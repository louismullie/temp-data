## Question

How does Shingrix differ from Zostavax?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Shingrix (RZV) differs from Zostavax (ZVL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental vaccine platforms and composition. Then, I should compare efficacy and real-world effectiveness across ages and over time. Next, I will examine immunogenicity mechanisms. After that, I need to review safety and reactogenicity. Then, I should verify dosing, administration, storage, and coadministration. Next, I must consider eligibility, contraindications, and use in immunocompromised patients. Finally, I will assess durability and revaccination strategies and close with practical counseling and ACIP preference guidance.

> Let me first confirm the core difference in platform and composition. Shingrix is a non-live, recombinant subunit vaccine containing VZV glycoprotein E with the AS01B adjuvant, whereas Zostavax is a live-attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster virus vaccine, a distinction that drives differences in safety, immunogenicity, and eligible populations [^113b28iL] [^115aea1c] [^114sr9oY] [^114P63y3].

> Now, I should compare efficacy head-to-head. Shingrix demonstrates approximately 90% or higher efficacy against herpes zoster across all age groups ≥ 50 years in pivotal trials with minimal decline over at least 3–4 years, and strong effectiveness in real-world cohorts, whereas Zostavax shows more modest efficacy that declines with age and time [^114P63y3] [^113qkNK8] [^114LSHkv] [^115UnS7T]. Wait, let me verify the network meta-analysis signal regarding ZVL versus placebo; I initially recalled that some analyses suggested ZVL was not statistically different from placebo, but further examination shows the recombinant subunit vaccine is statistically superior to both placebo and ZVL, and additional analyses also support ZVL being statistically superior to placebo, so I need to be cautious and acknowledge variability in indirect comparisons while emphasizing the consistent superiority of Shingrix [^114X1sFy] [^1173i4Ai] [^112gqSDM].

> I will now examine age effects and waning more closely. Hold on, I should verify the durability data across longer follow-up: RZV's protection remains high with limited waning through extended follow-up, whereas ZVL efficacy wanes substantially over time and becomes low to negligible by about 8–11 years post-vaccination, particularly in older adults [^113qkNK8] [^114P63y3] [^117AkJGV].

> Next, I should review immunogenicity profiles and mechanism. Shingrix elicits strong humoral responses and robust gE-specific CD4 T-cell responses with polyfunctionality and memory formation, which likely underpin its superior and age-independent efficacy; by contrast, Zostavax primarily boosts VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity but with less durable responses and weaker IL-2–dominant memory signatures compared with RZV, consistent with inferior long-term protection [^113NSAVX] [^114s6tsh] [^117P5SiN] [^117PL2zJ]. Let me double-check revaccination biology: responses to RZV are strong irrespective of prior ZVL receipt, supporting its use for those previously given the live vaccine [^114gbcav] [^113b28iL].

> I need to check safety and reactogenicity carefully. RZV is more reactogenic, with most recipients reporting local or systemic symptoms and about 17% having grade 3 reactions, but serious adverse events and deaths are comparable to controls; an observed association with Guillain-Barré syndrome has been noted post-licensure, though causality remains uncertain, and ACIP emphasizes counseling to support series completion; ZVL is generally less reactogenic but, as a live vaccine, carries risks in immunocompromised hosts [^111wGZYi] [^112rR76s] [^112XTzwA] [^115m6Wm4] [^1173i4Ai]. But wait, what if patients believe more pain means better immunity? Post hoc analyses show only a small statistical association that is not clinically useful, so reactogenicity should not be used as a surrogate for adequate response [^114JGnwW].

> Let me verify dosing, route, storage, and coadministration next. RZV is a 2-dose IM series given at 0 and 2–6 months for immunocompetent adults, with a permissible 1–2 month interval in immunocompromised settings; do not restart if delayed, but repeat the second dose if given too early; store refrigerated; ZVL is a single SC dose stored frozen; historical concerns about coadministration of ZVL with PPSV23 were based on antibody responses, while subsequent effectiveness data did not show diminished protection, and for RZV, coadministration with inactivated influenza vaccine and Tdap showed no meaningful interference [^113wsZLJ] [^111gVXDQ] [^116Svki7] [^116BB9NS] [^114KD3wH] [^111AVXUK] [^116y1b4W].

> I should confirm who is eligible and who is not. RZV is recommended for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years and, importantly, for immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years, without the need to screen for prior varicella history, and ACIP recommends RZV regardless of prior ZVL; conversely, ZVL is live and contraindicated in severely immunocompromised patients, with prior ACIP routine use focused on immunocompetent adults ≥ 60 years despite FDA approval down to age 50 [^114g2W58] [^116BPQK5] [^114QuFjr] [^115yz4d2] [^11368yFY] [^116USpuZ] [^112rR76s].

> Hold on, I should verify guidance for those anticipating immunosuppression. ACIP advises vaccinating before immunosuppression when feasible, using the shorter 1–2 month RZV interval if needed and timing doses during periods of lower immunosuppression and stable disease to optimize response [^116BB9NS] [^111b5CVJ].

> Let me consider durability and revaccination strategy. Shingrix maintains high efficacy with minimal waning in long-term follow-up extensions, whereas Zostavax's protection wanes markedly over time; for individuals previously vaccinated with ZVL, RZV elicits robust cellular and humoral responses and is recommended without requiring long intervals, though some studies evaluated ≥ 5-year gaps and expert guidance allows shorter intervals if clinically indicated with a minimal 2-month separation from ZVL [^113qkNK8] [^117AkJGV] [^113b28iL] [^112vXqNP].

> I need to ensure practical counseling is addressed. Patients should be counseled that RZV commonly causes short-lived local and systemic reactogenicity and that completing the 2-dose series is important for optimal protection; if the second dose is delayed beyond 6 months, do not restart the series, and if given too early, repeat appropriately [^112XTzwA] [^111gVXDQ].

> In summary, and I should double-check this conclusion against ACIP, Shingrix differs from Zostavax by being a non-live, adjuvanted recombinant vaccine with superior and more durable efficacy across ages, higher but acceptable reactogenicity, broader eligibility including immunocompromised adults, and a 2-dose IM schedule with refrigerator storage, leading ACIP to preferentially recommend RZV over ZVL for all eligible adults and to advise RZV even after prior ZVL [^11368yFY] [^1173i4Ai] [^114P63y3] [^116BPQK5].

Regarding **vaccine type** and **efficacy**, Shingrix is a recombinant subunit vaccine [^115aea1c] with > 90% efficacy [^114X1sFy] and durable protection [^117AkJGV], whereas Zostavax is a live attenuated vaccine [^114sr9oY] with ~51% efficacy [^114P63y3] that wanes over time [^113qkNK8]. Shingrix is administered as a **2-dose IM series** [^113wsZLJ] [^11368yFY] and is safe for immunocompromised adults [^117P5SiN], whereas Zostavax is a single SC dose [^114KD3wH] and is **contraindicated in immunocompromised patients** [^114sr9oY]. Shingrix is the **preferred vaccine** because of its superior efficacy [^114X1sFy] and broader eligibility [^114g2W58] [^116BPQK5].

| **Feature** | **Shingrix (RZV)** | **Zostavax (ZVL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Vaccine type | Recombinant subunit (non-live) [^116BPQK5] | Live attenuated virus [^114sr9oY] |

Shingrix is **preferred** over Zostavax because it provides higher and more durable protection [^113qkNK8], is suitable for immunocompromised patients [^116BPQK5], and maintains a favorable safety profile despite higher reactogenicity [^111wGZYi].

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114X1sFy]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Five randomized controlled trials including 90,605 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were included in the network meta-analysis of laboratory- or doctor-confirmed cases of herpes zoster. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo (vaccine efficacy 94%, 95% credible interval 79% to 98%) and the live attenuated vaccine (85%, 31% to 98%), whereas the live attenuated vaccine was not statistically different from placebo. These results were similar in the sensitivity analysis restricted to immunocompetent patients only. Four randomized controlled trials were included in the dose effects analysis, and only the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo, which was consistent in additional network meta-analysis restricted to four randomized controlled trials, including patients with no history of herpes zoster, and restricted to four randomized controlled trials with low risk of bias on random sequence generation. Additional analyses based on all study designs (five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study) and the efficacy comparison using informative priors (five randomized controlled trials) found that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to placebo and the live attenuated vaccine, and that the live attenuated vaccine was statistically superior to placebo.

### Notes from the field: Vaccine administration errors involving recombinant zoster vaccine - United States, 2017–2018 [^11368yFY]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two vaccines for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) are licensed for use in the United States and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Zoster vaccine live (ZVL; Zostavax, Merck), licensed in 2006, is a live attenuated virus vaccine administered as a single subcutaneous (SQ) dose. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZVL for adults aged ≥ 50 years, ACIP recommends ZVL for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline), licensed in October 2017, is also approved by the FDA for adults aged ≥ 50 years and is recommended by ACIP for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years. RZV is administered as a 2-dose intramuscular (IM) series, with the second dose given anytime from 2 to 6 months after the first. RZV is preferentially recommended by ACIP over ZVL. Furthermore, ACIP recommends that persons previously vaccinated with ZVL receive the full 2-dose RZV series.

RZV and ZVL differ with regard to vaccine type, dose, and schedule; ACIP recommendation; route of administration; and storage requirements. Prior experience indicates that administration errors are reported most frequently shortly after vaccine licensure and publication of recommendations, likely because of a lack of vaccine provider familiarity with the new vaccine.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^114P63y3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Immunization for herpes zoster (HZ) aims to reverse the decline in cell-mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus that occurs with advancing age or immunocompromise. There are two vaccines available: one live attenuated (Zoster vaccine, live attenuated [ZVL]) and, recently, a recombinant subunit vaccine (HZ/su).

- **Methods**: The literature relevant to the two HZ vaccines was reviewed.

- **Results**: ZVL has overall efficacies of 51% and 65% against HZ and postherpetic neuralgia, respectively, with a prominent decline in efficacy with advancing age of the vaccinee. This compares to approximately 90% efficacy against HZ for HZ/su that is minimally affected with advancing age. The efficacy of ZVL against HZ declines over 4 and 8 years, compared with minimal decline so far over 4 years with HZ/su, and immunogenicity that is maintained for 9 years. Local and systemic reactogenicity to HZ/su is much greater than to ZVL.

- **Conclusions**: HZ/su establishes an important principle: that a single recombinant viral protein with an effective adjuvant combination can stimulate immunogenicity superior to that of a live attenuated vaccine and that this can diminish immunosenescence. This provides hope for improvement of other vaccines for aging patients. However, key questions remain unanswered, including the durability of the efficacy of HZ/su, its efficacy as a booster for previous recipients of ZVL, and its efficacy in immunocompromised patients.

### Zoster vaccine: current status and future prospects [^117PL2zJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility

The live, attenuated Oka/Merck varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine, also known as the zoster vaccine, protects immunocompetent adults from herpes zoster and its complications. The success of the zoster vaccine in preventing the clinical manifestations of latent VZV reactivation contrasts with the failure to achieve similar results with vaccination against herpes simplex. This reflects major differences in the pathophysiology of latency and reactivation of these two alphaherpesviruses.

The Shingles Prevention Study and many other studies have demonstrated that VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, and not VZV antibody, plays a critical role in limiting reactivation and replication of latent VZV and, thus, in preventing herpes zoster and its complications. Consequently, the induction of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, rather than antibody presence, should be used as a proxy for the clinical efficacy of new formulations and uses of the zoster vaccine.

Prospects for improved zoster vaccines and their use in immunocompromised patients are discussed. Additionally, questions related to the use of the zoster vaccine are addressed.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^116HSpx5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

When vOka was first developed, it was feared that zoster might become more common after immunization than after infection with wild-type VZV. Although vOka was attenuated and did not cause a significant acute illness, little was known about its tendency to develop latency and subsequently to reactivate. Consequently, substantial research was conducted to compare the incidence of zoster in immunized individuals with those who had experienced wild-type varicella.

Early studies focused on children with leukemia who were immunized in the 1980s. It was found that the incidence of zoster in these vaccine recipients was significantly lower than in similar leukemic children who had contracted varicella from wild-type VZV. However, because the findings in leukemic children might not be generalizable to a healthy population, there was considerable interest in determining the incidence of zoster in healthy individuals who had received vOka.

Two large studies utilizing electronic databases were conducted by members of Kaiser Permanente and the CDC. In the first study, conducted between 2005 and 2009, 322 subjects were enrolled, with 118 having been vaccinated. The incidence of zoster was 79% lower in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children. Interestingly, half of the zoster cases detected in vaccine recipients were caused by wild-type VZV, suggesting either asymptomatic infection with wild-type VZV after vaccination or prior infection with wild-type VZV before vaccination.

### Association between immunogenicity and reactogenicity: A post hoc analysis of 2 phase 3 studies with the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine [^114JGnwW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

A key question is whether transient reactions to vaccines translate into better immune responses. Using clinical data from two large phase 3 studies of the recombinant zoster vaccine, we observed a small but statistically significant association between the intensity of a frequent side effect (pain) after vaccination and immune responses to vaccination. However, despite the statistical correlation, the impact on the immune response is so small, and the immune response in individuals without pain is already sufficient, that pain cannot be a surrogate marker for an appropriate immune response. Reactogenicity cannot be used to predict immunity after vaccination.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies: a phase 3, randomised, clinical trial and post-hoc efficacy analysis [^117P5SiN]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1–2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments. Participants were stratified according to their underlying diseases.

	- The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after the last vaccination in all participants. This included evaluation of the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We also assessed the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2, excluding participants with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Immunogenicity was assessed in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^117HbiwF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ) upon reactivation. Immunosenescence leads to a decrease in VZV-specific T-cell responses, which are thought to be the main mechanistic protection against VZV reactivation. Advanced age is therefore one of the major risk factors for developing HZ, with incidences increasing from 10/1000 person-years in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Vaccination represents a means to reduce HZ risk in older adults. In 2006, a live-attenuated HZ vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax; Merck Sharp & Dohme) was licensed and subsequently recommended in the United States for the prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 60 years. However, its efficacy decreases with age. In addition, efficacy against HZ is statistically significant only through year 5 and becomes negligible by year 11. Tseng et al. hypothesized that, owing to declining effectiveness over time, revaccination of previous ZVL recipients might be beneficial. However, ZVL-boosted cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses decline significantly in 3 years in reimmunized individuals, with only memory responses remaining marginally higher compared with de novo–immunized individuals.

Given on a 2-dose schedule, the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix; GSK), consisting of the VZV glycoprotein E (gE) antigen and the AS01 B adjuvant system, demonstrated > 90% efficacy against HZ across all age strata, sustained over 4 years of follow-up. Since 2017, RZV has received licensure for the prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 50 years in several countries. RZV induces robust responses and offers substantial protection.

### Efficacy of live zoster vaccine in preventing zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^114jdnw6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Declining cell-mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) in elderly individuals results in virus reactivation, manifesting as zoster (shingles) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). To prevent virus reactivation, a new VZV vaccine (Zostavax; Merck) that boosts cell-mediated immunity to VZV was developed. The 3-year Shingles Prevention Study showed that Zostavax significantly reduced the burden of disease due to zoster and PHN. Despite its cost-effectiveness for adults aged 65–75 years, as determined in the United States, Canada, and the UK, less than 2% of immunocompetent adults over age 60 years in the United States were immunized in 2007. This was due to a combination of a lack of patient awareness of the vaccine, physicians' uncertainty about the duration of protection, and different cost-sharing plans for immunization. Nevertheless, the zoster vaccine is safe, effective, and highly recommended for the immunization of immunocompetent individuals over age 60 years with no history of recent zoster.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^115RNRM7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Michiaki Takahashi developed the live attenuated varicella vaccine in 1974. This was the first, and is still the only, herpesvirus vaccine. Early studies showed promise, but the vaccine was rigorously tested on immunosuppressed patients because of their high risk of fatal varicella; vaccination proved to be lifesaving. Subsequently, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in healthy children. Eventually, the varicella vaccine became a component of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, with two doses administered to approximately 90% of children in the United States. The incidence of varicella has dropped dramatically in the United States since the vaccine's licensure in 1995. The varicella vaccine is also associated with a decreased incidence of zoster and is protective for susceptible adults. Today, immunocompromised individuals are protected against varicella due to vaccine-induced herd immunity. Latent infection with the varicella zoster virus occurs after vaccination; however, the vaccine strain is impaired in its ability to reactivate.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^113b28iL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In this phase III, open-label, multicenter study conducted in the United States between March 2016 and August 2017, adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with ZVL ≥ 5 years before RZV vaccination in this study (HZ-PreVac) were group-matched with ZVL-naive individuals (HZ-NonVac), as described elsewhere. Study participants were to receive 2 RZV doses intramuscularly, 2 months apart.

Adults aged ≥ 65 years were eligible for participation if they did not have an immunocompromising condition or a previous history of HZ. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria have been presented elsewhere. All participants provided written informed consent before the start of the study. The protocol was reviewed and approved by relevant institutional review boards. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of good clinical practice and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02581410).

RZV (Shingrix) contains 50 μg of VZV gE antigen and the AS01 B Adjuvant System (50 μg of 3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), 50 μg of QS-21, and liposome) per 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine.

### Live, attenuated varicella zoster vaccination of an immunocompromised patient [^112YCHes]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster outbreaks in adults over the age of 60 years has recently been approved. A 76-year-old white female with a history of left axillary breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy was given a Zostavax injection by her primary care physician. Eight days later, the patient developed a rash. Given the recent administration of live, attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV), a diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous herpes zoster was made. The patient was treated successfully with a course of famciclovir for 10 days and cephalexin for 7 days for a secondary bacterial infection. A review of the medical literature disclosed no reports of Zostavax given to adult cancer patients immunocompromised by systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, we believe this report is the first to describe the consequences of Zostavax administration to such a host. Clinicians should take care to review contraindications and precautions prior to administering the Zostavax vaccine.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^112rR76s]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Both currently licensed vaccines have disadvantages. ZOSTAVAX efficacy for herpes zoster (HZ) incidence is low compared with SHINGRIX, and its efficacy wanes over several years. Additionally, as a live-attenuated vaccine, it cannot be used in severely immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, SHINGRIX requires two doses, separated by 2–6 months, and the potent AS01B adjuvant makes SHINGRIX more reactogenic. The association of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with SHINGRIX is a concern, although it is unclear if there is a causal relationship. Due to significant supply shortages, most countries where SHINGRIX is licensed have yet to administer it.

The development of further zoster vaccines, either based on ZVL and RZV or on different vaccine platforms, is being pursued. Two clinical trials to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of different formulations of adjuvanted VZV gE subunit vaccines are currently registered in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03820414 and NCT04210752); however, results are not yet available. A placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a live-attenuated VZV vaccine in healthy adults aged 40 and older is currently registered in China (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04334577), but enrollment has not yet started.

The recent findings of safety and impressive efficacy of two messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-lipid vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA may lead to new mRNA vaccines for other diseases, including HZ.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^117Usm2m]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, specifically with respect to immunization in immunocompromised adults, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend offering the recombinant zoster vaccine to patients taking low-dose immunosuppressive therapy (such as less than 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, or using inhaled or topical corticosteroids). This recommendation also extends to patients anticipating immunosuppression or those who have recovered from an immunocompromising illness.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^114KD3wH]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend paying attention not to confuse the live zoster vaccine, which should be stored in the freezer and administered subcutaneously (SC), with the recombinant zoster vaccine, which should be stored in the refrigerator and administered intramuscularly (IM).

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116RHuFr]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Across all analyses, only three comparators were included: live attenuated vaccine, adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, and placebo/no vaccine. The transitivity plots suggested that the effect modifiers were balanced across the treatments when these were reported; however, several of the analyses did not have information on all comparisons in the network. Comparison-adjusted funnel plots were generated for the cases of suspected herpes zoster and injection site adverse events outcomes. Only 11 unique trials existed for both of these outcomes, resulting in low power to examine publication bias and small study effects. Although the funnel plot for injection site adverse events was considered to be symmetrical, the funnel plot for suspected herpes zoster was asymmetrical. Further examination revealed three trials with large standard errors and negative centered effect sizes, so a sensitivity analysis was done excluding these three trials. The results in Table 4 and Table 5 and in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are based on randomised controlled trials that included immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients, or both.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^116BB9NS]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend administering the second dose of the recombinant zoster vaccine typically 2–6 months after the first dose. Consider administering the second dose 1–2 months after the first dose for individuals who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule. If the second recombinant zoster vaccine dose is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first, repeat a valid second dose at least 4 weeks after the previous dose. Do not restart the vaccine series if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

### Boosting immunity in recipients of live-attenuated zoster vaccine [^117CwPuk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The article by Levin et al. in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases provides an important preliminary insight into the acquired immune responses to a second dose of the zoster vaccine in persons aged ≥ 70 years. No serious vaccine-related adverse events were observed, although the authors did not mention this in their discussion. The response to a first dose of the zoster vaccine was also evaluated in three age groups: 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and ≥ 70 years. VZV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels peaked at six weeks for all test groups. The IgG responses in all four groups were comparable, even for those receiving their first dose of the vaccine at ≥ 70 years of age.

Cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunospot assays to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion by effector and memory T cells. In contrast to the IgG response, significant differences were observed in the CMI responses of the four different study groups. As expected, the CMI responses in the group of individuals aged ≥ 70 years receiving their first dose were the least robust; however, persons aged ≥ 70 years receiving a booster dose 10 years after the first dose responded comparably to persons in the group aged 60–69 years. The booster in these individuals thus demonstrated a residual effect of the first dose. The strongest CMI responses were obtained from persons 50–59 years old receiving their first dose of the vaccine. The authors speculate that booster doses might be expected to be more effective in adults receiving their first dose between the ages of 50 and…

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^112cpY9Q]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Michiaki Takahashi developed the live attenuated varicella vaccine in 1974. This was the first, and is still the only, herpesvirus vaccine. Early studies showed promise, but the vaccine was rigorously tested on immunosuppressed patients because of their high risk of fatal varicella; vaccination proved to be lifesaving. Subsequently, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in healthy children. Eventually, the varicella vaccine became a component of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, with two doses administered in the United States to approximately 90% of children. The incidence of varicella has dropped dramatically in the United States since vaccine licensure in 1995.

Varicella vaccine is also associated with a decreased incidence of zoster and is protective for susceptible adults. Today, immunocompromised individuals are protected against varicella due to vaccine-induced herd immunity. Latent infection with the varicella zoster virus occurs after vaccination; however, the vaccine strain is impaired in its ability to reactivate.

### Effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster in a real-world setting [^115UnS7T]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

A 2-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 97% effective against herpes zoster (HZ) in a pivotal clinical trial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of RZV against HZ.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: Four health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink.
- **Participants**: Persons aged 50 years or older.
- **Measurements**: The outcome was incident HZ defined by a diagnosis with an antiviral prescription. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard of HZ in vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons, with adjustment for covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 minus the adjusted hazard ratio and was estimated by time since the last RZV dose and by corticosteroid use.

The study included nearly 2.0 million persons, contributing 7.6 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment, VE of one dose was 64% and VE of two doses was 76%. After one dose only, VE was 70% during the first year, 45% during the second year, 48% during the third year, and 52% after the third year. After two doses, VE was 79% during the first year, 75% during the second year, and 73% during the third and fourth years. Vaccine effectiveness was 65% in persons who received corticosteroids before vaccination and 77% in those who did not.

- **Limitation**: Herpes zoster could not be identified as accurately in these observational data as in previous clinical trials.

Conclusion: Two doses of RZV were highly effective, although less effective than in previous clinical trials. Two-dose effectiveness waned very little over time.

Herpes zoster may be severe in HIV-infected children. We determined the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine in 46 HIV-infected children who had experienced varicella. There were no serious adverse events. Two years after vaccination, 82% of subjects remained VZV-antibody positive, and 60% had VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity. No child developed herpes zoster.

This article reviews the history and development of the live-attenuated varicella vaccine, from its early days in Japan to its widespread use throughout the world. The vaccine has proven extremely safe after immunization of as many as 10 million healthy children and adults in the United States alone. It is also highly immunogenic and offers close to 100% protection from severe chickenpox and 90% protection from illness. It is expected to have a major impact on the epidemiology of varicella and zoster in countries with high vaccine uptake.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112gqSDM]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

The findings reported here are consistent with a review of the evidence conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommended the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older. Although a literature review of the evidence was carried out, the CDC did not conduct a systematic review or network meta-analysis. The CDC also performed a cost analysis and found that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine prevented more disease at lower overall costs than the live attenuated vaccine. However, an additional cost-effectiveness analysis might provide further clarity.

Importantly, the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine requires two doses to be administered intramuscularly at 0 and 2–6 months, whereas the live attenuated vaccine requires a single subcutaneous dose. As such, a comparison of cost, including the vaccine route of administration, as well as storage and handling, is required. A retrospective cohort study published after the literature search found the live attenuated vaccine to be effective, but immunity waned after five years. The study also found that as people aged, the vaccine was less effective.

The results of this systematic review indicate that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is likely more effective than the live attenuated vaccine for preventing herpes zoster. Additionally, the dose effects analysis suggested that standard doses are appropriate. As such, clinicians and policymakers can use these results to inform their recommendations about these vaccines.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115m6Wm4]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Withdrawal due to adverse events — Six randomized controlled trials encompassing 35,678 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were included in the network meta-analysis regarding withdrawals due to adverse events, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant. This lack of significance was consistent with the dose effect analysis and in all additional analyses.

- **Potential immune-mediated diseases**: Only two randomized controlled trials, including 29,311 immunocompetent patients, were part of the meta-analysis on potential immune-mediated diseases. There was no statistical difference between the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and placebo. No additional analyses were possible for this outcome.

- **Death**: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 102,718 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were analyzed regarding observed deaths during the study period, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant. This consistency was maintained in the dose effect analysis and all additional analyses.

- **Rank heat plot**: The rank heat plot suggests that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is the most effective against herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and post-herpetic neuralgia, showing fewer serious adverse events and deaths compared to the live attenuated vaccine or placebo. The live attenuated vaccine is considered safer regarding injection site and systemic adverse events, showing fewer withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^115VLiuN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

To determine whether the varicella vaccine was effective in healthy children, numerous clinical trials of the varicella vaccine were carried out in the United States in the 1980s. Hundreds of healthy children were enrolled. These studies showed that vOka is safe, well tolerated, and protective against household exposures. Side effects were minor and occurred in less than 5% of vaccinees. Adverse reactions included pain, redness, and rash at the injection site, as well as systemic symptoms of mild generalized rash and transient fever. Adolescents tended to have more adverse events than healthy younger children. Most immunized children developed ELISA antibodies to VZV. These antibodies persisted for years after vaccination, although whether they are protective is unknown. The vaccine's safety and immunogenicity were similar in studies of children in both Asia and Europe, where somewhat different formulations of vOka were tested.

Overall, roughly 85% of the children who received one dose of vOka were protected from wild-type VZV infection after they were exposed to individuals with VZV infections. The few vaccinees who developed varicella after exposure to VZV usually had mild infections. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies using different doses of the vaccine carried out in the United States and Finland found that vOka protected 90%–100% of vaccinees over a period of several years. The actual degree of protection depended on both the quantity of attenuated virus in the vaccine.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^111L9SDZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, there was a major concern regarding the use of the newly developed vOka, as it was believed to potentially cause latent infection. There was fear that the vaccine virus might reactivate and cause zoster, possibly with high frequency. However, early studies involving children with leukemia did not find the anticipated increase in zoster. Instead, they showed a reduced frequency of zoster. Long-term observations, mentioned in more detail below, suggest that the latency of the vaccine virus may actually be advantageous since periodic, asymptomatic reactivation could occur and subsequently boost immunity to varicella.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^114sz3uN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy of the live-attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine (ZVL) wanes substantially over time. We evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in previous ZVL recipients.

- **Methods**: Adults aged ≥ 65 years who were previously vaccinated with ZVL ≥ 5 years earlier (n = 215) were group-matched with ZVL-naive individuals (n = 215) and vaccinated with RZV. Glycoprotein E (gE)-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and the correlation between them, polyfunctional gE-specific CD4 T-cell responses, safety, and confirmed HZ cases were assessed.

- **Results**: Through 12 months after dose 2, anti-gE antibody concentrations, gE-specific CD4 T-cell frequencies, and activation marker profiles were similar between groups. Safety outcomes were also similar, and no HZ episodes were confirmed.

- **Conclusions**: RZV induced strong humoral and polyfunctional cell-mediated immune responses that persisted above prevaccination levels through 1 year after dose 2 in adults aged ≥ 65 years irrespective of previous ZVL vaccination. The RZV safety profile was not affected.

### Final analysis of the ZOE-LTFU trial to 11 years post-vaccination: Efficacy of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster and related complications [^117AkJGV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). Primary infection with VZV causes varicella (chickenpox), usually in children. During primary infection, the virus enters sensory nerves and becomes latent; reactivation of the latent virus causes HZ, usually in older adults. The incidence of HZ increases with age.

HZ often begins with a prodromal phase with pain, itching, and numbness, followed by a blistering rash that can leave residual scarring. HZ can result in complications including post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), disseminated infections, secondary bacterial infection, ophthalmic and neurological complications, and vasculopathy. PHN, defined as pain persisting for more than 90 days after the commencement of the HZ rash, is the most frequent complication of HZ and its incidence rises with older age. It is difficult to manage and can last for months to years, with a substantial impact on quality of life.

A large proportion of the population is at risk for HZ and HZ-related complications, especially as populations are aging in most parts of the world. Vaccines against HZ are approved from 50 years of age; thus, it is important to demonstrate that vaccinated individuals continue to be protected as they grow older, as the risk of HZ and associated complications rises with age. Long-term follow-up of the first licensed HZ vaccine (live attenuated zoster vaccine [zoster vaccine live, ZVL, Zostavax, MSD]) indicated that vaccine efficacy (VE) waned substantially over time and was 51.3%, 39.6%, and 21.1% for follow-up periods of 0–4.9 years.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^112vXqNP]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Timing of RZV for persons previously vaccinated with ZVL. Age and time since receipt of ZVL may be considered to determine when to vaccinate with RZV. Studies examined the safety and immunogenicity of RZV vaccination administered ≥ 5 years after ZVL; shorter intervals have not been studied. However, there are no data or theoretical concerns to indicate that RZV would be less safe or less effective when administered at an interval of < 5 years. Clinical trials indicated lower efficacy of ZVL in adults aged ≥ 70 years; therefore, a shorter interval may be considered based on the recipient's age when ZVL was administered. Based on expert opinion, RZV should not be given < 2 months after receipt of ZVL.

Coadministration with other vaccines. CDC's general best practice guidelines for immunization advise that recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vaccines. Concomitant administration of RZV with Fluarix Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine, QIV) has been studied, and there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to either vaccine or safety concerns. Evaluation of coadministration of RZV with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax23) and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap, Boostrix) is ongoing. The safety and efficacy of administration of two adjuvanted vaccines (e.g. RZV and adjuvanted influenza vaccine [Fluad]), either concomitantly or at other intervals, have not been evaluated.

### Assessment of attenuation of varicella-zoster virus vaccines based on genomic comparison [^114Sjjba]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccines are used to prevent chickenpox and shingles. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur during the attenuation of parental strains are critical indicators of vaccine safety. To assess the attenuation of commercial VZV vaccines, genetic variants were comprehensively examined through high-throughput sequencing of viral DNA isolated from four VZV vaccines: Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella. Whole-genome comparison of the four vaccines with the wild-type strain (Dumas) revealed that the sequences are highly conserved on a genome-wide scale. Among the 196 common variants across the four vaccines, 195 were already present in the genome of the parental strain (pOka), indicating that the variants occurred during the generation of the parental strain from the Dumas strain.

Compared to the pOka genome, the vaccines exhibited distinct variant frequencies on a genome-wide scale and within attenuation-related open reading frames. In particular, attenuation-associated 42 SNPs showed that Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella are in ascending order regarding similarity with pOka-like genotypes, which, in turn, might provide genomic evidence for the levels of attenuation. Finally, the phylogenetic network analysis demonstrated that genetic distances from the parental strain correlated with the attenuation levels of the vaccines.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^1153Dc42]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Protection against herpes zoster (HZ) induced by the live attenuated zoster vaccine Zostavax (ZVL) wanes within 3–7 years. Revaccination may renew protection. We assessed whether (re)vaccination with the adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine candidate (HZ/su) induced comparable immune responses in previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive individuals (HZ-NonVac).

- **Methods**: In an open-label, multicenter study, adults aged ≥ 65 years, vaccinated with ZVL ≥ 5 years previously (HZ-PreVac), were matched to ZVL-naive adults (HZ-NonVac). Participants received 2 doses of HZ/su 2 months apart. The primary objective of noninferiority of the humoral immune response 1 month post-dose 2 was considered demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted anti-glycoprotein E geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio of HZ-NonVac over HZ-PreVac was < 1.5. HZ/su cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were also assessed.

- **Results**: In 430 participants, humoral immune response to HZ/su was noninferior in HZ-PreVac compared with HZ-NonVac (adjusted GMC ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, .92–1.17]). Cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety appeared to be comparable between groups. HZ/su was well-tolerated, with no safety concerns raised within 1 month post-dose 2.

- **Conclusions**: HZ/su induces a strong immune response irrespective of prior vaccination with ZVL and may be an attractive option to revaccinate prior ZVL recipients.

### Varicella vaccines [^116vfiJx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Live attenuated vaccines are available for varicella and herpes zoster. The varicella vaccine is commonly administered to immunocompetent individuals, despite substantial evidence indicating its safety and effectiveness in immunocompromised groups.

- **Recent findings**: Varicella vaccine has been in use for decades, and its safety and efficacy in healthy children are well-documented in the literature. The vaccine is contraindicated for the immunodeficient population. However, recent studies have explored the immune response of the varicella vaccine in children with hematological malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 T-cell count of at least 200 cells/μl, atopic dermatitis, and juvenile rheumatic diseases, finding it immunogenic in most cases. Additionally, the herpes zoster vaccine, a newer member of the varicella vaccine family, has been well-tolerated and effective in healthy adults. Unfortunately, vaccination rates remain low.

- **Summary**: Studies indicate that the varicella vaccine is well-tolerated and immunogenic in moderately immunocompromised children, suggesting its potential in reducing the burden of viral infections. Similar research should be pursued for the herpes zoster vaccine in immunodeficient adults, as it has shown efficacy in lowering herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia incidence.

### Live attenuated zoster vaccine boosts varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific humoral responses systemically and at the cervicovaginal mucosa of Kenyan VZV-seropositive women [^114DAjgR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a promising vector for recombinant vaccines. Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines are believed to require mucosal immunogenicity, we characterized mucosal VZV-specific humoral immunity following VZVOka vaccination.

- **Methods**: Adult Kenyan VZV-seropositive women (n = 44) received a single dose of the live zoster VZVOka vaccine. The anamnestic responses to the virus were followed longitudinally in both plasma and mucosal secretions using an in-house glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Safety and reactogenicity were monitored. VZV seroprevalence and baseline responses to the virus were also characterized in our cohorts (n = 288).

- **Results**: Besides boosting anti-VZV antibody responses systemically, vaccination also boosted anti-VZV immunity in the cervicovaginal mucosa with a 2.9-fold rise in immunoglobulin G (P < .0001) and a 1.6-fold rise in immunoglobulin A (IgA) (P = 0.004) from the time before immunization to 4 weeks postvaccination. Baseline analysis demonstrated high avidity antibodies at the gastrointestinal and genital mucosa of VZV-seropositive women. Measurement of VZV-specific IgA in saliva is a sensitive tool for detecting prior VZV infection.

- **Conclusions**: The VZVOka vaccine was safe and immunogenic in VZV-seropositive adult Kenyan women. We provided compelling evidence of VZV's ability to induce genital mucosa immunity.

### Comparative immune responses to licensed herpes zoster vaccines [^113NSAVX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Live attenuated (ZV) and recombinant adjuvanted (HZ/su) zoster vaccines differ with respect to efficacy, effect of age, and persistence of protection. We compared cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses to ZV and HZ/su.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial stratified by age (50–59 and 70–85 years) and by HZ vaccination status (received ZV ≥ 5 years before entry or not). Varicella zoster virus (VZV)- and glycoprotein E (gE)-specific CMI were analyzed by interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) FluoroSpot and flow cytometry at study days 0, 30, 90, and 365.

- **Results**: Responses to ZV peaked on day 30 and to HZ/su (administered in 2 doses separated by 60 days) peaked on day 90. Age and vaccination status did not affect peak responses, but higher baseline CMI correlated with higher peak responses. HZ/su generated significantly higher VZV-specific IL-2+ and gE-specific IL-2+, IFN-γ+, and IL-2+/IFN-γ+ peak and 1-year baseline-adjusted responses compared with ZV. VZV-specific IFN-γ+ and IL-2+/IFN-γ+ did not differ between vaccines. HZ/su generated higher memory and effector-memory CD4+ peak responses and ZV generated higher effector CD4+ responses.

- **Conclusions**: The higher IL-2 and other memory responses generated by HZ/su compared with ZV may contribute to its superior efficacy.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^116BPQK5]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a two-dose (0.5 mL each) subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E combined with adjuvant (AS01 B), licensed in the United States for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2017. On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for herpes zoster due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy.

On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended two doses of RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy. RZV is the first herpes zoster vaccine approved for use in immunocompromised individuals. With moderate to high vaccine efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, RZV has the potential to prevent a significant incidence of herpes zoster and related complications. This report updates previous ACIP recommendations for the prevention of herpes zoster.

### Recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix): Real-world effectiveness in the first 2 years post-licensure [^114LSHkv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine) was licensed to prevent herpes zoster, dispensed as two doses given 2–6 months apart among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Clinical trials yielded efficacy of > 90% for confirmed herpes zoster, but post-market performance has not been evaluated. Efficacy of a single dose, a delayed second dose, and efficacy among individuals with autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions have not been studied. We aimed to assess post-market vaccine effectiveness of Shingrix.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study among Medicare Part D community-dwelling beneficiaries aged > 65 years. Herpes zoster was identified using a medical office visit diagnosis with treatment, and postherpetic neuralgia was identified using a validated algorithm. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to improve cohort balance and marginal structural models to estimate hazard ratios.

- **Results**: We found a vaccine effectiveness of 70.1% (95% confidence interval, 68.6–71.5) and 56.9% (95% CI, 55.0–58.8) for two and one doses, respectively. The two-dose vaccine effectiveness was not significantly lower for beneficiaries aged > 80 years, for second doses received at ≥ 180 days, or for individuals with autoimmune conditions. The vaccine was also effective among individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness against postherpetic neuralgia was 76.0% (95% CI, 68.4–81.8).

- **Conclusions**: This large real-world observational study of the effectiveness of Shingrix demonstrates the benefit of completing the two-dose regimen. Second doses administered beyond the initial recommended timeline were still effective.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^1134GR4h]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

A number of live vaccines for the protection of healthy children from viral diseases were successfully introduced before the varicella vaccine. These include poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, and mumps vaccines. For many years, varicella was considered too mild to warrant prevention. Serious complications of varicella, such as pneumonia and bacterial sepsis, both of which are now well recognized and justly feared, must have occurred in some children but may have been ignored.

In the 1960s, however, the standard of care for young children with leukemia, which had previously been virtually uniformly fatal, became treatment with anticancer drugs that ameliorated and often cured leukemia, albeit with immunosuppressive effects. In the absence of a vaccine, epidemics of varicella recurred every winter and spring. These epidemics affected susceptible children regardless of whether they were immunosuppressed, but varicella is a dangerous illness in immunosuppressed patients being treated for leukemia. The unanticipated consequence of the advancement of medical therapy was that children could be cured of leukemia only to die of varicella. Varicella thus no longer seemed too inconsequential to justify the development of a vaccine.

Even in immunocompetent populations, varicella caused approximately 100 deaths per year in the United States. While this may not seem like a large number of individuals, it was intolerable both to the families involved and to society.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine confers long-term protection against herpes zoster: Interim results of an extension study of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 [^113qkNK8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which establishes lifelong latency in the dorsal root ganglia after the initial infection. HZ occurs most frequently after the age of 50 years, and the risk increases further with age due to immunosenescence. HZ can have painful and debilitating complications, such as post-herpetic neuralgia, yet it is preventable by vaccination. As vaccine-induced immunity can wane over time, it is critical to assess if vaccines induce long-lasting protective immunity. For instance, a single dose of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL, Zostavax, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp) was 68% effective against HZ in individuals aged ≥ 50 years during the first year post-vaccination, but its effectiveness waned to 32% by the eighth year post-vaccination. Its efficacy against HZ in those aged ≥ 60 years also dropped from 62% in the first year post-vaccination to nonstatistically significant levels beyond the eighth year post-vaccination.

The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix, GSK), consisting of recombinant varicella-zoster glycoprotein E (gE) and the AS01 B adjuvant system, administered as a 2-dose schedule, demonstrated ≥ 90% efficacy against HZ in all age groups ≥ 50 years, which was maintained over a 3.2- and 3.7-year follow-up period in two pivotal phase 3 trials (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, respectively). While a correlate of protection has not been established at the time of writing, additional data have shown that immune responses to RZV plateau at a substantial level above baseline from the fourth year.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^114s6tsh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The mean frequencies of CD4 T cells expressing 2, 3, and 4 markers were very similar between study groups at all time points. In both study groups, the mean frequency, as well as the proportion of polyfunctional CD4 T cells, increased after each RZV dose. The mean frequencies and, to a lesser extent, the proportions of polyfunctional CD4 T cells decreased through 12 months after dose 2. Although the last assessment in our study was made 12 months after dose 2, previous findings in adults aged ≥ 50 years confirm this pattern and suggest that the proportion of polyfunctional CD4 T cells will plateau or even slightly increase through the second and third years after vaccination.

A single dose of ZVL was shown to boost VZV-specific memory T cells, which express the same 4 activation markers assessed in our study. The high frequency of IL-2–secreting CD4 T cells (in the absence of IFN-γ production) and high proportion of polyfunctional CD4 T cells observed after the first RZV dose may suggest a mixed population of gE-specific T cells resulting from both mobilization of the naive T-cell repertoire and recall of memory cells, respectively. However, further investigations are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to evaluate the individual contributions of naive and memory T cells to the overall observed CD4 T-cell response to RZV, as previously suggested for ZVL.

Expression of IFN-γ, alone or in combination with IL-2, differentiates effector and memory T-cell responses. In both study groups, the expression of IFN-γ, usually in combination with IL-2, is indicative of the presence of an…

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^115ydZbW]. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax [Merck & Co, Inc.]) was licensed in 2006 and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2008 for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its complications among adults aged ≥ 60 years. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Zostavax in 2011 for adults aged 50 through 59 years based on a large study of safety and efficacy in this age group.

ACIP initially considered the use of the herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged 50 through 59 years in June 2011 but declined to recommend the vaccine for this age group, citing shortages of Zostavax and limited data on the long-term protection afforded by the herpes zoster vaccine. In October 2013, ACIP reviewed the epidemiology of herpes zoster and its complications, the herpes zoster vaccine supply, short-term vaccine efficacy in adults aged 50 through 59 years, and short- and long-term vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in adults aged ≥ 60 years. They also conducted an updated cost-effectiveness analysis and considered the deliberations of the ACIP herpes zoster work group, all of which are summarized in this report. No vote was taken, and ACIP maintained its recommendation that the herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

### Postlicensure safety surveillance of recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) - United States, October 2017-June 2018 [^111wGZYi]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix), an adjuvanted glycoprotein vaccine, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for adults aged ≥ 50 years in October 2017. The previously licensed live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax) is recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. RZV is administered intramuscularly as a 2-dose series, with an interval of 2–6 months between doses. In prelicensure clinical trials, 85% of 6,773 vaccinated study participants reported local or systemic reactions after receiving RZV, with approximately 17% experiencing a grade 3 reaction (erythema or induration > 3.5 inches or systemic symptoms that interfere with normal activity). However, rates of serious adverse events (i.e. hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death) were similar in the RZV and placebo groups.

After licensure, CDC and FDA began safety monitoring of RZV in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). During the first 8 months of use, when approximately 3.2 million RZV doses were distributed (GlaxoSmithKline, personal communication, 2018), VAERS received a total of 4,381 reports of adverse events, 130 (3.0%) of which were classified as serious. Commonly reported signs and symptoms included pyrexia (fever) (1,034; 23.6%), injection site pain (985; 22.5%), and injection site erythema (880; 20.1%). No unexpected patterns were detected in reports of adverse events or serious adverse reactions.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1173i4Ai]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the herpes zoster live attenuated vaccine with the herpes zoster adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine or placebo for adults aged 50 and older, a systematic review with Bayesian meta-analysis and network meta-analysis was designed.

Data sources included Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, ranging from inception to January 2017, as well as grey literature and reference lists of included studies.

- **Eligibility criteria for study selection**: Experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies compared the live attenuated vaccine with the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, placebo, or no vaccine in adults aged 50 and older. Relevant outcomes assessed were the incidence of herpes zoster (the primary outcome), herpes zoster ophthalmicus, post-herpetic neuralgia, quality of life, adverse events, and death.

- **Results**: A total of 27 studies, including 22 randomized controlled trials encompassing 2,044,504 patients, alongside 18 companion reports, were included after screening 2,037 titles and abstracts, followed by 175 full-text articles. Network meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found no statistically significant differences between the live attenuated vaccine and placebo for the incidence of laboratory-confirmed herpes zoster. However, the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to both the live attenuated vaccine, with a vaccine efficacy of 85% (95% credible interval: 31% to 98%), and placebo, with an efficacy of 94% (79% to 98%). Network meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials showed the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine to be associated with statistically significant differences.

The objective of this research was to compare the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the herpes zoster live attenuated vaccine with the herpes zoster adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine or placebo for adults aged 50 and older.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^111AVXUK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

**Concomitant administration of zoster vaccines with other vaccines**: A major impediment to the administration of the portfolio of vaccines recommended for older adults is their low frequency of encounters with healthcare providers. Thus, it is important to administer more than one vaccine during a single visit. The FDA and ACIP have routinely endorsed the safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines at separate injection sites [232]. A clinical trial [233] demonstrated that concomitant administration of ZVL (Zostavax) and Pneumovax23 resulted in lower VZV antibody titers than observed when ZVL was administered 4 weeks after Pneumovax23; cellular immunity to VZV was not evaluated. Despite evidence that VZV-specific CMI, and not the antibody to VZV, is necessary to protect against HZ, the Zostavax prescribing information (package insert) was revised in 2009, advising against concomitant administration of the two vaccines. This likely resulted in numerous missed opportunities for vaccination [234]. Two cohort studies [235, 236] comparing ZVL VE for the incidence of HZ in eligible adults receiving concomitant versus sequential vaccination with Pneumovax23 and Zostavax provided direct evidence that concomitant administration did not reduce ZVL effectiveness. Nevertheless, the Zostavax prescribing information still advises providers to consider administering the two vaccines ≥ 4 weeks apart [237]. Safety and immunogenicity were comparable in adults ≥ 50 years of age vaccinated with ZVL (Zostavax).

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, specifically in relation to immunization for immunocompromised adults, the CDC 2022 guidelines recommend offering vaccination before individuals become immunosuppressed, if possible. It is advised to time the vaccination when the immune response is likely to be most robust, which is during periods of lower immunosuppression and stable disease.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111KgoKG]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The results suggest that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is superior to the live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster infection, as measured by laboratory- or doctor-confirmed cases and suspected cases. Owing to a lack of data, the superiority of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine over the live attenuated vaccine in reducing the number of cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and post-herpetic neuralgia is inconclusive. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was, however, associated with more adverse events at injection sites than the live attenuated vaccine. On the basis of the limited indirect evidence available, no statistically significant differences were shown between the vaccines for serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, and death. A randomized controlled trial comparing the immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine with the live attenuated vaccine will provide direct evidence on the relative safety of the two vaccines. As such, the results of this systematic review will need to be updated with evidence from this trial, as well as any additional new trials completed after the literature search. Differences between the dosages of the vaccine were not observed, suggesting the standard doses are appropriate for clinical use.

- **Strengths and limitations of this study**: This systematic review has several strengths. As no trials currently compare the safety and effectiveness of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and live attenuated vaccine.

### Cost-effectiveness of vaccination of immunocompetent older adults against herpes zoster in the Netherlands: A comparison between the adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated vaccines [^116KYwqX]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A new adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su or Shingrix®) might potentially overcome the shortcomings of ZVL. In Europe, HZ/su has been registered for all adults aged ≥ 50 years in 2018 and is a recombinant vaccine containing the VZV glycoprotein E adjuvanted with the AS01 B system. The vaccine has been developed to be administered in a two-dose schedule given 2–6 months apart. Two large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the protective efficacy of two doses of HZ/su against HZ incidence was 97% (95% CI 94–99%) among immunocompetent individuals aged ≥ 50 and 91% (95% CI 87–95%) among those aged ≥ 70. The duration of protection is currently unknown, but the trial confirmed a relatively stable efficacy over 4 years of follow-up.

Due to the registration of HZ/su, governments have the option to reassess their vaccination policy for HZ in the near future, but cost-effectiveness analyses for HZ/su are yet scarce. Previous cost-effectiveness studies for the US, Hong Kong, and Germany exist; however, results from other countries are not directly transferable to the Dutch context due to potential differences in epidemiological conditions, existing vaccination policies against HZ and varicella, healthcare resource use, and relative prices. Moreover, no comparison of HZ/su with ZVL booster strategies has been performed, and a lack of studies incorporating real-world effectiveness data for ZVL is noticed. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of HZ vaccination for the Dutch setting. First, we compared the impact of HZ/su and ZVL in immunocompetent older adults using efficacy data.

### Cost-effectiveness of vaccination of immunocompetent older adults against herpes zoster in the Netherlands: A comparison between the adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated vaccines [^113hxiRr]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccine efficacy of HZ/su and ZVL against HZ over time was modeled using data from published clinical trials (see also Additional file 1: Figure S7). For both vaccines, a function of vaccine efficacy over the years was fitted to the annual efficacy data using the standard error as a weighting factor. We fitted multiple types of functions and used the functions that provided the best fit.

For ≥ 70-year-olds, a linear function for two doses of HZ/su was fitted to the 4 years of trial data, resulting in a waning of 4.1% per year. We assumed that this waning rate would continue after 4 years and varied this assumption extensively in the sensitivity analysis. For 50- to 69-year-olds, a recent study estimated the waning rate at 0.9% per year using unpublished annual vaccine efficacy estimates. However, no confidence intervals of these estimates were reported, and the fit of a linear function through the annual vaccine efficacy estimates was poor. Therefore, we conservatively assumed that this waning rate was only valid for the first 4 years covered by the trial and would be equal to the ≥ 70 years age group after 4 years.

For ZVL, a one-minus-exponential function was fitted using follow-up data of ≥ 60-year-olds up to 11 years after vaccination. To include the effect of age, we adjusted the vaccine efficacy at take using age-specific risk ratios of the clinical trial. For the ZVL booster, we assumed that the efficacy would be equal to the efficacy that an initial dose would have had at that age. More details on the model fits are provided in Additional file 1.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^116y1b4W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (SHINGRIX) has undergone several trials.

- **Safety and immunogenicity with Pneumovax23**: A trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of RZV and Pneumovax23 to adults aged ≥ 50 years revealed no immunologic interference, and no safety concerns were identified.

- **Coadministration with Tdap**: A trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of coadministration of the first dose of RZV with the reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in adults ≥ 50 years demonstrated noninferiority for all vaccine antigens, except pertussis pertactin. However, as pertactin-specific immune responses after coadministration of RZV and Tdap compared favorably with protective levels in a German household contact study, these data do not suggest clinically relevant interference between RZV and Tdap. No safety concerns were identified.

- **Concomitant administration with influenza vaccine**: A phase III trial in adults ≥ 50 years evaluating the coadministration of RZV and an unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) demonstrated noninferiority of antibody responses to both vaccines compared with sequential administration. There was no decrease in immunogenicity, and no safety concerns were noted. There are currently no recommendations for the concomitant administration of the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and RZV, as concomitant administration of two adjuvanted vaccines has not been evaluated.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^117XXAxK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

After vOka was licensed in the United States, the vaccine continues to be evaluated. Children and adults who manifest a serious rash or other symptoms post-vaccination are identified and studied. Post-licensure safety studies are mandated by the Food and Drug Administration as they provide critical information on safety and efficacy. The Worldwide Adverse Experience System, sponsored by Merck and established in the late 1990s, analyzes potential adverse events following VZV vaccines. This program seeks to determine whether VZV recovered from patients with an adverse event after receiving the vaccine is vOka or wild-type VZV. The CDC also performs such laboratory determinations.

The type of VZV present in a rash that occurs shortly after vaccination continues to be of interest. The vOka in the varicella vaccine is a live agent and could, in theory, infect an individual and give rise to disease despite its attenuation. The vaccine could occasionally be administered to an individual who is incubating wild-type VZV. After vaccination, a rash caused by infection with VZV could either be due to an adverse effect of vOka or it could be due to infection with wild-type VZV. If the latter, the rash could be the result of infection that occurred prior to vaccination or it might indicate vaccine failure. During the early days after vOka was licensed, this type of analysis was particularly important because there were still many children who were actually developing varicella.

### Final analysis of the ZOE-LTFU trial to 11 years post-vaccination: Efficacy of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster and related complications [^1173f3wi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or adverse events (AEs) leading to withdrawal that were considered related to the investigational vaccine, study participation, or to a GSK medication or vaccine during the entire ZOE-LTFU study. The most common reasons for study withdrawal were unrelated SAEs, consent withdrawal not related to an AE, and loss to follow-up. The study adds to the long-term safety profile of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), which has been established across multiple clinical trials and over five years of post-licensure use.

The efficacy of RZV in the ZOE-50/70 studies and the potential public health benefits have contributed to changes in the national immunization programs of several countries. Some countries have introduced preferential recommendations in favor of RZV; others that did not previously recommend herpes zoster vaccination have included RZV in their routine immunization programs, and some have lowered the recommended age of vaccination. Data from the ZOE-LTFU study, including high efficacy observed in all age groups and minimal waning of vaccine efficacy over time, might support further introductions and expansion of vaccination to all age groups ≥ 50 years.

Our study had some limitations. Only approximately half of the potentially eligible participants from ZOE-50/70 took part in the ZOE-LTFU study, although the participants in ZOE-LTFU were generally representative of those in the parent studies. Due to the high vaccine efficacy and favorable safety profile of RZV in ZOE-50/70, participants from the placebo group were offered the vaccine in a cross-vaccination study. Therefore, there was no placebo group.
