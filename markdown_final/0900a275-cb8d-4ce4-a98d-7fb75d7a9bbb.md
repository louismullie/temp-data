## Question

Should antithrombotics or antiplatelets be held prior to cataract surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antithrombotics and antiplatelets should be held prior to cataract surgery, and if not, what exceptions and practical steps apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the surgical bleeding risk profile of modern phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and evidence say about continuing versus stopping aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, warfarin, and DOACs. Next, I will examine the balance between ocular bleeding complications and systemic thromboembolic risks. After that, I need to consider special scenarios such as dual antiplatelet therapy, mechanical heart valves, and retrobulbar anesthesia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and confirm resumption timelines and any testing considerations.

> Let me first confirm the procedure risk. Modern cataract surgery by phacoemulsification with clear corneal incision is a minimal-bleed-risk procedure; major hemorrhagic complications are rare, and when bleeding occurs it is usually minor and self-limited, such as subconjunctival hemorrhage or small hyphema, without compromising visual outcomes, which supports continuation of antithrombotics in most patients [^1134Fnu2] [^111zJJ75].

> I need to check the highest-credibility guidance for aspirin. The ACCP 2022 guideline explicitly recommends continuing aspirin for minor ophthalmologic procedures, including cataract surgery, because the risk of major bleeding is low and the thrombotic risk of stopping aspirin outweighs the bleeding risk; the AAO Preferred Practice Pattern concurs and notes no increase in sight-threatening hemorrhage with aspirin continuation, though subconjunctival hemorrhage may be more frequent [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all antiplatelets. For P2Y12 inhibitors, ACCP suggests continuing them for minor ophthalmologic procedures in general, but I should verify the nuance for cataract surgery specifically; the AAO notes more anesthetic-block complications with clopidogrel and recommends tailoring management, and for elective noncardiac surgery ACCP advises stopping clopidogrel about 5 days pre-op, so in cataract patients on DAPT I would continue aspirin and consider holding the P2Y12 inhibitor if the anesthesia plan or bleeding risk warrants it, balancing stent timing and thrombotic risk [^117HGtGk] [^1134Fnu2] [^11139q7u].

> Next, I should review warfarin. ACCP suggests continuing VKA therapy for minor ophthalmologic procedures, including cataract surgery, given low rates of clinically significant bleeding and the high risk of thromboembolism if interrupted; meta-analytic data show more minor bleeding events with continued warfarin but no increase in sight-threatening hemorrhage or loss of visual acuity, and the AAO similarly supports continuation with attention to INR being therapeutic and anesthesia technique [^116Ueg87] [^1159zdHe] [^1134Fnu2].

> I will now examine DOACs. Observational data in low-bleed-risk procedures, including cataract surgery, show low major bleeding rates with DOAC continuation, and ACCP provides agent-specific interruption windows if interruption is chosen; importantly, a standardized DOAC protocol (PERIXa) in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing low-bleed-risk procedures reported 0.1% major bleeding and 0% thromboembolism at 30 days, supporting continuation in most cataract cases, with dabigatran held 1–4 days if interruption is needed and factor Xa inhibitors typically held 1–2 days depending on renal function and bleeding risk [^114wTwNn] [^114QBnGC] [^114m9wfR].

> But wait, what if the patient has a mechanical heart valve or recently placed coronary stents. For mechanical valves, ACC/AHA recommends continuing VKA for minor procedures like cataract surgery without bridging when bleeding is easily controlled; for coronary stents, if within 3–12 months, ACCP advises stopping the P2Y12 inhibitor while continuing aspirin, and if within 6–12 weeks, either continue both or stop the P2Y12 inhibitor within 7–10 days, ideally coordinating with cardiology to avoid stent thrombosis [^115GPd1L] [^114ZCESD] [^111ci8Gz].

> I should double-check anesthesia considerations because they can shift the balance. Retrobulbar or peribulbar blocks carry a higher risk of orbital hemorrhage; in patients on warfarin or dual antiplatelet therapy, some clinicians prefer sub-Tenon's or topical anesthesia and may consider holding the P2Y12 inhibitor while keeping aspirin, whereas ACCP still broadly supports continuation of VKA for minor ophthalmic procedures but acknowledges higher bleeding risk with certain blocks, so shared decision-making and technique selection matter [^1134Fnu2] [^116Ueg87].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Continuation of antithrombotics increases minor ocular surface bleeding such as subconjunctival hemorrhage but does not increase sight-threatening operative hemorrhage or worsen visual outcomes; conversely, interruption increases systemic thromboembolic risk, which can be catastrophic, so the net clinical benefit favors continuation in most cataract patients unless there are procedure-specific or patient-specific high-bleed-risk features [^1134Fnu2] [^1159zdHe].

> I need to ensure practical steps are clear. Before surgery, confirm the indication for antithrombotic therapy, review stent timing and valve status, and check warfarin INR if clinically indicated; avoid routine platelet function testing as it does not guide management in this setting; if a P2Y12 inhibitor is held, stop about 5 days pre-op for clopidogrel, 3–5 days for ticagrelor, and 7 days for prasugrel, while continuing aspirin; resume all interrupted agents within 24 hours once hemostasis is secured postoperatively [^1135y6Di] [^11139q7u] [^113dCGgU] [^112xUx6k].

> Final recommendation: For routine phacoemulsification cataract surgery, continue aspirin, warfarin, and DOACs in most patients; for P2Y12 inhibitors, continue them in general but consider holding the P2Y12 inhibitor if the patient is on DAPT, has high bleeding risk features, or will undergo retrobulbar anesthesia, while maintaining aspirin; interrupt antithrombotics only after multidisciplinary discussion for exceptional high-bleed-risk scenarios or alternative anesthesia plans, and resume within 24 hours postoperatively when feasible [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2] [^117HGtGk] [^112xUx6k].

---

In general, **antithrombotics and antiplatelets should not be routinely held** before cataract surgery because the risk of sight-threatening bleeding is low [^1134Fnu2] and the risk of thromboembolic events is higher if these medications are stopped [^114gaX3V]. Current guidelines recommend **continuing aspirin, warfarin, and DOACs** for most patients undergoing cataract surgery, with individualized decisions for dual antiplatelet therapy or high bleeding risk scenarios [^113R8fuP] [^116Ueg87] [^1134Fnu2]. If interruption is necessary, use minimal interruption (e.g. 1–2 days) and coordinate with the prescribing physician [^111zJJ75].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Discontinuing antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy increases **thromboembolic risk**, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, or recent coronary stenting [^114gaX3V]. The risk is especially high in the perioperative period due to the hypercoagulable state induced by surgery [^117SDGxQ].

---

## Risks associated with continuation

Continuing antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy during cataract surgery increases the risk of **minor bleeding complications**, such as subconjunctival hemorrhage or mild hyphema [^1134Fnu2]. However, the incidence of sight-threatening bleeding complications, such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage or expulsive hemorrhage, is extremely low and not significantly increased by continuation of these medications [^1134Fnu2] [^115TLiGE].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies have evaluated the **risks and benefits** of continuing versus discontinuing antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy in cataract surgery:

- **Aspirin**: Continuation of aspirin therapy does not significantly increase the risk of sight-threatening bleeding complications during cataract surgery [^1134Fnu2]. The incidence of minor bleeding events, such as subconjunctival hemorrhage, is slightly increased but does not compromise visual outcomes [^115eaJ97].

- **Warfarin**: Continuation of warfarin therapy is associated with a slight increase in minor bleeding complications, but not with an increased risk of sight-threatening bleeding or compromised visual acuity [^1134Fnu2] [^1159zdHe].

- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Limited data suggest that continuation of DOACs during cataract surgery is associated with minimal bleeding risk, similar to warfarin [^1134Fnu2] [^114wTwNn].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major ophthalmological and cardiological societies provide clear recommendations on the **perioperative management** of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy in cataract surgery:

| **Medication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Aspirin | Continue [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2] |
| Warfarin | Continue [^116Ueg87] [^1134Fnu2] |
| DOACs | Continue [^111zJJ75] [^114TiuQE] |
| Clopidogrel (single antiplatelet) | Continue [^117HGtGk] [^1134Fnu2] |
| Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) | Individualized decision; consider continuing both or stopping clopidogrel 5 days before surgery [^1134Fnu2] [^11139q7u] |

---

## Factors influencing decision-making

The decision to continue or discontinue antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy should be **individualized** based on the following factors:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, indication for antithrombotic therapy, and risk of thromboembolic events [^116UP8Xv].

- **Procedure-specific factors**: Surgical technique, anesthesia method, and surgeon experience [^113bm8dF].

- **Medication-specific factors**: Type of antithrombotic or antiplatelet agent, dosage, and duration of therapy [^114rkXHJ].

---

## Practical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following practical recommendations are suggested:

- **Aspirin**: Continue aspirin therapy perioperatively in patients undergoing cataract surgery [^113R8fuP] [^1134Fnu2].

- **Warfarin**: Continue warfarin therapy perioperatively, ensuring the INR is within the therapeutic range [^116Ueg87] [^115GPd1L].

- **DOACs**: Continue DOACs perioperatively, considering the pharmacokinetics and renal function of the patient [^111zJJ75] [^1173KkBS].

- **Clopidogrel**: Continue clopidogrel therapy perioperatively, unless there is a high risk of bleeding or the patient is undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy [^117HGtGk] [^1134Fnu2].

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy**: Individualize the decision, considering the risk of thromboembolic events versus bleeding risk. If interruption is necessary, stop clopidogrel 5 days before surgery and continue aspirin [^117HGtGk] [^11139q7u].

---

## Conclusion

Antithrombotic and antiplatelet medications should **not be routinely discontinued** before cataract surgery. The risk of sight-threatening bleeding is low, whereas the risk of thromboembolic events is significantly higher if these medications are stopped. Current guidelines recommend continuing these medications perioperatively, with individualized decisions based on patient-specific, procedure-specific, and medication-specific factors [^1134Fnu2].

### Risks and benefits of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication use before cataract surgery [^1173SiHa]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risks and benefits associated with continuation of anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication use before cataract surgery.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients 50 and older scheduled for 19,283 cataract surgeries at nine centers in the United States and Canada between June 1995 and June 1997.

Intervention

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Intraoperative and postoperative (within 7 days) retrobulbar hemorrhage, vitreous or choroidal hemorrhage, hyphema, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction.

Results

Before cataract surgery 24.2% and 4.0% of patients routinely used aspirin and warfarin, respectively. Among routine users, 22.5% of aspirin users and 28.3% of warfarin users discontinued these medications before surgery. The rates of stroke, TIA, or deep vein thrombosis were 1.5/1000 among those who did not use aspirin or warfarin and 3.8/1000 surgeries among routine users of aspirin and warfarin who continued their medication before surgery. The rate was 1 event per 1000 surgeries among those who discontinued aspirin use (relative risk = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.1–5.9). There were no events among warfarin users who discontinued use. The rates of myocardial infarction or ischemia were 5.1/1000 surgeries (aspirin) and 7.6/1000 surgeries (warfarin) among routine continuous users and no different from those of routine users who discontinued use.

Conclusions

The risks of medical and ophthalmic events surrounding cataract surgery were so low that absolute differences in risk associated with changes in routine anticoagulant or antiplatelet use were minimal.

### Managing antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in patients undergoing elective ophthalmic surgery [^114Xp7qB]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment can be challenging for the ophthalmic surgeon with the risk of impaired surgical view or potentially sight-threatening haemorrhage. With the advent of newer medications and the expanding usage of these drugs, there is a need for up-to-date guidance on the subject. This paper describes the current use of modern antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in the UK, and reviews the evidence of such treatments in the context of ophthalmic surgery. A multidisciplinary approach has been used to develop a guideline for the management of antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment in elective ophthalmic surgery. Specifically, guidance is provided on when and how to stop antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment and, importantly, when to seek specialist medical advice.

### Management of antithrombotic therapies in patients scheduled for eye surgery [^114gaX3V]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

The large majority of patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery are elderly and take systemic medications on a regular basis, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments. It is current practice for many physicians to discontinue antithrombotic treatment prior to surgery to reduce bleeding complications that may lead to retrobulbar haemorrhage and, ultimately, to loss of vision. However, discontinuation of antithrombotic treatment in such patients may lead to thromboembolic events with serious consequences. The present narrative review highlights the risk of thrombosis when discontinuing antithrombotic drugs and the risk of bleeding when continuing them. The published literature on this topic shows that discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment leads to a substantially increased risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events and related complications, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves or recent coronary stenting. This risk is distinctly higher than the risk of significant local haemorrhage. Ophthalmic bleeding events reported in the literature are usually minor, without serious consequences, even if antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatments are continued, provided that the anticoagulation level is within the therapeutic range. Thus, the current data are in favour of maintaining antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs for most ophthalmic procedures, regardless of the anaesthetic techniques.

### Ophthalmic patients on antithrombotic drugs: a review and guide to perioperative management [^111q1uSR]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The changing profile of patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery, with an increase in prevalence of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug use, predisposes to bleeding complications. This mandates an awareness of these agents, allowing optimal patient management. We review traditional and newer agents in the context of cataract, vitreoretinal, glaucoma and oculoplastic surgery. Recommendations are given for continuation, cessation and re-commencement of these agents in order to minimise the risk of bleeding and thrombotic/thromboembolic complications.

### Evaluation of the need to discontinue antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications before cataract surgery [^115eaJ97]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk for intraoperative and postoperative bleeding associated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant treatment in patients having uneventful phacoemulsification.

Setting

Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyusyu, Japan.

Methods

In a nonrandomized case series, consecutive patients had phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under sub-Tenon anesthesia. All patients were on warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) therapy, or both. Patients discontinued therapy 1 week before surgery (discontinuation group) or continued the therapeutic regimen until the time of surgery (maintenance group).

Results

The discontinuation group comprised 182 patients and the maintenance group, 173 patients. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the mean prothrombin time-international normalized ratio in patients taking warfarin (P = 0.6). Although there was no significant intraoperative bleeding in any case, 47 eyes (16.5%) in the maintenance group and 31 eyes (10.8%) in the discontinuation group had a subconjunctival hemorrhage postoperatively (P = 0.0309). Minor postoperative ocular bleeding occurred in 11 eyes (4.0%) in the maintenance group and 7 eyes (2.5%) in the discontinuation group (P = 0.4). During the 1-month postoperative period, the mean change in corrected distance visual acuity was -0.462 logMAR ± 0.331 (SD) in the maintenance group and -0.434 ± 0.318 logMAR in the discontinuation group (P = 0.3).

Conclusions

Patients taking warfarin, aspirin, or both up to the time of phacoemulsification had a significantly higher incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage than those who discontinued therapy. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications or in visual improvement.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113R8fuP]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients having a minor dental, dermatologic, or ophthalmologic procedure — antiplatelet continuation evidence and question: The PICO asks whether antiplatelet drugs should be continued vs stopping antiplatelet drugs 7 to 10 days before the procedure. For minor dental procedures, small (< 100 patients) randomized trials and cohort studies suggest no increase in major bleeding with ASA continuation. For minor skin procedures, prospective cohort studies totaling about 200 patients suggest a low (< 1%) risk for major bleeding with continuation of ASA. For phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery, prospective cohort studies have suggested a low (< 1%) incidence of major bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation. For eyelid surgery, one 42-patient randomized trial compared ASA continuation with no perioperative ASA use and reported no significant effect on bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes. For skin procedures, one meta-analysis of two randomized trials and 28 observational studies totaling > 14,000 patients found no significant increase in bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^1134Fnu2]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy in cataract surgery — an analysis of 48,862 surgeries reported higher subconjunctival hemorrhage with warfarin or clopidogrel (3.7% warfarin, 4.4% clopidogrel, 1.7% nonusers) and more anesthetic‑block complications (6.2% warfarin, 8% clopidogrel, 4.3% nonusers), yet no significant increase in potentially sight‑threatening local anesthetic or operative hemorrhage, and no increase with aspirin alone. A study of 19,283 surgeries (74% with a peribulbar or retrobulbar block) found no increased risk of ocular hemorrhagic events when aspirin or warfarin were continued, though subconjunctival hemorrhage and eyelid ecchymosis were not reported. Data on newer anticoagulants are sparse. In a hospital series screening 141,213 emergencies, three cases of grade IV retrobulbar hemorrhage were identified; two patients were on combined acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel and had retrobulbar injections, whereas a U.K. series of 48,862 cataract surgeries found no increase in anesthetic or hemorrhagic complications with dual antiplatelet or combined aspirin/warfarin treatment receiving blocks or sub‑Tenon's anesthesia. Overall, several studies show a higher incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, but available data do not show increased sight‑threatening complications or decreased postoperative visual acuity. Evidence‑based guidelines recommend continuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications in patients undergoing cataract surgery, with management tailored to the individual patient. There are no recommendations from either the American Heart Association or the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons to prescribe systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with artificial heart valves or joint prostheses who undergo cataract surgery.

### Low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention-cardiovascular risks after its perioperative withdrawal versus bleeding risks with its continuation-review and meta-analysis [^113u5mzC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Low-dose aspirin given for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is frequently withdrawn prior to surgical or diagnostic procedures to reduce bleeding complications. This may expose patients to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aim of the study was to review and quantify cardiovascular risks because of periprocedural aspirin withdrawal and bleeding risks with the continuation of aspirin.

Methods

We screened MEDLINE (January 1970-October 2004) with additional manual cross-referencing for clinical studies, surveys on the opinions of doctors and guidelines.

Results

Studies reporting the relative risk of acute cardiovascular events after aspirin withdrawal when compared with its continuation were not found. However, retrospective investigations revealed that aspirin withdrawal precedes up to 10.2% of acute cardiovascular syndromes. The time interval between discontinuation and acute cerebral events was 14.3 ± 11.3 days, 8.5 ± 3.6 days for acute coronary syndromes, and 25.8 ± 18.1 days for acute peripheral arterial syndromes (P < 0.02 versus acute coronary syndromes). On aspirin-related bleeding risks, we obtained 41 (12 observational retrospective, 19 observational prospective, 10 randomized) studies, reporting on 49 590 patients (14 981 on aspirin). Baseline frequency of bleeding complications varied between 0 (skin lesion excision, cataract surgery) and 75% (transrectal prostate biopsy). Whilst aspirin increased the rate of bleeding complications by factor 1.5 (median, interquartile range: 1.0–2.5), it did not lead to a higher level of the severity of bleeding complications (exception: intracranial surgery, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy). Surveys amongst doctors on the management of this problem demonstrate wide variations. Available guidelines are scarce and in part contradictory.

Conclusions

Only if low-dose aspirin may cause bleeding risks with increased mortality or sequels comparable with the observed cardiovascular risks after aspirin withdrawal, it should be discontinued prior to an intended operation or procedure. Controlled clinical studies are urgently needed.

### Management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in glaucoma surgery [^115eBhXP]. Journal of Glaucoma (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of antithrombotic therapy is rising as the population of older adults grows and novel agents with wider indications emerge. Likewise, surgical treatment of glaucoma may become increasingly common as the prevalence of glaucoma increases and innovative treatment options are developed. These trends highlight the need to understand how best to manage antithrombotic therapy in the context of glaucoma surgery. This review article describes current literature on antithrombotic therapy and perioperative thromboembolic risk evaluation based on individual factors. In addition, guidance is offered on the management of antithrombotic therapy in the setting of each type of glaucoma surgery, with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach involving the patients' treating physicians.

### Perioperative antiplatelet therapy [^117SDGxQ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Aspirin is recommended as a lifelong therapy that should never be interrupted for patients with cardiovascular dis- ease. Clopidogrel therapy is mandatory for six weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, three to six months after myocardial infarction, and at least 12 months after placement of drug-eluting stents. Because of the hypercoagulable state induced by surgery, early withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease increases the risk of postoperative myocardial infarction and death five- to 10-fold in stented patients who are on continuous dual antiplatelet therapy. The shorter the time between revascularization and surgery, the higher the risk of adverse cardiac events. Elective surgery should be postponed beyond these periods, whereas vital, semiurgent, or urgent operations should be performed under continued dual antiplatelet therapy. The risk of surgical hemorrhage is increased approximately 20 percent by aspirin or clopidogrel alone, and 50 percent by dual antiplatelet therapy. The present clinical data suggest that the risk of a cardiovascular event when stopping antiplatelet agents preoperatively is higher than the risk of surgical bleeding when continuing these drugs, except during surgery in a closed space (e.g., intracranial, posterior eye chamber) or surgeries associated with massive bleeding and difficult hemostasis.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112FP71A]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on antiplatelets, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider stopping aspirin ≤ 7 days before surgery in patients on aspirin therapy undergoing elective surgery and requiring aspirin interruption.

### Should more patients continue aspirin therapy perioperatively? clinical impact of aspirin withdrawal syndrome [^111nAFeK]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based focused review of aspirin use in the perioperative period along with an in-depth discussion of the considerations and risks associated with its preoperative withdrawal.

Background

For patients with established cardiovascular disease, taking aspirin is considered a critical therapy. The cessation of aspirin can cause a platelet rebound phenomenon and prothrombotic state leading to major adverse cardiovascular events. Despite the risks of aspirin withdrawal, which are exacerbated during the perioperative period, standard practice has been to stop aspirin before elective surgery for fear of excessive bleeding. Mounting evidence suggests that this practice should be abandoned.

Methods

We performed a PubMed and Medline literature search using the keywords aspirin, withdrawal, and perioperative. We manually reviewed relevant citations for inclusion.

Results/Conclusions

Clinicians should employ a patient-specific strategy for perioperative aspirin management that weighs the risks of stopping aspirin with those associated with its continuation. Most patients, especially those taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, should have their aspirin continued throughout the perioperative period. When aspirin is held preoperatively, the aspirin withdrawal syndrome may significantly increase the risk of a major thromboembolic complication. For many operative procedures, the risk of perioperative bleeding while continuing aspirin is minimal, as compared with the concomitant thromboembolic risks associated with aspirin withdrawal. Those cases where aspirin should be stopped include patients undergoing intracranial, middle ear, posterior eye, intramedullary spine, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy surgery.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114wTwNn]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) management — observational data and evidence gaps are as follows: Observational evidence reported a low rate (1.6%) of major pocket hematomas and a 25-patient observational study of DOAC continuation for cataract surgery identified no bleeding events; in low-bleed-risk procedures, preoperative DOAC interruption versus continuation was associated with lower overall and minor bleeding (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.91; OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.93), persisting after adjustment (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.95). Almost all evidence pertains to atrial fibrillation, few retrospective case series address VTE, and there are no studies for low-dose DOAC therapy (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid) with ASA in stable coronary or peripheral arterial disease.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1161x5Qh]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1178MUVK]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy, aspirin, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider continuing aspirin in patients on aspirin therapy undergoing minor dental, dermatologic,
or ophthalmologic procedures.

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135y6Di]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on antiplatelets, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining routine platelet function testing before surgery/procedure to guide perioperative antiplatelet management in patients receiving antiplatelet drug therapy and undergoing elective surgery/procedure.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116Ueg87]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Minor ophthalmologic procedures in patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — evidence and recommendation: Minor ophthalmologic procedures include cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) and surgeries for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy; no randomized trials have assessed perioperative management with cataract surgery, cohort data report bleeding < 3%, and a meta-analysis found increased bleeding risk with continued VKAs (OR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.73–6.16) with an overall bleeding incidence of 10% (95% CI: 5–19), with events generally self-limiting and no compromised visual acuity. Therefore, in patients receiving VKA therapy who require a minor ophthalmologic procedure, we suggest continuation of VKA over VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), while noting that retrobulbar anesthesia poses a concern and VKA interruption may be preferred in higher-bleeding-risk situations such as more complex retinal surgery or retrobulbar anesthesia.

Design

Prospective interventional case series.

Methods

Consecutive patients with simple cataract on combined anticoagulant (warfarin) and antiplatelet (aspirin or clopidogrel) treatment who were unable to discontinue the treatment because of a high risk for thromboembolic events were included. Patients had cataract extraction under topical anesthesia with a clear corneal incision (CCI), phacoemulsification, and implantation of a foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens. Prothrombin time-international normalized ratio and platelet functions were evaluated immediately before surgery. Patients were also examined 1 day and 7 days postoperatively. Intraoperative and postoperative ocular bleeding and other related complications were assessed.

Results

Forty patients (51 eyes) with a mean age of 72 years (range 51 to 90 years) had phacoemulsification. Hemorrhagic complications were not observed at surgery or during the 1-week follow-up. Surgical complications included 1 rupture of the capsulorhexis and 1 implantation of a capsular tension ring due to partial zonulysis. No patient had a thromboembolic event.

Conclusions

In patients with uncomplicated cataract at high risk for thromboembolic events, phacoemulsification cataract surgery using a CCI under topical needle-free anesthesia was safely performed without discontinuing systemic anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely.

Objectives

To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy, for at least two weeks, and were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthetic or sedation in which bleeding that required transfusion or additional surgery was unlikely. We included studies which compared perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or versus substitution of antiplatelet therapy with a placebo for at least five days before surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Our primary outcomes were: all-cause mortality at longest follow-up (up to six months); all-cause mortality (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included: blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products; blood loss requiring further surgical intervention; risk of ischaemic events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with 666 randomized adults. We identified three ongoing studies. All study participants were scheduled for elective general surgery (including abdominal, urological, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery) under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. Studies compared continuation of single or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) with discontinuation of therapy for at least five days before surgery. Three studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and two reported methods to conceal allocation. Three studies were placebo-controlled trials and were at low risk of performance bias, and three studies reported adequate methods to blind outcome assessors to group allocation. Attrition was limited in four studies and two studies had reported prospective registration with clinical trial registers and were at low risk of selective outcome reporting bias. We reported mortality at two time points: the longest follow-up reported by study authors up to six months, and time point reported by study authors up to 30 days. Five studies reported mortality up to six months (of which four studies had a longest follow-up at 30 days, and one study at 90 days) and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 4.27; 659 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from eight fewer to 40 more). Combining the four studies with a longest follow-up at 30 days alone showed the same effect estimate, and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.27; 616 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from nine fewer to 42 more). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring transfusion (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.26; 368 participants; absolute effect of 42 more participants per 1000 requiring transfusion in the continuation group, ranging from 19 fewer to 119 more; four studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring additional surgery (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.58; 368 participants; absolute effect of six more participants per 1000 requiring additional surgery in the continuation group, ranging from seven fewer to 71 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to incidences of ischaemic events (to include peripheral ischaemia, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction) within 30 days of surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.77; 616 participants; absolute effect of 17 fewer participants per 1000 with an ischaemic event in the continuation group, ranging from 39 fewer to 40 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade evidence for all outcomes owing to limited evidence from few studies. We noted a wide confidence in effect estimates for mortality at the end of follow-up and at 30 days, and for blood loss requiring transfusion which suggested imprecision. We noted visual differences in study results for ischaemic events which suggested inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery may make little or no difference to mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischaemic events. We found moderate-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery probably makes little or no difference to bleeding requiring transfusion. Evidence was limited to few studies with few participants, and with few events. The three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^116ggpXA]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Interventional pain procedures — observational data and perioperative practice indicate that in a systematic review evaluating 31 reports, most patients can undergo dental procedures, arthrocentesis, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without alteration of their anticoagulant regimen, whereas for other invasive and surgical procedures, oral anticoagulation needs to be withheld with individualized decisions about perioperative heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Data suggest that the traditional attitude of discontinuing the medication 7 days before interventions poses considerable risk, yet multiple guidelines recommend these polices and discontinuation has been a general practice. An evaluation by Manchikanti et al of over 18,000 procedures with over 12,000 encounters and over 3,000 patients showed no significant prevalence of adverse events in those who continued with or ceased antithrombotic therapy. Based on comprehensive review, most commonly, epidural hematomas appear spontaneously, with a large number of reports after regional anesthesia, and instances reported with interventional techniques in patients without antiplatelet therapy, with discontinued therapy, and with continued therapy. In a survey, epidural hematoma occurred in 29 patients with discontinuation of antiplatelet and warfarin therapy compared to 26 patients with continued antiplatelet therapy.

Valvular heart disease — procedures with minimal bleeding — Antithrombotic therapy should not be stopped for procedures in which bleeding is unlikely or would be inconsequential, with examples including surgery on the skin, dental cleaning, or simple treatment for dental caries, and eye surgery for cataracts or glaucoma is usually associated with very little bleeding and is frequently performed without alteration of anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in vitreoretinal surgery [^112dwo2k]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate changes in the prevalence of antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy and its possible relationship to postoperative bleeding in vitreoretinal surgery (VRS) patients.

Design

Observational, retrospective case control study.

Methods

setting: University practice.study population: A total of 822 patents who underwent VRS during 3 intervals in 1994, 2004, and 2008.observation procedure: Retrospective chart review for 1994 and 2004, but contemporaneous in 2008.main outcome measures: Proportion using antiplatelets or anticoagulants, the incidence of early postoperative intraocular bleeding in patients, and clinical consequence of the hemorrhage.

Results

Thirty-one of 213 patients (14.6%) who underwent VRS in 1994, 103 of 361 patients (28.5%) in 2004, and 80 of 248 patients (32.3%) in 2008 had taken antiplatelet therapy (P < .001). The rates of anticoagulant therapy did not vary. The incidence of bleeding was higher (20.0%) in the patients who did not suspend antiplatelets than in those who did (9.6%) (P = 0.05, χ(2) test), but this difference lost statistical significance in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.079). Anticoagulant was associated with intraocular hemorrhage at postoperative first day after vitrectomy (P = 0.03, Fisher exact test). No reoperation or failure of the surgery was attributable to the hemorrhage in anticoagulant or antiplatelet patients.

Conclusions

Use of antiplatelet agents has increased in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery but probably does not increase the risk of postoperative intraocular bleeding; however, when safe to suspend even for a short time the potential risk is further reduced. Anticoagulant use was associated with a higher risk, but without serious consequences. Working with a patient's medical doctor may allow safe suspension in some cases, which may further lower these risks.

### Peri-operative management of ophthalmic patients on anti-thrombotic agents: a literature review [^115Lq2Rp]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

There is variability in the management of ophthalmic patients on anti-thrombotic agents (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) during the peri-operative period. A survey carried out in a UK teaching hospital on a cohort of ophthalmologists showed majority were comfortable with antiplatelet management but there was variability in managing patients on warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs); 40% were unaware of existing guidelines. We aim to review the recommendations in the literature with regards to managing anti-thrombotic agents during the peri-operative period of ophthalmic surgery. We reviewed incidences of complications, specifically, the haemorrhagic complications associated. Pubmed search was carried out on relevant keywords from January 2007 to August 2017. All relevant UK guidelines including the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and British Society of Haematology were reviewed. Literature recommendations for routine cataract surgery under topical or sub-Tenon's anaesthesia would be to continue all anti-thrombotic agents. For sharp needle anaesthesia, avoidance of dual antiplatelet therapy was recommended and warfarin could be continued if INR within therapeutic range. Recommendations for surgeries in glaucoma, vitreo-retinal, oculoplastic and lacrimal; and strabismus are presented. No evidence was found for corneal surgery. Haemorrhagic complications are reported in all groups. Limitations of this review include the retrospective nature, lack of randomized control trials and the limited evidence regarding DOACs. It is important for ophthalmologists to be aware of and balance the risk of thromboembolic events and risks of haemorrhagic complications for ophthalmic surgery. A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended for complex cases.

Antiplatelet drugs

Antiplatelet drugs are used in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. They may be taken individually or as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), usually following acute coronary syndromes or after coronary artery stenting. Aspirin inhibits the production of thromboxane. If taken alone it should be continued for most procedures until the day before surgery as most evidence suggests it does not increase bleeding, except for surgeries with a particularly high bleeding risk or surgery in a confined space (brain, posterior chamber of the eye, medullary canal) where it should be discontinued 5 days before the procedure. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor (P2Y12) antagonists (including clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are thienopyridines. They should be discontinued 5–7 days pre‐operatively. Consideration should be given to the use of haemadsorption filters if urgent or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass is undertaken in patients with P2Y12 inhibitors.

Antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary stents having non‐cardiac surgery

The management of these drugs in patients with coronary stents in situ is more challenging. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 4 weeks after the insertion of a bare metal stent and for 12 months after a drug‐eluting stent. The risk of peri‐operative adverse cardiac events reduces as time passes following the insertion of the stent. Very low bleeding‐risk procedures can be undertaken without stopping DAPT. Low bleeding‐risk procedures in patients with low thrombotic risk may be undertaken with discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist (5–7 days pre‐operatively) with aspirin continuing.

Ideally, elective surgery in patients deemed to be at high thrombotic risk (within 6 months of stent insertion) should be deferred until they are lower risk. If this is not possible it should proceed on aspirin with temporary discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist. Bridging with a parenteral short‐acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, such as tirofiban or eptifibatide, during the period of ADP receptor antagonist withdrawal can also be considered in conjunction with cardiology input.

For emergency surgery, management depends on the antiplatelet agent and when the last dose was taken. Platelet transfusions have been proven to improve haemostasis. Platelet function testing may be helpful to determine the degree of platelet inhibition. Neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided when ADP antagonists have been taken within 7 days, although aspirin is generally thought to be safe to continue.

### Cataract surgery practice patterns worldwide: a survey [^113TGhXp]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Results

The complete survey results are public and accessible online at the above URL. Overall response rate was 209/240 (87.08%) from 38 countries (figure 1). The survey represented all types and sizes of institutions: 38% public hospitals, 36% private practices and 26% academic sites; 40% of them with a surgical volume greater than 2000 and 40% between 1000 and 2000 per year for overall surgical volume between 241 700 and 410 500 cataracts per year. There was a significant correlation between type of institution and surgical volume (p < 0.05): public hospitals had larger surgical volume.

Figure 1
Survey geographic coverage. All countries in blue had one respondent except countries where the number of respondents is reported on the map. Italy had 83 responders and Japan 51.

Preoperative systemic testing varied considerably among respondents (figure 2): 52% of involved institutions had mandatory preoperative ECG and blood testing, in 126/209 (60%) centres was the ophthalmologist who interviewed patient on his/her systemic conditions while in 57/209 institutions an anaesthesiologist briefed the patient. In such all such cases, patients also underwent ECG and blood tests. Interestingly, 13/203 centres (6%) did not ask for any pre-op testing, neither interviewed the patient, while 65/209 (31%) required the patient to fill a questionnaire and 34/209 (16%) had the general practitioner doing it. Neither institution type nor surgical volume had an impact on systemic pre-op testing (table 1).

Figure 2
Systemic testing routinely performed for each cataract surgery by responders. Note percentages add up to more than 100% since multiple answers were allowed.

Survey questions when type of institution and surgical volume are considered independent variables

Antiplatelet aggregation drugs and anticoagulants were left untouched in 75% of cases and discontinued in 12% while pre-op topical prophylaxis was performed in 71% of interviewed institutions while the remainder 29% did not. Fifty-four per cent or responders used antibiotics, 29% non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 29% antiseptics and multiple choices were common: 6.9% used three products; 21% two drugs, 68% only one drug. Institutions requiring one drug only prescribed: 61/85 (71.7%) antibiotics, 15/85 (17.6%) antiseptic drugs alone, 9/85 (10.6%) NSAIDs (figure 3).

### Risk factors for severe bleeding complications in glaucoma surgery and the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents [^1114ugMN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraoperative bleeding can negatively influence the ophthalmic surgical result. This is particularly true for glaucoma surgery, where bleeding can lead to procedural failure or irreversible optic-nerve damage caused by postoperatively elevated/excessive intraocular pressure. Patients requiring glaucoma surgery are often taking various systemic medications including antiplatelet (AP) and anticoagulant (AC) agents, and the percentage of patients taking these has been rising for years. The question glaucoma surgeons face is whether these medications should be discontinued for surgery to possibly reduce the risk of bleeding, or whether a potentially higher risk of thromboembolic events is acceptable. Despite its being an everyday topic for glaucoma surgeons, there is, as well as for retinal surgeons, still no standardized guideline on how to proceed with the various AP and AC agents prior to different glaucoma procedures. Efforts have been made to assess the effect of platelet inhibitors or anticoagulants on bleeding frequency and severity during different ophthalmic procedures. In retinal surgery, there is growing evidence that the use of anticoagulant medications is unlikely to have a significant impact on the incidence of severe bleeding complications. A prospective study of 374 retinal patients performed concurrently with this study also came to this conclusion. However, in glaucoma surgery, uncertainty prevails regarding the extent to which anticoagulant medications raise the intraoperative bleeding risk. Studies demonstrating an increased risk of bleeding in patients using vitamin k antagonists appeared over a decade ago. More recent reviews recommend taking an individualized approach to each patient's preoperative management, but there still seems to be too little known about the influence of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The purpose of this prospective study was thus to identify risk factors for intraoperative severe bleeding events, and to evaluate the influence of AP and AC agents on their incidence and severity in glaucoma surgical procedures. Another aim was to validate a consensus scale of bleeding complications serving as a possible guide for upcoming glaucoma studies.

### Perioperative use of warfarin and aspirin in cataract surgery by Canadian society of cataract and refractive surgery members: survey [^113bm8dF]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To survey the members of the Canadian Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (CSCRS) and identify their practices regarding the perioperative use of warfarin and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) in cataract surgery.

Setting

Private practice, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Methods

Members of the CSCRS were faxed a questionnaire that examined their perioperative management of patients being treated with warfarin and aspirin.

Results

Of the 110 eligible participants, 82 returned a completed questionnaire, representing a response rate of 74.5%. Warfarin or aspirin was routinely stopped prior to cataract surgery by 25.6% of the respondents. The majority of surgeons who discontinued these medications reported doing so 3 to 7 days prior to surgery and resumed their use 1 to 2 days postoperatively. Topical anesthesia and clear corneal incisions were preferred by the higher volume surgeons. These surgeons were also less likely to discontinue either warfarin or aspirin preoperatively.

Conclusions

The majority of the Canadian Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery members do not stop either warfarin or aspirin for cataract surgery during the perioperative period.

Influence of AP/ AC Agents

There is controversy in the literature as to whether AP and AC agents should be discontinued before eye surgery. In vitreoretinal surgery there is a rising number of studies showing that the perioperative intake of such medications is not associated with an increased risk of intraoperative bleeding. Nevertheless, specialists in glaucoma surgery are more reluctant to make such statements. Rather, there seems to be consensus that the each patient's bleeding risk should be individually assessed. In a retrospective evaluation of 367 trabeculectomies, Cobb et al noted that taking ASA100 raised the risk of hyphema, but had no impact on surgical success. However, taking warfarin resulted in significantly worse outcomes. Regarding ASA100 our results are comparable, as we likewise observed no significantly increased risk for severe bleeding. The statement by Cobb et al regarding warfarin needs to be viewed critically, as only 5 patients in their cohort were taking warfarin. Only 2 of our study patients were taking a vitamin k antagonist, thus enabling no comparison. Law et al retrospectively compared glaucoma interventions in 347 patients taking AP and/ or AC agents with 347 controls. Risk for bleeding complications was higher in the study group (10.1% vs 3.7%) with the overall highest risk for patients on AC medication (22.9%). Their overall recorded risk of bleeding resembled our study's (6.9% vs 9%). However, the 22.9% risk increase in their patients taking AC agents could have been partly caused by the study's population, which revealed significant differences between groups regarding underlying diseases, such as arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia and coronary artery disease. Furthermore, as they did not grade the registered bleeding events, the effect of each bleeding event is unclear. There is a limitation associated with our study's observational design, that is, patients were included who continued to take their AP and/or AC agents as usual, as were those who discontinued them or bridged AC agents by using heparin. This heterogeneity made analysis challenging, but it reflects the real-world clinical situation (at least in Germany).

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116aSsRZ]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111zJJ75]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Assessing perioperative risk for surgery/procedure-related bleeding — the empiric classification separates patients into high, low-to-moderate, or minimal bleed risk based on the expected 30-day post-operative risk of major bleeding (high-bleed-risk ≥ 2%, low-to-moderate-bleed-risk 0%-2%, and minimal-bleed-risk approximately 0%). Minimal-bleed-risk procedures and selected surgeries such as phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery are those in which anticoagulants may be continued perioperatively without any or with minimal (ie, day of procedure only) interruption. Low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgeries/procedures encompass a broad range of interventions in which shorter periods of pre-operative anticoagulant interruption and post-operative anticoagulant resumption intervals are acceptable due to an overall lower bleed risk. High-bleed-risk surgeries/procedures are those which require sufficient pre-operative anticoagulant interruption so there is minimal-to-no residual effect at the time of surgery and delayed post-operative resumption; this category also includes any surgeries performed with neuraxial (spinal or epidural) anesthesia or other neuraxial interventions due to the risk for epidural hematoma. Selected minimal-bleed-risk procedures may require 1 to 2 days of anticoagulant interruption if there is concern about bleeding, and surgical procedures (eg, an inguinal hernia repair) may vary widely and might be justifiably categorized as low-to-moderate- or high-bleed-risk.

### Risk factors for severe bleeding complications in glaucoma surgery and the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents [^111a4JHL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

According to the results of our study cohort, this study identified deep vein thrombosis, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and the glaucoma procedures viscocanaloplasty and trabeculectomy as risk factors for severe bleeding events during glaucoma surgery. The documentation of the intraoperative bleeding history before surgery does not seem to provide sufficient information to discover which patient carries a particularly high risk of severe intraoperative bleeding. Like our parallel study in vitreoretinal surgery, the present investigation also failed to detect a significant effect of AP or AC agents on intraoperative bleeding. However, since the number of registered severe hemorrhages was relatively low and severe bleeding - due to the lack of compression options in glaucoma surgery - may have a direct impact on the surgical outcome, we are reluctant to make a recommendation regarding the perioperative management of anticoagulants. A prospective, randomized, blinded study should be conducted to answer this highly relevant question.

### Risk of hemorrhagic complications and secondary surgery in patients on warfarin vs DOACs undergoing glaucoma surgery [^1133MmmS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

One area of active clinical discussion is the discontinuation of anticoagulant medications prior to glaucoma surgery due to risk of bleeding. Currently, the literature has not reached a consensus on the single best practice for patients requiring glaucoma filtration surgery. One leading argument, however, is that although maintenance of warfarin and DOACs increase the risk of certain hemorrhagic events following glaucoma surgery, these dangers are outweighed by the risk of systemic thromboembolic events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke if patients discontinue anticoagulant use before surgery. Although not definitive, our study provides additional perspective to this ongoing discussion. Our results indicate potentially increased risk of specific types of ocular bleeding in warfarin vs DOAC patients, but these outcomes do not necessarily correlate with impaired visual acuity or permanent adverse outcomes. Our results also could not establish anticoagulant use as a risk factor for needing secondary glaucoma surgery. Based on these findings, there may be clinical evidence to keep patients on anticoagulant medication prior to glaucoma filtration surgery despite the aforementioned potential associated risks. However, further studies comparing risks of hemorrhagic complications with continuation of anticoagulant medications to risks of thromboembolic events with cessation of these drugs are needed to confidently answer this clinically relevant question. It is worth noting that researchers have reached a broader consensus for continuing anticoagulant use in cataract surgery despite its risks because anticoagulants were not associated with increased bleeding events in cataract surgery.

Because of their safety and efficacy, clinicians may prefer DOACs over warfarin. Several studies also corroborate this preference, as seen in one study conducted by Fang et al, which studied rates of recurrent venous thromboemboli in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study found that the cohort of patients taking DOACs was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE compared to those patients on warfarin. Another systematic review/meta-analysis conducted by Zeng et al found that, in atrial fibrillation patients, DOAC therapy reduced the risk of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause death but did not find a change in difference in risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. However, like these studies, most research directly comparing warfarin to DOAC assesses cardiovascular pathologies and studies outcomes like stroke that affect the systemic vasculature. The only similar study in the literature pertaining to ophthalmic outcomes studied conversion rates to neovascular disease in patients with non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration with warfarin vs DOAC use.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117HGtGk]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy for minor dental, dermatologic, and ophthalmologic procedures — In patients receiving an antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) who are undergoing a minor dental procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) over stopping the antiplatelet agent before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); for a minor dermatologic procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) over stopping the antiplatelet drug before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence); and for a minor ophthalmologic procedure, we suggest continuing the antiplatelet drug (ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor) throughout the ophthalmologic procedure over stopping the antiplatelet agent before the procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). Patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and a P2Y12 inhibitor can continue ASA and interrupt the P2Y12 inhibitor.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^115TLiGE]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract in the adult eye — suprachoroidal hemorrhage around cataract surgery has historical incidence data and perioperative considerations. Historically, the incidence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage related to large-incision cataract surgery was reported to be 0.15% to 0.19% and to be associated with myopia, glaucoma, diabetes, atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, and prolonged intraoperative hypotony. Published data on the incidence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage following phacoemulsification are lacking, and the risk is probably lower because the surgical duration is shorter and the hypotony time is reduced. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage has been reported during FLACS. The majority of published studies support the continuation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during cataract surgery, and anticoagulation with warfarin does not significantly increase the frequency of (supra)choroidal hemorrhage. Clinical signs and symptoms of an intraoperative (supra)choroidal hemorrhage include sudden pain, scotoma and loss of red reflex, elevated IOP, shallowing of the anterior chamber, and iris prolapse. Prompt diagnosis of a hemorrhage and immediate incision closure minimizes the likelihood of sight-threatening complications.

### Safety of continuing warfarin therapy during cataract surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159zdHe]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In patients who are receiving warfarin therapy and require cataract surgery, it may be possible to continue warfarin in the perioperative period but the safety of this management strategy has not been systematically evaluated.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the safety (bleeding events) of continuing warfarin before and after cataract surgery. We included studies that enrolled patients undergoing cataract surgery who were anticoagulated with warfarin alone and that reported bleeding events as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using a validated form. Odds ratios and bleeding rates were pooled to give summary estimates of bleeding risk.

Results

We identified 11 studies (5 cohort and 6 case series) assessing bleeding risk associated with warfarin continuation during cataract surgery. Patients who continued warfarin had an increased risk for bleeding (odds ratio; 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73–6.16). The overall incidence of bleeding (95% CI) was 10% (5–19). Almost all bleeding events were self-limiting and not significant, consisting of dot hyphemae or subconjunctival hemorrhages. No patient had compromised visual acuity related to a bleeding event.

Conclusion

Patients who are receiving warfarin therapy and undergo cataract surgery without warfarin interruption have an increased risk for bleeding but such bleeds are not clinically significant. The low quality of studies assessed, however, precludes definitive conclusions as to the risk for bleeding in patients who continue warfarin around the time of cataract surgery.

### Periprocedural thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy [^111RwQHd]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy pose a clinical challenge when therapy needs to be interrupted for surgical or invasive procedures. Maintaining anticoagulation places them at risk for serious bleeding complications, whereas discontinuing anticoagulation puts them at risk of thromboembolic complications. Most patients can undergo dental procedures, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without discontinuing anticoagulation. The main patient groups that may require a periprocedural alternative to oral anticoagulation (periprocedural thromboprophylaxis or bridging) include patients with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, and hypercoagulable states and patients with chronic venous thrombosis who are undergoing surgery. Currently, there is little consensus on the appropriate perioperative treatment of patients on long-term warfarin therapy. There are an increasing number of studies that evaluate the benefits of periprocedural bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in place of unfractionated heparin (UFH). An advantage of LMWH over UFH is that perioperative conversion from warfarin therapy with LMWH can be carried out in the outpatient setting, which is more convenient for patients and is cost effective. As with the use of UFH, there are reports of maternal thromboembolic complications with LMWHs in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. This review brings together the available data on periprocedural bridging to assess the available options for patients on long-term warfarin therapy who are undergoing surgical procedures. It provides a rationale for using LMWHs while individualizing the risks versus benefits in a given patient population.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116zruP4]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Warfarin use during cataract surgery — A 2009 meta-analysis found that patients taking warfarin while undergoing cataract surgery had a threefold increase (overall 9%–10% incidence) of nonclinically significant bleeding events compared with patients not on warfarin. The majority of bleeding events were self-limited and included hyphema or subconjunctival hemorrhage. There was no evidence that continuing warfarin had a negative impact on postoperative visual acuity.

### Patient's perceptions of importance of discontinuing antithrombotic medication before oculoplastics surgery [^113FNL2w]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aims to analyze patients' perspectives to ultimately gain insight into the patients understanding in 3 broad categories: their understanding of how their medications, supplements, and over-the-counter drugs work, their understanding of the risks these agents pose in a surgical setting, and their preferences for the continued use of the agents during and after oculoplastic surgery. To obtain these data, the authors prospectively surveyed 129 patients who had an oculoplastic surgery clinical evaluation at our tertiary care academic facility. Because no previously validated questionnaire on this topic existed, the authors utilized a novel questionnaire the authors developed. For antithrombotic medications, about 60% of patients felt there were risks associated both with stopping and continuing the agent during surgery. For antithrombotic supplements, more patients answered there were risks associated with continuing the agents during surgery versus stopping the agents during surgery (40% versus 25%, respectively). There was a relationship between patients' knowledge that they were on an antithrombotic prescription and their understanding of the risks associated with antithrombotic usage during surgery as well as sudden discontinuation of the prescription. With an understanding of the patient's point of view, surgeons will be equipped to have multifaceted conversations with their patients surrounding their medications, systemic health, and oculoplastic surgery.

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^113k8yRZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. Continuation of these agents, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be a particular challenge in the emergency setting.

Methods

A literature review of published articles sourced using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin and surgery was undertaken. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

Results and Conclusion

Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^115HqUkf]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

For decades, aspirin and warfarin have been the predominant antiplatelet and anticoagulant alternatives. Beginning with the introduction of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel in 2002, several more potent oral antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant agents have been approved for use. The increase in the number of therapeutic agents and the population at risk requires that surgeons have an understanding of the risks and benefits of reversing these agents in various settings and an understanding of the most appropriate methods for doing so. In part one of this practice management overview (in the prior issue of the journal), warfarin and the urgent reversal of warfarin-induced coagulopathy were reviewed and an overview of the newer direct oral anticoagulant agents was provided. Part two, contained herein, addresses the management of antiplatelet agents in the surgical setting, followed by general recommendations for the management of anticoagulated patients in the perioperative setting.

### Risk of hemorrhagic complications and secondary surgery in patients on warfarin vs DOACs undergoing glaucoma surgery [^114YueoN]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although warfarin has not been directly compared to DOACs to assess hemorrhagic risks after glaucoma surgery, studies that assessed anticoagulant and antiplatelet use in glaucoma surgery do exist. Law et al specifically compared anticoagulant with antiplatelet therapy in terms of risk of hemorrhagic complications after glaucoma surgery. This study found that both antiplatelet therapies and anticoagulants were associated with increased hemorrhagic risk, but they also determined that patients on anticoagulant therapy preoperatively also had a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications compared to those on antiplatelet therapy. Another finding was that patients on anticoagulant therapy who did not cease therapy prior had the highest risk of developing an adverse bleeding outcome. As Law's paper looked at anticoagulants as a single pharmacological class and confirmed their use to be the highest-risk for bleeding outcomes, our paper stratified anticoagulants based on their unique mechanisms of action and found different rates of hemorrhagic risk within the classes of anticoagulants themselves.

### Oral antithrombotic medication is associated with improved visual outcomes in eyes with submacular hemorrhage from wet age-related macular degeneration [^112F3Ljm]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine differences in visual acuity (VA) outcomes in eyes of patients on antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) that develop submacular hemorrhage (SMH) compared with eyes of patients who are not on antithrombotics and develop SMH.

Design

A retrospective study of patients presenting with fovea-involving SMH due to wet age-related macular degeneration over an 8-year period who had ≥ 6 months of follow-up.

Subjects

Demographics, VA at presentation and final follow-up after SMH management, and history of any antithrombotic therapy were collected. Patients were grouped based on whether they were on anticoagulants (direct oral anticoagulants or warfarin), antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors, aspirin, or both), or neither.

Methods

Multivariate generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

The difference between VA at presentation with SMH and VA at final follow-up was compared between patients taking oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents and those not on any antithrombotic agent.

Results

Seventy-seven eyes of 74 patients were included. Twenty were on oral anticoagulants, 38 were on antiplatelet agents, and 22 were on neither. After controlling for age, sex, post-SMH cataract surgery, time to presentation, treatments received, initial VA, and follow-up duration, patients taking oral anticoagulants had greater improvement in VA at final follow-up compared with patients who were not taking a concurrent antithrombotic agent (P = 0.001); however, patients on oral antiplatelets did not (P = 0.09). After additionally controlling for the initial size and thickness of SMH, patients taking oral anticoagulants and patients taking oral antiplatelets had greater improvement in VA at final follow-up compared with patients who were not taking an antithrombotic (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Patients taking oral anticoagulants who then develop an SMH may have better long-term VA outcomes than those who were not. However, this effect was not seen in patients taking oral antiplatelet medications. This suggests that baseline anticoagulants may be associated with improved VA outcomes in eyes that develop an SMH. When controlling for size and thickness of SMH, patients taking oral anticoagulants and those taking oral antiplatelets had better long-term VA outcomes than those who were not, suggesting a potential mitigating effect of oral antithrombotics.

For patients with intermediate risk, the recommended target of vitamin K antagonism anticoagulation therapy is an INR of 2.5 and for those in the high-risk group an INR of 3.0 is recommended.

Assessing hemorrhagic risk

Remaining on anticoagulation in the periprocedural period must be balanced against the risk of periprocedural hemorrhage. While this can be difficult to quantify, the factors generally taken into account are patient characteristics and the nature of the procedure they are to undergo. Numerous scoring tools have been proposed to quantify patient hemorrhage risk including the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index, the HEMORR2HAGES score, and the HAS-BLED score. The HAS-BLED score is the most commonly employed tool that has been validated to predict bleeding risk during bridging of anticoagulation. The HAS-BLED score assigns a point value to each of the following risk factors: hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, stroke, bleeding history, labile INR, elderly age, and drugs (aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol) and groups patients into low, medium, and high risk of bleeding (see tables 6 and 7).

Table 6
HAS-BLED score to assess bleeding risk

Table 7
Risk of bleeding by HAS-BLED score

These systems can be used to gauge the risk of bleeding when considering recommendations for periprocedural management.

The nature of the procedure should also be considered when assessing bleeding risk. While there is no firm scoring system to quantify this, procedures can generally be grouped into high-risk (2–4%) and low-risk (0–2%) procedures.
High risk: cardiovascular, orthopedic, head and neck cancer or urological in nature, or those > 45 min in length.
Low risk: procedures anticipated to be < 45 min, cutaneous, or relatively straightforward such as a cholecystectomy.

Also to be taken into account are those situations where a small amount of bleeding can have serious consequences, such as ophthalmological procedures, or those where bleeding may not be easily detected.

### Factors related to postoperative vitreous hemorrhage after small-gauge vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients [^1156Juv5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the leading cause of blindness in working-age individuals. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may be required to treat the complications of PDR, such as vitreous hemorrhage (VH) and tractional retinal detachment (TRD), to prevent patients from severe, irreversible vision loss. Postoperative vitreous hemorrhage (POVH) is a common PPV complication and occasionally requires reoperation.

PDR, as a complication of diabetes, is often combined with diabetic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases (CVDs) or chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Systemic diabetic complications may require long-term anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy to prevent thromboembolism. The surgeon often must balance the risk of thromboembolism and the risk of bleeding in the perioperative adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. The perioperative guidelines on the adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in noncardiac surgery show that in acute coronary syndrome, for patients with percutaneous intervention or drug-eluting stents, aspirin is recommended to be continued and clopidogrel should be restarted as soon as possible after surgery; in patients with atrial fibrillation a mechanical heart valve, or venous thromboembolism, warfarin is typically stopped five days before surgery and resumed within 24 h postprocedure in cases of moderate bleeding risk, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy may be considered in the perioperative period; in patients with CKD, heparin is recommended. The LMWH bridging therapy is commonly used in dialysis patients or diabetic CKD patients during the perioperative period. There is no guideline or consensus on the perioperative adjustment of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in diabetic vitrectomy. The consensus regarding ocular surgery recommends that there is no need to stop anticoagulation therapy in only cataract surgery, which is regarded as a procedure with a minimal bleeding risk.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents — evidence and consensus indicate that one nonrandomized comparative observational study is equivocal regarding discontinuing warfarin and replacing it with low-molecular-weight heparin on transfusion requirements (Category B1-E evidence). Observational studies report blood loss volumes ranging from 265 to 756 mL and transfusion requirements ranging from a mean of 0.08 to 0.5 units when clopidogrel is discontinued preoperatively (Category B3 evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate discontinuing aspirin before surgery, with two RCTs versus placebo reporting equivocal findings (P > 0.01) for perioperative blood loss, transfusion, or postoperative adverse events (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state both consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding discontinuing anticoagulation therapy for elective surgery in consultation with a specialist, if clinically possible discontinuing nonsurgical antiplatelet agents sufficiently in advance except in patients with prior percutaneous coronary interventions, and considering thrombosis versus increased bleeding risk when altering anticoagulation status.

### Oral antithrombotic medication is associated with improved visual outcomes in eyes with submacular hemorrhage from wet age-related macular degeneration [^1176EXgK]. Ophthalmology Science (2025). Medium credibility.

There was no significant difference in VA at presentation between patients on an antiplatelet agent at presentation and at final follow-up compared with patients on no antithrombotic (20/800 vs. 20/640 at presentation, P = 0.61; 20/430 vs. 20/750 at final follow-up; P = 0.33, respectively) (Table 2). There was also no significant difference in VA between patients taking an anticoagulant at presentation and at final follow-up compared with patients not taking an antithrombotic agent (20/1180 vs. 20/640 at presentation, P = 0.24; 20/250 vs. 20/750 at final follow-up, P = 0.11, respectively).

After controlling for age, sex, time to presentation to the clinic, duration of follow-up, whether a patient had subsequent cataract surgery after SMH, initial VA, type of intervention for SMH (pneumatic displacement or vitrectomy), and treatment with anti-VEGF after SMH, patients taking oral anticoagulants improved by 0.866 logMAR units, or about 4 lines on the ETDRS chart, more at final follow-up than patients not taking an antithrombotic agent (P = 0.001). In this model, whether a patient had subsequent cataract surgery after SMH, initial VA, and time followed were significant at the 0.05 level, while the other control variables were not (Table 4, column 1). When additionally controlling for size and thickness of SMH, patients taking oral anticoagulants improved by 0.711 logMAR units, or about 3 lines on the ETDRS chart, more at final follow-up than patients not taking an antithrombotic agent (P = 0.002). In this model, SMH size was significant at the 0.05 level, while thickness was not (Table 4, column 2). Full regression outputs for these models are available in Tables S5 and S6 (available at).

Investigation of indications for antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy

The abnormal systemic conditions requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy were identified as CKD, CVD, atrial fibrillation, HTN, and diabetic foot (n = 141). Among the 141 patients requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, 66 patients did not receive any medication due to an unawareness of their abnormal systemic conditions; 13 patients discontinued their treatment after the onset of ocular symptoms; and 34 patients were on aspirin, five on heparin, one on dabigatran, 15 on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel or dabigatran), and seven on combined therapy (Table 1).

Table 1
The use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications in PDR patients at presentation

The reasons for combined therapy were CKD combined with HTN (5/67), CKD combined with CAD and HTN (7/28), CKD combined with stroke and HTN (4/6), CKD combined with CAD and stroke (1/4), CAD (2/30), and CAD with AF (3/4). There were 109 patients with stage 2 or more severe CKD; there were 36 patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy and 5 out of 12 dialysis patients on heparin. There were 66 patients with a diagnosis of CAD. Among them, there were 13 patients on antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy (Fig. 1).

In patients on aspirin monotherapy, aspirin was discontinued for at least one week before surgery in 27 patients (79.4%). Clopidogrel (9/15) was discontinued for at least five days before surgery in patients with CAD treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. In patients with dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin was continued, while dabigatran (1) and clopidogrel (6/15) were discontinued. Warfarin (7/7) was stopped and bridged with low-weight-molecular heparin three days before the operation. In patients on dialysis, heparin (5) was stopped and bridged with LMWH during the perioperative period. There were 22 patients (35.5%) whose antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy was not changed due to systemic abnormalities, and none of them developed POVH.

All anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies were restarted within one week after PPV when the absence of rebleeding in the fundus was confirmed.

### Aspirin and warfarin therapy in oculoplastic surgery [^11248pWg]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

There are no nationally agreed guidelines on preoperative management of patients who are on aspirin or warfarin therapy. There is considerable evidence that complication rates in anticoagulated patients are low whereas there are higher rates of thromboembolic complications in those whose therapy is manipulated. This survey aimed to establish oculoplastic specialist and non-specialist ophthalmic surgeons' current management practice of patients before oculoplastic surgery who are taking aspirin or warfarin and to assess the rate of complications in these patients.

Method

An anonymous postal questionnaire survey of all ophthalmic consultants and specialist registrars in the Wessex region along with oculoplastic specialists in the Southern region.

Results

The overall response rate was 92%. Preoperative management was influenced both by type of operation and by type of surgeon. A statistically significant higher proportion of surgeons would consider altering warfarin compared with aspirin treatment. For all procedures, non-specialists are unlikely to stop aspirin therapy, and are less likely to stop warfarin before all procedures apart from dacrocystorhinostomy. A significant proportion of surgeons (18%) would allow insufficient time for the coagulation status of the patient to change after altering treatment. A considerable proportion of surgeons (54%) reported that they had seen complications as a result either of stopping or continuing anticoagulation therapy.

Conclusions

In this survey, at least half the surgeons questioned would consider stopping warfarin before oculoplastic procedures. Over half of all surgeons have seen complications related to aspirin or warfarin, some of which were serious. A suggested approach to minimising patient risk is given.

### Patterns of antiplatelet therapy during noncardiac surgery in patients with second-generation drug-eluting stents [^111qUXoT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patterns of Perioperative APT

Of the 3582 eligible patients, 1832 (51%) continued APT and 1750 (49%) discontinued APT before NCS (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups are shown in Table 1. Incidence of discontinuing APT widely differs across types of surgery. More patients discontinued APT before certain type of surgeries including gynecology (79%), breast (70%), head and neck (63%), and intra‐abdominal (62%) surgeries; however, only some of the candidates for vascular (15%) or ophthalmologic (27%) surgeries discontinued APT. In women, preoperative use of aspirin monotherapy, β‐blocker, or renin‐angiotensin system inhibitor and surgery with higher cardiac or hemorrhage risk were independently associated with discontinuing APT. Chronic kidney disease, stable angina, high‐risk PCI, and urgent surgery were related to discontinuing APT (Table 1, Table S4). Seventy‐five percent of patients undergoing NCS within 6 months after PCI preoperatively continued APT, while 44% of patients undergoing NCS 12 months after PCI continued APT. Compared with other patterns of perioperative APT, continuing DAPT was associated with higher incidence of risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, anemia, MI, and high‐risk PCI (Table S5). Median time interval between PCI and NCS in patients continuing DAPT (7 months) was much shorter than the other groups (23–27 months; Table S5). Median duration of DAPT was 10.3 months in patients with stable angina and 11.2 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Bridging therapy — For patients with mechanical heart valves who are undergoing minor procedures (eg, dental extractions or cataract removal) where bleeding is easily controlled, continuation of VKA anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR is recommended. For patients with a bileaflet mechanical AVR and no other risk factors for thromboembolism who are undergoing invasive procedures, temporary interruption of VKA anticoagulation, without bridging agents while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended. For patients with a mechanical valve prosthesis receiving VKA therapy who require immediate/ emergency noncardiac surgery or an invasive procedure, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (or its activated form) is reasonable.

### Serious adverse vascular events associated with perioperative interruption of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy [^1155rvja]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Antithrombotic medications may increase perioperative bleeding during cutaneous surgery. Whether to discontinue these medications before surgery is controversial.

Objective

To evaluate the available evidence in order to generate preliminary guidelines regarding the perioperative use of antithrombotics.

Methods

Presentation of two cases of adverse events after preoperative discontinuation of antithrombotics, review of current anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs, and review of the literature concerning perioperative antithrombotics in cutaneous surgery.

Results

Perioperative withholding of antithrombotics in cutaneous surgery may be associated with serious adverse vascular events. Continuing antithrombotics in these circumstances does not appear to significantly increase bleeding complications. The complexity of available antithrombotics makes case-by-case determinations regarding their use difficult.

Conclusion

Cutaneous surgeons should strongly consider perioperative continuation of patients' antithrombotic drugs. The final determination should be made by the surgeon after evaluation of the circumstances and, if necessary, consultation with other experts.

5.7 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks

In the following clinical settings, the risks of COUMADIN therapy may be increased:

Moderate to severe hepatic impairment
Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy)
Use of an indwelling catheter
Severe to moderate hypertension
Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: COUMADIN reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with COUMADIN may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients.
Eye surgery: In cataract surgery, COUMADIN use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As COUMADIN cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue COUMADIN before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^115tRUqj]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is commonly used for the prevention of thrombo-embolic events. Peri-operative management of patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events is a relevant and common clinical problem. In these patients, interrupting anticoagulation might promote embolic events such as cerebral stroke or prosthetic thrombosis. Conversely, peri-operative maintenance of OAC may increase the risk of post-operative bleeding. Kearon and Hirshsuggested the discontinuation of OAC and the initiation of intravenous (i.v.) heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin as a 'bridging' therapy. Other studies have shown little or no increased risk of bleeding with the maintenance of OAC in low-risk procedures such as dental work, arthrocentesis, cataract surgery, upper endoscopy, or colonoscopy. Larson et al.reported that a moderate-intensity anticoagulant therapy with OAC targeting a goal INR 1.5–2.0 appears to be a safe and feasible method for preventing thrombo-embolic complications in these patients.

The use of i.v. heparin that current guidelines recommend in these patientshas been associated with an increased risk of haematoma, and the maintenance of OAC did not increase the rate of pocket haematoma in two previous small series. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the maintenance of OAC during device implantation or replacement is as safe as bridging to i.v. heparin in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events. The primary comparison was the incidence of pocket haematomas and/or thrombo-embolic events during a 45-day period following the procedure. The secondary endpoint was to compare the duration of the hospital stay between both groups.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy [^113pdhqD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, cardiovascular events represent the major cause of morbidity and mortality. A key role in the pathogenesis of these events is played by platelets. Interventional procedures, with placement of coronary and vascular stents, often represent the preferred therapeutic strategy. Antiplatelet medications are considered first-line therapy in preventing cardiovascular thrombotic events. A wide array of antiplatelet agents is available, each with different pharmacological properties. When patients on antiplatelet agents present for surgery, the perioperative team must design an optimal strategy to manage antiplatelet medications. Each patient is stratified according to risk of developing a cardiovascular thrombotic event and inherent risk of surgical bleeding. After risk stratification analysis, various therapeutic pathways include continuing or discontinuing all antiplatelet agents or maintaining one antiplatelet agent and discontinuing the other. This review focuses on the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of both older and novel antiplatelet drugs, and reviews current literature and guidelines addressing options for perioperative antiplatelet management.

Post-procedure resumption of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy — timing and risk categorization are described as variable, ranging from 24 hours to 72 hours for warfarin and 24–48 hours for all the remaining drugs. For warfarin, despite recommendations to avoid the bridging, low molecular heparin may be started after the surgery after 24 hours for low bleed risk and 48–72 hours for high bleed risk procedures. For interventional techniques, similar patterns are utilized using minor surgery as low-risk and major surgery as moderate or intermediate and high-risk.

### Factors related to postoperative vitreous hemorrhage after small-gauge vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients [^113qq7gy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Demographics, including age; gender; preoperative characteristics, including DM duration and DM medication, and the history of diabetes-related complications, including stroke coronary artery disease (CAD), congenital heart failure, diabetic foot and CKD, and HTN; anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications; and ocular characteristics, including the history of previous photocoagulation, cataract phacoemulsification extraction, IV anti-VEGF agents, visual symptom duration, visual acuity (VA), lens status, and the presence of iris neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma, were reviewed from the patients' charts.

All the patients included in our study underwent preoperative anesthetic assessment. Physicians treated each patient with abnormal systemic conditions detected during preoperative screening. After the surgeon and the physician balanced the systemic risk of stopping anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy and the benefit of PPV, the previous therapy was adjusted or left unchanged. The adjustment or maintenance of antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications in the perioperative period was recorded. The surgeon confirmed the restart of previous anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy after PPV based on the post-PPV ocular signs for active bleeding. Adjustments to the renal dialysis plans and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy were recorded. PPV was postponed in patients who had had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, or cerebrovascular event in recent six months, especially those who were using dual antiplatelet therapy or had drug-eluting stent implants.

### Risk factors for severe bleeding complications in glaucoma surgery and the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents [^115tX9Gr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Our aim was to establish a uniform grading system for intraoperative bleeding events and then to apply this grading system to evaluate the influence of various factors such as AP and/ or AC agents only on clinically relevant, severe (grade 3 or higher) bleeding events. As in our parallel study of retinal patients, this grading revealed rather few patients suffering a severe intraoperative hemorrhage. Our ability to statistically claim an increased risk for a severe bleeding event due to AP and/ or AC agents is thus limited. However, to strengthen the evidence of this study's results, a prospective, randomized, blinded (ideally a multicenter) study would be desirable involving a larger study population to account for the few severe bleeding events, and with a blinded bleeding severity grading setup. In such a trial, the individual effect of AP/AC medication and especially novel oral anticoagulative agents and laboratory parameters such as INR or aPTT could be analyzed, as Dayani and coworkers did, as they demonstrated a higher risk of bleeding in patients with higher INR values. In addition, it could then be investigated whether increased conjunctival hyperemia due to the use of pressure-lowering eye drops influences the risk of severe intraoperative bleeding events.

### Factors related to postoperative vitreous hemorrhage after small-gauge vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients [^112qTq5E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our cohort of PDR patients had a high prevalence of CKD, CAD (141/220), and (CVD (141/220). Antiplatelet use is recommended in DM patients to reduce CVD mortality risk. The long-term use of combined antiplatelet or anticoagulation is required in most diabetic patients with CKD or CVD, especially in patients with AF or deep vein thrombosis. Contrary to expectations, 66 out of 141 patients with CKD or CVD were not on proper anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy due to their unawareness of the combined systemic conditions prior to preoperative assessment.

Most patients were instructed to discontinue anticoagulation, antiplatelet medications, or bridging therapy with LMWH before PPV (64.5%). Aspirin monotherapy was discontinued for at least one week (27/34), dual antiplatelet therapy was switched to aspirin monotherapy for at least five days (15/15), and anticoagulation therapy was replaced with warfarin (7), and heparin (5) was bridged with LMWH during the perioperative period. The anticoagulation or antiplatelet plans of twenty-two patients (35.5%) were not changed due to systemic abnormalities. Thirteen patients stopped anticoagulation medication after the onset of ocular symptoms without physician consultation. To reduce the risk of thrombosis, most patients' previous anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications were restarted one to two days after PPV and following post-PPV ocular evaluation of the possibility of active bleeding, according to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for the perioperative management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Our data demonstrated that this practice of altering the systemic therapy in advance of PPV surgery (53) might increase the occurrence of POVH compared to a small sample of patients who continued the previous therapy (22). It should be explored in a further study enrolling a larger sample of PDR patients with adjusted or continued anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

Regression Results

After controlling for age, sex, time to presentation to the clinic, duration of follow-up, whether a patient had subsequent cataract surgery after SMH, initial VA, type of intervention for SMH (pneumatic displacement or vitrectomy), and treatment with anti-VEGF after SMH, patients taking antiplatelet agents improved by an additional 0.426 logMAR units, or about 2 lines on the ETDRS chart, at final follow-up than patients not taking an antithrombotic agent; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). In this model, initial VA was significant at the 0.05 level, while the other control variables were not (Table 4, column 3). When additionally controlling for size and thickness of SMH, patients taking oral antiplatelet agents improved by an additional 0.692 logMAR units, or about 3 lines on the ETDRS chart, at final follow-up than patients not taking an antithrombotic agent (P < 0.001). In this model, SMH size and thickness were significant at the 0.05 level (Table 4, column 3). Full regression outputs for these models are available in Tables S7 and S8 (available at).

### To measure or not to measure direct oral anticoagulants before surgery or invasive procedures [^113Q36mY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may need interruption of treatment before surgery or invasive procedures. Owing to their favorable pharmacokinetics, DOAC could be interrupted for a fixed number of days before surgery or invasive procedures without laboratory testing. However, there are a number of issues that raise concerns about the safety of this strategy. In contrast, laboratory testing prior to surgery or invasive procedures would provide a direct assessment of the residual drug concentration and minimize the risk of bleeding. This forum is aimed at discussing the pros and cons of the two strategies and fostering discussion on this important issue. Overall, the laboratory strategy appears superior in terms of patient safety and should be considered in patients undergoing surgical or invasive procedures.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112iNfpQ]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — bridging therapy during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic heart valves: For patients with mechanical heart valves who are undergoing minor procedures (eg, dental extractions or cataract removal) where bleeding is easily controlled, continuation of VKA anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR is recommended. For patients with a bileaflet mechanical AVR and no other risk factors for thromboembolism who are undergoing invasive procedures, temporary interruption of VKA anticoagulation, without bridging agents while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended. For patients with a mechanical prosthesis receiving VKA therapy who require immediate/ emergency noncardiac surgery or an invasive procedure, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (or its activated form) is reasonable. For patients with bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings who are receiving anticoagulant therapy for AF, it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around the time of invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against the risk of bleeding. For patients who are undergoing invasive procedures and have 1) a mechanical AVR and any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the INR is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis, with the risk of bleeding weighed against the benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

### Periprocedural bleeding and thromboembolic events with dabigatran compared with warfarin: results from the randomized evaluation of long-term anticoagulation therapy (RE-LY) randomized trial [^1118W6K8]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dabigatran reduces ischemic stroke in comparison with warfarin; however, given the lack of antidote, there is concern that it might increase bleeding when surgery or invasive procedures are required.

Methods and Results

The current analysis was undertaken to compare the periprocedural bleeding risk of patients in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial treated with dabigatran and warfarin. Bleeding rates were evaluated from 7 days before until 30 days after invasive procedures, considering only the first procedure for each patient. A total of 4591 patients underwent at least 1 invasive procedure: 24.7% of patients received dabigatran 110 mg, 25.4% received dabigatran 150 mg, and 25.9% received warfarin, P = 0.34. Procedures included: pacemaker/defibrillator insertion (10.3%), dental procedures (10.0%), diagnostic procedures (10.0%), cataract removal (9.3%), colonoscopy (8.6%), and joint replacement (6.2%). Among patients assigned to either dabigatran dose, the last dose of study drug was given 49 (35–85) hours before the procedure on comparison with 114 (87–144) hours in patients receiving warfarin, P < 0.001. There was no significant difference in the rates of periprocedural major bleeding between patients receiving dabigatran 110 mg (3.8%) or dabigatran 150 mg (5.1%) or warfarin (4.6%); dabigatran 110 mg versus warfarin: relative risk, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.17; P = 0.28; dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin: relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.49; P = 0.58. Among patients having urgent surgery, major bleeding occurred in 17.8% with dabigatran 110 mg, 17.7% with dabigatran 150 mg, and 21.6% with warfarin: dabigatran 110 mg; relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.41; P = 0.47; dabigatran 150 mg: relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.35; P = 0.44.

Conclusions

Dabigatran and warfarin were associated with similar rates of periprocedural bleeding, including patients having urgent surgery. Dabigatran facilitated a shorter interruption of oral anticoagulation.

Antiplatelet medications — thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel) pharmacology and perioperative interruption are described as follows: "Thienopyridine derivatives demonstrate both time-dependent and dose-dependent effects. For example, steady state is achieved within 7 days for clopidogrel with doses of 75 mg/day. However, steady state levels of clopidogrel are reached within 2–5 hours with 300–600 mg loading doses". Evidence is limited as "No prospective studies have evaluated perioperative management of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Retrospective studies suggest an increased risk of bleeding with clopidogrel continued perioperatively". Regarding timing, "Labeling of the thienopyridine derivatives recommends that if a patient is not undergoing an elective procedure and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, therapy with clopidogrel should be interrupted "for 5 days prior to surgery" and prasugrel discontinued "at least 7 days prior to any surgery"; and, "Based on expert opinion, the ESAIC/ESRA recommends 5–7 days for clopidogrel and 7 days for prasugrel".

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^114QBnGC]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of PERIXa, the standardized protocol for perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation and resumption, associated with rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 1902 patients with AF who were receiving factor Xa inhibitors and planned to undergo procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, including endoscopy, dental procedures, or ocular surgery, the 30-day postprocedural event rates were 0.1% for major bleeding and 0% for thromboembolism.

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that the standardized perioperative anticoagulation strategy in the PERIXa protocol may be a safe and reasonable option for patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery.

If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. For dual-antiplatelet therapy post stent placement, management depends on the time since stent placement. If the patient is within 12 weeks postcoronary stenting, either delaying elective surgery or continuing both medications is recommended because of the high risk of stent thrombosis. For patients who are more than three months after coronary stent placement, the recommendation is to stop the P2Y. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Evidence-based answer… [^113YCi57]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does preoperative testing before cataract surgery lead to fewer perioperative adverse events. Evidence-Based Answer Routine preoperative testing before cataract surgery does not reduce intraoperative or postoperative complications. Practice Pointers Family physicians commonly provide preoperative examinations and medical clearance before major surgeries. Preoperative medical testing may include screening electrocardiography, chest radiography, complete blood counts, and serum measurements. For a minor surgery such as cataract surgery, it is unclear which specific laboratory or other tests are necessary. The researchers in this Cochrane review identified three randomized controlled trials with a total of 21, 868 patients.

These studies examined rates of intraoperative and postoperative medical adverse events in patients who received routine preoperative medical testing compared with those who did not receive routine testing or those who received selective preoperative testing before cataract surgery. Pooled analysis of these three studies concluded that preoperative medical testing did not reduce the rate of intraoperative or postoperative medical adverse events compared with selective or no testing. No significant differences were reported in the rate or types of intraoperative and postoperative ocular adverse events in the preoperative testing group compared with the selective or no testing groups. There were no differences in postoperative hospitalizations and deaths.

One study also examined testing costs, and it found that those who had routine preoperative medical testing incurred costs 2. 5 times higher than the costs for those who had selective preoperative testing. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends against routine medical tests before cataract surgery, although pre-operative medical tests can be ordered when indicated by findings on a patient's history or physical examination. 1 The American Heart Association recommends against the use of routine testing in asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk procedures such as cataract surgery because the cardiac risk associated with low-risk procedures is generally less than 1 percent. 2.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy… [^114od2Hr]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Among patients taking therapeutic anticoagulation, the competing thrombotic and bleeding risks lead to complex perioperative decision-making. These guidelines1 aim to optimize the perioperative management of antithrombotic medications. The guideline defines surgeries as interventions requiring anesthesia with or without hospitalization, and procedures as minor interventions that do not typically require hospitalization. The perioperative period begins 1 week prior to the intervention and ends 4 weeks later.

Patients at high risk of perioperative thromboembolism have greater than a 10% yearly risk of arterial embolism or greater than a 10% monthly risk of venous thromboembolism; moderate risk is 4% to 10% yearly for arterial embolism or 4% to 10% monthly for VTE; and low risk is less than 4% yearly for arterial embolism and less than 2% monthly for VTE. Bleeding risk is considered high when the intervention is associated with a 2% or greater risk of major bleeding up to 30 days after the intervention, moderate risk implies less than 2% probability, and minimal risk approximates 0%.
