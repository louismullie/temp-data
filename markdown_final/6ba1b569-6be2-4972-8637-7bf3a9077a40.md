## Question

high globulin level on laboratory testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate high globulin levels on laboratory testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing the protein pattern to distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal processes [^117RkPAf] [^117V5GLa]. Then, I should determine the appropriate initial laboratory workup for suspected monoclonal gammopathy and when to extend testing, including urine studies and prognostic markers [^114qKbBM]. Next, I will evaluate common causes and diagnostic clues for polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, including when to measure IgG subclasses, CRP, and organ-specific workups like liver disease and IgG4-related disease [^117V5GLa] [^11543kiZ]. After that, I need to risk stratify monoclonal gammopathies such as MGUS, determine follow-up intervals, and identify red flags suggesting progression to myeloma or amyloidosis, using CRAB and SLIM criteria to decide who needs urgent imaging or therapy [^111LKe6K] [^114T5mNA]. Finally, I should integrate special disease contexts where globulin elevations carry prognostic weight, avoid over-testing by following guidelines, and lay out a succinct longitudinal monitoring strategy with decision points [^116WRy88] [^115CTYvt].

> Let me first confirm and characterize the elevation since laboratory variation and transient changes are common and an initial recheck prevents chasing noise [^114s28h1]. I need to calculate the globulin fraction when only total protein and albumin are reported because Globulin equals Total Protein minus Albumin and to note the albumin to globulin ratio since an A to G ratio below 0.75 has been associated with higher mortality in hemodialysis cohorts, which underscores prognostic implications even if the elevation is polyclonal rather than clonal [^1165dRNr]. Wait, let me verify whether a single elevated value should trigger an extensive workup and I should confirm persistence on repeat testing before proceeding because transient inflammatory states can normalize and mislead [^117V5GLa].

> Next, I should determine whether the pattern is monoclonal or polyclonal on serum protein electrophoresis because this is the pivotal branch point that directs the remainder of the evaluation and management [^114s28h1] [^117V5GLa]. A discrete M protein spike suggests a clonal plasma cell or B cell process such as MGUS, multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or AL amyloidosis, whereas a broad based gamma region elevation supports a polyclonal reactive or inflammatory process such as chronic liver disease, autoimmune conditions, chronic infection, or IgG4 related disease [^117RkPAf] [^111yRc1c] [^117V5GLa]. Hold on, I should verify whether atypical band localization could obscure quantitation and if the M protein lies outside the gamma region I should use total immunoglobulin quantitation or careful densitometric approaches to avoid misclassification [^113FSrZ1].

> For suspected monoclonal gammopathy, I need to order the recommended initial panel of tests because missing serum free light chain abnormalities or small M proteins delays critical diagnoses and alters downstream testing [^114s28h1]. Let me obtain serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains with kappa to lambda ratio, and serum immunofixation as the core triad since this combination maximizes sensitivity for M protein detection and characterization in line with AACC and CAP guidance [^117RkPAf] [^115vqgry]. I should add urine immunofixation when AL amyloidosis is suspected and include quantitative immunoglobulins plus baseline tumor burden markers such as beta 2 microglobulin, LDH, and albumin if the initial workup is abnormal to support staging and prognosis [^114s28h1] [^114qKbBM]. Wait, I need to ensure I do not over interpret a slightly abnormal free light chain ratio in renal impairment or polyclonal inflammation, so I will double check renal function and the electrophoretic pattern because renal reference intervals and clinical context are crucial for avoiding false positives [^116oz8hL].

> When the pattern is polyclonal, I should categorize likely causes and pursue targeted evaluation rather than shotgun testing because an organized approach reduces unnecessary investigations while catching serious disease [^117V5GLa]. I will now examine common groups including liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infections and chronic inflammation, non hematologic malignancy, hematologic disorders such as Castleman disease, IgG4 related disease, immunodeficiencies, and iatrogenic causes like IVIG because these clusters cover the vast majority of etiologies [^117V5GLa]. Let me consider simple but powerful clues such as a CRP of 30 mg per L or higher suggesting an IL 6 driven process and markedly elevated IgG4 above 5 g per L being about 90 percent specific for IgG4 related disease, while remembering that mild IgG4 elevations are nonspecific and that ethnic variation in IgG4 levels exists [^117V5GLa] [^115a7cbj]. Hold on, I should verify liver specific differentials because primary sclerosing cholangitis warrants measurement of serum IgG4 to exclude IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis per AASLD guidance, and autoimmune hepatitis typically features hypergammaglobulinemia with autoantibodies but can be mimicked by drug induced AIH like phenotypes or even Wilson disease in outlier cases [^11543kiZ] [^115dPZN5] [^112Jt3b6] [^111epN6p].

> I need to risk stratify monoclonal gammopathies with validated models because this dictates whether to defer invasive testing, to monitor more closely, or to escalate evaluation with marrow and imaging [^111LKe6K]. Low risk MGUS defined by IgG subtype, M protein below 15 g per L, and a normal free light chain ratio can defer bone marrow biopsy and advanced imaging and can be followed with periodic labs at defined intervals, whereas intermediate or high risk MGUS with higher M protein, non IgG subtype, or abnormal free light chain ratio deserves hematology referral, marrow evaluation, and appropriate whole body imaging [^111LKe6K] [^115CTYvt]. Wait, let me verify progression risk to multiple myeloma because that shapes patient counseling and the risk is about 0.5 to 1 percent per year on average which supports a watchful waiting approach in most MGUS patients [^111LKe6K]. Next, I should review smoldering myeloma workup because adding beta 2 microglobulin, LDH, and albumin helps prognostication and may influence surveillance intensity [^114pE2qq].

> I will now assess for myeloma defining events and end organ damage to determine urgency of therapy using CRAB criteria and SLIM biomarkers because early identification of treatment requiring disease is essential to prevent irreversible organ injury [^114T5mNA]. CRAB includes hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions, while SLIM allows treatment before CRAB when bone marrow plasma cells exceed 60 percent or the involved to uninvolved free light chain ratio exceeds 100 or MRI shows more than one focal lesion above 5 mm which the European Myeloma Network and BSH endorse in diagnostic pathways [^114T5mNA] [^114qKbBM]. I should confirm that suspected AL amyloidosis triggers targeted organ assessment including urine albumin to creatinine ratio, troponin, and NT proBNP along with careful symptom review because missing cardiac or renal involvement can be catastrophic yet sometimes subtle early on [^115gmYMB] [^114s28h1].

> Let me consider specific disease contexts where the globulin fraction adds prognostic or diagnostic value, while recognizing evidence quality and avoiding over generalization [^117V5GLa]. In inflammatory bowel disease, an elevated globulin fraction greater than 4 g per dL has been associated with higher CRP, anemia, increased hospitalizations, higher healthcare utilization, and in Crohn disease a higher surgery risk over multiyear follow up, although these are observational data and should augment but not replace disease activity indices [^116WRy88] [^1124tNmb] [^112umwuW]. For IgG4 related disease, the electrophoresis often shows a polyclonal pattern with beta gamma bridging and serum IgG4 above 5 g per L is highly specific, but I should double check by combining serology with histology and characteristic imaging to avoid misdiagnosing MGUS or myeloma, which has happened when dense polyclonal IgG4 bands are misread as biclonal gammopathy [^117V5GLa] [^1114vrLW] [^115a7cbj]. For hepatic disorders, I should screen for autoimmune hepatitis with hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies, exclude IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis in possible PSC by measuring serum IgG4, and remember that Wilson disease can mimic AIH in rare cases requiring copper studies for resolution of diagnostic uncertainty [^115dPZN5] [^11543kiZ] [^111epN6p].

> I need to check infectious and systemic inflammatory mimics because some will drive prominent polyclonal elevations and require specific therapy rather than hematology pathways [^117V5GLa]. Mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with hepatitis C is a classic example in which globulin abnormalities accompany vasculitic manifestations and the diagnostic yield depends on strict preanalytical handling to prevent false negatives, so I should order cryoglobulin testing only with appropriate temperature controls and in the right clinical context [^114rQPmB] [^111cNDTB]. But wait, what if there is hyperviscosity symptoms in a polyclonal setting, I should remember that rare IL 6 driven states and IgG4 related disease can cause polyclonal hyperviscosity requiring plasmapheresis while the definitive treatment still targets the driver disease [^117V5GLa].

> On management principles, if the elevation is polyclonal, I should treat the underlying condition and monitor the globulin fraction or immunoglobulin levels as supportive disease activity markers because they usually improve with control of the primary process and they rarely require direct interventions beyond managing hyperviscosity in select cases [^117V5GLa]. If the pattern is monoclonal, I should arrange hematology referral for all but clearly low risk MGUS and adopt risk adapted surveillance, with expedited evaluation for any new anemia, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia, bone pain, or rising paraprotein or free light chain levels which may herald progression [^115CTYvt] [^116bkfsy] [^111LKe6K]. Let me verify that amyloidosis specific screening steps are considered when clinical features suggest organ involvement, since early recognition changes outcomes and workup should include urine albumin to creatinine ratio and cardiac biomarkers as an initial screen before tissue confirmation [^115gmYMB].

> I should avoid over testing by following guideline concordant triggers for M protein evaluation and by using decision support to improve test ordering compliance, even though there is an ongoing debate about population screening for MG which is not guideline supported at present [^1119c5Y2] [^115UdofE]. At first, I thought that general screening might be justified because earlier detection could prevent late myeloma presentations, but hold on, I should verify the current consensus which is that routine MGUS screening is not recommended and testing should be reserved for when malignant disease or MGCS is suspected per BSH and JAMA guidance [^111ZzrJ9] [^111LKe6K]. I need to ensure that my initial laboratory panel includes serum free light chains with SPEP and reflex to serum immunofixation as indicated, and I can often avoid 24 hour urine testing because serum free light chains provide higher sensitivity in many scenarios while recognizing that specific cases may still benefit from urine studies and that renal dysfunction can shift reference intervals [^117RkPAf] [^115fREST] [^116oz8hL].

> For long term surveillance, if MGUS is diagnosed, I should recheck CBC, creatinine, calcium, paraprotein, and free light chains at six months and then annually in low risk MGUS, with shorter three to six month intervals for intermediate or high risk disease, and I should consider extending intervals or de intensifying in those with limited life expectancy [^115CTYvt]. I should double check formal risk reassessment every three years for high intermediate or high risk MGUS and maintain a low threshold for imaging or marrow if new CRAB features or significant biomarker changes develop during follow up [^113DeVzE] [^115CTYvt]. If the elevation is polyclonal without a defined driver, I will monitor every three to six months initially and prioritize trend analysis over single values, escalating targeted evaluations as clinical features emerge [^117V5GLa].

> Let me reconsider common pitfalls and analytic interferences so I do not misclassify patterns or over call clonal disease in inflammatory or renal settings because these are frequent sources of error in real practice [^116oz8hL]. I should verify renal function when interpreting the free light chain ratio since mild elevations up to approximately 3.1 can occur with reduced clearance or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and do not necessarily imply a monoclonal process, and I should be cautious with atypical electrophoretic patterns such as IgG4 beta gamma bridging that can mimic biclonality on casual review and therefore require immunofixation correlation and clinical context [^116oz8hL] [^1114vrLW] [^114s28h1]. Hold on, I should also remember that A to G ratio extremes may carry independent prognostic associations in certain populations like incident hemodialysis patients and thus deserve documentation even when the cause is clear [^1165dRNr].

> In summary, my algorithm is to confirm the elevation, classify the electrophoretic pattern as monoclonal or polyclonal, complete a guideline based initial panel with SPEP, serum free light chains, and immunofixation when clonal disease is suspected, pursue targeted evaluation of common polyclonal causes including liver, autoimmune, infectious, and IgG4 related etiologies, assess for myeloma defining events and amyloidosis when monoclonal disease is present, apply risk stratification to guide referral and surveillance, avoid indiscriminate screening while leveraging decision support to optimize test ordering, and monitor longitudinal trends with clearly defined escalation triggers [^114s28h1] [^117V5GLa] [^111LKe6K] [^1119c5Y2] [^115CTYvt].

Elevated globulin on lab testing most often reflects **increased immunoglobulin production** [^117V5GLa] from chronic inflammation, infection, or immune dysregulation [^117V5GLa], and can signal **monoclonal gammopathies** such as MGUS [^111LKe6K], multiple myeloma [^114qKbBM], or Waldenström macroglobulinemia [^111yRc1c]. It may also indicate polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia [^117V5GLa] from autoimmune or chronic liver disease, or rarer causes like IgG4-related disease [^1114vrLW]. Initial evaluation should include **SPEP, sFLC, and immunofixation** to distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal patterns, with further workup guided by clinical context and organ involvement (SPEP [^117RkPAf], sFLC [^115fREST], immunofixation [^114s28h1]). Management targets the underlying cause, with regular monitoring for progression in monoclonal disorders [^111LKe6K] and supportive care for complications such as hyperviscosity or renal impairment [^114qKbBM].

## Laboratory evaluation

Upon detection of elevated globulin levels, a **systematic laboratory evaluation is essential**:

- **Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)**: Differentiates monoclonal from polyclonal gammopathies [^117RkPAf].
- **Serum free light chain (sFLC) assay**: Detects monoclonal light chains, particularly in light-chain myeloma [^114s28h1] [^115fREST].
- **Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)**: Confirms and characterizes monoclonal proteins [^116bkfsy] [^114s28h1].
- **Complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests, calcium levels**: Assess organ involvement and complications [^114qKbBM].
- **Immunoglobulin quantification (IgG, IgA, IgM)**: Determines specific immunoglobulin elevations [^113FSrZ1].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Elevated globulin levels carry **significant clinical implications**:

- **Monoclonal gammopathies**: Risk of progression to malignancy (e.g. multiple myeloma) [^111LKe6K] or organ damage (e.g. AL amyloidosis) [^114s28h1].
- **Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia**: Indicates chronic inflammation, autoimmune disease, or chronic infection, necessitating further evaluation and management [^117V5GLa].
- **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Elevated globulin levels can cause hyperviscosity [^1114vrLW], leading to neurological, visual, and bleeding complications.

---

## Management strategies

Management **depends on the underlying cause**:

- **Monoclonal gammopathies**: Regular monitoring [^111LKe6K], risk stratification, and treatment initiation if progression occurs [^115CTYvt].
- **Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia**: Treat underlying inflammatory, autoimmune, or infectious conditions [^117V5GLa].
- **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Plasmapheresis and treatment of the underlying condition [^1114vrLW].

---

Elevated globulin levels indicate increased **immunoglobulin production** from chronic inflammation, infection, or immune dysregulation, and can signal **monoclonal gammopathies**. Evaluation includes SPEP, sFLC, and immunofixation [^117RkPAf], with management focused on the underlying cause and monitoring for complications.

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia: Assessment, clinical interpretation, and management [^117V5GLa]. The Lancet Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

This review outlines a practical approach to assessing and managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in adults. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia is most commonly caused by liver disease, immune dysregulation, or inflammation but can also provide an important diagnostic clue for rare diseases such as histiocyte disorders, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Castleman disease, and IgG4-related disease.

Causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can be divided into eight categories: liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infection and inflammation, non-haematological malignancy, haematological disorders, IgG4-related disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and iatrogenic causes (from immunoglobulin therapy). Measuring serum concentrations of C-reactive protein and IgG subclasses are helpful in diagnosis. IL-6-mediated inflammation, associated with persistently elevated C-reactive protein concentrations (≥ 30 mg/L), is an important driver of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in some cases. Although the presence of markedly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations (> 5 g/L) is around 90% specific for diagnosing IgG4-related disease, mildly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations are seen in many conditions.

In most cases, managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia simply involves treating the underlying condition. Rarely, however, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can lead to hyperviscosity, requiring plasmapheresis.

It does not meet the criteria for any other small B-cell lymphoid neoplasm that may also exhibit plasmacytic differentiation.

- **Waldenström macroglobulinemia**: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with bone marrow involvement and IgM monoclonal gammopathy of any concentration.

### Diagnosis and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: A review [^111LKe6K]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nearly 5% of adults have the precursor malignant condition, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Management centers on differentiating MGUS from more serious conditions to determine additional diagnostic testing, monitoring, and potential therapy.

- **Observations**: MGUS is defined by the absence of end-organ damage or symptoms, a small amount of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein), and low volume of plasma cells. MGUS must be distinguished from overt malignant diseases like multiple myeloma (MM), immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, and monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), all of which cause organ damage or symptoms. Although testing for M proteins is often prompted by clinical findings (e.g. osteoporosis or autoimmune disease), recent evidence from screened populations suggests that previous MGUS disease associations were likely overestimated and that testing for M proteins should be reserved for when malignant disease or MGCS is suspected. The risk of progression to malignant disease ranges from 0.5% to 1%, meaning most patients have indolent disease.

- **Guideline-concordant management**: Management of MGUS is determined by the predicted risk of progression to malignant disease, which depends on the subtype of immunoglobulin, M protein concentration, and free light chain ratio. Patients with low-risk MGUS can safely defer bone marrow biopsy and advanced imaging and should undergo periodic laboratory monitoring. Intermediate- and high-risk MGUS should trigger bone marrow biopsy and bone imaging to detect overt MM and require shorter monitoring intervals.

### Cushing's syndrome [^113g5kvz]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

During the past 30 years, there have been advances in understanding the pathogenesis of Cushing's syndrome and in the differential diagnosis of its various forms. Improved diagnostic tests and procedures have increased the ability to recognize even mild hypercortisolism and have provided the means to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Despite these advances, the occurrence of unusual clinical presentations and laboratory shortcomings may produce diagnostic problems and challenge clinical intuition. This article reviews recent pathogenic views, new tests, and new diagnostic problems in the evaluation of Cushing's syndrome. Atypical clinical presentations of hypercortisolism and some laboratory shortcomings that may confuse the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome are also reported.

### Serum monomeric α2-macroglobulin as a clinical biomarker in diabetes [^112rsFzD]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the number of potential biomarker proteins for diabetes, very few have proven useful as clinically beneficial indicators because of the technical difficulties associated with their identification among highly abundant serum proteins. We attempted to identify a protein with distinguishable expression in human diabetes.

- **Methods**: We applied a highly efficient strategy for the purification of endogenous low abundance proteins from diabetic and non-diabetic serum samples. Extracted sera were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry using an ion-trap mass spectrometer. The identities of the proteins were confirmed by western blotting, and the serum levels were evaluated.

- **Results**: A significantly upregulated protein in diabetic patients was identified as monomeric α2-macroglobulin. Its tetramer, another dominant circulating molecular form, was only marginally increased in diabetes.

- **Conclusion**: Serum monomeric α2-macroglobulin is highly expressed in many diabetic subjects. It is identical to the human 'cardiac isoform of α2-macroglobulin' described in the literature, a well-known acute phase serum biomarker protein mechanistically involved in cardiac and atherosclerotic diseases.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^115UdofE]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is a frequently detected clonal B-cell or plasma-cell disorder. Importantly, every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by MG. Although clinical algorithms now allow earlier treatment of patients with biomarkers of malignancy before MM-induced tissue damage (CRAB) occurs, most patients are still diagnosed late. It is important to revisit how MG should be managed in clinical practice and whether screening is required. As the prevalence of MG and other medical co-morbidities both rise with increasing age, the degree of contribution of MG to disease states other than malignant progression is often unclear. This can lead to monitoring lapses and under recognition of the organ dysfunction that can occur with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Therefore, models of progression to MM and/or MGCS require further refinement.

While MG is currently detected incidentally, a case for screening has been made with ongoing studies in this area. Screening has the potential benefit of earlier detection and prevention of both MGCS and delayed MM presentations, but important drawbacks include the psychosocial impact on individuals and resource burden on healthcare services. MG terminology should transition alongside our increasing understanding of the condition and genomic characterization that have already begun to revise the MG nomenclature. The biology of MG has been poorly understood and is often inferred from the biology of MM, which is unhelpful. We review the literature and case for MG screening in this paper. In particular, we highlight a

The availability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing has rapidly increased. Assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations, and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

- **Objective**: IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development, and the selection of convalescent plasma donors.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

### IgG4-related disease: What a hematologist needs to know [^1114vrLW]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) represents an important new diagnostic consideration in patients with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. An elevated serum IgG4 level, often accompanied by an increase in IgG1, causes polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Rarely, this elevation can be sufficient to result in polyclonal hyperviscosity syndrome. It is not known what causes the exuberant production of IgG4 immunoglobulins, currently considered an epiphenomenon rather than a contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease. Not surprisingly, the serum free light chains tend to be abnormally elevated. IgE is often markedly increased, particularly in patients with eosinophilia and atopy, whereas IgA and IgM levels are normal or modestly elevated.

Serum IgG4 typically runs in the fast gamma or beta-gamma region on the serum protein electrophoresis, and thus the typical electrophoretic profile of a patient with IgG4-RD demonstrates polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with beta-gamma bridging. This sometimes prominent pattern is dependent on IgG4 concentration and is highlighted in Figure 3. The hypergammaglobulinemia can be mistaken for a polyclonal increase in IgA, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or "biclonal" IgG kappa and lambda gammopathy, as laboratory physicians may not be familiar with the dense bands of IgG-lambda and kappa which in fact represent polyclonal IgG4. Some patients have even been treated for myeloma before subsequently being found to have IgG4-RD as the cause of their protein abnormalities, plasmacytosis, and renal disease.

Similar to those with autoimmune hepatitis, IBD patients have a dysregulated immune system, involving both innate and adaptive immune function. Several studies have investigated levels of immunoglobulins and their subtypes in patients with IBD. A recent study demonstrated a relationship between immunoglobulins and IBD-related surgeries, though these findings were derived from IgG subtype profiles and not the total globulin fraction.

Data investigating the clinical implications of an elevated globulin fraction in patients with IBD are limited. Given the availability of total globulin fraction in routine laboratory evaluations, we explored its potential role. We hypothesized that an elevated globulin fraction might serve as a biomarker of disease severity and healthcare utilization in IBD patients followed over a multiyear period.

### Salmonella colitis as an unusual cause of elevated serum lipase [^117DZ3TJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Authors and clinicians advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. While acute pancreatitis is among the differential diagnoses for elevated lipase levels, several other causes have been identified, including several reports of Salmonella species as a causative agent. Retrospective studies have reported clinical pancreatitis associated with Salmonella infection, concluding that clinical pancreatitis should be considered a complication of Salmonella infections. However, Salmonella infections may induce elevated pancreatic enzyme levels without clinical pancreatitis or morphological pancreatic abnormalities through a variety of proposed mechanisms.

The following is a case that describes a patient who developed Salmonella colitis and demonstrated elevated serum lipase levels without clinical pancreatitis.

### Calculated globulin (CG) as a screening test for antibody deficiency [^113TkWKo]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Some laboratories could choose to cascade directly upon the discovery of a low CG, adding immunoglobulins and serum electrophoresis (SEP) as deemed appropriate. However, this may be hampered by the frequent lack of clinical data on the request form, placing the requesting clinician in the best position to make an informed decision, potentially also limiting costs. With increasing pressure on health resources, the removal of total protein has been advocated on cost grounds. As part of the process of test profile harmonization and demand management, it has been suggested that its inclusion remains more as an opportunistic screening test for monoclonal gammopathy; however, no specific intervention exists other than watchful waiting.

Data from the study argue that the range of disorders for which additional information is gained is wider than monoclonal gammopathy. In particular, when defined cut-offs are in place, there are clear treatment advances for multiple myeloma. Clinically important monoclonal bands are detected with a low CG, fulfilling screening criteria for both primary and secondary antibody deficiency. Additionally, testing costs must be evaluated in the context of the complete patient pathway, the utility losses associated with delay in diagnosis of patients, the benefits associated with accurate immunological testing, and the potentially increased use of health resources if the test is not performed. Where the test is already being performed, it would seem reasonable to obtain the best value for money by educating users regarding its use at both ends of the referral process.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^1154FDkr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

There were 1,767 IBD patients with four years of clinical follow-up who had an assessment of serum globulin, forming the study population. The median number of times a globulin fraction was checked per patient was seven (IQR 3–14). Amongst these IBD patients, the majority were female (53.5%), with a mean age of 48.4 ± 15.1 years. Over half of the participants (65.4%) had CD, while 34.5% had UC. Among the study participants, 446 (25.2%) had an elevated globulin fraction at the start of the defined study time period, forming the high (i.e. elevated) globulin fraction group, while the remaining patients comprised the normal globulin fraction group.

- **High globulin fraction group**: IBD patients in the high globulin fraction group were more likely to be female (P = 0.004) and to have undergone prior IBD-related surgery (P < 0.001). At the time of the initial test, there was no difference in disease duration between patients with a high globulin fraction and those with a normal globulin fraction. Regarding other biomarkers of disease activity checked on the initial visit, patients with a high globulin fraction had significantly higher CRP, ESR, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia than those without globulin elevation.

The EASL 2025 guidelines recommend establishing a differential diagnosis between drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis and classic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This can be achieved by evaluating treatment response and disease course. Viewing resolution after withdrawal of the implicated agent, with or without a short course of corticosteroids, and no relapse in the long term, possibly indicates drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis rather than classic AIH.

### Developing and updating differential diagnosis tables in emergency medicine for potentially life-threatening diseases [^11374uWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

No study has verified whether the published differential diagnosis tables cover all potentially life-threatening diseases observed in real-world clinical practice and updated the tables using real-world data.

- **Objectives**: To create initial differential diagnosis tables based on published resources and to validate and update the tables using the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) database as a real-world reference. We created the initial differential diagnosis tables using published textbooks, UpToDate®, BMJ Best Practice, and databases such as the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Google Scholar without language restrictions from their inception to September 22, 2022. Then, we extracted chief complaints and diagnosis lists from the NHAMCS database of emergency patients aged ≥ 16 years between November 2016 and 2019. Finally, we compared the diagnosis lists from the NAMCS database and the initial tables to cover all potentially life-threatening diseases.

- **Results**: We created the initial tables for 78 chief complaints and 2,054 differential diagnoses (with 554 diagnoses in the red category and 1,500 in the yellow category, respectively). Additionally, we created 71 chief complaints and 1,468 differential diagnoses from the NHAMCS database. We found 114 potentially life-threatening diseases associated with 39 chief complaints not covered by the initial tables. Finally, the initial tables were updated to include 78 chief complaints and 2,168 differential diagnoses.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^112tz9cv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

We conducted an additional analysis to determine the rates of comorbidities associated with the difference in serum globulins between the elevated globulin and normal globulin inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient cohorts. We analyzed referral patterns to specialist clinics in hepatology, hematology/oncology, and rheumatology. Additionally, we analyzed rates of specific conditions, including liver cirrhosis, hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, monoclonal gammopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome, between the two IBD patient groups. Comorbidities associated with an elevated globulin fraction were more common in the IBD cohort with an elevated globulin fraction. However, more granular analysis suggested that these comorbidities occurred in small subgroups of the elevated globulin IBD patients and did not account for the majority of these patients. Specific diagnoses, such as monoclonal gammopathy, were rare (1 individual), and rheumatologic processes were found in 5% of these IBD patients with elevated globulin fraction. The IBD elevated globulin fraction patients were overall sicker, with higher rates of anemia and liver conditions associated with elevated globulin fraction. Thus, our analysis demonstrates that an elevated globulin fraction continues to be a biomarker of clinical severity in IBD, reflecting the impact of both the underlying disease and possible comorbidities.

### Guidelines for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika [^1133pgtw]. PAHO (2022). High credibility.

The PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines provide comprehensive screening and diagnosis recommendations for arbovirus infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Recognizing the clinical manifestations of these infections is crucial for their differential diagnosis.

- **Dengue**:
	- **Findings that help in differentiation**: thrombocytopenia, progressive increase in hematocrit, leukopenia.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: anorexia or hyporexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills, hemorrhages, including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: retro-ocular pain, hepatomegaly, headache, diarrhea, dysgeusia, cough, elevated transaminases, positive tourniquet test.

- **Chikungunya**:
	- **Findings that help in differentiation**: arthralgias.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: eruption, conjunctivitis, arthritis, myalgias, bone pain.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: hemorrhages, including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both.

- **Zika**:
	- **Findings that help in differentiation**: pruritus.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: eruption, conjunctivitis.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: lymphadenopathies, pharyngitis, odynophagia.

### Calculated globulin (CG) as a screening test for antibody deficiency [^1141iLNz]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Calculated globulin, determined by subtracting albumin from total protein, is typically assessed as part of a liver function test profile in both primary and secondary care settings to determine serum globulin concentration, of which immunoglobulins are a major component. Traditionally, calculated globulin has been used to detect paraproteins when levels are elevated. This study explored the possibility of utilizing low levels of calculated globulin to identify antibody deficiency.

Serum samples with a calculated globulin cut-off of less than 18 g/L, based on results from a pilot study, were collected from nine hospitals in Wales over a 12-month period. Anonymized request information was obtained, and the samples were tested for immunoglobulin levels, serum electrophoresis, and, if appropriate, immunofixation. A method comparison for albumin measurement using bromocresol green and bromocresol purple was conducted.

Eighty-nine percent (737 of 826) of the samples had an immunoglobulin G (IgG) level of less than 6 g/L when tested with the bromocresol green methodology with a cut-off of less than 18 g/L, and 56% (459) had an IgG of less than 4 g/L. Patients with both secondary and primary antibody deficiencies were identified, and serum electrophoresis and immunofixation revealed that 1.2% (10) had previously undetected small paraproteins associated with immune-paresis. Utilizing bromocresol purple, 74% of samples showed an IgG of less than 6 g/L with a cut-off of less than 23 g/L.

Screening using calculated globulin with defined cut-off values is effective in detecting both primary and secondary antibody deficiency, as well as new paraproteins associated with immune-paresis. This test is cost-effective, widely available, and under-utilized in current medical practice.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^114T5mNA]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies is based on clinical, biological, and radiological criteria but remains challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients.

The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria (bone marrow [BM] infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain [SFLC] ratio > 100, or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and care of patients.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The discrimination between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma is based on:
	- Plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow
	- Presence of clinical symptoms

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^116WRy88]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Biochemical inflammatory markers included high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We evaluated annual dichotomous patterns (any elevated value vs. all normal values during a calendar year) of biochemical inflammatory markers (CRP ≥ 0.74 mg/dL; ESR > 20 mm/h per UPMC laboratory standards). Index visit laboratory data were eligible for inclusion if obtained within 1 month of the index visit.

Healthcare utilization measures included the total number of outpatient clinic visits, total count of telephone encounters, number of radiographic studies, and number of endoscopic procedures. As for emergency department (ED) use, IBD-related hospital admissions, and IBD-related surgery, these were treated as binary (yes/no) variables.

IBD medication exposure was determined by annual prescriptions in the electronic medical record. We collected data on exposures to immunomodulators, biologics, steroids, and 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds. Immunomodulator agents included azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate. Steroid prescriptions included systemic prednisone and excluded other systemic glucocorticoids to avoid prescriptions indicated for adrenal insufficiency. We also included enteric steroids (oral budesonide and per rectum corticosteroid preparations). Biologics included anti-tumor necrosis factor medications (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol). Finally, 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds included sulfasalazine, mesalamine, balsalazide, either oral or topical. Use of oral vancomycin was also collected as a proxy for Clostridioides difficile infection treatment.

### Dent disease: Clinical practice recommendations [^111LqJEm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

Due to the variability in presentation, the differential diagnosis for Dent disease (DD) is extremely broad. We therefore recommend genetic testing as the gold standard in each case suspected of DD. Once low-molecular-weight proteinuria has been established, the differential diagnosis mainly includes other causes of proximal tubular dysfunction, both genetic and acquired.

Variable degrees of proximal tubular dysfunction, including phosphate, bicarbonate, and amino acid wasting, can be observed; however, patients rarely present a complete renal Fanconi syndrome. In particular, glucosuria is absent in most cases or only mild.

- **Differential diagnosis of proximal renal tubular dysfunction**:
	- Genetic and acquired etiologies contribute to proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Genetic testing facilitates a definitive diagnosis of DD.

### Hypergammaglobulinemia, normal serum albumin and hypercalcaemia: a case of systemic sarcoidosis with initial diagnostic confusion [^111Hijej]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman presented to casualty with a constellation of symptoms pointing to a diagnosis of hypercalcaemia, which was confirmed on laboratory investigation. Findings of a raised serum protein (108 g/l) and normal albumin (35 g/l) led to an initial working diagnosis of multiple myeloma. However, later serum protein electrophoresis found a polyclonal gammopathy, and further investigation led to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient responded well to conventional treatment with oral prednisolone.

A number of learning points have been highlighted, including the pitfalls of pattern recognition in diagnosis and the various manifestations of systemic sarcoidosis. A brief review of the history and various manifestations of sarcoidosis is presented, including the pathophysiology of hypercalcaemia in sarcoidosis, as well as polyclonal gammopathy.

### Elevated serum IgG4 levels in diagnosis, treatment response, organ involvement, and relapse in a prospective IgG4-related disease UK cohort [^113ivodx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) for over a decade. However, an elevated serum IgG4 is not specific for the disease. There have been inconsistent reports of its use in diagnosis, as a marker of disease relapse, and its relationship to organ involvement in retrospective cohorts. The aims of this study were to ascertain conditions that are associated with an elevated serum IgG4 and to investigate the role of IgG4 in diagnosis, relapse, and organ involvement in a prospective cohort of patients with IgG4-RD.

- **Methods**: We evaluated serum IgG4 measurements in the Oxford Immunology Laboratory over six years. Patients in whom serum IgG4 was requested to differentiate IgG4-RD from other diseases were recruited into a longitudinal follow-up study to determine final diagnosis. In a prospective cohort of IgG4-RD patients, organ involvement, response to therapy, and disease relapse were determined.

- **Results**: Two thousand and sixty-seven samples from 1,510 patients had serum IgG4 measured. Of these, IgG4 was elevated (≥ 1.4 g/l) in 243 (16.1%) patients. The main indication (85.6%) was to distinguish between IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD conditions. Only 5.1% of patients who had serum IgG4 measured for this purpose had a final diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Of those with an elevated serum IgG4, 22.4% met IgG4-RD diagnostic criteria. Serum IgG4 was elevated in 48 (82.8%) of IgG4-RD patients. An IgG4 cutoff of 1.4 g/l gave a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 84.7% to diagnose IgG4-RD.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^116jBpqH]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy: is it harmful enough to warrant screening?

The mechanisms by which different types of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) cause organ dysfunction and morbidity are incompletely understood. Although MG can lead to malignant transformation and paraprotein-mediated tissue damage, it has also been repeatedly associated with increased occurrence of other diagnoses, known as monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). The biological explanation for MGCS is even less well understood; it is possible that the mechanisms leading to cancerous and non-cancerous consequences overlap.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^112umwuW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In our study, after controlling for confounding factors, including hypoalbuminemia, increased globulin fraction remained an important, independent predictor of increased hospitalization for CD and UC patients, as well as IBD-related surgery for CD patients. This routinely available, low-cost laboratory test is a well-recognized biomarker in autoimmune liver diseases, as well as other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, but has not yet become the focus of dedicated investigation in IBD. More recently, several studies have characterized immunoglobulin levels in patients with IBD. Elevated immunoglobulin levels have been reported in conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that increased immune reactivity and B-cell dysregulation play an important part in the pathogenesis of IBD. A recent study by Wang et al. suggested that circulating memory B-cells and plasmablasts are associated with the level of immunoglobulins and disease activity in UC patients. Our findings are further strengthened by Shiraishi et al, who demonstrated a similar clinical signal in 277 UC patients, where an elevated globulin fraction was associated with lower rates of mucosal healing.

There are several important limitations to this proof-of-concept study that aims to show that globulin fraction can be used as a biomarker of disease activity in IBD patients. This was an observational study that was carried out at a tertiary referral center, whose patients may not be reflective of the IBD patients followed in the general population.

### Association of serum globulin with all-cause mortality in incident hemodialysis patients [^1165dRNr]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Serum globulin is a major component of total protein and can be elevated in inflammatory disease states. While inflammation is common in hemodialysis patients and associated with mortality and morbidity, the association between serum globulin and mortality has never been examined in hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective cohort of 104,164 incident hemodialysis patients treated by a large dialysis organization from 2007 to 2011, we explored the association between baseline serum globulin, albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, and serum protein levels with all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality. Adjustments for demographic variables and laboratory markers of malnutrition and inflammation were made using Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results**: Patients with a globulin concentration > 3.8 g/dL had a higher all-cause and infection-related mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.16 and HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.51, respectively] in the fully adjusted model when compared with the reference group of 3.0- < 3.2 g/dL. Additionally, patients with an A:G ratio < 0.75 had a 45% higher all-cause mortality hazard [HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.38–1.52] and patients with total serum protein < 5.5 g/dL had a 34% higher risk of death [HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.27–1.42] when compared with the reference group (A:G ratio 1.05- < 1.15 and total serum protein 6.5- < 7 g/dL).

- **Conclusions**: Among incident hemodialysis patients, a higher globulin level was associated with a higher mortality risk independent of other markers of malnutrition and inflammation.

### Differential diagnosis and management of thrombocytopenia in childhood [^116PPrYK]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments and to form a broad differential diagnosis, enabling clearer consideration of rare etiologies. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology, as it is currently known, is described and discussed.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^116UcBtU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that increased globulin fraction is a readily available biomarker associated with a more severe clinical course in a subgroup of patients with IBD and is independent of low albumin. On multivariate analysis, elevated globulin fraction was associated with hospitalization among CD and UC patients, as well as IBD-related surgeries in CD patients, after controlling for hypoalbuminemia. The use of globulin fraction adds no extra cost or effort in the evaluation of IBD patients, as this is a routinely ordered test. The mechanism behind the increased globulin fraction remains unclear, and the durability of this biomarker of severity requires further study, but it could be related to immune dysregulation and plasmablasts.

- **What is already known**: The clinical implications of a high globulin fraction in multiyear inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severity are unknown. Globulin fraction is associated with endoscopic disease severity in ulcerative colitis and is a readily available component of routine bloodwork.

- **What the new findings are**: IBD patients with a high globulin fraction had higher rates of C-reactive protein elevation and anemia during a multiyear follow-up. These patients also had higher rates of biologic use and healthcare utilization during the same period.

### Optimization of utilization of serum protein analysis: Role of the electronic medical record in promoting consultation by pathology [^1141iAv3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for monoclonal gammopathies is typically conducted through serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain tests. SPEP may be succeeded by immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). The decision to order IFE can be made by the treating physician or at the discretion of the pathologist.

We examined the appropriateness of IFE ordering by treating physicians and report on our findings, follow-up changes to the ordering process, and results of the change. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from our laboratory spanning April 2009 to July 2012. In April 2009, clinicians had three options for test ordering: SPEP with reflex IFE, SPEP only, and SPEP with IFE. In April 2010, the options were restricted to SPEP with reflex IFE only. We compared the rates of SPEP and IFE conducted during two periods: April 2009 through April 2010, and May 2010 through July 2012. There was a notable decrease in the IFE/SPEP ratio from 0.47 to 0.21.

Review of electronic medical records by the consultant pathologist was instrumental in improving utilization and enhancing the value of pathology consultation. Possible impacts on laboratory costs, revenue, and overall health care are also presented.

### The many faces and pathologic diagnostic challenges of autoimmune hepatitis [^114t5wtM]. Human Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory liver disease, characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, the presence of specific autoantibodies, and typical abnormalities in liver histology. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive treatment are necessary for both chronic and acute onset AIH to prevent progression to end-stage liver disease or fatal liver failure. However, the diagnosis of AIH is challenging mainly because of its heterogeneous clinical, serological, and pathological features. Although portal lymphoplasmacytosis and interface hepatitis are the most typical histological features of AIH, many other histological features can be observed in AIH, including emperipolesis, hepatocyte rosettes, and Kupffer cell hyaline globules.

Recent studies have questioned emperipolesis and hepatocyte rosette formation as typical features of AIH, and atypical clinical and histological presentations have also been recognized. This led an international working group to propose the modified AIH diagnostic criteria. However, it is well recognized that there are no pathognomonic characteristics that can be used to diagnose AIH, and careful clinicopathological correlation is required to arrive at the correct diagnosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the histological features of AIH, its varied histopathologic spectrum, recent updates, and major differential diagnoses in routine clinical practice.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^113pbsrj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The study population consisted of IBD patients who consented and were prospectively followed in a natural history IBD registry maintained at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The UPMC IBD registry systematically derives clinical data from the electronic medical records of all patients diagnosed with IBD using established criteria. Patients enrolled in the registry and tested for total serum protein (total protein) in the outpatient setting were included in the study.

For patients with a normal globulin fraction throughout the study, the inclusion time point was the first laboratory assessment with a normal value in the registry. For those with an elevated globulin fraction, the inclusion time point was the first occurrence of a high globulin fraction. Using random time points for inclusion increased the generalizability and external validity of the study, as patients were enrolled during routine care rather than exclusively at the time of IBD diagnosis. Patients were excluded if there was no total protein measurement during the study period or if they had a diagnosis of IBD unclassified.

An increased globulin fraction (> 4 g/dL) was defined by subtracting the same-day albumin level from the total protein level, according to the upper limit of normal of the UPMC clinical laboratory at the time of enrollment. Patients were stratified into two groups: those with an initially elevated globulin fraction and those with a normal globulin fraction.

### Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin G subclass concentrations differ according to sex and race [^115EstPA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations are integral to the workup of immune deficiencies and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Demographic differences in IgG concentrations are poorly described but can influence test interpretation, contribute to racial disparities in primary immunodeficiency diagnosis, and explain demographic differences in IgG concentrations in IgG4-RD.

- **Objective**: To assess differences in IgG and IgG subclass concentrations according to sex and race.

- **Methods**: We identified patients with IgG and IgG subclass concentrations measured in a large healthcare system. Multivariate-adjusted differences in IgG and IgG subclass concentrations and the proportion of subjects with results outside of reference ranges according to sex and race were estimated.

- **Results**: Of the 12,851 patients, the mean age was 54.7 years and 7,917 (62%) were female. Of these, 11,673 (91%) were white, 611 (5%) were black, and 302 (2%) were Asian. Compared with the mean concentrations of white patients, Asian and black patients had higher mean concentrations of IgG (1,340.0 and 1,504.4 vs. 988.1 mg/dL, P < .001), IgG1 (782.0 and 938.4 vs. 592.4 mg/dL, P < .001), IgG2 (493.5 and 384.2 vs. 305 mg/dL, P < .001), IgG3 (76.6 and 91.9 vs. 55.9 mg/dL, P < .001), and IgG4 (140.4 and 53.6 vs. 41.6 mg/dL, P < .001). Immunoglobin G subclass 4 concentrations were higher in males than those in females (56.3 vs. 37.4 mg/dL, P < .001). Similar observations were made when comparing the proportions of patients with results outside of reference ranges and after stratifying by diagnosis.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^116izaxb]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

A defining feature of plasma cell disorders is the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins, often referred to as a monoclonal M-protein, which can be used as a diagnostic marker and for the follow-up of the disease. Its heavy- and light-chain components can be identified by immunofixation and further quantified by serum protein electrophoresis and/or a serum free light-chain (SFLC) assay. It should be noted that with persisting disease and possible de-differentiation of myeloma cells, the capacity to produce M-proteins may decrease or be completely lost, a situation known as light-chain escape. In such patients, low M-protein levels, the presence of light chains only, or even a complete absence of M-proteins and light chains may be mistaken for an ongoing or evolving response.

Of note, immunofixation is approximately 10-fold more sensitive than serum protein electrophoresis and is required at diagnosis to characterize the phenotype of the M-protein and for confirmation of a complete response, which is defined as being immunofixation-negative. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation may not detect light-chain aberrations in patients with oligo-secretory disease, such as light-chain multiple myeloma. Due to their low molecular weight, these SFLC are rapidly cleared by the kidneys. In such cases, the monoclonal burden should be measured in a 24-hour urine collection or in the serum by an automated SFLC immunoassay (Grade 1A), the latter having a higher sensitivity to detect and quantify the involved free light chains.

### Falsely elevated testosterone due to heterophile antibodies [^112bqUvw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated testosterone is a rare phenomenon that may result from heterophile antibodies. Similar to patients with heterophile antibodies for β-hCG, incorrect management may lead to unnecessary testing or therapy.

- **Case**: A previously healthy postmenopausal woman presented with a falsely elevated total testosterone level due to interference consistent with heterophile antibodies, with subsequent normal levels detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

- **Conclusion**: Asymptomatic patients may present with an elevated hormone level due to heterophile antibody interference. Molecular studies for hormone levels can assist greatly when falsely elevated levels are suspected; however, these tests are costly and time-intensive.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis-an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome [^115FwLM4]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis (HLH) causes a constellation of non-specific findings, including persistent fever, altered mental state, rash, and cytopenias affecting all cell lines, often with thrombocytopenia initially. Other findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and transaminitis. Typically, patients display hyperferritinaemia, where highly elevated ferritin levels (> 10,000 μg/l) may be pathognomonic of HLH in some contexts, accompanied by elevated triglycerides and decreasing fibrinogen. It is important to note, however, that often one or more of these abnormalities may not be observed.

Key to early detection of HLH before the 'tipping point' into hyperinflammation is the interpretation of patterns of results rather than absolute values and recognizing worrying trends, such as decreasing ESR in a patient with a known chronic disease.

The absence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow can be falsely reassuring. The test is not 100% sensitive and haemophagocytosis may not be present in up to 30% of cases or may only appear on repeat testing. Furthermore, the presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow or other tissues is not binary, nor is it alone sufficient to make a diagnosis of HLH; some degree of haemophagocytosis can be present in the marrow of patients without HLH. Close collaboration with haematologists is therefore essential when managing HLH.

In both paediatric and adult populations, hyperferritinaemia has been shown to be sensitive and specific as a marker for HLH and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in 'at-risk' patients, and also as a marker of response to treatment. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed that utilize ferritin, given its wide availability and low cost.

### Key biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review [^111G9hVf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

β‐Globulins comprise about 16% of serum proteins in the blood of healthy individuals. Elevated levels of β‐globulin can be seen in many conditions, such as infections, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammation, and T2DM. In contrast, β‐globulin deficiency is commonly caused by malnutrition and liver and kidney disease. A significantly high level of serum β2‐globulins (≥ 1.8 mg/L) was positively correlated with T2DM patients with diabetic nephropathy (p < 0.001). Elevated serum and urinary levels of β2‐globulins have a high prevalence in T2DM patients with multiple diabetic complications, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. An increased correlation between β2‐globulins and the development of end-stage renal disease was observed in Indian individuals diagnosed with T2DM. Urinary and serum β2‐globulins were used as potential clinical biomarkers in detecting early nephropathy in T2DM patients. Overall, β2‐globulins serve as predictors for patients with T2DM who have complications.

γ‐Globulins are the most abundant proteins after albumin, with immunoglobulins as the most significant γ‐globulins. The five main classes of immunoglobulins are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. γ‐Globulins have been used as a marker of the acute adaptive immune system and have a close association with infection, inflammation, obesity, and T2DM. In a study involving 2530 participants, elevated levels of γ‐globulin were identified as a noteworthy predictor of T2DM, and γ‐globulin was linked to a 20% higher incidence of T2DM. Total γ‐globulin concentrations were associated with…

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppression, cancer therapies, and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialties are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count, and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance:

- **Blood tests**: The BSH 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining appropriate blood tests, including CBC, creatinine, serum calcium, paraprotein, and serum free light chain levels, 6 months after diagnosis and annually thereafter in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS.

- **Risk assessment**: Consider extending the interval of monitoring in low-risk MGUS populations and reducing further investigations in patients with a short life expectancy.

### Laboratory testing for cryoglobulins [^111cNDTB]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate below 37°C and can cause multiorgan damage. There are three types of cryoglobulins: Type I (also called simple), which is mostly associated with monoclonal gammopathy and/or other hematologic disorders, and Type II and Type III (known as mixed cryoglobulins), which are associated with infectious and systemic diseases. Testing for cryoglobulins is complicated by a lack of reference range, standards, and stringency in maintaining testing temperature conditions. Identification of cryoprecipitate can be critical for patient care; therefore, correct testing conditions are crucial for reliable cryoglobulin testing.

The patient's blood sample should be kept at 37°C initially to avoid premature precipitation of cryoglobulins, thereby decreasing the yield for subsequent identification, which could cause a false negative result. After warm centrifugation or warm cell precipitation, the clear serum is observed at 4°C for the formation of cryoprecipitate. The cryoprecipitate is then washed in cold buffer, and the resulting precipitate is warmed to 37°C and subjected to further analysis by immunodiffusion and immunofixation. In addition to Meltzer's triad of purpura, weakness, and arthralgias, cryoglobulinemias have protean manifestations involving the skin, joints, kidneys, nervous system, as well as the hematopoietic system.

The management of cryoglobulinemia, especially in patients with organ damage, remains difficult. Treatment of cryoglobulinemia focuses on managing the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder or infectious or systemic cause.

### Efficacy of the detection of the alpha1-antitrypsin "Z" deficiency variant by routine serum protein electrophoresis [^1153pT8s]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a common but underdiagnosed genetic disorder. Severe AAT deficiency may be detected by the absence of alpha1-globulin protein fraction by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP). Routine SPEP may represent an underused resource for the identification of AAT deficiency. Total alpha1-globulin protein was measured in 47 MM, 24 MZ, and 19 ZZ phenotype serum samples by a Sebia CAPILLARYS (Norcross, GA) capillary electrophoresis system. Measured serum AAT concentrations by immunoassay exhibited moderate correlation with measured SPEP alpha1-globulin fraction concentrations.

In this sample set, 16 (84%) of the ZZ, 7 (29%) of the MZ, and none of the MM sample phenotypes exhibited alpha1-globulin concentrations of less than 0.21 g/dL. From estimates of MZ and ZZ phenotype prevalence, it can be calculated that 1 ZZ phenotype should be present in approximately every 31 samples with alpha1-globulin concentrations of less than 0.21 g/dL. Clinicians should consider investigation of potential AAT deficiency in patients who exhibit low alpha1-globulin protein levels by routine SPEP.

### What do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally, B lymphocytes).

Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Are renal reference intervals required when screening for plasma cell disorders with serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis [^116oz8hL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal impairment and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may abnormally increase the serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, giving false-positive results with reference intervals. We measured sFLCs with concomitant serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in 281 patients. Results were interpreted relative to renal function (serum creatinine concentrations) and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Overall, 78 plasma cell disorders (PCDs) were detected with the serum panel of SPEP/sFLC compared to 76 with SPEP/UPEP.

In 13 samples with negative SPEP/UPEP results, mildly increased ratios up to 3.1 (normal range 0.26–1.65) were observed. Among these, 10 were associated with increased serum creatinine and 1 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; 2 were unassociated with either condition. In 2 samples, decreased kappa/lambda ratios were identified, which were clinically significant despite normal SPEP/UPEP results. Two monoclonal gammopathies were identified with UPEP and sFLC, although samples appeared normal with SPEP.

Screening for PCDs with a serum panel consisting of SPEP and the sFLC assays is a highly sensitive approach that could eliminate the need for UPEP. A mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to 3.1 was observed with increased serum creatinine and/or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, which was consistent with pathophysiologic changes. Therefore, renal reference intervals are recommended.

### Differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^113itTDc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder occurring in 4.2% of adults over 50 years of age, which can progress into symptomatic diseases either through proliferation of the plasma cell clone, giving rise to multiple myeloma and other lymphoplasmacellular neoplasms, or through organ damage caused by the monoclonal protein, as seen in light-chain amyloidosis and related conditions.

The differential diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic monoclonal gammopathies is crucial for determining when to initiate therapy.

- **Criteria for determining end-organ damage**: Markers of organ injury caused by the monoclonal protein. Patient assessment and optimal follow-up are now performed using risk stratification models, which should also consider the risk of developing AL amyloidosis. Patients with low-risk MGUS (approximately 40% of all MGUS patients) require limited assessment and very infrequent follow-up.

The ongoing development of novel molecular biomarkers and advanced imaging techniques will improve the identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention through innovative clinical trials.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^1124tNmb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Predicting the multiyear clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the use of biomarkers remains an elusive, yet important goal. This has been a challenge, not only because of the lack of candidate biomarkers but also given the lack of a uniformly accepted strategy for gauging multiyear disease severity in IBD. In this study, we addressed both of these challenges by utilizing a prospective natural history registry to assess the performance of increased globulin fraction, a routinely available serum lab test, as a candidate biomarker of multiyear IBD severity. Increased globulin fraction, either reported directly or calculated as the difference between the serum total protein and serum albumin, was associated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and higher rates of healthcare utilization, including hospitalization, over the 4-year study period. The association between hospitalization and high globulin fraction remained significant on multivariable logistic regression analysis amongst Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. These data suggest that increased globulin fraction may identify a subgroup of patients at risk for worse clinical trajectories, who may benefit from closer clinical monitoring and treatment.

Over the past several years, multiple studies have examined the role of biomarkers in diagnosing and predicting the behavior of IBD, including CRP, fecal calprotectin, and anemia. A number of studies evaluated the correlation between albumin levels and IBD status, but none have assessed globulin fraction as a biomarker in IBD. The globulin fraction may play a crucial role in further understanding the disease progression and management of IBD patients.

### Cryoglobulins [^114rQPmB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Serum cryoglobulins are found in a wide spectrum of disorders but are often transient and without clinical implications. Monoclonal cryoglobulins are usually associated with haematological disorders, whereas mixed cryoglobulins are found in many infectious and systemic disorders. So-called essential mixed cryoglobulinaemia shows a striking association with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (> 90%). It is a systemic vasculitis (leucocytoclastic vasculitis) with cutaneous and multiple visceral organ involvement. Chronic HCV infection can lead to a constellation of autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. In this review, the aetiology, diagnosis, disease heterogeneity, and treatment of cryoglobulinaemia are discussed.

### IgG4-related disease: What a hematologist needs to know [^115a7cbj]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 70% of patients with IgG4-RD have an elevated serum IgG4 level. Serum IgG subclasses should be investigated in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis to exclude a monoclonal paraprotein. Serum IgG4 level has a diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 83–97% and specificity from 60–85%, with a general cut-off of "above the upper limit of normal". Typically, 1.35 g/L is used as the biomarker cut-off for IgG4-RD, which corresponds to the upper limit of normal for one common commercial method but not another, without specifying the methodology. While mildly elevated serum IgG4 can be seen in many conditions, markedly elevated serum IgG4 (> 5 g/L) is approximately 90% specific for IgG4-RD.

Aside from methodological differences, serum IgG4 levels in IgG4-RD can vary greatly depending on ethnicity and degree of organ involvement. In the Boston cohort of patients (76% White), only 53 of 103 patients had elevated serum IgG4 levels. In contrast, in a cohort of 334 Japanese patients, more than 95% had elevated serum IgG4. In our multi-ethnic cohort, we found that Asians have a higher serum IgG4 than non-Asians (median 11.2 g/L versus 2.9 g/L, P = 0.0094), and elevated serum IgG4 had a sensitivity of 96% in Asians compared to 67% in non-Asians. Patients with multi-organ involvement or of Asian ethnicity typically have elevated serum IgG4, sometimes markedly so, such as the patient in this illustrative case. The serum IgG4/IgG ratio is typically > 0.2 in patients with IgG4-RD, although the ratio does not increase the diagnostic specificity.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The extent of abnormality in liver blood tests is a critical factor in directing further investigation, based on the magnitude of test result derangement. A common practice is to use threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval; however, this assumption lacks support in the literature. Prognosis is more accurately determined by diagnosis and the context within which tests are requested.

To illustrate, consider two patients: one with an acute hepatitis A infection may have ALT values exceeding 1000 U/L, while another with hepatitis C might exhibit ALT levels within the normal range. Nevertheless, the hepatitis A patient is likely to thrive regardless of management, whereas a patient with hepatitis C faces significant risks of progressing to end-stage liver disease if undiagnosed and untreated.

The most common causes of chronic liver disease — such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — often present with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Thus, despite the increased use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, potentially preventable through earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for liver enzymes like ALT may be set too high, likely due to the inclusion of patients with occult NAFLD in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### Use of clinical decision support to improve the laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathies [^1119c5Y2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

There is considerable variation in ordering practices for the initial laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) despite clear society guidelines to include serum free light chain (sFLC) testing. We assessed the ability of a clinical decision support (CDS) alert to improve guideline compliance and analyzed its clinical impact.

- **Methods**: We designed and deployed a targeted CDS alert to educate and prompt providers to order an sFLC assay when ordering serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) testing.

- **Results**: The alert was highly effective at increasing the co-ordering of SPEP and sFLC testing. Preimplementation, 62.8% of all SPEP evaluations included sFLC testing, while nearly 90% of evaluations included an sFLC assay postimplementation. In patients with no prior sFLC testing, analysis of sFLC orders prompted by the alert led to the determination that 28.9% (800/2,769) of these patients had an abnormal κ/λ ratio. In 452 of these patients, the sFLC assay provided the only laboratory evidence of a monoclonal protein. Moreover, within this population, there were numerous instances of new diagnoses of multiple myeloma and other MGs.

The CDS alert increased compliance with society guidelines and improved the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected MGs.
