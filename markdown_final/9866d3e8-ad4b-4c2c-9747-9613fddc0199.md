## Question

Deficit in bile absorption in lieus can produce kidney stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a deficit in bile absorption in the ileum can produce kidney stones, and if so, how that happens mechanistically and clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of ileal bile acid absorption and its role in fat digestion. Then, I should verify how ileal dysfunction or resection perturbs bile acid and fat handling. Next, I will examine the downstream effects on colonic oxalate handling and urinary supersaturation. After that, I should review corroborating clinical evidence across IBD, short bowel syndrome, and bariatric surgery. Finally, I will consider stone types, risk modifiers, and guideline-based prevention to ensure the reasoning is clinically actionable.

> Let me first confirm the baseline physiology. The terminal ileum is the primary site for active reabsorption of conjugated bile acids via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), which recycles bile acids into the enterohepatic circulation and maintains an adequate bile acid pool for micelle formation and fat absorption; ileal dysfunction or resection reduces ASBT-mediated uptake and increases bile acid loss into the colon, producing bile acid malabsorption and steatorrhea [^116aWStU] [^1134iZkd].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate consequences of bile acid malabsorption. Reduced intraluminal bile acids impair micelle formation, leading to fat maldigestion and steatorrhea. Unabsorbed fatty acids in the colon then bind calcium, forming calcium–fatty acid soaps and lowering free calcium available to bind oxalate, which increases the soluble oxalate fraction and promotes colonic absorption of oxalate [^116aWStU] [^114NTDSf].

> I will now examine the oxalate–calcium interplay more closely. Normally, calcium binds oxalate in the gut, forming insoluble calcium oxalate that is excreted in stool. When fatty acids saponify calcium, more oxalate remains soluble and is absorbed, raising urinary oxalate and calcium oxalate supersaturation, the core mechanism of enteric hyperoxaluria [^114NTDSf] [^113pLuks].

> Hold on, I should verify additional colonic mechanisms that amplify risk. Unabsorbed bile acids and fatty acids can increase colonic permeability to small molecules, including oxalate, further augmenting net oxalate absorption; in parallel, chronic diarrheal losses reduce urine volume and urinary citrate and magnesium, both natural inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization, compounding supersaturation and crystallization risk [^116aWStU] [^114NTDSf].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence linking ileal dysfunction to nephrolithiasis. In Crohn's disease with ileal involvement or resection, nephrolithiasis prevalence is increased, with hyperoxaluria reported in a substantial fraction of patients. Similar risk is seen in short bowel syndrome with colon in continuity and after malabsorptive bariatric procedures, all settings characterized by bile acid loss and fat malabsorption [^114kdaa8] [^112LKVnC] [^111k8cGR].

> Let me consider stone types and modifiers. I initially thought ileostomy would drive calcium oxalate stones via enteric hyperoxaluria, but wait, I should double-check that assumption. Ileostomy patients more often form uric acid stones due to low urine volume and acidic urine from bicarbonate losses, whereas enteric hyperoxaluria with intact colon is the classic setting for calcium oxalate stones, so I need to correct that overgeneralization and keep the clinical context explicit [^114NTDSf] [^1144GWAt].

> I need to ensure the mechanistic chain is coherent. Ileal bile acid malabsorption leads to steatorrhea and colonic calcium–fatty acid soap formation, which reduces calcium available to bind oxalate, increases soluble oxalate, and raises urinary oxalate; low urine volume and low citrate/magnesium from diarrheal losses further increase calcium oxalate supersaturation, culminating in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis in patients with an intact colon [^114NTDSf].

> But wait, what if we intervene therapeutically to test causality. Conjugated bile acid replacement in short bowel syndrome improves fat absorption and has been shown to reduce fecal fat and urinary oxalate, supporting the mechanistic model; similarly, guideline-directed strategies for enteric hyperoxaluria — low-fat and low-oxalate diet, calcium with meals to bind oxalate, and potassium citrate — address both the oxalate load and inhibitor deficits, aligning with the pathophysiology [^112zm1AD] [^1175R6tU] [^113Z3YzH].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, a deficit in ileal bile acid absorption can produce kidney stones, primarily via enteric hyperoxaluria driven by fat malabsorption, colonic calcium sequestration, increased oxalate absorption, and urinary supersaturation, with additional contributions from low urine volume and low citrate/magnesium. The risk is highest when the colon is present and is well documented in ileal Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, and malabsorptive bariatric surgery [^112LKVnC] [^114kdaa8] [^111k8cGR].

Bile malabsorption in the ileum increases kidney stone risk by causing **enteric hyperoxaluria** [^114kdaa8] and **uric acid stones**. Unabsorbed bile acids and fatty acids bind calcium in the colon, increasing soluble oxalate absorption and urinary oxalate excretion [^114kdaa8] [^116aWStU]. Bile acid diarrhea also causes volume depletion, low urine pH, and low citrate/magnesium, promoting uric acid and calcium oxalate stones [^114NTDSf] [^113SuwkD]. Management includes **low-fat, low-oxalate diet**, calcium citrate with meals, potassium citrate, and high fluid intake [^1175R6tU] [^113Z3YzH] [^112J77fm].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking bile malabsorption to kidney stones

### Enteric hyperoxaluria

- **Calcium binding by fatty acids**: In bile acid malabsorption, unabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium in the colon, reducing calcium available to bind oxalate and increasing soluble oxalate absorption [^114kdaa8] [^113SuwkD].

- **Increased oxalate absorption**: Elevated soluble oxalate in the colon increases intestinal oxalate absorption, leading to hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate stone formation [^114kdaa8] [^113pLuks].

- **Colonic permeability**: Bile acids and fatty acids increase colonic permeability, further enhancing oxalate absorption [^116aWStU] [^117BeEos].

---

### Uric acid stone formation

- **Low urine pH**: Bile acid diarrhea causes bicarbonate loss and metabolic acidosis, lowering urine pH and increasing uric acid supersaturation [^114NTDSf] [^1144GWAt].

- **Volume depletion**: Chronic diarrhea leads to low urine volume, concentrating uric acid and promoting crystallization [^114NTDSf] [^112pNCCF].

- **Low citrate and magnesium**: Gastrointestinal losses reduce urinary citrate and magnesium, inhibitors of uric acid and calcium oxalate stones [^114NTDSf] [^113SuwkD].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and reviews document an increased risk of **nephrolithiasis** in patients with ileal dysfunction or resection, including:

- **IBD and nephrolithiasis**: Patients with Crohn's disease, especially with ileal involvement or resection, have a higher prevalence of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate and uric acid stones [^114kdaa8] [^113SuwkD].

- **Short bowel syndrome**: Extensive ileal resection or bypass increases the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis [^112pZ7et] [^117Q94cc].

- **Bariatric surgery**: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and other malabsorptive procedures increase the risk of calcium oxalate stones due to fat malabsorption and hyperoxaluria [^111k8cGR] [^116RfRdR].

## Clinical management and prevention strategies

### Dietary modifications

Dietary modifications include a **low-oxalate diet** to reduce dietary oxalate intake and a **low-fat diet** to decrease fatty acid binding of calcium and oxalate absorption [^112J77fm] [^1175R6tU]. High fluid intake maintains urine volume and reduces stone risk [^112KfBG2].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Calcium citrate**: Taken with meals to bind oxalate in the gut and reduce absorption [^113Z3YzH] [^113NxSqY].

- **Potassium citrate**: Alkalinizes urine, increases citrate, and reduces uric acid and calcium oxalate supersaturation [^117WbgHC] [^114NTDSf].

- **Cholestyramine**: Binds bile acids, reducing diarrhea and oxalate absorption [^116jQQWt].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include periodic **24-hour urine testing** for oxalate, citrate, calcium, uric acid, pH, and volume to guide therapy [^1114hkZw] and regular assessment of renal function, especially in patients with recurrent stones or chronic diarrhea [^112rKmx4].

---

Bile malabsorption in the ileum increases kidney stone risk through **enteric hyperoxaluria** and **uric acid stone formation**, driven by increased oxalate absorption, low urine pH, and volume depletion. Management focuses on dietary changes, calcium citrate, potassium citrate, and high fluid intake to reduce stone recurrence [^1175R6tU] [^112J77fm].

### Gut microbes take It to the next level? First insights into farnesoid X receptor agonists of microbial origin [^113m79KN]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The investigators examined the potential of the novel conjugates to activate FXR in a cell reporter assay and in mice. Although the choice for a kidney‐based cell system with uncertain expression of transporters engaged in uptake of bile salt ligands is less obvious, dose‐dependent activation of FXR was observed for Phe‐CA and Tyr‐CA, with the latter having the highest potency (half‐maximal effective concentration [EC 50] = 0.14 µmol/L) that outranked the most potent endogenous bile salt (viz. chenodeoxycholic acid; EC 50 = 9.7 µmol/L). Gavage of the microbial bile salt conjugates resulted in induction of FXR target genes in ileum and liver, along with anticipated repression of bile salt synthetic genes. Comparable effects were observed when administering an identical dose of CA. The lack of measurements in portal/systemic blood precludes a conclusion on absorption of the bacterial conjugates in intact form. Given the clinical interest in agonistic FXR activation for treatment of metabolic (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) or cholestatic (primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) liver diseases, (6) further investigation into the enterohepatic dynamics of these novel bile salt conjugates is warranted. Likewise, their interaction with plasma membrane receptors for generic (un)conjugated bile salts (i.e. TGR5) or particular conjugated bile salt species (e.g. sphingosine‐1‐phosphate receptor 2, muscarinic receptors) should be explored.

Analysis of public metabolome data sets revealed spectral matches to the novel conjugates in fecal samples of healthy persons and patient populations. Their presence was more frequent in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency resulting in fat malabsorption. Likewise, increased abundance of each of the three bacterial conjugates was noted in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis, and this was associated with a dysbiotic state. It is conceivable that dysbiosis (e.g. through small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) could result in increased bacterial de‐ and reconjugation of bile salts. Feeding normal or atherosclerosis‐prone mice a high‐fat diet caused elevation of fecal levels of bacterial bile salt conjugates, underlining an apparent dysbiotic link, and providing a rationale for analyses in patients with obesity‐related disorders. It will be worthwhile to explore whether the microbial bile salt conjugates contribute to dysbiosis or are the consequence thereof and may serve as a biomarker.

### Case report: disease mechanisms and medical management of calcium nephrolithiasis in rheumatologic diseases [^111tc5Ba]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients may present with nephrocalcinosis and/or nephrolithiasis. While these are distinct entities, there is an underlying common mechanism. Nephrocalcinosis refers to the diffuse precipitation of calcium salts within the tubular epithelium and interstitial tissue of the kidney. This generally involves the medulla and can be detectable by ultrasound or CT scan. Nephrolithiasis refers to kidney stones that are larger and generally visible on plain radiographs, ultrasounds and CT scans. Both nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis frequently evolve from the metabolic abnormalities described above. Those abnormalities can include hypercalciuria, hyperoxalauria or hypocitraturia and/or defects in urinary acidification.

The vast majority of calcium oxalate stone formers do not have any systemic disease and are described as idiopathic stone formers. The defect is often hypercalciuria, although the genetic mechanisms can vary. Some stone formers are discovered to have primary hyperparathyroidism where PTH excess leads to increased bone resorption as well as increased synthesis of calcitriol which increases intestinal calcium absorption which in turn leads to increased filtered load of calcium at the kidney. Others may have dietary issues or underlying bowel condition. Malabsorption of fatty acids or bile salts such as in Crohn's disease or after gastric bypass leads to increased colonic intestinal oxalate absorption that contributes to excess urine oxalate. Those with primary bowel disorders are labeled as having enteric hyperoxaluria. Those patients found to have excess calcitriol levels need a careful consideration for the possibility of underlying sarcoidosis, although this can sometimes be the phenotype of genetic hypercalciuria.

### Calcium oxalate crystal related kidney injury in a patient receiving roux-en Y hepaticojejunostomy due to gall bladder cancer [^111jfTbx]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The cause of hyperoxaluria related calcium oxalate crystals could be multifactorial in nature. Firstly, malabsorption leading to steatorrhea plays a central role in all forms of enteric hyperoxaluria. Under normal circumstances, calcium will bind to oxalate within the intestinal lumen to form insoluble calcium oxalate, that is excreted in feces. If with fat malabsorption, excessive intraluminal free fatty acids bind to and saponify calcium, which inhibits the formation of calcium oxalate. Bile plays an important role in fat digestion, emulsifying fat as the first stage in its digestion. There was only a 50% bile level for this patient to help digest fat because a CBD drainage was performed to avoid obstructive jaundice (about 500 mL per day, according to the medical records). Therefore, because fat malabsorption was anticipated in this patient, more soluble free oxalate was absorbed by the colonic mucosa. In addition, the other 50% nonabsorbed bile salts were drained into the colon, causing increased colonic permeability to small molecules such as oxalate. Both soluble free oxalate in the lumen, and higher permeability to oxalate cause enteric hyperoxaluria. Secondly, the patient also experienced diarrhea without enough fluid supplements to enable him to avoid chronic kidney injury related edema. The diarrheal fluid losses can lead to a reduction in urine volume, along with intratubular concentrations of oxalate and calcium.

### Biology of calcium homeostasis regulation in intestine and kidney [^111cDS5g]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The paracellular reabsorption of Cl – from the late proximal tubule contributes a lumen-positive electrical potential providing a driving force for Na + and Ca 2+ reabsorption. Cldn-2 and -12 confer cation permeability to Ca 2+ in the PT, as in the intestine. Cldn-2 is the main protein conferring Ca 2+ permeability to the PT since Cldn2 deficient mice display a 3-fold increase in urinary Ca 2+ excretion. Cldn12 knockout mice do not have altered urinary Ca 2+ and Na + excretion. However, ex vivo microperfusion studies of PTs from Cldn12 knockout mice found reduced Ca 2+ permeability consistent with a role for Cldn12 in paracellular Ca 2+ absorption. Moreover, Cldn2 and Cldn12 double knockout mice display further increased urinary Ca 2+ excretion than single Cldn2 knockout mice. The phenotype of the Cldn2 knockout mouse is similar to individuals with idiopathic hypercalciuria and kidney stones and a coding variation in CLDN2 in humans leads to hypercalciuria and kidney stone disease. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CLDN2 associate with altered gene expression and risk of kidney stone formation, further cementing altered proximal tubule paracellular Ca 2+ reabsorption in causing hypercalciuria and kidney stones (Figs 2 a and 3).

### Intestinal aspects of cholesterol gallstone formation [^111o8UoN]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Apart from biliary cholesterol supersaturation, crystallization-promoting proteins and impaired postprandial gallbladder motility, the intestine may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. Prolonged intestinal transit could increase gallstone risk by enhancing formation in the intestinal lumen of the secondary hydrophobic and pro-lithogenic bile salt deoxycholate. Furthermore, in normal subjects there is an intimate relationship between gallbladder and intestinal motility in the fasting (interdigestive) state. In gallstone patients we found disordered intestinal motility, absent gallbladder contraction and abnormal release of the hormone motilin in the interdigestive state. These disturbances could contribute to gallstone formation.

Our understanding of bile metabolism and the molecular effects of bile acids has expanded in recent years. Bile acids, which are classically recognized for their involvement in dietary lipid absorption, are now known to be involved in many aspects of energy metabolism and disease processes in humans. Cholelithiasis, a consequence of altered bile metabolism, affects a significant number of American adults. An understanding of the disease process, risk factors, and complications of gallbladder disease is necessary for the development of novel targeted treatments and prophylactic therapies against the development of gallstones.

### Hyperoxaluric calcium nephrolithiasis [^114AVhDw]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperoxaluria leads to increased calcium oxalate supersaturation and calcium oxalate stone formation. Excess oxalate can arise from endogenous overproduction as in primary hyperoxaluria or from dietary sources. In the last 15 years great strides have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. However options still seem limited in treating the mild hyperoxaluria found in many stone formers. Inadequate knowledge of food oxalate content, the effect of dietary oxalate precursors on oxalate excretion, and the factors affecting handling of oxalate by the intestine prevent development of rational therapies for treatment of hyperoxaluria. Recent studies of oxalate degrading bacteria and renewed interest in the role of diet calcium in oxalate absorption may lead to better therapeutic strategies for hyperoxaluric calcium nephrolithiasis.

### Renal and urological disorders associated with inflammatory bowel disease [^115bMYJu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Other mechanisms may be involved in oxalate stone formation. Oxalobacter formigenes degrades dietary oxalate, and its decolonization in the gut may lead to the hyperabsorption of oxalate. Oral administration of Oxalobacter decreases urinary oxalate concentration. Low urinary levels of antilithogenic substances such as magnesium and citrate also play a role in renal calculi formation in IBD. Magnesium and citrate replacement should ideally aim to correct urinary rather than serum levels towards normal. Other preventative measures include a diet low in oxalate and fat, and pyridoxine supplementation. Oral cholestyramine increases oxalate and decreases citrate excretion. The toxic effects of oxalate on renal epithelial and tubular cells cause oxalate nephropathy with persistent hyperoxaluria and, together with stone formation, constitute a major but rare contributor to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Uric acid supersaturation of the urine, which promotes uric acid stone formation, is aided by low urinary pH resulting from loss of alkali in diarrheal stool and diminished urine volumes (especially after colonic resection) in IBD. Preventative measures include reduction in dietary purine intake, a high fluid intake to maintain a urine output of 2 to 3 litres, and alkalinization of the urine. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol inhibit uric acid synthesis and uricosuria. Oral potassium citrate also helps prevent uric acid stone recurrence.

Varda et al highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis to ensure appropriate treatment of IBD patients with renal stones. Using data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (2006–2009), they studied a cohort of over 3.5 million patients seeking care for urolithiasis at emergency departments in the United States, of whom 14 352 patients had concomitant IBD. Patients with IBD with urolithiasis were more likely to develop urinary tract infections, acute kidney injury, sepsis, end-organ failure, and to require hospital admission compared with those without IBD.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of reloxaliase in enteric hyperoxaluria [^112c9Soi]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Enteric hyperoxaluria is caused by increased intestinal oxalate absorption and can lead to kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure. Reloxaliase is an orally administered recombinant enzyme that degrades oxalate along the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing its absorption. METHODS: We randomly assigned participants with enteric hyperoxaluria to reloxaliase or placebo, three to five times per day with food for 4 weeks. The primary end point was percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate (UOx) excretion during weeks 1 to 4. Secondary end points included the proportion of participants with more than a 20% reduction in 24-hour UOx and an efficacy assessment in the bariatric surgery subgroup. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients underwent randomization. The 24-hour UOx decreased from a baseline geometric mean of 83.2 to 67.4 mg/24 hr during weeks 1 to 4 in reloxaliase-treated participants. Corresponding data for placebo-treated participants were 84.2 to 78.1 mg/24 hr. Estimates from the mixed-effect model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis showed a 22.6% reduction in geometric mean UOx during weeks 1 to 4 for reloxaliase and 9.7% for placebo, a difference of 14.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.9 to 22.8; P = 0.004). A 20% or greater reduction in 24-hour UOx was observed in 48.3% of reloxaliase-treated participants and 31.6% of placebo-treated participants (P = 0.06). In the bariatric surgery subgroup, MMRM analysis showed a 21.2% reduction in geometric mean UOx for reloxaliase and a 6.0% reduction for placebo, for a difference of 16.2 percentage points (95% CI, 4.2% to 26.7%). Adverse events occurred in 69% of reloxaliase-treated participants versus 53% of individuals taking placebo and were most commonly gastrointestinal. All but one of the adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity; no reloxaliase-treated participants discontinued the study. CONCLUSIONS: Reloxaliase treatment for 4 weeks reduced UOx excretion in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria; adverse events were relatively common, but not dose-limiting. These data establish the foundation for a clinical trial to determine the impact of reloxaliase on nephrolithiasis in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.

### Ursodiol (Reltone 200 mg) [^113Rpnzx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Lithocholic acid causes cholestatic liver injury and can cause death from liver failure in certain species unable to form sulfate conjugates. Lithocholic acid is formed by 7-dehydroxylation of the dihydroxy bile acids (ursodiol and chenodiol) in the gut lumen. The 7-dehydroxylation reaction appears to be alpha-specific, i.e., chenodiol is more efficiently 7-dehydroxylated than ursodiol and, for equimolar doses of ursodiol and chenodiol, levels of lithocholic acid appearing in bile are lower with the former. Man has the capacity to sulfate lithocholic acid. Although liver injury has not been associated with ursodiol therapy, a reduced capacity to sulfate may exist in some individuals, but such a deficiency has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

Pharmacodynamics

Ursodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis and secretion of cholesterol, and also inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol. It appears to have little inhibitory effect on synthesis and secretion into bile of endogenous bile acids and does not appear to affect secretion of phospholipids into bile.

With repeated dosing, bile ursodeoxycholic acid concentrations reach a steady-state in about 3 weeks. Although insoluble in aqueous media, cholesterol can be solubilized in at least two different ways in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids. In addition to solubilizing cholesterol in micelles, ursodiol acts by an apparently unique mechanism to cause dispersion of cholesterol as liquid crystals in aqueous media. Thus, even though administration of high doses (e.g., 15–18 mg/kg/day) does not result in a concentration of ursodiol higher than 60% of the total bile acid pool, ursodiol-rich bile effectively solubilizes cholesterol. The overall effect of ursodiol is to increase the concentration level at which saturation of cholesterol occurs.

The various actions of ursodiol combine to change the bile of patients with gallstones from cholesterol-precipitating to cholesterol-solubilizing, thus resulting in bile conducive to cholesterol stone dissolution.

After ursodiol dosing is stopped, the concentration of the bile acid in bile falls exponentially, declining to about 5% to 10% of its steady-state level in about 1 week.

### Biology of calcium homeostasis regulation in intestine and kidney [^114TroTE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypercalciuria and Ca 2+ -based kidney stones

Hypercalciuria is an increase in urinary excretion of Ca 2+ (> 250 mg/day in women and > 300 mg/day in men). It can occur from increased intestinal absorption, bone resorption or decreased renal reabsorption of Ca 2+. Hypercalciuria is the greatest risk factor for nephrolithiasis. Kidney stones commonly occur in adults with a lifetime risk nearing 1 in 10. From 2017 to 2020, 9.9% (23.7 million) of people in the USA reported a history of kidney stones at some point in their lives, while a further 1.8% (4.4 million) had experienced at least one kidney stone episode in the last year. Kidney stones are deposits of minerals (most commonly Ca 2+ containing) and salts that accumulate in the kidney. The formation of kidney stones is a hereditary trait enhanced by dietary factors. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene approaches have provided insights into genetic variants and molecular pathways for kidney stone formation. A recent study that carried out a large meta-analysis of GWAS on kidney stone disease confirmed 44 independent susceptible loci for kidney stone formation. In these 720 199 patients, of the 44 susceptibility loci, 12 were associated with Ca 2+, phosphate or calcidiol concentration, and we highlight this in Table 1.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^113YA5va]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Gallstones demonstrated on CT scanning consistently fall into the following categories:
Dense opacification (calcified gallstones) in 48.3%
Slight opacification in 11.5%
Rim opacification in 21.8%
Radiolucent (generally pure cholesterol stones) in 14.9%
Composite stones of calcium, cholesterol, and bile pigments may be missed on CT scanning due to isoattenuation relative to bile/fluid. This may occur in up to 25% of cases. A study by Barakos et al. reports several cases of isoattenuating tones relative to the fluid, which has accumulated in obstructed bowel. These stones were missed on CT but were later demonstrated by ultrasound scanning or postoperatively.

There are several reports of CT scanning underestimating the size of stones in gallstone ileus. In IV contrast-enhanced CT scanning, this may be due to radiolucency at the periphery of the stones, or stones embedded in the mucosa of the bowel wall. Furthermore, the drawback of IV contrast-enhanced CT scanning in gallstone ileus is the difficulty in defining some radiolucent stones or rim-calcified stones. Intraluminal radiolucent stones may resemble soft-tissue densities (isoattenuation), e.g. a mass or an intussusceptum as reported by Prasad et al. On the contrary, in contrast-enhanced small bowel, rim-calcified (thus rim-enhancing on CT) stones may go undiagnosed given their strong resemblance to contrast-enhanced small bowel (the radiolucent center of the calculus resembling bowel lumen). Such rim-enhancing stones may be calcified completely (encircling the stone) or as an arc, and occur in approximately 22% of cases of gallstone ileus.

In summary, the identification of gallstones on CT scanning is complicated by variability in gallstone composition and structure. Its applicability in this condition is highly dependent on a high index of suspicion, and the skill of the observer. However, overall CT scanning is a powerful tool for the diagnosis of bowel obstruction, and thus one of its rarer causes, gallstone ileus.

### A new era in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones? [^112rtijF]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most prevalent type of kidney stone. The amount of oxalate excreted in the urine is a major risk factor for CaOx stone formation. The study by Siener et al. makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of how Oxalobacter formigenes affects oxalate metabolism and excretion in humans and hence influences the risk of developing CaOx kidney stones.

A careful and individualized evaluation of risk factors is a fundamental part of the management of patients with urinary tract stone disease. Identification and correction of important abnormalities provide the basis for designing an efficient and rational treatment program, aiming at an arrest or at least reduction of recurrent stone formation. It is beyond doubt that appropriate therapeutic steps in this regard are of great benefit for the patient. It needs to be emphasized, however, that no success will be obtained unless the patient is willing and able to follow the ensuing dietary recommendations and medical advice.

### Causal effects of inflammatory bowel diseases on the risk of kidney stone disease: a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization [^117LUPt7]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a systemic metabolic disorder, and its main pathogenic factors include metabolic abnormalities, urinary tract infections, and drug factors. IBD (CD and UC) is a kind of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Studies have demonstrated the following reasons accounting for the relationship between IBD and KSD: (i) patients with IBD exposed to surgery could lead to supersaturation for calcium oxalate and uric acid and TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment per se drives the increased risk of stone formation; (ii) malabsorption of bile salts and fatty acids caused by recurrent inflammation of the intestine can increase the solubility of oxalate; (iii) chronic intestinal inflammation could lead to fluid losses, bicarbonate losses, and reduced magnesium absorption, which further promote the formation of urinary calculus.

According to previous studies, 4–23% of patients with IBD suffered from renal and urinary tract complications, with nephrolithiasis being the most common form of renal manifestation. Based on a meta-analysis including 1624 individuals, urinary complications might occur in up to 22% of patients suffering from IBD, and calcium oxalate is more frequent in patients with CD than with UC. Likewise, the latest retrospective analysis containing 1874 patients diagnosed with IBD reported that renal involvement may be observed in approximately 6% of patients suffering from IBD. Patients with CD seem to be more susceptible than those with UC. It also found renal manifestations were associated with surgical resection history and disease activity in CD patients, whereas no such link was identified in patients with UC. These studies all demonstrated that CD patients presented a higher risk of KSD compared with UC patients. The different effects of CD and UC on KSD might be interpreted as follows: CD belongs to a kind of systemic disorder with a prolonged premorbid stage, whereas UC is frequently confined to the distal colonic tract and characterized by acute mucosal lesions. According to anatomical position, CD occurs primarily in the small intestine and frequently affects the terminal ileum, which directly leads to hyperoxaluria in patients with ileal dysfunction. Moreover, extensive resection of the lesions may result in estrogen deficiency, which may increase the risk of calculus recurrence by elevating calcium oxalate saturation and urinary calcium.

### Role of the calcium-sensing receptor in reducing the risk for calcium stones [^114D6QqT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The tight control of blood Ca2+ levels within a narrow range is essential for the performance of vital physiologic functions. Muscle contraction, neuronal excitation, and intracellular signaling processes acquisitively require Ca2+. It is the concerted action of intestine, bone, and kidney that controls the Ca2+ balance through the regulation of intestinal absorption, bone (de)mineralization, and renal excretion of Ca2+, respectively. Along the nephron, fine-tuning of blood Ca2+ levels takes place by Ca2+ reabsorption. The calciotropic hormones regulate Ca2+ transport processes, leading to whole-body Ca2+ homeostasis and, importantly, preserving a constant Ca2+ concentration in the blood. Defects in renal Ca2+ handling can lead to hypercalciuria, consecutive kidney stone formation, and obstructive nephropathy. Here we give an overview of the key players involved in normal Ca2+ management and describe the in-depth investigations on a renal hypercalciuric model of disease, the Trpv5 knockout mouse, which naturally displays molecular adaptations that prevent Ca2+ precipitation in the kidney.

### Structure and mechanism of oxalate transporter oxlT in an oxalate-degrading bacterium in the gut microbiota [^112CEn33]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Oxalate is the smallest dicarboxylate (C 2 O 4 2–) ingested through our daily diet from oxalate-containing foods, such as vegetables, beans and nuts. Oxalate is also a final metabolic product in our body and is partly secreted to the intestine via the systemic circulation. Then it is absorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted through the kidney. However, excess oxalate forms an insoluble salt with blood calcium and causes kidney stone disease (Fig. 1a). Oxalobacter formigenes is an oxalate-degrading bacteria in the gutthat can metabolically decomposes intestinal oxalate and thus contributes significantly to oxalate homeostasis in the host animals including humans. Indeed, patients with cystic fibrosisor inflammatory bowel diseaseor those who have undergone jejunoileal bypass surgeryare known to have low rates of colonisation of O. formigenes and an increased risk of hyperoxaluria and kidney stone formation.

### Incidence of kidney stones after metabolic and bariatric surgery-data from the scandinavian obesity surgery registry [^111k8cGR]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Specific Procedures

The pathophysiology behind kidney stone formation is fat malabsorption, as it causes increased binding of dietary calcium to free fatty acids, thus reducing the available amount of calcium to immobilize dietary oxalate. Furthermore, the presence of unabsorbed bile salts and fatty acids in the colon increases colonic permeability, which raises intestinal oxalate absorption, leading to hyperoxaluria and increased risk of oxalate stone formation.

The highest risk for symptomatic kidney stones was seen after BPD/DS which probably depends on several factors. Firstly, the procedure results in vast physiological changes, including the above-mentioned increase of bile salts and fatty acids in the colon, increasing the risk for oxalate stone formation. Furthermore, as the calcium homeostasis is under stress due to low vitamin D levels, the overall capacity to take care of oxalate can be reduced. Secondly, an altered dietary pattern due to frequent problems with diarrhea, including a relative hypovolemia, may both induce the formation of kidney stones and impair their natural elimination. Thirdly, a higher proportion of BPD/DS patients were men (41.8% vs. 24–19% in the two other procedures). Although sex was not considered a significant risk factor in the multivariable analysis, higher risk has been reported among men compared to women.

This report describes a patient with a type II Caroli' s disease who developed a gallstone ileus. Previous hepaticojejunostomy operations were thought to have facilitated the migration of stones into the bowel and consequent gallstone ileus. This complication, which was strongly suspected from the clinical history, was diagnosed by ultrasound examination despite the absence of aberrantly located stones on plain abdominal x-ray. Ultrasound is useful in the diagnostic workup of patients with bowel obstruction to confirm obstruction itself, to assess its level, and possibly to identify the cause.

### Medical management of stone disease [^112JRGx4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dietary manipulation still remains one of the most important strategies for therapy. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that severe calcium restriction is inappropriate in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis. Dietary recommendations based on recent evidence and the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis are discussed.

Recent Findings

New evidence strongly supports the role of oxalate, salt and animal protein dietary restrictions in the prevention of calcium stone recurrence. Moderate calcium restriction is only effective in absorptive hypercalciuria. Calcium restriction is not effective in other etiologies of calcium stones and its implementation can lead to bone demineralization. New evidence has implicated the lack of intestinal bacteria to be responsible for the degradation of dietary oxalate, with its higher absorption resulting in an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. The role of Oxalobacter formigenes is herein discussed.

Summary

Metabolic abnormalities responsible for stone recurrence are currently identified in 97% of evaluated patients and remission rates of medical prophylaxis in calcium stone formers are approaching 80%. Urinary calcium excretion in most renal stone formers is more dependent on the dietary acid load than on the dietary calcium intake itself. Reducing the acid-ash content of the diet has an impact on decreasing stone recurrence, while preventing bone loss. New evidence associates the decolonization of oxalate degrading intestinal flora with a higher risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, possibly opening the door for biological manipulation as a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

### Conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduces urinary oxalate excretion in short bowel syndrome [^112zm1AD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have steatorrhea, in part because of bile acid malabsorption that causes decreased bile acid secretion into the duodenum and consequent fat maldigestion. In SBS patients with colon in continuity, luminal calcium forms calcium fatty acid soaps rather than precipitating as insoluble calcium oxalate. Soluble oxalate is hyperabsorbed by the colon leading to hyperoxaluria and an increased risk for renal calcium oxalate stones and deposits. The authors hypothesized that oral ingestion of conjugated bile acids would increase fat absorption and thereby decrease calcium fatty acid soap formation and oxalate hyperabsorption.

Methods

The effect of conjugated bile acid replacement therapy (9 g/d) on fecal fat excretion and urine oxalate excretion was measured in an appropriate patient, utilizing the metabolic balance technique. The effects of chronic bile acid replacement therapy on oxalate excretion and nutritional status also were measured in a 3-month outpatient study.

Results

Natural conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion from 119 to 79 g/d (Delta40 g/d), and urinary oxalate excretion from 87 to 64 mg/d (966 to 710 micromol/d; Delta23 mg/d). Cholylsarcosine, a synthetic conjugated bile acid, had similar but less powerful effects. During a 3-month outpatient trial of natural conjugated bile acids (9 g/d), urine oxalate decreased to normal levels (27 mg/d) in association with weight gain, decreased hunger, and decreased hyperphagia.

Conclusion

Conjugated bile acid replacement therapy reduced fecal fat excretion, reduced urinary oxalate excretion, and improved nutritional status in a patient with SBS with colon in continuity, hyperoxaluria, and oxalate nephrolithiasis.

### Nutritional aspects of stone disease [^115jKQhq]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Kidney stones can form during a state of urinary supersaturation. Because urine often is supersaturated with respect to various salts, crystal formation is very common in nonstone formers and stone formers alike, and it may even be absent in kidney stone formers. Thus, uncomplicated crystalluria does not distinguish between stone formers and healthy people. Landmark clinical studies, however, have shown that under identical conditions of dietary and fluid intake, healthy controls almost exclusively excrete single calcium oxalate crystals 3 to 4 microns in diameter, whereas recurrent calcium stone formers pass larger crystals, 10 to 12 microns in diameter, often fused into polycrystalline aggregates 20 to 300 microns in diameter. Thus, those who form stones appear to be more "sensitive" to a given diet than nonstone formers. It is in these subjects that "bad dietary habits" induce nephrolithiasis, making nutritional aspects important. This article reviews the current evidence-based knowledge of the impact of nutrition on the recurrence of a kidney stone.

### Usodiol (ursodiol 200 mg) [^112FvvL8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lithocholic acid causes cholestatic liver injury and can cause death from liver failure in certain species unable to form sulfate conjugates. Lithocholic acid is formed by 7-dehydroxylation of the dihydroxy bile acids (ursodiol and chenodiol) in the gut lumen. The 7-dehydroxylation reaction appears to be alpha-specific, i.e., chenodiol is more efficiently 7-dehydroxylated than ursodiol and, for equimolar doses of ursodiol and chenodiol, levels of lithocholic acid appearing in bile are lower with the former. Man has the capacity to sulfate lithocholic acid. Although liver injury has not been associated with ursodiol therapy, a reduced capacity to sulfate may exist in some individuals, but such a deficiency has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

Pharmacodynamics

Ursodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis and secretion of cholesterol, and also inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol. It appears to have little inhibitory effect on synthesis and secretion into bile of endogenous bile acids, and does not appear to affect secretion of phospholipids into bile.

With repeated dosing, bile ursodeoxycholic acid concentrations reach a steady-state in about 3 weeks. Although insoluble in aqueous media, cholesterol can be solubilized in at least two different ways in the presence of dihydroxy bile acids. In addition to solubilizing cholesterol in micelles, ursodiol acts by an apparently unique mechanism to cause dispersion of cholesterol as liquid crystals in aqueous media. Thus, even though administration of high doses (e.g., 15–18 mg/kg/day) does not result in a concentration of ursodiol higher than 60% of the total bile acid pool, ursodiol-rich bile effectively solubilizes cholesterol. The overall effect of ursodiol is to increase the concentration level at which saturation of cholesterol occurs.

The various actions of ursodiol combine to change the bile of patients with gallstones from cholesterol-precipitating to cholesterol-solubilizing, thus resulting in bile conducive to cholesterol stone dissolution.

After ursodiol dosing is stopped, the concentration of the bile acid in bile falls exponentially, declining to about 5% to 10% of its steady-state level in about 1 week.

### Impact on urinary oxalate levels with use of ezetimibe [^115dtRvr]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Kidney stones are common in the United States with an estimated prevalence of 10.6% in men and 7.1% in women. 1 Nearly 75% of analysed stones are comprised of calcium oxalate with or without trace amounts of secondary minerals such as uric acid or calcium phosphate. 2 Signs and symptoms of nephrolithiasis range from asymptomatic incidental findings on imaging tests to acute renal colic with haematuria, nausea, vomiting and hydronephrosis potentially necessitating urgent urologic intervention. Risk factors for calcium oxalate stone formation include dietary intake of oxalate, sodium, and ascorbic acid, anatomic variants, urine volume plus composition, and other medical conditions such as primary hyperthyroidism, obesity and gastrointestinal disorders. 3

Enteric hyperoxaluria results from fat malabsorption syndromes of the intestinal tract allowing free fatty acids to bind dietary calcium instead of dietary oxalate. 4 Soluble oxalate readily moves into the bloodstream which becomes filtered by the kidneys inducing higher levels of urinary oxalate. Conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and bariatric surgery with bowel resection can precipitate enteric hyperoxaluria along with drugs such as orlistat, an oral lipase inhibitor indicated for weight loss via reducing absorption of dietary fat. 5 In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, for treatment of hyperlipidemia. 6 This drug acts on intestinal lumen limiting the transport of biliary and dietary cholesterol into enterocytes and reducing chylomicron synthesis causing reductions in serum low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. 7 Subsequently, this increases the concentration of free cholesterol in the intestinal tract which may impact oxalate absorption. Previous analysis in a small number of cases has suggested increased urine oxalate levels with use of ezetimibe. In the present study, we examined a relationship of ezetimibe and urinary oxalate, in patients with urinary stone disease, analysing results of multiple urine collections while on and off treatment with ezetimibe.

### Gut microbiome and kidney stone disease: not just an oxalobacter story [^115LvEsR]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Intestinal regulation of oxalate absorption is a complex mechanism, not exclusively reliant on the oxalate-degrading anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes. Using metagenomics, Miller et al. were able to describe a network of bacterial taxa co-occurring with Oxalobacter formigenes in fecal samples from non-stone forming controls and less represented in stone formers. These findings may help to illuminate why previous intervention studies with probiotics have failed to reduce the risk of hyperoxaluria, opening new possibilities for future research.

### Diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis [^112GYVNM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common affliction, affecting approximately 10% of adults. Potentially presenting with acute abdominal or flank pain, nausea, or emesis, it may pose as a general surgical condition. Therefore, recognition, diagnosis, and management concerns are pertinent to the general surgeon. Furthermore, the risk of nephrolithiasis is increased in common general surgical conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, hyperparathyroidism, and short gut. Nephrolithiasis may be induced as a result of general surgical interventions, including gastric bypass and bowel resection with ileostomy. An understanding of this common disease will improve coordination of patient care between urologists and general surgeons.

Nephrolithiasis

Renal stone development in the context of IBD is a long-reported association dating back to the 1970s. Historical series report more than 5 times the prevalence of nephrolithiasis in IBD patients compared with the general population. It has been reported that up to 38% of IBD patients may develop asymptomatic nephrolithiasis. Recently, in a prospective cohort of 2323 IBD patients from Switzerland, Fagagnini et al reported a prevalence of 4.6% and 3% for nephrolithiasis on imaging in those with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, disease activity, history of bowel surgery, NSAID intake, and a lack of physical activity were all associated with the development of renal stones. Similarly, in a cohort of 3104 IBD patients from Mississippi, 6% and 6.7% of UC and CD patients developed urolithiasis, respectively. It is typical to find either visible or invisible hematuria in renal stone disease; however, not all such hematuria is reliably stone mediated, as both gross and microscopic hematuria can be a manifestation of other kidney and ureteric pathologies.

The association between nephrolithiasis and bowel surgery in IBD patients is well established and may occur in patients following ileostomy formation. Torricelli et al evaluated the impact of extensive surgery (total proctocolectomy and either end-ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis) on the urine profile, serum biochemistry, and stone composition in IBD patients. In their case-control study, low urinary volume and hypocitraturia were risk factors associated with nephrolithiasis in IBD patients who underwent total proctocolectomy compared with kidney stone formers without IBD. Calcium oxalate and uric acid stones were most frequent. In the setting of fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea caused by extensive active small bowel inflammation or bowel resection, luminal calcium binds free fatty acids, thereby decreasing the calcium that is available to bind and excrete oxalate in the stool. The resulting increase in intestinal absorption of oxalate leads to so-called "enteric hyperoxaluria" and calcium oxalate stone formation in the kidneys.

### Dominant negative mutation in oxalate transporterassociated with enteric hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis [^117JkYHp]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nephrolithiasis (NL) is the second most frequent renal disease after hypertension affecting up to 10% of individuals worldwide, and in nearly all countries, its prevalence and incidence are reported to be rising.NL is highly recurrent and is a major cause of patient pain, disability and lost working days. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, bone demineralisation and fractures, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

The vast majority of kidney stones is composed of calcium oxalate. Even a small increase in urinary oxalate markedly promotes calcium oxalate crystal formation, and hence, hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for kidney stones. The oxalate found in urine is either from exogenous or endogenous origin. Dietary oxalate, which accounts for almost 50% of the oxalate excreted in urine, is abundantly present in plant and animal sources, absorbed by the gut and excreted unchanged in the urine. In addition, endogenous oxalate production occurs in the liver resulting from the metabolism of glyoxylate. Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that results from increased endogenous oxalate production, whereas secondary hyperoxaluria is acquired and caused by excessive intake of dietary oxalate or of oxalate precursors or by factors that can increase net oxalate absorption by the gastrointestinal tract (eg, low calcium diet, lipid malabsorption and abnormal microbiome). Therefore, identification of the potential mechanisms leading to hyperoxaluria is an important step to optimise care and treatment of oxalate-dependent NL.

In mice, ablation of the oxalate transporter SLC26A6 causes a defect in intestinal oxalate secretion that results in increased net absorption of dietary oxalate, leading to hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate NL. This observation supports the possibility that an additional type of inherited hyperoxaluria might exist in human patients due to mutations leading to defective intestinal oxalate secretion, thereby resulting in enhanced net intestinal absorption of oxalate. Four studies have assessed the impact of SLC26A6 variants in humans. However, these studies either reported no association of SLC26A6 variants with hyperoxaluria or with NL, or reported mutations that disrupt a complex between SLC26A6 and the citrate transporter NaDC-1 thereby causing hypocitraturia as a risk factor for NL. Therefore, no rare human SLC26A6 variant contributing to hyperoxaluria has been reported so far.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^113YG1N4]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects: Orlistat-associated to liver failure

Orlistat, a drug inhibiting pancreatic lipase and aimed at aiding weight loss, has been linked to severe liver-related side effects, including the formation of gallstones, liver inflammation with bile obstruction, and acute liver failure, as highlighted in various studies. Research findings have underscored instances of grave liver conditions connected to the consumption of orlistat, leading to regulatory in safety guidelines regarding its use. In addition, orlistat's potential to cause liver damage and its association with severe liver outcomes, such as gallstone formation, obstructive jaundice, and acute liver failure, have been documented. The drug has also been related to the formation of silent gallstones and significant weight reduction in certain individuals. Despite the low incidence of serious side effects and discontinuation of treatment due to these effects reported in clinical trials, the prevalence of gallstones and obstructive jaundice linked to orlistat demands attention. It is crucial to acknowledge that the occurrence of adverse events, especially those affecting the liver due to orlistat, might be underrepresented in published reports. Therefore, the potential for serious hepatic adverse effects should be carefully considered when prescribing orlistat for weight management.

Adverse effects: Orlistat-associated acute kidney injury and enteric hyperoxaluria

Investigating the reflection of Orlistat, acute kidney injury, and enteric hyperoxaluria is vital due to the rare yet serious adverse effects linked to Orlistat. Enteric hyperoxaluria, which results from enhanced oxalate absorption in the intestine, is known to cause kidney stones, chronic kidney damage, and acute oxalate nephropathy. The mechanisms involved encompass numerous gastrointestinal disorders that lead to poor fat absorption and reduced secretion of oxalate in the gut, which are linked to hyperoxaluria associated with obesity. Moreover, secondary hyperoxaluria, prompted by enhanced absorption of dietary oxalate, can increase the risk of developing kidney stones and oxalate nephropathy, especially in individuals with gastrointestinal complications or those who have undergone intestinal surgeries. This section underscores the importance of investigating the relationship between enteric hyperoxaluria and the onset of acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, and following bariatric surgery.

### Determinants of urolithiasis in patients with intestinal fat malabsorption [^113fW788]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the determinants of urinary stone formation in patients with fat malabsorption, because, although the prevalence of urolithiasis is greater in patients with intestinal diseases, the pathogenetic mechanisms and risk factors associated with urolithiasis in this population remain partially unsolved.

Materials and Methods

The present study retrospectively analyzed the determinants of urolithiasis in 51 patients with fat malabsorption due to different intestinal diseases. Anthropometric, clinical, blood, 24-hour urinary parameters, and dietary intake were assessed.

Results

The resection rate (ie, pancreatic and/or bowel resection) differed significantly between stone formers (SF; n = 10) and nonstone formers (NSF; n = 41; 70% vs 29%; p = 0.027). Urinary citrate was lower (1.606 ± 1.824 vs 3.156 ± 1.968 mmol/24 h; p = 0.027), while oxalate excretion (0.659 ± 0.292 vs 0.378 ± 0.168 mmol/24 h; p = 0.002) and the relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate were greater in SF than NSF (8.16 ± 4.61 vs 3.94 ± 2.93; p = 0.003). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but also high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma β-carotene, and vitamin E concentrations, were significantly diminished, whereas serum aspartate aminotransferase activity was significantly greater in SF compared with NSF. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed resection status as a major extrarenal risk factor for stone formation (odds ratio 5.639).

Conclusion

Increased urinary oxalate and decreased citrate excretion, probably resulting from pancreatic and/or bowel resection with mainly preserved colon, were identified as the most crucial urinary risk factors for stone formation in patients with fat malabsorption. The findings suggest that hyperoxaluria predominantly results from increased colonic permeability for oxalate due to disturbed bile acid metabolism. The impaired status of fat-soluble antioxidants β-carotene and vitamin E indicates severe malabsorptive states associated with an enhanced stone-forming propensity.

### Benefits and challenges to therapeutic targeting of bile acid circulation in cholestatic liver disease [^114jHWFn]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the liver, BA transport is altered in other tissues important for BA cycling in patients with cholestatic liver disease. In the small intestine, the consensus is that BAs negatively regulate IBAT expression and ileal BA absorption. As such, under normal physiological conditions, ileal BA absorption is homeostatically controlled to balance hepatic BA secretion, thereby protecting the hepatocyte from receiving a BA load that exceeds the canalicular transport capacity. In patients with cholestatic liver disease, much less is known regarding the changes in ileal IBAT expression and intestinal BA transport capacity. However, it has been reported that ileal conservation of BAs (as measured using the BA tracer 75 SeCAT) is unchangedor increased, in cholestatic patients. In patients with cholestatic liver disease, BAs and BA metabolites are significantly increased in the systemic circulation and urine. For the kidney, results from animal model studies generally supported the concept that IBAT expression and tubule BA absorption are decreased in response to the increased BA exposure. However the changes in kidney BA reabsorption or IBAT expression appear to be variable between different cholestatic models and between species, with fractional tubular taurocholate reabsorption decreasing from 93.1% to 89.5% in bile duct-ligated rats, and a range of reported cholestasis-associated decreases in kidney IBAT expression or activity in rats (decreased ~40% to 60%,) and wildtype mice (decreased ~0% to 55%; –). Moreover, it is difficult to reconcile the concept that kidney IBAT expression or activity is significantly decreased with the observation that the urinary loss of sulfated BAs (a poor IBAT substrate) versus non-sulfated BAs does not reflect their relative abundance in the plasma of cholestatic patients. Although there is a paucity of data on kidney IBAT expression in patients with liver or kidney disease, kidney IBAT mRNA and protein expression in biopsies collected from patients with chronic renal failure was similar to that of control subjectsand a recent immuno-histochemical analyses of a limited number of kidney biopsies from cholestatic patients documented IBAT protein expression levels that were similar in liver disease subjects with or without cholemic nephropathy. These findings support the concept of persistent, ongoing IBAT-mediated reabsorption of conjugated BA from the renal proximal tubules in cholestatic patients.

Introduction

Gallstones typically develop within the gallbladder or bile ducts. They are categorized into three primary types: cholesterol stones, bilirubin stones, and mixed stones. Among these, cholesterol stonesand those are classified as mixed stones. Gallstones, which may present as either asymptomatic or symptomatic, are chemically classified into two main types: common cholesterol stones and bilirubin (pigment) stones. Black pigment stones are associated with chronic hemolysis, while brown pigment stones are linked to obstructed or infected bile ducts. The majority of gallstones (80–90%) that form in the gallbladder primarily consist of cholesterol (70%), embedded within a matrix of bile pigments, calcium salts, and glycoproteins. In addition to pure and mixed cholesterol stones, pure pigment stones are also identified. Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (bacterial and helminthic deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides) and are more prevalent in Asia. Black pigment stones, which mainly consist of calcium bilirubinate, are found in conditions such as hemolytic anemia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and in patients with cystic fibrosis. The increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin is believed to be the cause of black pigment stones, a phenomenon also observed in patients with ileal dysfunction, consistent with the finding of elevated bilirubin levels in bile in patients with active ileal Crohn's disease or following ileal resection. However, in patients with bile salt malabsorption, other factors leading to biliary cholesterol supersaturation may more likely promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Gallstones are a prevalent condition, with particularly high incidences rates among American Indians, where the prevalence can reach up to 60–70%. In contrast, among White adults in developed countries, the prevalence ranges from 10 to 15%. Gallstones pose a substantial burden on healthcare systems, a challenge anticipated to escalate with an aging and high-risk population. In the United States (US), gallstone disease is the most frequently diagnosed hospitalized condition among gastrointestinal and liver diseases. The majority of individuals with gallstones remain asymptomatic throughout their lives, yet approximately 10 percent of patients will eventually develop symptoms. Complications associated with gallstones, such as cholecystitis, acute suppurative cholangitis, and pancreatitis, impact between 20 and 40% of individuals diagnosed with gallstones. However, approximately 1–2% of these patients experience complications necessitating surgical intervention annually. Furthermore, the presence of gallstones elevates the risk of gallbladder cancer(GBC), a condition typically associated with a poor prognosis. GBC is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, representing 80–95% of biliary tract cancers worldwide. Although relatively uncommon, it ranks sixth among all gastrointestinal malignancies. In 2019, an estimated 12,360 new cases were diagnosed, and 3,960 patients died from GBC and other biliary cancer in the United States. Because of the insidious onset, rapid progression, and early asymptomatic characteristics of GBC, diagnosis is usually not made until intraoperative and postoperative pathological examinations, when the disease is already in moderate and advanced stages, and the therapeutic effect are poor. Indeed, the overall mean survival rate for patients with gallbladder cancer is 6 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. Gallstones have traditionally been regarded as an etiological factor for gallbladder cancer according to case–control studies or autopsy studies. Most patients with gallbladder cancer have gallstones, and gallbladder cancer rates are well correlated with the prevalence of gallstones disease. In support of this association, an inverse correlation between cholecystectomy for gallstones and gallbladder cancer rates has been described. Convincing evidence also exists for the presence of gallstones as a strongly associated factor for gallbladder cancer etiology. It incurs direct costs amounting to $6.5 billion, and the associated expenditures have been escalating rapidly. Consequently, the identification of reliable and well-controlled clinical indicators is crucial for predicting or preventing the development of gallstones.

### Pathophysiology and management of hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy: a review [^113pLuks]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperoxaluria results from either inherited disorders of glyoxylate metabolism leading to hepatic oxalate overproduction (primary hyperoxaluria), or increased intestinal oxalate absorption (secondary hyperoxaluria). Hyperoxaluria may lead to urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate and crystal formation, causing urolithiasis and deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney parenchyma, a condition termed oxalate nephropathy. Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy, whose diagnosis is frequently delayed and prognosis too often poor. Fortunately, novel promising targeted therapeutic approaches are on the horizon in patients with primary hyperoxaluria. Patients with secondary hyperoxaluria frequently have long-standing hyperoxaluria-enabling conditions, a fact suggesting the role of triggers of acute kidney injury such as dehydration. Current standard of care in these patients includes management of the underlying cause, high fluid intake, and use of calcium supplements. Overall, prompt recognition of hyperoxaluria and associated oxalate nephropathy is crucial because optimal management may improve outcomes.

### Intra-tubular deposits, urine and stone composition are divergent in patients with ileostomy [^1144GWAt]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with ileostomy typically have recurrent renal stones and produce scanty, acidic, sodium-poor urine because of abnormally large enteric losses of water and sodium bicarbonate. Here we used a combination of intra-operative digital photography and biopsy of the renal papilla and cortex to measure changes associated with stone formation in seven patients with ileostomy. Papillary deformity was present in four patients and was associated with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates. All patients had interstitial apatite plaque, as predicted from their generally acid, low-volume urine. Two patients had stones attached to plaque; however, all patients had crystal deposits that plugged the ducts of Bellini and inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). Despite acid urine, all crystal deposits contained apatite, and five patients had deposits of sodium and ammonium acid urates. Stones were either uric acid or calcium oxalate as predicted by supersaturation, however, there was a general lack of supersaturation for calcium phosphate as brushite, sodium, or ammonium acid urate because of the overall low urine pH. This suggests that local tubular pH exceeds that of bulk urine. Despite low urine pH, patients with an ileostomy resemble those with obesity bypass, in whom IMCD apatite crystal plugs are found. They are, however, unlike these bypass patients in having interstitial apatite plaque. IMCD plugging with sodium and ammonium acid urate has not been found previously and appears to correlate with formation of uric acid stones.

### A single urine sodium measurement may validly estimate 24-hour urine sodium excretion in patients with an ileostomy [^112G2g3o]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

In healthy volunteers with intact intestines, the correlation between sodium intake and renal excretion was strong, but this was not the case for the ileostomates. Some of our analyses were inconclusive, but they indicate that the osmolality of a beverage may have a greater impact on ileostomates' sodium balance than their total sodium intake. This should be investigated in future studies, as well as the effects of oral sodium administration in different doses. Further investigations may also evaluate whether 20 mmol sodium/L is too conservative a limit for indication of treatment. Ng et al has demonstrated that patients with an ileostomy who had a natriuresis below 100 mmol/d present lower urine volume, urinary calcium and magnesium levels, body mass index, lean body mass, and bone status than ileostomates with a higher natriuresis. 3

Assessment of sodium balance presupposes normal kidney function, and we found creatinine clearance to be normal in all but 2 participants. These 2 patients were the oldest participants in this study and did not have the lowest levels of natriuresis. We have no reason to suspect that a decreased renal function is responsible for a low natriuresis in the ileostomy patients, and we expect that it is solely explained by a negative sodium balance.

Sodium depletion and dehydration should be monitored and treated to prevent both life‐threatening states, such as kidney failure, as well as fatigue and other symptoms that may negatively impact the patients' general well‐being. Dependency on home parenteral nutrition or fluid may decrease quality of life, 39 and we anticipate that the patients would rather modify their oral fluid intake than be admitted regularly to receive parenteral fluid support. Some studies recommend ileostomates to aim for a dietary sodium intake of 250 mmol/d, 13, 19 corresponding to 14.6 g table salt/d. A recent cross‐sectional study assessed sodium intake in 40 ileostomates to be 76 (± 58) mmol sodium/d, 40 which seems low in comparison. It may be problematic if ileostomates comply to the general health recommendations to decrease sodium intake, particularly if they mainly ingest hypo‐osmolar fluids. Although our results regarding total sodium intake were inconclusive, it is clinically important if the fluid intake rather than the diet‐related sodium intake drives sodium absorption in patients with an ileostomy. A range of parameters, including habitual diet intake, may have affected the ileostomates' postresection adaptation, 41 which in combination with beverage osmolality could potentially explain why different patients have various reactions to sodium intake.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^115WS6TY]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

The definition of gallstone ileus is the obstruction of bowel (whether small intestine or large intestine, also called "gallstone coleus") due to the impaction of one or more gallstones. To achieve this, the impacted stones are usually greater than 2–2.5 cm in diameter. Smaller stones pass through the lumen of the bowel as "rolling stones" and rarely cause obstruction. However, cases have been reported of multiple stones causing obstruction as an inspissated mass.

Common places for gallstones to be lodged include the ileum and ileocecal valve due to the anatomical narrow lumen in 60% of cases, jejunum in up to 16%, stomach in 15%, and colon (gallstone coleus) in 2–8% of cases. Rare cases of gallstone impaction have been reported at sites of strictures, e.g. Crohn's or diverticulitis, and stenosis, e.g. at the neck of a Meckel's diverticulum.

Obstructing gallstones generally migrate to the bowel via bilioenteric fistulas, the most common of which is a fistulous connection from the gallbladder to the duodenum (85% of cases). These fistulas form following chronic erosion by a stone or recurrent/chronic inflammation of the gallbladder wall, i.e. calculous cholecystitis. However, reports demonstrate that only 25–72% of gallstone ileus cases demonstrate a previous history of gallstone disease. Other types of fistulas include hepatoduodenal, choledochoduodenal, cholecystogastric, cholecystojejunal, and cholecystocolonic. Rare case reports have demonstrated enteric fistulation into bowel secondary to gallbladder malignancy.

Other, rarer, mechanisms of enteric gallstone migration include the passage of gallstones through the ampulla of Vater followed by in situ growth, or inspissation of multiple small stones, or the inadvertent iatrogenic migration of gallstones during manipulation of the gallbladder or ducts (e.g. during ERCP or a cholecystectomy).

### Disorders of bile formation and biliary transport [^115raUtY]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

A wide range of cholestatic liver diseases result from various primary defects in bile formation. Clinical features include jaundice, pruritus, failure to thrive, fat malabsorption, cholelithiasis, and variably progressive cirrhosis. Accurate diagnosis of these disorders is essential for determination of prognosis and selection of the most appropriate therapies. Severe genetic defects in canalicular bile acid and phospholipid excretion lead to progressive liver disease that often requires liver transplantation. Defects in bile acid biosynthesis and aminophospholipid transport may be responsive to medical or non-transplant surgical approaches.

### Stones from bowel disease [^114NTDSf]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are increased in patients with bowel disease, particularly those who have had resection of part of their gastrointestinal tract. These stones are usually CaOx, but there is a marked increase in the tendency to form uric acid stones, as well, particularly in patients with colon resection. These patients all share a tendency to chronic volume contraction due to loss of water and salt in diarrheal stool, which leads to decreased urine volumes. They also have decreased absorption, and therefore diminished urinary excretion, of citrate and magnesium, which normally act as inhibitors of CaOx crystallization. Patients with colon resection and ileostomy form uric acid stones, as loss of bicarbonate in the ileostomy effluent leads to formation of an acid urine. This, coupled with low urine volume, decreases the solubility of uric acid, causing crystallization and stone formation. Prevention of stones requires treatment with alkalinizing agents to raise urine pH to about 6.5, and attempts to increase urine volume, which increases the solubility of uric acid and prevents crystallization. Patients with small bowel resection may develop steatorrhea; if the colon is present, they are at risk of hyperoxaluria due to increased permeability of the colon to oxalate in the presence of fatty acids, and increased concentrations of free oxalate in the bowel lumen due to fatty acid binding of luminal calcium. EH leads to supersaturation of urine with respect to CaOx, in conjunction with low volume, hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria. Therapy involves a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, attempts to increase urine volume, and agents such as calcium given to bind oxalate in the gut lumen. Correction of hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria are also helpful.

### Prevalence of nephrolithiasis in patients with ileal bladder substitutes [^117RsWnx]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the effect of ileal bladder substitutes with preservation of the ileocecal valve and distal 25 cm of ileum on nephrolithiasis.

Methods

We reviewed a consecutive series of 518 patients (44 women and 474 men) with ileal orthotopic bladder substitution in whom 55 to 65 cm of ileum was resected but with preservation of the ileocecal valve and distal 25 cm of ileum, to determine prevalence of nephrolithiasis as well as bicarbonate, base excess, creatinine levels, and urinary pH at time of stone diagnosis and 2 years before it.

Results

Four male patients with a median age of 66 years (range, 50 to 70 years) developed nephrolithiasis after ileal bladder substitute, for a total of five calculi. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis in this retrospective cohort is thus 1% (5 of 518). They developed the calculi after a median follow-up of 8 years (range, 4 to 17 years). The four patients were diagnosed with calculi at 2.3, 3, 10, 10.3, and 14 years after bladder substitute. Two of the stones were uric acid calculi; the remaining three were calcium oxalate. None of our patients were acidotic or had elevated serum creatinines at time of stone formation. Urinary pH determined once in spontaneously voided urine at the time of stone diagnosis was pH 6.0 for the two uric acid calculi and pH 7.0 for the remaining calculi.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrates a low prevalence of calculi in our cohort.

### Hyperoxaluria: diagnosis and treatment [^114WCzne]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperoxaluria is categorized as either primary (PH), enteric (EH), or idiopathic (IH). The PHs are a group of ultra-rare genetic disorders resulting in oxalate overproduction that can result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Novel RNA inhibitory drugs are now available to treat PH that significantly reduced the risk of kidney stones. EH is driven by fat malabsorption and enhanced intestinal oxalate absorption, which in severe cases can result in ESRD. Therapies for EH are limited and research is focused on novel strategies to reduce intestinal oxalate absorptions. Causes for IH are unclear and may involve multiple mechanisms.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^112rKmx4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Short bowel syndrome — selected complications and management considerations are summarized in Table 2. For central venous catheter complications (infection, occlusion, thrombosis, breakage), management includes aseptic technique during placement and dressing changes, appropriate catheter and insertion site, proper catheter care and monitoring for infection, and catheter removal when no longer needed. For hepatobiliary complications (steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, cholelithiasis), approaches include avoid excesses and deficiencies in PN formula, limit intravenous lipid dose to < 1 g/kg/d, reduce/eliminate soybean-based intravenous lipid emulsion, use non–soybean-based intravenous lipid emulsions, cycle PN, increase oral/enteral intake, identify/treat sepsis or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and prophylactic cholecystectomy when abdominal surgery is being undertaken for other reasons. For metabolic bone disease, management includes periodic assessment of bone mineral density, monitoring calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D status with supplementation as needed, correcting metabolic acidosis when present, and specific osteoporosis treatments. Kidney injury measures include monitoring urine output periodically and maintaining adequate urine output with increased fluid intake, a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, potassium citrate supplementation, and calcium carbonate supplementation. Chronic diarrhea options include diet/oral fluid modifications, oral rehydration solution, antidiarrheal agents, antisecretory agents (proton pump inhibitor [PPI], histamine-2 receptor antagonist [H2RA]), somatostatin analogs, and intestinotrophic factor. For protein energy malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte and/or micronutrient deficiencies, management includes monitoring vitamin, mineral and electrolyte levels with supplementation as needed, optimizing oral diet and fluid intake, parenteral support (hydration, nutrition), and intestinotrophic factor.

### Associations between net gastrointestinal alkali absorption, 24-hour urine lithogenic factors, and kidney stones [^117HaH3J]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is not clear whether kidney stone formers have an abnormal handling of alkali and acid precursors in the gut, which might affect urine composition and ultimately stone formation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the determinants of net gastrointestinal alkali absorption and its associations with key urinary parameters in a large group of stone formers and non-stone formers.

Methods

Data were collected from three independent cohorts with at least one 24-hour urine collection. We explored potential determinants of net gastrointestinal alkali absorption and the association between net gastrointestinal alkali absorption, urinary parameters, and stone former status. Finally, we estimated the proportion of the association between urine parameters and stone former status explained by differences in net gastrointestinal alkali absorption.

Results

The analysis included 6067 participants (1102 men and 4965 women; 698 and 1804 of whom were stone formers, respectively). Average net gastrointestinal alkali absorption values were consistently lower in stone formers across the three cohorts (from -15.0 to -4.9 mEq/d). Age was directly associated with net gastrointestinal alkali absorption, whereas body mass index and net endogenous acid production were inversely associated. Net gastrointestinal alkali absorption was inversely associated with supersaturation for calcium oxalate, uric acid, and renal net acid excretion and directly associated with supersaturation for calcium phosphate, urine pH, and citrate. The odds of being a stone former was 15% (13%-17%) lower per 10 mEq/24 hours higher net gastrointestinal alkali absorption. Differences in net gastrointestinal alkali absorption explained a modest amount of the differences between stone formers and non-stone formers for supersaturation for calcium oxalate (6.3%) and a sizable amount for supersaturation for uric acid (15.2%), urine pH (38.3%), citrate (26.2%), and renal net acid excretion (63.4%).

Conclusions

Kidney stone formers have lower net gastrointestinal alkali absorption, and this explains differences in urine composition and the likelihood of stone formation.

### Tests that now deserve to be more widely adopted in IBD clinical practice [^1134iZkd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) has been reported in up to 50% of adult patients with CD, especially those with ileal involvement and dysfunction or resection. Depending on the extent of disease or resection, this usually predisposes to diarrhoea, but may also cause steatorrhoea with malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins and formation of gallstones and kidney stones. Secretory diarrhoea (bile acid diarrhoea) is due to the effects of unabsorbed bile acids (BAs) on various mechanisms, such as adenylate cyclase affecting water and electrolyte absorption, in the colonic epithelium. This may be compounded by an increase in intestinal permeability and also motility, produced by actions of primary and secondary bile acids on the farnesoid X and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptors.

There are several causes for the increase in BAs entering the colon in active ileal CD. Ileal dysfunction produces malabsorption of BAs, due to a decrease in BA absorptive transporters, particularly the apical sodium-linked BA transporter. Active inflammatory disease also reduces synthesis of the regulatory hormone, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), and this results in excess BA synthesis, with increased BA precursors. Similarly, ileal resection reduces the amount of specialized tissue for active BA absorption and FGF19 production. These changes in the enterohepatic circulation and synthesis of BAs can be measured to help the differential diagnosis of symptoms in people with CD.

### Enteric hyperoxaluria: role of microbiota and antibiotics [^117BeEos]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Enteric hyperoxaluria is commonly observed in malabsorptive conditions including Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Its incidence is increasing secondary to an increased prevalence of both disorders. In this review, we summarize the evidence linking the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria.

Recent Findings

In enteric hyperoxaluria, fat malabsorption leads to increased binding of calcium to free fatty acids resulting in more soluble oxalate in the intestinal lumen. Bile acids and free fatty acids in the lumen also cause increased gut permeability allowing more passive absorption of oxalate. In recent years, there is more interest in the role of the gut microbiota in modulating urinary oxalate excretion in enteric hyperoxaluria, stemming from our knowledge that microbiota in the intestines can degrade oxalate. Oxalobacter formigenes reduced urinary oxalate in animal models of RYGB. The contribution of other oxalate-degrading organisms and the microbiota community to the pathophysiology of enteric hyperoxaluria are also currently under investigation.

Summary

Gut microbiota might play a role in modulating the risk of enteric hyperoxaluria through oxalate degradation and bile acid metabolism. O. formigenes is a promising therapeutic target in this population; however, further studies in humans are needed to test its effectiveness.

### Hyperoxaluria: a gut-kidney axis? [^115MyAod]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperoxaluria leads to urinary calcium oxalate (CaOx) supersaturation, resulting in the formation and retention of CaOx crystals in renal tissue. CaOx crystals may contribute to the formation of diffuse renal calcifications (nephrocalcinosis) or stones (nephrolithiasis). When the innate renal defense mechanisms are suppressed, injury and progressive inflammation caused by these CaOx crystals, together with secondary complications such as tubular obstruction, may lead to decreased renal function and in severe cases to end-stage renal failure. For decades, research on nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis mainly focused on both the physicochemistry of crystal formation and the cell biology of crystal retention. Although both have been characterized quite well, the mechanisms involved in establishing urinary supersaturation in vivo are insufficiently understood, particularly with respect to oxalate. Therefore, current therapeutic strategies often fail in their compliance or effectiveness, and CaOx stone recurrence is still common. As the etiology of hyperoxaluria is diverse, a good understanding of how oxalate is absorbed and transported throughout the body, together with a better insight in the regulatory mechanisms, is crucial in the setting of future treatment strategies of this disorder. In this review, the currently known mechanisms of oxalate handling in relevant organs will be discussed in relation to the different etiologies of hyperoxaluria. Furthermore, future directions in the treatment of hyperoxaluria will be covered.

### Gallstone ileus 30 years after cholecystectomy and hepaticojejunostomy [^116VrUpa]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Gallstone ileus occurs when the small or large intestine is obstructed by a gallstone and is a rare occurrence in a post-cholecystectomy patient. Non-specific clinical symptoms and inconsistent imaging results often lead to a delay in diagnosis. Complex anatomy, such as a Roux-en-Y biliary-enteric anastomosis, can increase the risk of stone formation and further confound a potential case of gallstone ileus. Here, we present a rare case of gallstone ileus at the anastomosis site of a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy done 30 years prior for a common bile duct injury during a cholecystectomy. The possibility of negative CT findings, pattern of presentation on imaging as intussusception, and potential pathomechanism of gallstone formation in post-cholecystectomy patients are discussed. Through this case and review of similar cases, we emphasise the need for further study of post-cholecystectomy gallstone ileus and the importance of clinical suspicion during diagnosis.

### Mechanisms of the intestinal and urinary microbiome in kidney stone disease [^117Eg99g]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2022). High credibility.

Kidney stone disease affects ~10% of the global population and the incidence continues to rise owing to the associated global increase in the incidence of medical conditions associated with kidney stone disease including, for example, those comprising the metabolic syndrome. Considering that the intestinal microbiome has a substantial influence on host metabolism, that evidence has suggested that the intestinal microbiome might have a role in maintaining oxalate homeostasis and kidney stone disease is unsurprising. In addition, the discovery that urine is not sterile but, like other sites of the human body, harbours commensal bacterial species that collectively form a urinary microbiome, is an additional factor that might influence the induction of crystal formation and stone growth directly in the kidney. Collectively, the microbiomes of the host could influence kidney stone disease at multiple levels, including intestinal oxalate absorption and direct crystal formation in the kidneys.

### Metabolic and nutritional consequences of urinary diversion using intestinal segments to reconstruct the urinary tract [^1147pDdt]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Intestinal segments in various forms have been used to reconstruct the urinary tract since the mid-1800s. Currently, many different forms of continent and incontinent diversion options exist. Incorporating bowel mucosa within the urinary tract leads to predictable metabolic and nutritional consequences. The use of ileum or colon can cause a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, osteoporosis, fat malabsorption, urinary calculi, and ammoniagenic encephalopathy. Due to metabolic and nutritional consequences associated with the use of jejunum and gastric segments, the use of these bowel segments is not recommended.

### Who makes uric acid stones and why – observations from a renal stones clinic [^112pNCCF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Excessively acidic urine is the dominant factor in uric acid stone formation. Recent evidence implicating insulin resistance has revived interest in its causation. We reviewed data on uric acid stone formers attending a general stones clinic to find out whether this supports and adds to current concepts.

Methods

A retrospective database study of 1504 stone formers investigated at the Southampton renal stones clinic from 1990 to March 2007. Uric acid stone formers and idiopathic calcium stone formers were compared using non-parametric tests.

Results

Fifty-nine patients (3.9%; 43 men) had uric acid stones. In men the commonest associated conditions were diabetes (20%), gout (20%) and an ileostomy (15%); in women, diabetes (33%), urinary infections (27%) and hyperparathyroidism (20%). Most patients with diabetes (85% of men, 75% of women), however, produced calcium stones. Risk factors did not differ significantly between calcium and uric acid stone formers with diabetes, gout or ileostomies. The median urine pH of men with idiopathic calcium stones was 6.20, idiopathic uric acid stones 5.47, diabetes 5.68, gout 6.05, diabetes and gout 5.20 and ileostomy 5.10. Plasma urate was higher with gout and idiopathic uric acid stones. Urate excretion was increased in gout. Oxalate excretion was lower with idiopathic uric acid stones (new finding). Urine volume decreased and oxalate concentration increased with ileostomy.

Conclusions

Uric acid stones are increased in diabetes, but most patients with diabetes make calcium stones. Different mechanisms may explain low pH with diabetes, gout and idiopathic stones. Low oxalate excretion with idiopathic urate stones needs confirmation.

### End point considerations for clinical trials in enteric hyperoxaluria [^114BDagE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Enteric hyperoxaluria is a medical condition characterized by elevated urinary oxalate excretion due to increased gastrointestinal oxalate absorption. Causative features include fat malabsorption and/or increased intestinal permeability to oxalate. Enteric hyperoxaluria has long been known to cause nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, and, more recently, an association with CKD and kidney failure has been shown. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria, and it is unclear what end points should be used to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs and biologics for this condition. This study represents work of a multidisciplinary group convened by the Kidney Health Initiative to review the evidence supporting potential end points for clinical trials in enteric hyperoxaluria. A potential clinical outcome is symptomatic kidney stone events. Potential surrogate end points include (1) an irreversible loss of kidney function as a surrogate for progression to kidney failure, (2) asymptomatic kidney stone growth/new stone formation observed on imaging as a surrogate for symptomatic kidney stone events, (3) urinary oxalate and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation as surrogates for the development of symptomatic kidney stone events, and (4) plasma oxalate as a surrogate for the development of the clinical manifestations of systemic oxalosis. Unfortunately, because of gaps in the data, this Kidney Health Initiative workgroup was unable to provide definitive recommendations. Work is underway to obtain robust information that can be used to inform trial design and medical product development in this space.

NASPGHAN IBD — nutritional assessment and micronutrient monitoring: Physicians caring for children with IBD should complete a general dietary and nutritional assessment at each office visit, and energy requirements in this subgroup of patients should be the same as all pediatric patients. In Crohn disease (CD) with small bowel involvement, periodic assessment of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels is advised and those with significant small bowel involvement or prior small bowel resection are at increased risk for zinc deficiency; routine nutritional laboratory assessments may include yearly measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Measurement of CBC as well as serum iron is useful when there is concern for iron deficiency anemia, and if there is a history of significant small bowel disease or the alkaline phosphatase is low in a particular patient, zinc deficiency should be assessed. Clinicians should be suspicious about nephrolithiasis in children with a history of significant small bowel disease, surgical resection, or a positive family history; when clinically indicated, measurement of urine creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, volume, and pH should be obtained.

Nephrolithiasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis are systemic diseases that can have extraintestinal manifestations in 6 to 20% of cases. These manifestations often lead to rheumatologic care and can include uveitis, iritis, ankylosing spondylitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and erythema nodosum. Nephrolithiasis is also more common in patients with IBD than in the general population, as high as 9–18%, especially those with Crohn's disease (51.52) (Fig. 5). The types of stones can be calcium oxalate, uric acid or mixed stones. In IBD, hypercalciuria itself is rare, unless an underlying genetic defect or in cases of excess Vitamin D repletion. Risk factors for kidney stone formation in Crohn's disease include the following: (1) malabsorption of fatty acids/bile salts. Excess fatty acid bile salt presence binds intraluminal intestinal calcium. This leads to less insoluble calcium excretion in the stool and hence less calcium to bind oxalate. This in turn leads to higher oxalate absorption from the colon and increase in oxalate in the systemic circulation and hence the urine. This mechanism does not occur if colon is surgically absent. (2) A second important mechanism is lack of natural inhibitors of stone formation- less urinary citrate and magnesium due to gastrointestinal losses. (3) Chronic diarrheal illness also leads to chronic volume depletion and low urine volume with increased risk of super saturation of all salts. (4) In patients with ileostomy there are large losses of bicarbonate that leads to chronic systemic acidosis and acidic urine pH. This acidic urine pH and low urine volume increases risk of uric acid and calcium oxalate stone risk. (5) Finally, there may also be lower levels of the oxalate fermenting bacteria, Oxalobacter Fromigenes, contributing to increase in intestinal oxalate availability. Patients with ulcerative colitis have increased risk of uric acid and calcium oxalate stones, especially with ileostomy, due to low urine volume, low urine pH but do not have the increase urine oxalate typical of Crohn's patients.

### Chenodiol [^111PLaGN]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY At therapeutic doses, Chenodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis of both cholesterol and cholic acid, gradually replacing the latter and its metabolite, deoxycholic acid in an expanded bile acid pool. These actions contribute to biliary cholesterol desaturation and gradual dissolution of radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in the presence of a gall-bladder visualized by oral cholecystography. Chenodiol has no effect on radiopaque (calcified) gallstones or on radiolucent bile pigment stones.

Chenodiol is well absorbed from the small intestine and taken up by the liver where it is converted to its taurine and glycine conjugates and secreted in bile. Owing to 60% to 80% first-pass hepatic clearance, the body pool of Chenodiol resides mainly in the enterohepatic circulation; serum and urinary bile acid levels are not significantly affected during Chenodiol therapy.

At steady-state, an amount of Chenodiol near the daily dose escapes to the colon and is converted by bacterial action to lithocholic acid. About 80% of the lithocholate is excreted in the feces; the remainder is absorbed and converted in the liver to its poorly absorbed sulfolithocholyl conjugates. During Chenodiol therapy there is only a minor increase in biliary lithocholate, while fecal bile acids are increased three to fourfold.

### The alteration of urine composition due to stone material present in the urinary tract [^1154ju9H]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Based on a recently introduced mathematical model approach we show that uroliths located in the urinary tract (UT) can substantially deplete the urinary concentrations of lithogenic constituents by continuous growth.

Methods

To illustrate the influence of the urinary depletion effect on urinalysis, a "typical" calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone former, presently not stone-free, was investigated. Serum and urine samples were analyzed. Several metabolic tests were performed. Crystallization risk according to the BONN-Risk-Index (BRI) and the relative supersaturation in respect to CaOx (RS(CaOx)) were determined. X-ray films taken before and after a period of six months were evaluated in order to estimate stone size and average stone growth rate taken place within that period.

Results

Regarding CaOx urolithiasis the urine samples show a pathologically altered pH, a low 24h-citric acid excretion, and a low 24h-urine volume. Neither calcium nor oxalate excretion data reflect values indicating these substances as risk factors. However, BRI and RS(CaOx) reflect a high crystallization risk. The patient's intestinal oxalate absorption is high. Applying the depletion model, the patient's 24h-urine composition shifts from normooxaluric to hyperoxaluric.

Conclusion

In the patient, a hitherto undetected hyperoxaluria is diagnosed when in-vivo stone growth is taken into account. This is a clear indication that the metabolic status can only be evaluated correctly in "stone-free" patients. Any stone material present in the UT must be considered in urinalysis interpretation as the stone-related urinary depletion effect is of high clinical relevance. A helpful nomogram is presented, allowing the estimation of the extent of urinary depletion caused by CaOx uroliths.

Table 2.
Dynamic changes of bile acids in sera and stool in different gut disorders.

In IBD, the inflammation of the intestinal wall is an important contributing factor to the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea, causing the impaired ability of solute and water reabsorption, destruction of epithelium integrity, disturbance of the intestinal microorganism homeostasis, and deficiency of specific transport mechanisms in the gut. Actually, the diarrhea is in consequence of the impaired capacity of absorptive fluid, which is physiologically estimated to be 4.5–5 l/day. Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is a symptom that occurs frequently in patients with IBD, especially in patients with ileal CD. It has been reported that patients with only colon disease have markedly decreased ileal bile acid absorption. These results are also supported by a study in pediatric IBD, showing that 86% of CD patients with persistent diarrhea have no or only mild disease activity. Interestingly, another study found that expression of apical sodium/bile acid cotransporting polypeptide responsible for ileal bile acid reabsorption in ileal biopsies from the non-inflammatory site of CD patients was significantly reduced, suggesting that the diarrhea may be a potential protective mechanism whereby the accumulated toxic bile acids are diluted and excreted outside the body in time that epithelial integrity and function can be protected from the damage of toxicity of bile acids. This idea is supported by the observation that, despite elevated levels of colonic bile acids, bile acid-induced diarrhea is not associated with significant alterations in mucosal histology. Also, bile acids have been shown to impair the intestinal epithelium integrity, causing increased intestinal permeability. This observation has gained further new support from the latest findings showing that GPBAR1 is very crucial for the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and plays important roles in the development of experimental colitis. In fact, increased mucosal permeability with destroyed epithelial tight junction induced by the accumulation of bile acids in the intestine can also be present in asymptomatic CD patients. Bacterial overgrowth is a frequent phenotype in patients with active IBD, which may have a dramatic influence on bile acid metabolism. Steatorrhea often occurs due to the impaired ability of unconjugated bile acids to form micelles once the colonic bacteria transit into the proximal parts of the small intestine, leading to premature and increased deconjugation of bile acid conjugates. In addition, kidney stone disease has a high clinical correlation with CD, and its pathogenesis is closely related to the damaged intestinal bile acid metabolism because DCA increases oxalate absorption. In patients with CD, malabsorbed bile acids and fatty acids bind calcium ions in the intestine, thereby preventing the formation of oxalate. Reabsorbed oxalic acid is increased and secreted into the urine, promoting the formation of hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. Pigment gallstone disease in patients with CD has the same mechanism. Because of BAM, enhanced reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin from the intestinal lumen leads to an acceleration of its enterohepatic circulation with biliary hypersecretion of bilirubin.

Discussion and conclusions

Kidney stone formation and nephrocalcinosis

Kidney stones develop when dissolved salts in the urine become solids. This occurs when salts exceed solubility ratios (Tables 1 and 2). This is called super saturation. Four different variables can lead to supersaturation: (1) Low urine volume; (2) excess excretion of solutes such as calcium, oxalate, or uric acid; (3) lack of natural inhibitors of crystal formation, such as citrate or magnesium; and (4) urine pH. Urine volume is the main determinant of super saturation. In most kidney stone formers, urine calcium and urine oxalate concentrations are the main determinants of kidney stone formation and contribute to calcium oxalate super saturation and calcium oxalate stone formation. Kidney stone formation is dependent not only on the urine solute concentrations but also on urine pH, with alkaline urine pH contributing to calcium phosphate super saturation and acidic urine pH contributing to calcium oxalate and uric acid supersaturation. Urine pH in turn is dependent on renal acid handling. Urine contains many substances, most notably citrate, that hinder the formation of solid calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Urine citrate reduces super saturation by binding calcium and hence inhibits growth of calcium crystals. Hence, deficient levels of urine citric acid can contribute to stone formation irrespective of urine pH. Adequate amount of urinary magnesium is also believed to inhibit calcium oxalate formation by binding to urine oxalate.

Table 1
Factors that lead to stone formation

Table 2
Recommended lab workup for patients with recurrent kidney stone

Calcium oxalate stone formation correlates directly with urine calcium and /or oxalate level and indirectly with urine volume, pH and citrate. Normal urine citrate level is greater than 350–400 mg/day. Conventional upper limits of urine calcium for women is about 250 mg per day and about 300 mg per day for men. Patients who exceed this level of urine calcium require further diagnostic evaluation. This should include assessment of serum calcium levels, parathyroid hormone levels, and evaluation of 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin-D (calcitriol) levels. The upper limit for normal oxalate is around 40 mg/day. Patients with excess oxalate require a careful assessment for fat malabsorption as well as careful dietary history for possible diet excess (including tea, spinach, certain nuts, wheat germ, or vitamin C). (Table 2).

### Causal effects of inflammatory bowel diseases on the risk of kidney stone disease: a two-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization [^115L6AbT]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), belongs to a group of chronic diseases occurring in the gastrointestinal tract with increasing incidence across the world. The number of patients suffering from IBD worldwide is expected to grow exponentially over the next few decades, which will pose a huge challenge to healthcare systems. In addition to the characteristic symptoms of gastric discomfort and diarrhea, extraintestinal symptoms frequently occur in patients with IBD. Studies have reported that IBD is related to various extraintestinal manifestations, containing ophthalmologic, genitourinary, dermatologic, hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, pancreatic and hepatobiliary systems. However, CD and UC can affect the development of extraintestinal complications to varying degrees.

The incidence of kidney stone disease (KSD) increases across sex, race and age, affecting approximately 15% of the population. For the majority of the population, KSD is caused by a multifactorial etiology involving genetic and environmental factors. Genetic approaches studying KSD have uncovered that the following play significant roles in the formation of renal stones: channels and transporters; ions, protons and amino acids; the metabolic pathways for cysteine, vitamin D, oxalate, uric acid and purines; and the calcium-sensitive receptor signaling pathway. Extraintestinal manifestations are quite common in patients with IBD, and kidney stone disease has been reported with increasing frequency in these patients and with a higher risk of CD than UC. As for its relevant pathogenesis, hypercalcemia and osteoporosis due to long-term corticosteroid exposure may contribute to the development of calcium-containing calculus. Furthermore, the gut microbiota residing in the human gastrointestinal tract has been reported to be involved in the formation of renal calculus, making the interaction between IBD and the gut microbiota a key risk factor. In a large cohort study, the risk of urolithiasis was related to anti-TNF therapy and surgery. Small bowel resection or ileostomy will alter intestinal absorption in patients diagnosed with IBD. Interestingly, a clinical trial showed kidney stones were discovered in none of the UC patients but in some of the CD patients. Meanwhile, hyperoxaluria occurred in 36% of patients with CD but was absent in those with UC, suggesting the occurrence of renal calculi might be related to the patients with CD. Nevertheless, the genetic correlation and causal relationship between IBD and KSD remain unclear at present.

### Bile metabolism and lithogenesis: an update [^117Si924]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Bile is composed of multiple macromolecules, including bile acids, free cholesterol, phospholipids, bilirubin, and inorganic ions that aid in digestion, nutrient absorption, and disposal of the insoluble products of heme catabolism. The synthesis and release of bile acids is tightly controlled and dependent on feedback mechanisms that regulate enterohepatic circulation. Alterations in bile composition, impaired gallbladder relaxation, and accelerated nucleation are the principal mechanisms leading to biliary stone formation. Various physiologic conditions and disease states alter bile composition and metabolism, thus increasing the risk of developing gallstones.

### Chronic calcium pyrophosphate crystal inflammatory arthritis induced by extreme hypomagnesemia in short bowel syndrome [^111kvg41]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of short bowel syndrome (SBS) with mild, moderate or severe intestinal failure and/ or associated metabolic complications are estimated to occur if less than 200 cm of small bowel have been retained. It has been reported to show a wide spectrum of potential complications like underweight, food intolerance, osteoporosis, steatorrhea, chologenic diarrhea with loss of bile salts, electrolytes and vitamins as well as megaloblastic anemia or renal calcium oxalate stone formation etc. Although SBS patients are often primarily referred to gastroenterological or nutritional hospitals, several other medical disciplines may be involved because of extraintestinal affections or complications like hormonal dysbalances, neurological symptoms (polyneuropathy), psychiatric or psychosocial co-morbidities (anxiety, chronic fatigue and depression) or orthopedic complications (osteoporosis) etc. Thus, often only an interdisciplinary approach may be helpful to manage patients with SBS, and at least, each patient has to be treated individually, based on more or less conserved intestinal functions or manifested deficiencies. The present case demonstrates how difficult clinical challenges can be in SBS and shows how intestinal resection may lead to severe metabolic consequences, recurrent joint attacks and food intolerances.

3.4 Side Effects and (S)AEs

3.4.1 Side Effects

Diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most common side effects, reported by five patients (Figure 3). Some patients reported these side effects multiple times, as it could reoccur at different moments during treatment. Skin lesions were reported in three patients (i.e. small skin rash or bumps combined with dry skin and itching, managed effectively with topical treatments) probably unrelated to CA treatment. None of the patients who reported diarrhea or pruritus experienced these symptoms prior to the initiation of CA treatment.

FIGURE 3
Reported side effects during CA treatment by patients (n); children (black) and adults (gray).

Children tolerated CA better than adults, who reported more frequent and severe side effects. Temporary cessation of CA treatment resolved the complaints. To prevent recurrence, dose reductions were necessary for two adult and one pediatric patient. Treatment rechallenge with a lower CA dose often resulted in a (temporary) absence of these side effects. Despite dose reductions and careful treatment rechallenge, the two adult AMACR patients continued to experience mild to moderate side effects (i.e. persistent diarrhea and abdominal pains) at lower doses (7 mg/kg/day).

More side effects were reported for the adults and generally there was a less clear correlation between treatment dose and the occurrence of the side effects (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
Number of reported side effects reported per CA dose category by children (black) versus adults (gray).

3.4.2 (S)AEs

Eleven AEs were reported, all in adult AMACR patients. These included kidney stones, cold and flu symptoms, an arm fracture, neck pain, tingling sensations in hands and feet, hematuria and bladder spasms, and nonmalignant intestinal polyps (all n = 1). Most AEs were categorized as mild to moderate and were assessed as unrelated to CA treatment, and resolved without long‐term consequences.

Three SAEs occurred: one hospitalization for a bone fracture after a fall due to hypotension following significant weight loss (> 10%), one involving bladder carcinoma, treated with local chemotherapy, and another who developed a HCC was treated with ablation and was awaiting the possibility of liver transplantation. All SAEs were assessed as unrelated to CA treatment, but potentially due to the underlying disorder.

Urinary citrate inhibits calcium stone formation by complexing calcium in a soluble form and by effects on urinary crystals to prevent growth to stones. Low urinary citrate has been recognized for several decades as a contributing factor in some stone forming patients, but recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms and derangements of the renal handling of citrate in various conditions. In addition, oral citrate as an alkalinizing agent can not only increase urinary citrate, but also favorably impact other stone-promoting conditions. This review will focus on the understanding of these concepts.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of enteric hyperoxaluria [^117Q94cc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Enteric hyperoxaluria is a distinct entity that can occur as a result of a diverse set of gastrointestinal disorders that promote fat malabsorption. This, in turn, leads to excess absorption of dietary oxalate and increased urinary oxalate excretion. Hyperoxaluria increases the risk of kidney stones and, in more severe cases, CKD and even kidney failure. The prevalence of enteric hyperoxaluria has increased over recent decades, largely because of the increased use of malabsorptive bariatric surgical procedures for medically complicated obesity. This systematic review of enteric hyperoxaluria was completed as part of a Kidney Health Initiative-sponsored project to describe enteric hyperoxaluria pathophysiology, causes, outcomes, and therapies. Current therapeutic options are limited to correcting the underlying gastrointestinal disorder, intensive dietary modifications, and use of calcium salts to bind oxalate in the gut. Evidence for the effect of these treatments on clinically significant outcomes, including kidney stone events or CKD, is currently lacking. Thus, further research is needed to better define the precise factors that influence risk of adverse outcomes, the long-term efficacy of available treatment strategies, and to develop new therapeutic approaches.

### Benefits and challenges to therapeutic targeting of bile acid circulation in cholestatic liver disease [^115STgsf]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

POTENTIAL FOR SYSTEMIC IBAT/ASBT INHIBITORS AND DUAL ASBT/NTCP INHIBITORS

BAs are cytotoxic at high free concentration, and interventions that shunt BAs away from the liver appear to slow or even reverse disease progression. The gut-restricted IBAT inhibitors block only part of the return of BAs to the liver. Notably, it does not block ongoing IBAT-mediated reabsorption of BAs from the kidney or hepatocyte NTCP-mediated BA re-uptake from blood in cholestatic patients with elevated serum BA levels. However, systemic inhibitors that block IBAT-mediated BA reclamation in the ileum and kidney (Figure 2) may be more effective at redirecting BAs away from the cholestatic liver for elimination in feces or urine. There are several barriers to pursuing this potential therapeutic strategy. Since the IBAT inhibitors developed and approved to date are poorly absorbed and largely gut-restricted, different strategies are required to design/develop an absorbable small-molecule IBAT inhibitor with acceptable bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, renal tubule IBAT target engagement, drug metabolism, and safety properties. Regarding efficacy, better estimates of the mass of non-sulfated/non-glucuronidated BAs that undergo glomerular filtration and reabsorption by the proximal tubules in cholestatic patients are needed. – This would provide critical information regarding the amount of BA that can be potentially eliminated via this route each day, acknowledging that glomerular BA filtration will decrease as serum BA levels are reduced. However, one of the most significant potential hurdles is the risk that increasing BA elimination in urine will induce acute kidney injury (cholemic nephropathy).

### Enteronephrohepatic circulation of bile acids and therapeutic potential of systemic bile acid transporter inhibitors [^116CC8ps]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Together with carriers in liver and small intestine, kidney transporters function to conserve and compartmentalize bile acids in the enteronephrohepatic circulation. In patients with liver disease, systemic bile acid levels are elevated, undergo increased renal glomerular filtration, and contribute to the pathogenesis of cholemic nephropathy and acute kidney injury. In this review, we describe mechanisms for renal bile acid transport and highlight very recent discoveries that challenge current paradigms for the pathogenesis of cholemic nephropathy and renal tubule cast formation. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the kidney apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) to redirect bile acids into urine for elimination, reduce hepatobiliary accumulation and systemic levels of bile acids, and treat cholemic nephropathy. In conclusion, a deeper understanding of the enteronephrohepatic bile acid axis is providing insights into novel strategies to protect both liver and kidney in patients with liver disease.

### Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome: considerations of resected and residual anatomy [^112LKVnC]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

The human small intestine is organized with a proximal-to-distal gradient of mucosal structure and nutrient processing capacity. However, certain nutrients undergo site-specific digestion and absorption, such as iron and folate in the duodenum/jejunum vs vitamin B12 and bile salts in the ileum. Intestinal resection can result in short bowel syndrome (SBS) due to reduction of total and/or site-specific nutrient processing areas. Depending on the segment(s) of intestine resected, malabsorption can be nutrient specific (eg, vitamin B12 or fat) or sweeping, with deficiencies in energy, protein, and various micronutrients. Jejunal resections are generally better tolerated than ileal resections because of greater postresection adaptive capacity than that of the jejunum. Following intestinal resection, energy scavenging and fluid absorption become particularly important in the colon owing to loss of digestive and absorptive surface area in the resection portion. Resection-induced alterations in enteroendocrine cell abundance can further disrupt intestinal function. For example, patients with end jejunostomy have depressed circulating peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide 2 concentrations, which likely contribute to the rapid intestinal transit and blunted intestinal adaptation observed in this population. SBS-associated pathophysiology often extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract, with hepatobiliary disease, metabolic bone disease, D-lactic acidosis, and kidney stone formation being chronic complications. Clinical management of SBS must be individualized to account for the specific nutrient processing deficit within the remnant bowel and to mitigate potential complications, both inside and outside the gastrointestinal tract.
