## Question

Manage hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing atherosclerotic from fibromuscular disease. Then, I should verify hemodynamic severity and kidney viability. Next, I will outline universal medical therapy, including RAAS blockade, blood pressure targets, and risk factor modification. After that, I need to define when revascularization is indicated versus when medical therapy alone suffices. Finally, I should consider special populations, procedural details, and a practical follow-up algorithm, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus uncertain [^1156Xfgv] [^11723rCL] [^114ZXQyV].

> Let me first confirm the clinical suspicion and etiology, because management hinges on whether the stenosis is atherosclerotic or fibromuscular dysplasia and on the likelihood of hemodynamic significance. I should look for resistant hypertension, abrupt-onset or accelerated hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, unexplained renal dysfunction or asymmetry, and new azotemia after starting ACEi/ARB, while remembering that FMD is more common in younger women and atherosclerotic RAS clusters with age, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and PAD [^115FVuVt] [^115xsHGK] [^115akfnS]. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence context: atherosclerotic RAS may be present in 14–40% of adults with hypertension, but only a small fraction (about 0.1–5%) is hemodynamically significant enough to drive renovascular hypertension, so I must avoid overcalling incidental lesions [^111roWzE] [^116N6K5Y].

> Next, I should review first-line noninvasive imaging to establish the diagnosis and anatomic severity, while planning for hemodynamic confirmation if moderate disease is suspected. Duplex renal artery ultrasound is preferred initially because it avoids contrast and can estimate velocities and resistive indices; CTA or MRA provide high-resolution anatomic detail, and catheter angiography remains the gold standard when intervention is contemplated or when hemodynamic severity must be confirmed with pressure gradients or renal FFR [^111AgBiw] [^115jaYdB] [^111FZKQn]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds: a resting mean gradient ≥ 10 mmHg, a systolic gradient ≥ 20 mmHg, or a renal FFR ≤ 0.8 supports hemodynamic significance for 50–70% lesions, which otherwise have uncertain physiologic impact [^111FZKQn].

> I will now examine kidney viability and parenchymal injury, because revascularization is unlikely to help atrophic, fibrotic kidneys. I need to check kidney size asymmetry, cortical thinning, and proteinuria; severe albuminuria suggests advanced ischemic nephropathy and predicts poorer response to revascularization, whereas absence of heavy proteinuria portends better outcomes [^111roWzE] [^115iXDSj]. Hold on, I should verify that resistive indices by ultrasound can also inform viability; high resistive indices (> 0.8) correlate with irreversibility and reduced likelihood of renal function recovery after intervention [^notfound].

> Now, I should confirm universal medical therapy for all patients with atherosclerotic RAS, because randomized trials show no superiority of stenting over optimized medical therapy for most outcomes. RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitor or ARB is first-line for unilateral disease, with calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as adjuncts; in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney, ACEi/ARB can still be used with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium, and diuretics are often needed for volume control [^113u6WRa] [^111qvRAE] [^116s4it7]. I need to ensure blood pressure targets are individualized: ESVS 2025 recommends < 130/80 mmHg for patients < 65 years, < 140/80 mmHg for 65–79 years, and 140–150 mmHg systolic for those ≥ 80 years if tolerated, aligning with broader hypertension guidance [^114ZXQyV]. But wait, what if ACEi/ARB precipitate a ≥ 30% eGFR decline or hyperkalemia? Then I should reassess for bilateral disease or volume status and adjust therapy accordingly, rather than reflexively abandoning RAAS blockade [^112jEytt].

> Next, I should review comprehensive risk factor modification because atherosclerotic RAS reflects systemic disease. High-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy unless contraindicated, smoking cessation, glycemic control, and lifestyle measures are essential to reduce cardiovascular and renal events and are consistently recommended across guidelines [^111AgBiw]. Hold on, I should verify that these measures are necessary even if revascularization is pursued; yes, stenting does not replace secondary prevention, and patients still require RAAS blockade and risk factor control post-procedure [^1141u3Yn].

> Let me consider when revascularization is indicated despite optimal medical therapy. I should confirm that contemporary guidelines converge on a selective approach: reserve angioplasty/stenting for high-risk phenotypes such as resistant hypertension despite ≥ 3 agents including a diuretic, recurrent flash pulmonary edema or acute heart failure from hemodynamically significant RAS, rapidly declining renal function or AKI in the setting of high-grade stenosis, and bilateral RAS or unilateral RAS in a solitary kidney [^11723rCL] [^1147DVZn] [^114V7VJq]. I need to ensure lesion severity is truly significant: generally ≥ 70% stenosis, or 50–69% with post-stenotic dilatation or a significant gradient, with hemodynamic confirmation when needed, because moderate lesions alone are insufficient to justify intervention [^111FZKQn] [^1147DVZn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stenting for all atherosclerotic RAS; I should double-check the trial data. Large RCTs like ASTRAL and CORAL did not show benefit of stenting over medical therapy for blood pressure, renal function, or cardiovascular outcomes, but they under-enrolled the highest-risk phenotypes and often excluded bilateral disease or very severe stenosis, limiting generalizability to the patients most likely to benefit [^111H7cKu] [^112kiR4J]. Meta-analyses corroborate only modest reductions in diastolic BP and antihypertensive pill count without clear clinical outcome advantages, reinforcing a conservative default strategy [^116xEx6D] [^115X5DqP]. Hmm, wait a minute, observational and registry data suggest that carefully selected patients with resistant hypertension or flash pulmonary edema can experience meaningful BP and renal responses, but I must acknowledge the nonrandomized design and potential selection bias [^114ZpDiU] [^114szL6D].

> I should confirm the technical approach when revascularization is warranted. For atherosclerotic ostial lesions, balloon-expandable stent placement is preferred due to recoil and restenosis risk with angioplasty alone; for non-ostial FMD, balloon angioplasty without stenting is favored, with stenting reserved for dissection or bailout [^111AgBiw] [^115UEmZp]. Let me verify hemodynamic optimization steps: measuring translesional gradients or renal FFR during angiography helps confirm severity and can be done in the same session as intervention, improving selection and potentially outcomes [^111FZKQn].

> But wait, what if the patient has fibromuscular dysplasia rather than atherosclerosis? I need to ensure I distinguish this because FMD often responds differently. FMD is more common in younger women, tends to involve the mid/distal renal artery with a beaded appearance, and is more likely to be cured or substantially improved with angioplasty alone; guidelines support revascularization for symptomatic FMD with hemodynamically significant lesions, whereas routine stenting is not indicated in FMD unless complications occur [^1142zPnD] [^115UEmZp] [^112kiR4J]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to hypertension attributable to FMD; yes, recommendations endorse angioplasty for FMD-related stenosis causing resistant hypertension or other organ ischemia [^1142zPnD] [^115UEmZp].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios. In patients with CKD, ACEi/ARB remain appropriate with close monitoring, and the threshold for considering revascularization may be lower if there is rapidly declining function or bilateral disease threatening dialysis; conversely, severe proteinuria and cortical thinning suggest irreversible injury and poor likelihood of recovery after stenting [^111qvRAE] [^111roWzE]. In heart failure with flash pulmonary edema, high-grade RAS is a recognized driver, and revascularization can reduce admissions and improve cardiorenal status in carefully selected cases, though evidence quality varies [^11723rCL] [^114ZpDiU]. For older adults, I should confirm BP targets are less aggressive and individualized to tolerability, consistent with ESVS age-stratified recommendations [^114ZXQyV].

> I will now examine procedural risks and long-term surveillance, because these influence the net benefit. Renal artery stenting has high technical success but carries risks such as access-site complications, dissection, distal embolization, contrast nephropathy, and in-stent restenosis in 10–25% over time; thus, I need to weigh these against potential gains in BP control, renal function, or heart failure symptoms [^115xsHGK] [^113M1k95]. Let me reconsider: if the kidney is nonviable or the patient has stable, easily controlled hypertension with low-grade stenosis, the risk-benefit calculus favors medical therapy alone [^112jEytt].

> Next, I should review a practical follow-up algorithm to ensure safety after initiating or intensifying RAAS blockade and after any intervention. I need to check serum creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks of starting or uptitrating ACEi/ARB, anticipate a modest eGFR drop up to about 30% that is often acceptable, and reassess if the decline exceeds that threshold or if hyperkalemia emerges; after stenting, I should monitor renal function, blood pressure, and consider duplex surveillance for restenosis at 6–12 months and periodically thereafter [^112jEytt] [^113M1k95]. Hold on, I should verify that continued risk factor optimization and antiplatelet therapy are maintained post-stenting; yes, secondary prevention remains mandatory regardless of revascularization status [^1141u3Yn].

> Let me synthesize the decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Start with aggressive medical therapy and risk factor modification for all with atherosclerotic RAS; reserve revascularization for those with high-risk clinical phenotypes and hemodynamically significant lesions after confirming severity and kidney viability; for FMD, favor angioplasty in symptomatic patients with significant stenosis; and throughout, individualize decisions via a multidisciplinary team integrating clinical presentation, imaging, and hemodynamics [^115oSZNK] [^11723rCL] [^115UEmZp]. I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary ACC/AHA, ESC, and ESVS guidance; the convergence toward selective revascularization and universal medical therapy is consistent across these documents [^1156Xfgv] [^1147DVZn] [^114ZXQyV].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. For most patients with hypertension due to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, optimized medical therapy with RAAS blockade, strict blood pressure control, statin, antiplatelet therapy, and lifestyle measures is the cornerstone and yields outcomes comparable to routine stenting; revascularization should be reserved for resistant hypertension, flash pulmonary edema or heart failure exacerbations from hemodynamically significant RAS, or rapidly declining renal function in a viable kidney, with careful selection and hemodynamic confirmation guiding intervention [^116xEx6D] [^111H7cKu] [^11723rCL].

Hypertension from renal artery stenosis is best managed with **guideline-directed medical therapy** as first-line, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, statins, and antiplatelet therapy, with close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^113u6WRa] [^114ZXQyV] [^116s4it7]. Revascularization is reserved for **resistant hypertension** (≥ 3 drugs, including a diuretic) [^114V7VJq], **progressive renal dysfunction**, or **recurrent flash pulmonary edema** despite optimal medical therapy [^11723rCL] [^1147DVZn]. ACE inhibitors/ARBs are safe and effective in unilateral RAS [^114A5rvY] but require cautious use with close monitoring in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney [^111qvRAE] [^1154GUfb]. Blood pressure targets are individualized by age and comorbidity, typically < 130/80 mmHg in younger patients and < 140/90 mmHg in older or frail patients [^114ZXQyV]. Regular follow-up with renal imaging and laboratory monitoring is essential to detect progression and guide timely intervention [^111qvRAE].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

RAS reduces renal perfusion, activating the **RAAS** and causing hypertension, fluid retention, and end-organ damage [^115xsHGK]. Clinical features include:

- **Resistant hypertension**: Difficult to control despite multiple agents [^115akfnS].
- **Progressive renal dysfunction**: Rising creatinine or declining eGFR [^115xsHGK].
- **Flash pulmonary edema**: Recurrent acute pulmonary edema without heart failure [^notfound].
- **Abdominal bruit**: Suggests hemodynamically significant RAS [^115FVuVt].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and severity assessment guide management; **noninvasive imaging is preferred** initially [^116JFg7S]:

| **Modality** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Duplex ultrasound | First-line screening | Noninvasive, no contrast | Operator-dependent, limited by obesity |
| CTA | High sensitivity/specificity | Detailed anatomy | Contrast nephrotoxicity, radiation |
| MRA | Alternative to CTA | No radiation, contrast safer | Expensive, limited availability |
| Invasive angiography | Gold standard, hemodynamics | Definitive diagnosis | Invasive, contrast risk |

---

Hemodynamic significance is typically **≥ 70% stenosis** or a **≥ 20 mmHg systolic gradient** [^111FZKQn].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is **first-line** for most patients with RAS-related hypertension:

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: First-line in unilateral RAS; effective and safe with monitoring [^113u6WRa] [^114A5rvY].
- **Calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics**: Add-on therapy for BP control [^116s4it7].
- **Statins and antiplatelet therapy**: Reduce cardiovascular risk [^115ui1qB] [^114jQ4qZ].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Sodium restriction, weight loss, smoking cessation [^111AgBiw].

---

## Indications for revascularization

Revascularization is reserved for specific clinical scenarios; **indications include**:

- **Resistant hypertension**: ≥ 3 antihypertensives, including a diuretic, with > 70% stenosis [^114V7VJq].
- **Progressive renal dysfunction**: Declining eGFR or rising creatinine with significant stenosis [^114jQ4qZ].
- **Recurrent flash pulmonary edema**: Despite optimal medical therapy [^11723rCL].

---

## Revascularization techniques

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting is the **preferred method** for atherosclerotic RAS due to high success and low complication rates [^115Jhpof]. Balloon angioplasty alone is preferred for **fibromuscular dysplasia**, with stenting reserved for complications [^115UEmZp].

---

## Risks and benefits of revascularization

Benefits include improved **blood pressure control**, stabilization or improvement in **renal function**, and reduced **cardiovascular events** in selected patients [^111FeoCt]. Risks include **procedural complications** (e.g. contrast nephropathy, bleeding, restenosis) and limited benefit in low-risk patients [^116xEx6D].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to detect progression and complications; **monitoring includes**:

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Frequent checks to assess control [^111qvRAE].
- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes [^111qvRAE].
- **Imaging**: Duplex ultrasound or CTA/MRA if clinical deterioration occurs [^116JFg7S].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs can be used with close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^111qvRAE] [^1154GUfb].
- **Elderly patients**: Individualized BP targets and cautious use of antihypertensives [^114ZXQyV].
- **Pediatric patients**: Fibromuscular dysplasia is more common; revascularization may be preferred [^112jEytt].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Unilateral RAS | - ACE inhibitor/ARB <br/> - Calcium channel blocker <br/> - Thiazide diuretic <br/> - Statins <br/> - Antiplatelet therapy |
| Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney | - ACE inhibitor/ARB with close monitoring <br/> - Calcium channel blocker <br/> - Thiazide diuretic <br/> - Statins <br/> - Antiplatelet therapy |
| Resistant hypertension | - Revascularization if > 70% stenosis [^114V7VJq] |
| Progressive renal dysfunction | - Revascularization if significant stenosis [^112jEytt] |
| Flash pulmonary edema | - Revascularization if recurrent [^notfound] |

---

Medical therapy is **first-line** for hypertension from renal artery stenosis, with revascularization reserved for resistant cases or specific clinical scenarios. ACE inhibitors/ARBs are effective and safe with monitoring, and regular follow-up is essential to guide therapy and detect progression [^115oSZNK].

### Update on intervention versus medical therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^115xmSne]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is known to be one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, and early nonrandomized studies suggested that renal artery stenting (RASt) improved outcomes. The vascular community embraced this less invasive treatment alternative to surgery, and RASt increased in popularity during the late 1990s. However, recent randomized studies have failed to show a benefit regarding blood pressure or renal function when RASt was compared with best medical therapy, creating significant concerns about procedural efficacy. In the wake of these randomized trial results, hypertension and renal disease experts along with vascular interventional specialists now struggle with how to best manage atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. This review objectively analyzes the current literature and highlights each trial's design weaknesses and strengths. We have provided our recommendations for contemporary treatment guidelines based on our interpretation of the available empirical data.

### When and how should we revascularize patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis? [^111DWXfK]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the leading cause of secondary hypertension and may lead to resistant (refractory) hypertension, progressive decline in renal function, and cardiac destabilization syndromes (pulmonary edema, recurrent heart failure, or acute coronary syndromes) despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Although randomized controlled trials comparing medical therapy with medical therapy and renal artery stenting have failed to show a benefit for renal artery stenting, according to comparative effectiveness reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the trials may not have enrolled patients with the most severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, who would be more likely to benefit from renal stenting. Because of limitations of conventional angiography, it is critical that the hemodynamic severity of moderately severe (50% to 70%) atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis lesions be confirmed on hemodynamic measurement. The authors review techniques to optimize patient selection, to minimize procedural complications, and to facilitate durable patency of renal stenting. The authors also review the current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions appropriate use criteria as they relate to renal stenting.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) causes chronic, progressive ischaemic nephropathy and is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Radiology plays a large part in the diagnosis, with a variety of imaging techniques available. Each has relative advantages and disadvantages depending on each unique clinical setting. We discuss and illustrate the range of diagnostic methods and interventional techniques for diagnosis and management of RAS and review the current evidence base for endovascular therapy compared with optimal medical management. Knowledge of the relative merits of the various forms of imaging and treatment will guide decision making in the multidisciplinary setting.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension: pragmatism, pitfalls, and perspectives [^115q2btt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many years and even decades, a diagnostic work-up to look for a secondary form of hypertension, particularly of renovascular origin, has been a central tenet in medicine. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization bring into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes "renovascular hypertension". From a clinical point of view, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not have a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty; to expose them to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up add up to little more than a wild goose chase. However, with very few exceptions, medical therapy with antihypertensives and statins remains the cornerstone for the management of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension.

### Current issues in the diagnosis and management of patients with renal artery stenosis: a cardiologic perspective [^115ui1qB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis most often is caused by atherosclerosis. Although patients with renal artery stenosis can be managed conservatively, renal revascularization may be indicated, particularly in patients with refractory hypertension on a multidrug regimen and patients with declining renal function. Duplex ultrasonography of the renal arteries and magnetic resonance angiography are currently the most efficient noninvasive methods for the evaluation of renal artery stenosis. Selective digital subtraction renal arteriography remains the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis. In selected patients undergoing coronary studies and angiography immediately after the coronary procedure can be efficient. Atherosclerotic renal artery lesions, which commonly affect the renal artery ostium, can be treated safely and effectively with balloon-expandable stents. Successful angioplasty commonly results in improved control of hypertension, but an overall benefit on renal function and/or patient survival has not been shown. Generally the risk/benefit ratio of renal artery stenting seems favorable, but further randomized studies are needed for evidence-based decision making. All patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should receive rigorous secondary prevention measures including platelet inhibitors, statins, and beta-blockers.

Regarding medical management for renal artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, CHEP 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy in patients with hypertension attributable to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

### Renal artery stenosis [^111AgBiw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and predominantly caused by atherosclerosis. In suspected patients, a non-invasive diagnosis with ultrasound is preferred. Asymptomatic, incidentally found RAS does not require revascularization. In symptomatic patients requiring revascularization, renal artery stenting is the preferred therapy. Selecting appropriate patients for revascularization requires careful consideration of lesion severity and is optimized with a multidisciplinary team. All patients with atherosclerotic RAS should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy, including hypertension control, diabetes control, statins, antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation and encouraging activity.

### Renal artery stenosis: to intervene, or not to intervene, "that is the question" [^116hczKV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) due to atherosclerosis continues to be a major cause of secondary hypertension. It can also lead to renal dysfunction due to ischemic nephropathy. While major clinical trials have emphasized that medical management should be preferred over angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of renal artery stenosis, clinical scenarios continue to raise doubts about the optimal management strategy. Herein, we present two cases that were admitted with hypertensive emergency and renal function deterioration. Medical therapy failed to control the blood pressure and in one patient, renal failure progressed to a point where renal replacement therapy was required. Both patients underwent angioplasty (for > 90% stenosis) and stent insertion with successful resolution of stenosis by interventional radiology. Postoperatively, blood pressure gradually decreased with improvement in serum creatinine. Dialysis therapy was discontinued. At 4- and 8-month follow-up, both patients continue to do well with blood pressure readings in the 132–145/70–90 mmHg range. This article highlights the importance of percutaneous interventions in the management of atherosclerotic RAS and calls for heightened awareness and careful identification of candidates who would benefit from angioplasty and stent insertion.

### A review of the current treatment of renal artery stenosis [^112rYdZx]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with morbidity and mortality consequent to progressive ischemic renal failure and the cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. There is considerable uncertainty concerning the optimal management of patients with this condition. This review considers the aetiological factors and the physiologic consequences of ARAS and compares the results of clinical studies of medical and endovascular therapies on blood pressure control and preservation of renal function.

Results

Although, in patients with fibromuscular disease the results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) are clearly superior to medical therapy and surgery, in asymptomatic patients with ARAS the antihypertensive benefits and preservation of renal function of endovascular, surgical and medical therapies appear similar. In selected symptomatic patients interventions may, however, be life-saving. Surgery is generally reserved for arterial occlusions with preserved renal parenchyma and function.

Conclusions

The results of larger, multicentre, randomised, controlled trials are required to clearly clarify the role of interventional therapy in asymptomatic patients.

### Renal artery stenosis: prevalence of, risk factors for, and management of in-stent stenosis [^113M1k95]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is common and is associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. More frequent use of percutaneous renal artery stent placement for the treatment of renal artery stenosis during the past 2 decades has increased the number of patients with implanted stents. In-stent stenosis is a serious problem, occurring more frequently than earlier reports suggest and potentially resulting in late complications. Currently, there are no guidelines covering the approach to restenosis after renal artery stent placement. This article reviews data on the prevalence of and risk factors for the development of in-stent stenosis and the clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of in-stent stenosis and suggests a strategy for the management of patients after percutaneous renal artery stent placement.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease in chronic heart failure: should we intervene? [^113qemqg]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, which is also the most common cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). One-third of patients with CHF are reported to have significant renovascular disease. The presence of RAS confers a worse outcome in studies of hypertension and coronary disease, though data are lacking for patients with CHF. As the kidney is intricately involved in the fluid retention that occurs in CHF, an adverse effect of RAS on outcome would be expected. Presentations of RAS in CHF include flash pulmonary oedema, hypertension, worsening of CHF, and worsening renal function. RAS commonly progresses and may cause worsening of renal function in patients with CHF and previously stable renal function. A variety of investigations that can safely and accurately identify RAS in CHF are available, although none is recommended in current guidelines for the management of CHF. Treatment for RAS, whether for hypertension, for renal dysfunction, or for pulmonary oedema, is at the discretion of the physician due to the lack of adequate randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of intervention. As it is not clear how RAS should be managed in CHF, screening cannot be advocated. Currently, a multicentre randomized outcome trial, which includes a cohort of patients with RAS and CHF, is in progress to provide answers in this area of uncertainty.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: current therapy and future developments [^112eUTdH]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis affects between 2 and 4 million people in the United States alone and likely has a higher prevalence than previously thought. Renal artery stenosis has been increasingly recognized in recent years, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease. It has been associated with hypertension, renal dysfunction, and sudden onset of pulmonary edema. Patients with symptomatic and hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis are candidates for revascularization. Revascularization is most often accomplished by renal artery stenting, which has high success rates in terms of patency and low complication rates. An important element in managing patients with renal artery stenosis is selecting those patients who are most likely going to benefit from revascularization. This review article focuses on the clinical diagnosis, current treatment options, and future directions regarding treatment of patients with renal artery stenosis.

### Refining the approach to renal artery revascularization [^115stxMo]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases with different pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and outcomes. The 2 most common forms of RAS are fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and atherosclerosis (ARAS). Renovascular syndromes are broadly classified into renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy, but these terms are misleading, because they imply a causal relationship between RAS, hypertension, and renal dysfunction, which is difficult to prove in humans. Data supporting renal revascularization are limited by heterogeneous causes of hypertension and renal dysfunction, insufficient understanding of the relationship between RAS and nephropathy, inconsistent techniques for revascularization, ambiguous terminology and end points to assess benefit, and lack of large-scale randomized trials. The purpose of this review is to enhance understanding of the epidemiology, clinical markers, and diagnosis of RAS; the relationship between RAS and important disease states; the distinction between renal ischemia and nephropathy; optimal revascularization techniques; and avoidance of renal injury.

### Renovascular hypertension [^113UFAuR]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renovascular disease (RVD) is a major cause of secondary hypertension. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common type of RVD followed by fibromuscular dysplasia. It has long been recognized as the prototype of angiotensin-dependent hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of hypertensive occlusive vascular renal disease are complex and distinction between the different causes of RVD should be made. Recognition of these distinct types of RVD with different degrees of renal occlusive disease is important for management. The greatest challenge is to individualize and implement the best approach for each patient in the setting of widely different comorbidities.

### Balloon angioplasty, with and without stenting, versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis [^116xEx6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis but the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, to include the results of recent, important large trials, of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4). Bibliographies were also reviewed and trial authors were contacted for more information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently on trial design, participants, interventions and outcome measures. A formal meta-analysis was completed to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function and cardiovascular and renal adverse events. Peto's odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous variables were calculated.

Main Results

Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta-analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD -2.00 mmHg; 95% CI -3.72 to -0.27) whilst the meta-analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD -1.07 mmHg; 95% CI -3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD -7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI -22.6 to 6.62). Meta-analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The available data are insufficient to conclude that revascularisation in the form of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, is superior to medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. However, balloon angioplasty results in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure and a small reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements. Balloon angioplasty appears safe and results in similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events to medical therapy.

Renal artery stenosis is a potentially reversible cause of hypertension, and transcatheter techniques are essential to its treatment. Angioplasty remains a first-line treatment for stenosis secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. Renal artery stenting is commonly used in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although recent trials have cast doubts upon its efficacy. Renal denervation is a promising procedure for the treatment of resistant hypertension, and in the future, its indications may expand.

Renal artery disease

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension in adults, however in younger women fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. Luminal obstruction and hypoperfusion of the kidney activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and leads to systemic hypertension. All patients with significant atherosclerotic RAS should be managed with blood pressure control, statin and antiplatelet therapy. Patients with bilateral RAS can still safely be treated with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers, provided that they have close follow-up of renal function.

Three major RCTs (STAR (Stent placement and blood pressure and lipid-lowering for the prevention of progression of renal dysfunction caused by atherosclerotic ostial stenosis of the renal artery), ASTRAL (angioplasty and stenting for renal artery lesions) and CORAL (cardiovascular outcomes in renal atherosclerotic lesions) have not found benefit for revascularisation over medical therapy, although these trials have been criticised for flaws in trial design and inclusion of some patients with only moderate disease. Still, due to lack of supporting evidence, renal revascularisation should be reserved for selected patients with FMD, recurrent congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension despite adequate medical therapy (at least three antihypertensive agents including a diuretic agent) or progressive renal failure with renal ischaemia. Because of the associated morbidity and mortality of open surgery, endovascular treatment is the preferred technique for patients who need revascularisation. If a lesion is not obviously severe at the time angiography, confirmation of haemodynamic significance can be performed with measuring translesional systolic pressure gradient or renal fractional flow reserve. Before planned revascularisation, renal resistive index obtained by ultrasound can provide additional information on viability of the kidney and predicted response to revascularisation.

RENOVASCULAR DISEASE

The 2023 ESH Guidelines also discuss the prevalence, prognosis and management of the two main causes of renovascular hypertension, atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD) and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Revascularization with balloon angioplasty without stenting is emphasized as the treatment of choice for patients with FMD and critical renal artery stenosis, while for ARVD, the recommendation is to offer revascularization on top of medical therapy in patients with documented secondary hypertension due to ARVD or those with high-risk clinical presentations (flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension or rapid loss of kidney function) with documented high-grade stenosis (≥ 70%). Medical therapy alone could be used for individuals with asymptomatic ARVD with stenosis < 70%, patients with mild or moderate hypertension that is easily controlled with antihypertensive drugs and low-grade stenosis, or patients with non-viable kidney parenchyma, where revascularization has little to offer. In all the latter cases, if treatment initiation with an ACEi or an ARB results in eGFR reduction of ≥ 30%, careful re-evaluation is warranted. Current strategies in the management of ARVD are detailed in a recent clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice and the Working Group 'Hypertension and the Kidney' of ESH.

1) Accelerated phase hypertension

Accelerated hypertension is a hypertensive emergency characterised by systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 120 mmHg with evidence of acute target organ damage. RAS is a leading cause of secondary hypertension and renal ischaemic disease. The belief for many years was that by restoring blood flow to a kidney affected by an atherosclerotic lesion would in essence cure hypertension. Several large randomised control trials have effectively shown that revascularisation does not confer a substantial benefit over medical treatment in those with renal artery disease. However, as indicated earlier, high risk presentations were under-represented in these trials.

HERCULES (A safety and effectiveness study of the Herculink Elite Renal Artery Stent to treat Renal Artery Stenosis), a prospective multicentre trial of 202 patients with ARVD undergoing intervention for uncontrolled hypertension, found a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in stent-treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The absolute reduction was related to severity of hypertension pre intervention, those with a starting SBP > 180 mmHg experiencing a mean fall of 48 mmHg while those with a starting SBP of 140–160 mmHg experiencing a mean reduction of 23 mmHg at 9 months. This trial highlighted that when patients are appropriately selected for intervention, they can experience significant reductions in blood pressure and in the number of anti-hypertensive medications required for treatment. This is certainly in keeping with the experience of our unit in relation to revascularisation for the indication of severe/accelerated hypertension in the setting of RAS.

A group in Lyon with a similar MDT approach to those diagnosed with atherosclerotic renal artery disease between 2013 and 2015 who primarily focused on blood pressure control found better control in those assigned to intervention. Those in the revascularisation group had a decrease in systolic blood pressure of -23 ± 34 mmHg (p = 0.007) and diastolic blood pressure of 12 ± 18 mmHg (p = 0.007). There was also a reduction of antihypertensive agents and the number of cases of resistant hypertension at one year follow up. There was no change in those assigned to medical treatment.

Our unit is a dedicated renal centre and it is possible that accelerated phase hypertension treated by other specialities such as cardiology may be under represented in this case series. There were 3 patients whose initial presentation was that of accelerated phase hypertension (Table 1). All 3 patients responded well to intervention and achieved target blood pressure within one month of intervention. Of note one patient's severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction improved significantly from an ejection fraction of 24% to 55%.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common disorder in adults with atherosclerosis and is associated with hypertension, impaired renal function, congestive heart failure, and angina pectoris. The incidence of RAS is increasing because of the aging of the US population and increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis. The case of Mrs S, an 82-year-old woman with long-standing hypertension and unilateral RAS detected by magnetic resonance angiography, illustrates the challenges surrounding indications for revascularization. The discussion reviews the clinical presentation and natural history of RAS and strategies for diagnosis. The role of medical therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy are reviewed, particularly in the context of guidelines and systematic reviews to help clinicians and patients facing this challenging decision.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — synopsis (epidemiology, thresholds, and evidence): Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing that can produce a hemodynamically significant restriction of renal blood flow, usually by > 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease — most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia — is less prevalent and occurs more often in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension, but only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Trials comparing endovascular procedures with medical therapy showed no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone in adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although there may be benefit in subgroups such as those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Critical review of indications for renal artery stenting: do randomized trials give the answer? [^116exxHn]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a well accepted cause of deterioration of arterial hypertension and of renal insufficiency. Just recently, more interest has been focused on the impact of RAS on structural heart disease and patient survival. Technical improvements of diagnostic and interventional endovascular tools have lead to a more widespread use of endoluminal renal artery revascularization and extension of the indications for this type of therapy during the past 2 decades. Since the first renal artery angioplasties performed by Felix Mahler and Andreas Grüntzig, numerous single centre studies have reported the beneficial effect of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, and since the early 1990's stenting of renal artery stenosis caused either by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. However, none of the so far published or presented randomized controlled trials (RCT) could prove a beneficial outcome of RAS revascularization compared with medical management. As a result of these negative trials including the recently presented ASTRAL trial, referrals to endovascular renal artery revascularization went down and moreover, reimbursement of these procedures became a matter of debate. This article summarizes the background and the limitations of the so far published and still ongoing controlled trials. Moreover, we discuss why well-designed registries might give important insight on the impact of endovascular revascularization of hemodynamically relevant atherosclerotic RAS.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRenovascular hypertension [^116JFg7S]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension is the most common type of secondary hypertension and is estimated to have a prevalence between 0.5% and 5% of the general hypertensive population, and an even higher prevalence among patients with severe hypertension and end-stage renal disease, approaching 25% in elderly dialysis patients. Investigation for renal artery stenosis is appropriate when clinical presentation suggests secondary hypertension rather than primary hypertension, when there is not another known cause of secondary hypertension, and when intervention would be carried out if a significant renal artery stenosis were identified. The primary imaging modalities used to screen for renal artery stenosis are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, with the selection of imaging dependent in part on renal function. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis [^1141u3Yn]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

A reduction in the diameter of the renal arteries can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction and/or pulmonary edema. About 90% of patients with renal artery stenosis have atherosclerosis, and 10% have fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common condition that typically occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with coexistent vascular disease at nonrenal sites. Patients who undergo revascularization to treat hypertension associated with atherosclerotic stenosis need to continue medication with statins, antiplatelet agents and renin-angiotensin antagonists after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Two recent trials compared renal outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic stenosis who were treated with antihypertensive medication plus stenting with those in patients who were treated with medication alone. Available results favor a conservative approach (medication only) for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. These results, however, concern patients with stable clinical conditions and, in many cases, only moderate renal artery lesions. Blood pressure outcome after angioplasty is more favorable in patients with fibromuscular renal artery disease, who usually do not have renal failure, than in those with atherosclerosis.

### Renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy [^1158GvHE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease remains among the most prevalent and important causes of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction. Many lesions reduce perfusion pressure including fibromuscular diseases and renal infarction, but most are caused by atherosclerotic disease. Epidemiologic studies establish a strong association between atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (ARAS) and cardiovascular risk. Hypertension develops in patients with renovascular disease from a complex set of pressor signals, including activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), recruitment of oxidative stress pathways, and sympathoadrenergic activation. Although the kidney maintains function over a broad range of autoregulation, sustained reduction in renal perfusion leads to disturbed microvascular function, vascular rarefaction, and ultimately development of interstitial fibrosis. Advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and intensive risk factor management including smoking cessation and statin therapy can provide excellent blood pressure control for many individuals. Despite extensive observational experience with renal revascularization in patients with renovascular hypertension, recent prospective randomized trials fail to establish compelling benefits either with endovascular stents or with surgery when added to effective medical therapy. These trials are limited and exclude many patients most likely to benefit from revascularization. Meaningful recovery of kidney function after revascularization is limited once fibrosis is established. Recent experimental studies indicate that mechanisms allowing repair and regeneration of parenchymal kidney tissue may lead to improved outcomes in the future. Until additional staging tools become available, clinicians will be forced to individualize therapy carefully to optimize the potential benefits regarding both blood pressure and renal function for such patients.

### Stenting for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^111MwwG3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in the adult population. ARAS may result in progressive renal impairment, renovascular hypertension, and/or cardiac disturbance syndromes. Because medical therapy does not affect the progressive nature of this disease process, more aggressive treatments are needed to definitively treat ARAS. When performed correctly, renal artery stenting has been shown to stabilize or improve renal function and/or renovascular hypertension in 65–70% of carefully selected patients with ARAS. Therefore, percutaneous renal artery stenting should be considered the primary treatment for patients with symptomatic ARAS.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary hypertension (HTN) and may lead to resistant (refractory) HTN despite guideline directed medical therapy. Although randomized controlled trials comparing medical therapy to medical therapy and renal artery stenting have shown no benefit with renal artery stenting, according to comparative effectiveness reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the trials did not enroll patients with the most severe RAS who would be more likely to benefit from renal stenting. Because of limitations of conventional angiography, it is important to assess the hemodynamic severity of moderate (50%-70%) RAS lesions with a hemodynamic measurement. We review techniques to optimize patient selection, to minimize procedural complications, and to facilitate durable patency of renal stenting. We also review the current ACC/AHA Guidelines and SCAI Appropriate Use Criteria as they relate to renal stenting.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^114SWFGc]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Acute presentations of atheromatous RAS are relatively uncommon but should be considered in patients presenting with severe hypertension, acute heart failure syndromes or with rapidly deteriorating renal function, especially AKI, particularly if there is evidence of widespread atheromatous disease. A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these instances so that timely revascularization can be undertaken to restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure syndromes. These are situations in which targeted early renal revascularization has a genuine chance of improving survival.

### SCAI expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^113kPmhb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis with resultant renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenting has emerged as the primary revascularization strategy in most patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS. Despite the frequency with which hemodynamically significant RAS is observed and high rates of technical success of renal artery stenting, there remains considerable debate among experts regarding the role of medical therapy versus revascularization for renovascular hypertension. Modern, prospective, multicenter registries continue to demonstrate improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excellent safety profiles in patients with RAS. Modern randomized, controlled clinical trials of optimal medical therapy versus renal stenting particularly designed to demonstrate preservation in renal function after renal artery stenting have demonstrated limited benefit. However, these trials frequently excluded patients that may benefit from renal artery stenting. This document was developed to guide physicians in the modern practical application of renal stenting, to highlight the current limitations in the peer-reviewed literature, to suggest best-practices in the performance of renal stenting and to identify opportunities to advance the field.

### The impact of renal artery stenting on therapeutic aims [^112W7iyi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an anatomical categorisation of several disease processes that result in reduced renal perfusion. The impact is two-fold: directly — through reduced renal perfusion resulting in reduced function and ultimately ischaemic atrophy; and indirectly — through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems leading to systemic hypertension, cardiovascular complications and ultimately, end-organ damage including glomerulosclerosis. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Atherosclerotic RAS is not uncommon and may be present on imaging in up to 50% of patients with coronary artery disease. In contrast, the incidence of pathologically impaired renal perfusion leading to clinical conditions is much less clear with the clinical presentation influenced by speed of onset and the type/severity of organ dysfunction.

Given the variable presentation of symptomatic RAS, there may be several therapeutic aims of treating RAS either acutely (reducing blood pressure, improving renal function, treating acute cardio-renal syndromes) or in the longer term (preventing hypertensive end-organ damage and ischaemic renal atrophy). The current treatment of clinically relevant RAS consists primarily of medical optimisation with anti-hypertensive agents. Endovascular treatment may be undertaken with angioplasty alone (usually only in patients with FMD) or with stenting (RASt) in atherosclerotic disease, where ostial calcification makes recoil and restenosis more likely if angioplasty is performed in isolation. It is possible that amongst populations with a heavy atherosclerotic burden, a significant number of people could merit intervention, but the role of RASt is uncertain as two large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show a significant benefit to either renal or cardiovascular outcomes.

### SCAI expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^112BNBRp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Medium credibility.

SCAI expert consensus on atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) summarizes that the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic RAS includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis with resultant renovascular hypertension, and that renal artery stenting has emerged as the primary revascularization strategy in most patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS. It notes that modern, prospective, multicenter registries continue to demonstrate improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excellent safety profiles in patients with RAS, whereas modern randomized, controlled clinical trials of optimal medical therapy versus renal stenting particularly designed to demonstrate preservation in renal function after renal artery stenting have demonstrated limited benefit. It also states that these trials frequently excluded patients that may benefit from renal artery stenting, and that this document was developed to guide physicians in the modern practical application of renal artery stenting, to highlight the current limitations in the peer-reviewed literature, to suggest best-practices in the performance of renal stenting and to identify opportunities to advance the field.

ABSTRACT

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is the most common type of renal artery stenosis. It represents a common health problem with clinical presentations relevant to many medical specialties and carries a high risk for future cardiovascular and renal events, as well as overall mortality. The available evidence regarding the management of ARVD is conflicting. Randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate superiority of percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTRA) with or without stenting in addition to standard medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone in lowering blood pressure levels or preventing adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ARVD, but they carried several limitations and met important criticism. Observational studies showed that PTRA is associated with future cardiorenal benefits in patients presenting with high-risk ARVD phenotypes (i.e. flash pulmonary oedema, resistant hypertension or rapid loss of kidney function). This clinical practice document, prepared by experts from the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and from the Working Group on Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), summarizes current knowledge in epidemiology, pathophysiology and diagnostic assessment of ARVD and presents, following a systematic literature review, key evidence relevant to treatment, with an aim to support clinicians in decision making and everyday management of patients with this condition.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^111TmiVZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — renal artery stenosis evaluation and management state that care should be used in determining the appropriate diagnostic tests because administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others. Refractory hypertension and/or a significant reduction in kidney function after renin-angiotensin system blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis, and patients with diabetes and CKD in whom refractory hypertension is suspected should be evaluated, preferably without radiocontrast, to assess whether arterial stenosis is present. Current non-invasive modalities that avoid radiocontrast include magnetic resonance angiography and duplex Doppler ultrasonography, whereas captopril nuclear renal scans are not recommended because sensitivity is low in patients with decreased GFR or bilateral renal artery stenosis; further evaluation may be undertaken with carbon dioxide or gadolinium angiography. Hypertension with unilateral renal artery stenosis may be treated with medicine (preferably an ACE inhibitor or ARB) with the option of revascularization, usually by percutaneous angioplasty and stent placement, and treatment of bilateral disease or unilateral disease in a single functioning kidney may require revascularization to both control hypertension and prevent loss of kidney function, although whether revascularization adds benefit to optimal medical management is uncertain.

### Catheter-based therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^115Jhpof]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) is more common than was previously thought, particularly in patients with known coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular atherosclerosis. Clinical subsets in which RAS is more common include patients with uncontrolled hypertension, renal insufficiency, and/or sudden onset ("flash") pulmonary edema. Renal artery atherosclerosis progresses over time and is associated with loss of renal function regardless of medical therapy. Patients with symptomatic (hypertension, renal insufficiency, or flash pulmonary edema) and hemodynamically significant RAS are potential candidates for revascularization. The current standard of care is stent placement for aorto-ostial atherosclerotic lesions. Procedure success rates are very high (≥ 95%), with infrequent major complication rates. Five-year primary patency rates are 80% to 85%, and secondary patency rates exceed 90%. The key element in managing patients with RAS is selecting those most likely to benefit, that is, those with blood pressure control, preservation or improvement of renal function, and control of flash pulmonary edema from renal revascularization. This article will highlight the anatomical features, physiologic parameters, and biomarkers that may be helpful in optimally selecting patients for renal artery revascularization.

As the incidence of hypertension (HTN) continues to rise, finding the optimal treatment of this multifactorial disease is critical. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a known etiology for HTN and is associated with declining renal function. Other than medications, the original gold standard for treatment of HTN from RAS was with an open surgical revascularization or nephrectomy. Since then, endovascular interventions for RAS have been reported to be technically possible, but their efficacy over medications or surgery has yielded conflicting results in case series and randomized trials. This tabular review summarizes the results of randomized trials that compared the outcomes of endovascular renal artery interventions with nonendovascular techniques (including medical and surgical treatments) for the treatment of HTN and renal dysfunction. Based on these data, the strengths and weaknesses of individual trials are critically analyzed to better define the methods to identify and treat patients with RAS.

Background

Hypertension on renal replacement therapy (RRT) is best managed by optimizing goal weight, tight fluid control, salt restriction, increased dialysis times/frequency, decreasing sodium in the dialysate and transitioning to home hemodialysis. While ultrafiltration on hemodialysis typically lowers blood pressure, some patients have a paradoxical rise in blood pressure called intradialytic hypertension (IDH).

### Limitations of angiography for the assessment of renal artery stenosis and treatment implications [^116Kr5pG]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Percutaneous catheter-based renal artery revascularization has been increasingly utilized for the treatment of renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenting has a high technical success rate, but the rate of improvement in hypertension is somewhat less than expected with this technique. Misinterpretation of angiographic images may play a role in these unfavorable clinical results. We present a case in which the diagnosis of severe renal artery stenosis was not apparent by angiography. Intravascular ultrasound and translesional pressure gradient measurements during arteriography can help to determine the precise severity of stenosis and may augment the clinical results of percutaneous renal artery stent placement.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — epidemiology and treatment effects: Renal artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a hemodynamically significant restriction of blood flow, usually by > 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease, of which fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common, is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension; however, only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is considered to be hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Several trials designed to compare the efficacy of these procedures with medical therapy suggested no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone among adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Nonetheless, there may be benefit in certain subgroups of individuals with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who were not represented in the trials, including those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^112hkNfv]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

We believe that three important considerations are necessary when contemplating renal revascularization for patients with atherosclerotic RAS. The clinical presentation is key but so too is the severity of the RAS lesion and the extent of parenchymal damage within the kidney (with better results anticipated when there is minimal proteinuria and absence of significant renal atrophy). Our case series highlighted cases compatible with the recommendations of the ACC/AHA 2018 guidelines that suggest revascularisation should be reserved for those patients with "high risk" presentations such as recurrent flash pulmonary oedema, rapidly declining renal function and refractory hypertension (Fig. 3).

### Revascularization for renovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115xsHGK]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on renal artery stenosis:

- **Definition**: Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis and FMD, accounting for approximately 90% and 10% of renal artery stenosis cases, respectively. Renal artery stenosis decreases renal perfusion, triggering the RAAS, which leads to renovascular hypertension and may cause ischemic nephropathy, resulting in progressive renal dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in the general population is estimated at 5–10%, and as high as 25% in elderly patients with hypertension.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for renal atherosclerosis include older age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, PAD, and a family history of CVD. Risk factors for FMD include female sex, tobacco use, and a family history of FMD.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, renal artery stenosis can present with refractory hypertension, impaired renal function, pulmonary edema, and congestive HF. Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of renal artery stenosis can be severe if left untreated, potentially leading to CKD or ESRD. Patients undergoing revascularization for hypertension related to atherosclerotic stenosis should continue pharmacotherapy after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Restenosis occurs in 10–25% of cases.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^1166ixhG]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe hypertension accounted for 25% of our acute presentation cases. Hypertension is a common co-morbidity worldwide and a leading cause of mortality. Prevention and control of hypertension decreases mortality and incidence of heart failure. The prevalence in the past two decades has been increasing possibly due to increased consumption of processed food and changes in lifestyle. Up to 15% of those with hypertension will develop resistant hypertension.

In the general population there is a high prevalence of resistant hypertension amongst those with CKD with increasing prevalence seen with reducing renal function, ranging from 15% in those with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 to 33.4% in those with eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73m 2. Previous RCT such as STAR, CORAL and ASTRAL have failed to demonstrate a significant benefit to patient outcome in patients with poorly controlled blood pressure or progressive renal impairment.

Other smaller studies of patients with high grade RAS that was managed medically without revascularisation found that more anti-hypertensive medications were required to effectively control blood pressure and that 5.8% of patients eventually required revascularisation. In our case series, those with severe hypertension were receiving an average of 5 anti-hypertensive agents before stenting, which improved to an average of 3 agents to achieve target blood pressure post revascularisation. Our case series emphasises the need for monitoring patients with hypertension and other vascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, smoking and dyslipidaemia to identify those most likely to benefit from revascularisation so as to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Previous studies have highlighted the benefit of revascularisation in those with heart failure with a substantial reduction in all-cause mortality and hospital admission. The presence of an acute heart failure syndrome was the indication for revascularisation in 19% of the acute RAS presentations to our unit. In two of these patients there was a significant improvement in volume overload, blood pressure and renal function. One of the patients who did not benefit from stenting had previously benefitted from revascularisation on two separate occasions. There is a high prevalence of RAS amongst those with more chronic congestive heart failure ranging from 15 to 54% depending on the cohort studied and imaging modality used to identify the presence of RAS. In those with heart failure the presence of RAS is associated with worse renal outcomes and higher mortality.

Renal artery stenosis — evidence from ASTRAL and CORAL trials and when stenting could be considered: Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) and the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trials demonstrated no benefit of renal angioplasty over medical therapy. In CORAL, adults had atherosclerotic renal artery disease defined as > 60% stenosis and hypertension or CKD stages 3 to 4; individuals with a serum creatinine level > 4 mg/dL, stenosis not treatable with a single stent, or fibromuscular dysplasia were excluded, and participants were randomly assigned to medical therapy alone versus stenting combined with medical therapy. Annual eGFR decline was 1.5 ± 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 with stenting and 2.3 ± 6.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 without stenting (P = 0.18). Viewed with other studies, these results do not support routine use of stenting of unilateral renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis; however, in significant atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (> 60%) with inability to control BP with medical management, stenting of the atherosclerotic renal artery could be considered, particularly in cases of bilateral renal artery stenosis, which was a priori excluded from the CORAL study.

### Renal artery stenosis: optimizing diagnosis and treatment [^112Dx2Ma]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, with fibromuscular dysplasia being the most frequent among other less common etiologies. A high index of suspicion based on clinical features is essential for diagnosis. Revascularization strategies are currently a topic of discussion and debate. When revascularization is deemed appropriate, atherosclerotic RAS is most often treated with stent placement, whereas patients with fibromuscular dysplasia are usually treated with balloon angioplasty. Ongoing randomized trials should help to better define the optimal management of RAS.

### Mild renal artery stenosis can induce renovascular hypertension and is associated with elevated renal vein renin secretion [^117MjQsg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension is a syndrome which encompasses the physiological response of the kidney to changes in renal blood flow and renal perfusion pressure. Such physiological changes can occur with renal artery occlusion irrespective of the severity of the lesion. We have analyzed hypertensive patients with mild renal artery stenosis and compared them to patients with no stenosis. Renal vein renin sampling from catheterization of the renal vein was performed in all these patients. Patients with mild stenosis had higher renal vein renin ratio (3.01 ± 1.5) than the patients with no stenosis (1.10 ± 0.29; p = 0.002). Patients with mild stenosis were also found to have higher diastolic blood pressure and renal artery resistive indices when compared to patients with no stenosis. We therefore conclude that mild stenosis can precipitate renin-mediated hypertension in renovascular stenosis and also emphasis that parameters pertinent to renal physiology need to be evaluated before considering treatment options in patients with renal artery stenosis and medical management with RAAS blockade is the preferred modality of therapy for patients with renin-mediated hypertension.

INTRODUCTION

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) represents the most common type of renal artery stenosis (RAS), accounting for ≈90% of patients with RAS versus 10% of cases that are due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and other, more rare causes. ARVD is commonly clustered with various comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease and heart failure (HF), and its overall prognosis is unfavourable. Despite the fact that the pathophysiological basis of RAS was originally described almost 100 years ago, the optimal treatment of ARVD is still highly controversial. Preliminary observational evidence indicated the efficacy and safety of percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTRA) with or without stenting for the treatment of ARVD, but subsequent randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate the superiority of revascularization in addition to standard medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone in lowering blood pressure (BP) levels or preventing adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes in patients with ARVD. However, these trials had several limitations in design or execution flaws and met important criticism. Recent observational studies in ARVD patients with high-risk clinical presentations have demonstrated that successful restoration of blood flow is associated with the preservation of kidney function and decreased risk of CV events and death.

This document was prepared by experts from the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and from the Working Group on Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH). It briefly summarizes current knowledge in epidemiology, pathophysiology and diagnostic assessment of ARVD and presents, following a systematic literature review, key evidence relevant to medical or interventional treatment, with an aim to support clinicians in decision -making and everyday management of patients with this condition.

### Endovascular intervention in renovascular disease: a pictorial review [^112spGdW]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a narrowing of the renal arteries, often associated with renovascular hypertension and an increased risk of renal insufficiency. Atherosclerotic RAS constitutes 90% of RAS cases, increasing in prevalence in patients with diabetes, hypertension, aortoiliac occlusive disease, and coronary artery disease, as well as with age. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) accounts for fewer than 10% of RAS cases. FMD occurs nine times more frequently in females than in males, tending to affect women aged 15 to 50.

Numerous physiologic and imaging-based modalities exist for the evaluation of patients with clinical suspicion of RAS. Generally, noninvasive evaluations by duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or computed tomographic angiography (CTA) serve as initial diagnostic tools. Subsequent catheter-based angiography permits confirmation of the RAS, aetiology, extent of intrarenal vascular disease, as well as intervention planning. Contrast medium must be used cautiously in patients with renal failure given the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Digital subtraction techniques may decrease the required contrast volume, thereby minimising impact on renal function.

RAS resulting from atherosclerotic disease typically involves the ostium and proximal third of the main renal artery (Fig. 1a). FMD refers to a collection of vascular diseases of the intima, media (90%), and adventitia (periarterial). RAS secondary to medial FMD is characterised by a beaded, aneurysmal appearance localised to the distal two-thirds of the renal artery and its branches (Fig. 2a), whereas intimal and periarterial FMD is commonly associated with progressive vessel dissection and thrombosis. Bilateral renal artery FMD is observed in greater than 35% of patients.

Renal artery stenosis — treatment recommendations specify that in adults with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, medical therapy is recommended to reduce kidney and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. In adults with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis for whom medical management has failed (eg, resistant hypertension, worsening kidney function, and/or acute heart failure [HF]), it is reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and stent placement. In adults with hypertension and nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, including fibromuscular dysplasia, it may be reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^114szL6D]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) often follows an asymptomatic chronic course which may be undetected for many years. However, there are certain critical acute presentations associated with ARVD and these require a high index of suspicion for underlying high-grade RAS (renal artery stenosis) to improve patient outcomes. These acute presentations, which include decompensated heart failure syndromes, accelerated hypertension, rapidly declining renal function, and acute kidney injury (AKI), are usually associated with bilateral high-grade RAS (> 70% stenosis), or high-grade RAS in a solitary functioning kidney in which case the contralateral kidney is supplied by a vessel demonstrating renal artery occlusion (RAO). These presentations are typically underrepresented in large, randomized control trials which to date have been largely negative in terms of the conferred benefit of revascularization.

Case presentation

Here we describe 9 individual patients with 3 classical presentations including accelerated phase hypertension, heart failure syndromes, AKI and a fourth category of patients who suffered recurrent presentations. We describe their response to renal revascularization. The predominant presentation was that consistent with ischaemic nephropathy all of whom had a positive outcome with revascularization.

Conclusion

A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these instances so that timely revascularization can be undertaken to restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure syndromes.

### Beyond atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia: rare causes of renovascular hypertension [^113KCE6Y]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Renovascular hypertension is one of the most common forms of secondary hypertension. Over 95% of cases of renovascular hypertension are due either to atherosclerosis of the main renal artery trunks or to fibromuscular dysplasia. These two causes of renal artery stenosis have been extensively discussed in recent reviews and consensus. The aim of the current article is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on the remaining causes. While these causes are rare or extremely rare, etiologic and differential diagnosis matters both for prognosis and management. Therefore, the clinician cannot ignore them. For didactic reasons, we have grouped these different entities into stenotic lesions (neurofibromatosis type 1 and other rare syndromes, dissection, arteritis, and segmental arterial mediolysis) often associated with aortic coarctation and other arterial abnormalities, and nonstenotic lesions, where hypertension is secondary to compression of adjacent arteries and changes in arterial pulsatility (aneurysm) or to the formation of a shunt, leading to kidney ischemia (arteriovenous fistula). Finally, thrombotic disorders of the renal artery may also be responsible for renovascular hypertension. Although thrombotic/embolic lesions do not represent primary vessel wall disease, they are characterized by frequent macrovascular involvement. In this review, we illustrate the most characteristic aspects of these different entities responsible for renovascular hypertension and discuss their prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, management, and prognosis.

### Clinical outcomes after percutaneous revascularization versus medical management in patients with significant renal artery stenosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115X5DqP]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to systematically evaluate whether percutaneous revascularization is associated with additional clinical benefit in patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) as compared with medical management alone.

Methods

We included randomized controlled trials that compared percutaneous revascularization in addition to medical therapy versus medical management alone in patients with RAS. Six trials with 1,208 patients were included.

Results

At a mean follow-up of 29 months, there was no change in systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 1.20 mm Hg, 95% CI -1.18 to 3.58 mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -1.60 mm Hg, 95% CI -4.22 to 1.02 mm Hg) from baseline in the percutaneous revascularization arm compared with the medical management arm. There was a reduction in the mean number of antihypertensive medications (WMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.13, P < .001), but not serum creatinine (WMD = -0.14 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.007 mg/dL), in the percutaneous revascularization arm at the end of follow-up. Percutaneous revascularization was not associated with a significant difference in all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.96, 95% CI 0.74–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.56–1.13), stroke (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.50–1.47), or worsening renal function (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.67–1.23) as compared with medical management.

Conclusions

In patients with RAS, percutaneous renal revascularization in addition to medical therapy may result in a lower requirement for antihypertensive medications, but not with improvements in serum creatinine or clinical outcomes, as compared with medical management over an intermediate period of follow-up. Further studies are needed to identify the appropriate patient population most likely to benefit from its use.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and accounts for approximately 1–3% of all causes of hypertension. Over 90% of RASs are caused by atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic RAS is increasingly common in aging populations, particularly elderly people with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, aortoiliac occlusive disease, coronary artery disease or hypertension. Three therapeutic options are currently available for patients with renovascular hypertension: medical antihypertensive therapy, surgical revascularisation and transluminal angioplasty including stent implantation. We present in this report a male patient with bilateral severe ostial stenosis and coronary artery disease, and who was successfully treated with renal stent implantation in one session.

### Renal artery branch stenosis induced hypertension in children: a case series [^113RGbRc]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

HTN is considered a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. Studies have shown that elevated BP in childhood increases the risk for adult HTN and metabolic syndrome. Since the publication of "The Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents" in 2004, pediatric HTN has attracted increasing attention. Epidemic investigations have indicated that there has been an increase in the prevalence of childhood high BP, including both HTN and elevated BP with the actual prevalence of ~ 3.5%. The etiology of HTN is classified as primary HTN and secondary HTN. Primary HTN is now the predominant diagnosis for hypertensive children and adolescents. The secondary causes of HTN in children including renal disease and renovascular disease, cardiac or endocrine causes, and medication related HTN, etc.

Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is caused by renal artery stenosis (RAS), including stenosis of the main renal artery and its branches, which leads to a reduction in renal blood flow, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and subsequently an increase in BP. RVH is a common cause of secondary hypertension in children, accounting for 5–25% of cases. Children with RVH usually have relatively high BP and clinical symptoms, and BP is difficult to control by a single anti-hypertensive drug. For these patients, renal vascular ultrasound or computed tomography can establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is only capable of detecting primary branch stenosis, while identifying narrowing in secondary branches and beyond may be challenging. Therefore, diagnosis of RVH induced by artery branch stenosis is difficult. Furthermore, reported cases were limited in children, and there is no consensus on the treatment regimen for this kind of HTN. Recently renal artery intervention therapy was widely applied and could provide immediate improvement of kidney function and BP for those with renal artery abnormality. However, balloon dilation and stent implantation were not suitable for children with renal branch artery stenosis, especially those with interlobular artery stenosis, therefore, the treatment for those patients is facing great challenge.

This article analyzes the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment strategies of four children with HTN induced by renal artery branch stenosis, with the aim of providing clinical guidance for diagnosis and patent therapeutic regimen.

In adults with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis for whom medical management has failed (eg, resistant hypertension, worsening kidney function, and/or acute HF), it is reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stent placement (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In adults with hypertension and nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, including fibromuscular dysplasia, it may be reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty (Class 2b, Level C-LD).

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of CTA and MRA, invasive catheter angiography remains the gold standard method for RAS diagnosis and evaluation and it should guide the final decision to intervene. Catheter angiography additionally enables measurement of pre- and post-intervention pressure gradients to establish the haemodynamic severity of the stenosis and the possibility of treatment in the same setting and time. By expert consensus and based on studies, an angiographic RAS > 70% lumen stenosis is considered severe or significant, and stenoses of 50–70% are considered moderately severe and of uncertain haemodynamic significance. For moderately severe stenoses, confirmation of the haemodynamic severity of the RAS is recommended prior to stenting. A resting or hyperaemic translesional systolic gradient ≥ 20 mmHg, a resting or hyperaemic mean translesional gradient ≥ 10 mmHg or a renal fractional flow reserve (RFFR) ≤ 0.8 confirms haemodynamically severe RAS.

Management

ARVD management includes medical therapy with or without renal artery revascularization.

### Clinical problems in renovascular disease and the role of nuclear medicine [^115M3nnx]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although renovascular disease remains defined as a stenosis of the main renal artery or its proximal branches (renal artery stenosis [RAS]), its clinical overview has changed dramatically over the last 15–20 years and its management is more controversial than ever before. The clinical problems, not only diagnosis and treatment but also the relative contribution of different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the progression of kidney disease, have shifted dramatically. This presentation aims to emphasize the paradigm change revisiting the (recent) past focused on renovascular hypertension (RVH) to the current context of preservation or recovery of threatened renal function in patients with progressive atherosclerotic renovascular disease until its last stage of irreversible "ischemic nephropathy". In the past, the foreground was occupied by RVH, a very rare disease, where the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was supposed to play the major, if not only, role in RVH issues. The retrospective RVH diagnosis was established either on the improvement or, more rarely, on the cure of hypertension after revascularization by, most often, a percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without a stent placement. At this time, captoptril radionuclide renography was an efficient diagnostic tool, because it was a functional (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition), noninvasive test aiming to evidence both the RAAS activation and the lateralization (or asymmetry) of renin secretion by the kidney affected by a "hemodynamically significant" RAS. At present, even if captoptril radionuclide renography could be looked upon as the most efficient (and cost effective in selected high-risk patients) noninvasive, functional test to predict the improvement of hypertension after RAS correction, its clinical usefulness is questioned as the randomized, prospective trials failed to demonstrate any significant benefits (either on blood pressure control or on renal function protection) of the revascularization over current antihypertensive therapy. Today many patients with RVH remain undetected for years because they are treated successfully and at low expense with these new blockers of RAAS. In addition to its well-known role in hemodynamics, angiotensin II promotes activations of profibrogenic and inflammatory factors and cells and stimulates reactive oxygen species generation. The "atherosclerotic milieu" itself plays a role in the loss of renal microvessels and defective angiogenesis. After an "adaptative" phase, ischemia eventually develops and induces hypoxia, the substratum of ischemic nephropathy. Because blood oxygen level-dependent MRI may provide an index of oxygen content in vivo, it may be useful to predict renal function outcome after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty. New PET tracers, dedicated to assess RAAS receptors, inflammatory cell infiltrates, angiogenesis, and apoptose, would be tested in this context of atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

### Management of renal artery stenosis: the case for intervention, defending current guidelines, and screening (drive-by) renal angiography at the time of catheterization [^111h8fSa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

There is little debate that an untreated significant obstruction of blood flow to the kidney, most often due to atherosclerosis, is potentially hazardous to the health of patients. The treatment of atherosclerotic renovascular disease has evolved over the past 20 years from open surgery with its inherent morbidity and risk of mortality to percutaneous endovascular treatment with stents. The current debate is on the question of which patients are offered any additional advantage by revascularization for renal artery stenosis over medications alone. The primary issue is patient selection, including the most appropriate screening strategies for renal artery stenosis, which must be balanced against the risk of procedure-related complications. The goal of this paper is to explore the most appropriate utilization of revascularization with renal stent placement.

INTRODUCTION

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) refers to the presence of a lesion that narrows the vessel lumen by at least 60%, the hemodynamic significance of which can be further confirmed by determining the pressure gradient with endovascular methods. It can occur in up to 5–10% of the general population, and its main cause is the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, the prevalence of the disease increases with age and correlates with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, male sex, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or a family history. In 20%, it occurs bilaterally or involves the single functioning kidney. Rarer causes include fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a history of or active vasculitis including the presence of Takayasu arteritis (type 3, 4 or 5 disease). FMD occurs in a younger population, is nine times more common in women and is more common in people without cardiovascular risk factors, except for smoking, which contributes to its occurrence. It develops in less than 1% of the general population and is usually diagnosed in the fifth decade of life, often incidentally during diagnostic imaging performed for other clinical indications, but cases diagnosed in childhood have also been described. The pathogenesis of FMD is not fully understood. There are suggestions that it is related to the presence of genetic and environmental factors, smoking and estrogens. In 10%, the disease occurs in a family member. FMD takes the form of narrowing or widening (ectasias, aneurysms) of medium-sized arteries, and the sudden dissection of the vessel at the site of the primary lesion may occur. The condition most often affects the arteries of the central nervous system and renal arteries, less often other locations in the abdomen and vessels of the extremities. RAS, regardless of the cause, can lead to a number of adverse consequences. Reducing the flow behind the stenosis results in increased secretion of renin in the affected kidney, which leads to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system and consequently the development of secondary hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. RAS is the most common form of renovascular hypertension and one of the most common (5–28%) of secondary hypertension in general. Progressive renal ischemia may contribute to the deterioration of its excretory function and lead to chronic kidney disease and, in advanced cases, to loss of function and atrophy of the organ. During RAS, there may also be recurrent pulmonary oedema with abrupt onset (flash pulmonary edema), and in those cases, exclusion of structural disease in the heart suggests the presence of RAS. Other conditions that raise suspicion of renal artery disease include onset of hypertension less than 30 years of age, rapid acceleration of previously well controlled blood pressure, onset of resistant hypertension, hypertensive crisis (acute heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy), unexplained renal atrophy or disproportion in kidney size, unexplained kidney failure, worsening of kidney function after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB).

Figure shows the suspected mechanisms of BP elevation in renal artery stenosis and recommendations for management of renovascular hypertension. Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis induces excessive activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, causing both sympathetic nervous system activation and fluid retention, which may lead to an elevated BP level at bedtime and/or an abnormal nocturnal BP dipping pattern.

Figure 1
Mechanisms and management of renovascular hypertension.

Renal artery stenosis leads to renal hypoperfusion, which induces excessive activation of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous systems, as well as fluid retention caused by the decrease in pressure natriuresis. These abnormalities cause elevation of BP levels and flash pulmonary edema. Based on the mechanisms of renovascular hypertension, we speculated that an increase in nighttime BP levels and abnormal nocturnal BP dipping may occur in patients with resistant hypertension due to renovascular disease. Nighttime BP is an important target to prevent CVD events especially in resistant hypertension. In the management of renovascular hypertension, interventional renal angioplasty including PTRA should be considered in patients with poor BP control despite adequate use of multiple antihypertensive medications. *Contraindicated in bilateral stenosis and taking care of renal dysfunction.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^1156h7qu]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Revascularization consists of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with only balloon or with stent implantation; recently, an attractive option has been the use of a drug-coated balloon (DCB). Surgery is undertaken only in exceptional or refractory cases. The discussion on the effectiveness and benefits from invasive procedures has been going on for years. Currently, the authors of the guidelines do not recommend routine revascularization since there are no benefits of such management over conservative treatment have been demonstrated, apart from a slight reduction in the number of antihypertensive drugs used (2.96 vs. 3.18 drugs). Studies, including the randomized CORAL and ASTRAL trials, have not confirmed the benefit of revascularization in terms of renal function. However, it should be remembered that only patients with atherosclerotic cause of stenosis were included in these studies. Thus, European guidelines do not recommend routine revascularization for RAS (recommendation class III) and allow endovascular treatment in specific causes or clinical situations, such as stenosis due to FMD, renal artery disease with sudden pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure and in renal artery disease with acute renal failure with oliguria or anuria. In the case of FMD, it should be undertaken only in symptomatic patients with organ ischemia, and balloon angioplasty is the treatment of choice, with stent implantation only in case of arterial dissection or balloon angioplasty failure (class of recommendations IIa).

- resistant hypertension, hypertension of abrupt onset or worsening or increasingly difficult to control, flash pulmonary edema (atherosclerotic), early-onset hypertension, especially in women (fibromuscular hyperplasia)

- abdominal systolic-diastolic bruit, bruits over carotid (atherosclerotic or FMD) or femoral arteries.

### Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease [^1161urkb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) complicated by intradialytic hypertension (IDH). Increased sympathetic drive leading to increased stroke volume and/or vasoconstriction with an inappropriate increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) has been postulated to be the cause of IDH.

Case presentation

Attempts to control her blood pressure by reducing her goal weight; increasing dialysis times/ frequency and decreasing her sodium concentrate in the dialysis fluid were unsuccessful. Acting upon literature evidence suggesting renovascular disease as a cause of IDH, we referred her to an interventional radiologist for evaluation of the renal arteries. Selective angiogram of both renal arteries revealed right sided atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) treated with insertion of a balloon mounted 6 mm stent and left sided fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) treated with 5 mm balloon angioplasty.

Conclusions

This case highlights the need for interrogating the renal arteries radiologically for a potential cause in difficult to control IDH and comments on the association between PKD and FMD that has not yet been reported.

### Spleno-renal artery transposition in a solitary functioning kidney for treatment-resistant hypertension and acute kidney injury [^112sPWUe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS) is an important cause of treatment-resistant hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension with RAS can cause progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to end-stage kidney disease. Therapeutic revascularisation can be helpful in appropriate circumstances where pharmaceutical intervention has failed and significant renovascular disease contributes to resistant hypertension. We present an interesting case of a Caucasian male with peripheral vasculopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), single functioning kidney and ostial RAS caused by stent struts from an endovascular AAA stent graft. He had escalating medications requirement, with repeated failed attempts at percutaneous radiological intervention that led to an episode of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), before undergoing successful surgical revascularisation by a splenic artery transposition graft to the left renal artery that was performed to improve kidney function and the blood pressure. This report highlights the challenges faced with regard to the management of severe hypertension and progressive CKD.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^111vP7cu]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) often follows an asymptomatic chronic course which may be undetected for many years. The prevalence of ARVD ranges depending on the population studied. In the general asymptomatic population, it is estimated that 6.8% of the population over the age of 65 years have evidence of 50% or greater renal artery stenosis (RAS) on duplex ultrasound. In those with established cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors the prevalence increases to up to 54% in those with congestive heart failure.

However, there are certain critical acute presentations associated with ARVD and these require a high index of suspicion for underlying high-grade RAS to improve patient outcomes. These acute presentations, which include decompensated heart failure syndromes, accelerated hypertension, rapidly declining renal function, and acute kidney injury (AKI), are usually associated with bilateral high-grade RAS (> 70% stenosis), or high-grade RAS in a solitary functioning kidney in which case the contralateral kidney is supplied by a vessel demonstrating renal artery occlusion (RAO). As the latter presentations are rarely associated with flank pain or haematuria, the consensus is that these RAO are usually chronic.

In contrast, acute RAO is a rare and organ threatening condition with varied presentations. The potential causes include thromboembolic disease, renal artery thrombosis, dissection and iatrogenic during endovascular procedure. One of the leading causes of acute occlusion is atherosclerosis. The majority of patients with acute RAO present with flank pain or with features such as fever, nausea, uncontrolled hypertension, haematuria or acute renal injury. Nonspecific features can result in a delay in diagnosis which leads to delayed management and long-term sequelae such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Functional MRI studies measuring tissue oxygenation by blood oxygenation level dependant (BOLD) MRI have shown that when increasing severity of RAS occurs beyond 70% there is risk of progressive reduction in perfusion leading to cortical ischaemia. This in turn leads to reduced renal blood flow and oxygenation within the affected kidney, with consequent activation of inflammatory pathways with increased levels of biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase- associated lipocalin (NGAL) ultimately leading to fibrosis. For optimal patient outcome a haemodynamically significant atheromatous lesion must be identified and addressed early before the inflammatory pathway is activated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries — supportive text on management and revascularization: Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries represents systemic disease and indicates higher risk for both kidney failure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and no RCT has demonstrated a clear clinical advantage of renal artery revascularization over medical therapy in individuals with hypertension; by meta-analysis, renal angioplasty with stenting results in a small reduction in DBP and antihypertensive medication requirement. On the basis of the CORAL trial, the recommended medical approach includes a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker plus lipid, diabetes, and antiplatelet management. Revascularization can be favorable for select individuals with uncontrolled hypertension and progressively worsening kidney function and/or acute HF who were not represented in RCTs, and may be considered for nonatherosclerotic renal artery disease and hypertension and may be curative. Fibromuscular dysplasia is most common in women (90%) and may present at a younger age (mean age 53 years), and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone without stenting can improve BP control and even normalize BP, especially when hypertension is of recent onset or resistant.

ABSTRACT

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following the evolution of evidence in recent years, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. These include recommendations for target office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg in most and against target office BP < 120/70 mmHg in all patients with CKD; recommendations for use of spironolactone or chlorthalidone for patients with resistant hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher or lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively; use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for patients with CKD and estimated eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2; use of finerenone for patients with CKD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; and revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and secondary hypertension or high-risk phenotypes if stenosis ≥ 70% is present. The present report is a synopsis of sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and the overall management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Percutaneous revascularization for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115UmcMq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous revascularization (PR) of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) improves patency in the renovascular disease. However, whether PR is associated with additional clinical benefits in the patients with atherosclerotic RAS remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of PR versus medication alone for atherosclerotic RAS.

Methods

We compiled an electronic database of prospective, randomized, controlled trials related to the efficacy of PR versus medication for RAS. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk ratios (RRs) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention-to-treat analysis. We considered the following outcomes: changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), reduction in antihypertension medication, serum creatinine, worsening renal failure, mortality, stroke, and congestive heart failure.

Results

Seven trials with a total of 1916 patients (937 with PR, 979 with medication alone) were analyzed. The changes in SBP/DBP from baseline were similar between the 2 groups (changes in SBP: P = 0.69; changes in DBP: P = 0.15). PR treatment led to a statistically significant decrease in the number of antihypertensive medications compared with medical management alone (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.10, P < 0.001). The pooled RR for deteriorating renal function, congestive heart failure, or stroke showed no significant difference.

Conclusion

PR is equally effective to medical management in the treatment of RAS. Therefore, patients with atherosclerotic RAS along with hypertension or chronic kidney disease should receive medical therapy to control blood pressure, but they should not be considered for a renal artery stent.

Renovascular hypertension is one of the common causes of secondary hypertension. Here we report a case of patient of renal artery stenosis presenting to the emergency department as a case of acute flaccid paralysis. Renal artery stenosis has been associated with hypokalaemia, but rarely reported to be symptomatic. Initial correction of hypokalaemia leads to improvement of weakness and aetiological work up for hypokalaemia with hypertension revealed hypokalaemia due to hyperaldosteronism secondary to unilateral renal artery stenosis. The patient was managed medically with aldosterone antagonist in the anti hypertensive therapy and weakness did not recur despite withdrawal of potassium supplements. On follow-up, the patient was ambulatory with no signs of weakness, controlled blood pressure and normal potassium level.

### Renal artery stenosis… [^114hLyxU]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the arteries to one or both of the kidneys that can cause hypertension and, sometimes, reduced kidney function and size. It occurs more commonly in older people with atherosclerosis. Hypertension caused by RAS is called secondary hypertension. This means that, unlike essential or primary hypertension, secondary hypertension does have a specific cause. In some cases, diagnosing and treating RAS can result in decreasing or eliminating the need to take medication for hypertension.

The narrowing of the kidney arteries in RAS is usually due to atherosclerosis; more rarely it can be caused by abnormal growth of tissue within the wall of the artery. The latter condition, called fibromuscular dysplasia, is potentially curable and is more common in women and younger age groups but can also occur later in life. When atherosclerosis is the cause of RAS, it is especially important to be evaluated and treated for related diseases of the heart and brain, since they are also susceptible to narrowed arteries. Atherosclerosis in those organs can lead to heart attack or stroke. The November 5, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about an 82-year-old woman with hypertension and renal artery stenosis. Symptoms Most often, renal artery stenosis does not cause any specific symptoms. Rarely, a person may have symptoms related to high blood pressure such as fatigue, headache, or dizziness.

Diagnosis New onset of high blood pressure in someone younger than 35 or older than 55 Worsening control of previously well-controlled hypertension, or very high blood pressure, especially if it is affecting other organs in the body. Treatment Take medication to control blood pressure. This may require 3 or more different drugs. Don't smoke. Control diabetes if it is present. Control cholesterol, taking medications if necessary. Renal artery angioplasty and stenting are only done if blood pressure cannot be controlled with medications or if blood tests indicate a significant worsening of kidney function.

### Radiologic evaluation of suspected renovascular hypertension… [^115A5U6J]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The prevention and management of hypertension are major public health challenges for the United States. Most patients with hypertension have essential hypertension that is managed with lifestyle adjustments and pharmacologic therapy. 1 In some patients, a secondary treatable cause of hypertension is present, with renal artery stenosis as the most common etiology. Although there are a number of diseases that can cause renal artery stenosis, atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the most common. There are a variety of clinical findings associated with renovascular hypertension. 2 The presence of these findings improves the predictive value of the diagnostic imaging evaluations. If renal artery stenosis can be reversed, the patient's hypertension can theoretically improve. However, it is important to note that the presence of a detectable stenosis that can be treated with angioplasty or surgical intervention does not ensure a cure for all patients.

His physical examination was unremarkable; specifically, no abdominal bruit was identified. His serum creatinine level was 1. 6 mg per dL. Given his history of vascular disease and recent onset of uncontrollable hypertension, renal artery stenosis was suspected. Because of his mildly elevated creatinine, a duplex Doppler ultrasonography was ordered, followed by magnetic resonance angiography. Catheter-directed renal artery angiography confirmed renal artery stenosis, and angioplasty was performed, with placement of an arterial stent across the stenosis. Following reduction of the stenosis, the patient became normotensive, with blood pressure readings in the 120s/60s mm Hg. Her serum creatinine level was 1. 0 mg per dL. Given the uncontrollable nature of her hypertension, renal artery stenosis was suspected. Computed tomographic angiography was performed on this patient with normal renal function.

This demonstrated a tight ostial stenosis that is typical of atherosclerosis. Catheter-directed renal artery angioplasty with stent placement was performed, and the ostial lesion was identified and treated. Fibromuscular dysplasia involving the mid-right renal artery was discovered and treated with balloon angioplasty before the stent placement. Following reduction of the stenoses, the patient's hypertension improved, with subsequent blood pressure readings in the 150s/80s mm Hg.
