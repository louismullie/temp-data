## Question

ICD 10 post partum code

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ICD-10 postpartum codes, specifically which codes to use, how to apply them, and how to interpret them in context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "postpartum" means clinically and how ICD-10 defines the puerperium. Then, I should verify the main ICD-10 categories that capture postpartum conditions and care. Next, I will examine specific high-frequency codes like Z39.2 for routine postpartum care, O72 for postpartum hemorrhage, and F53 for postpartum mental health. After that, I should review coding nuances such as timing, sequencing, and the impact of the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance and highlight limitations and validation considerations so the user can apply these codes accurately in both clinical and research settings.

> Let me first confirm the clinical and coding definition of "postpartum". Clinically, the immediate postpartum period spans the first 6 weeks after delivery, but many maternal health frameworks extend surveillance to 12 months for conditions like perinatal depression and severe maternal morbidity, so I need to keep both conventions in mind when selecting codes and interpreting data. ICD-10-CM uses the puerperium to refer to the period after childbirth, and many O codes explicitly denote conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, which guides code selection for postpartum complications and care encounters [^115JGJwV] [^111e2TLS].

> Next, I should review the major ICD-10-CM categories that encompass postpartum conditions. Hold on, let me verify the structure: Chapter 15 (O00–O9A) covers pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, including complications like hemorrhage, infection, and hypertensive disorders. Z codes include routine postpartum care and follow-up, such as Z39.2 for postpartum care. Mental and behavioral disorders in the postpartum period are coded in the F chapter, notably F53 for mental disorders associated with the puerperium, and injuries complicating pregnancy or the puerperium are captured by O9A.2–O9A.5, which I should remember for trauma or abuse-related presentations [^111e2TLS] [^117AzMk5] [^111goWyF] [^112p5LmB].

> I will now examine the routine postpartum care code, Z39.2, because it is commonly used for billing and surveillance. Wait, let me verify the timing and usage: in claims-based studies, Z39.2 is used to identify reimbursed postpartum visits, typically within 60 days of delivery, and it is the standard code for routine postpartum checkups in systems that bill separately for postpartum care. This aligns with CMS-aligned strategies that capture visits within 60 days, so I should use Z39.2 for routine postpartum encounters and be mindful of payer-specific windows [^117AzMk5] [^112Fii2d].

> Now, I should review postpartum hemorrhage coding, since it is a leading postpartum complication. ICD-10-CM uses O72.x for postpartum hemorrhage, with subcategories for atony, retained placenta, delayed or secondary hemorrhage, and coagulation defects. Hold on, I should verify the definitional nuance: while clinical definitions often use 500 mL after vaginal birth and 1,000 mL after cesarean, coding may not always distinguish by mode, and some countries use 500 mL universally, so I need to code based on documented diagnosis rather than trying to infer blood loss thresholds from the code itself. Validation work shows high specificity but variable sensitivity for PPH in administrative data, reinforcing the need to pair codes with clinical context or procedures like transfusion when studying severity [^1141gFEt] [^116dJsoN] [^1175hvcc].

> Let me consider postpartum mental health coding next. ICD-10-CM includes F53 for mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, but I should confirm the timing conventions. DSM-5 uses a peripartum-onset specifier for major depressive disorder with onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum, whereas many clinical and public health frameworks extend surveillance to 12 months. Practically, studies often combine F53 with F32–F33 depression codes and medication proxies to capture perinatal depression, and some exclude F53 within the first week to avoid capturing self-limited "baby blues", so I should align code selection with the clinical question and timeframe [^112Ddr5f] [^115JGJwV] [^113zgatf] [^111goWyF].

> I need to check injury and abuse coding in the postpartum period. O9A.2–O9A.5 denote injuries, poisoning, and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, and they should be sequenced first when the injury or abuse is the reason for encounter, followed by the specific injury code. Validation studies show high positive predictive value when these codes are used as principal diagnoses, especially in emergency department data, but lower PPV when listed secondarily, so I should prioritize sequencing and corroborate with clinical notes when possible [^112p5LmB] [^115y4Epa] [^113JzmNc].

> Hold on, I should verify the impact of the ICD-9 to ICD-10 transition on postpartum coding and ascertainment. The transition in 2015 introduced far more granular obstetric codes and removed the explicit antepartum/delivery/postpartum status designations, which changed how some conditions are captured and categorized. Interrupted time series analyses show abrupt changes in prevalence for several pregnancy-related categories at the transition, and severe maternal morbidity algorithms had to be updated and revalidated, reminding me to be cautious when comparing pre- and post-2015 trends and to use validated ICD-10 code sets whenever possible [^111e2TLS] [^113QZ5Mf] [^116frLSA].

> Next, I should review practical coding guidance and common pitfalls. For routine postpartum visits, use Z39.2 and ensure the encounter is billed within the payer's postpartum window. For complications, select the most specific O code that matches the documented condition and timing, and add additional codes for severity or procedures when relevant, such as transfusion codes with O72 to signal severe hemorrhage. For mental health, combine diagnostic codes with treatment codes or medication proxies to improve sensitivity, and remember that F53 is appropriate for postpartum-onset disorders within the first 6 weeks, while many programs track depression up to 12 months. Always document the timing relative to delivery to support accurate code assignment and to distinguish immediate postpartum from extended postpartum periods [^117AzMk5] [^111qrW8e] [^113zgatf] [^112Ddr5f].

> But wait, what if I am trying to identify postpartum conditions in claims for research or quality surveillance? I should double-check that the codes I choose have been validated for the outcome of interest. For example, the CDC SMM algorithm has been adapted for ICD-10 and has known performance characteristics, and injury codes O9A.2–O9A.5 have validated PPVs in inpatient and ED settings. Conversely, some conditions like drug overdose in perinatal populations have low sensitivity when identified by ICD codes alone, so I should consider multi-source ascertainment or natural language processing when accuracy is critical [^116frLSA] [^115y4Epa] [^114s6Pxq].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am precise about the clinical context and timing when selecting ICD-10 postpartum codes. Use Z39.2 for routine postpartum care within the relevant reimbursement window, O72.x for postpartum hemorrhage with attention to subtypes, F53 for puerperal mental disorders within 6 weeks (and consider F32–F33 plus treatment codes for extended perinatal depression), and O9A.2–O9A.5 for injuries or abuse complicating the puerperium, sequencing appropriately. Always corroborate with clinical documentation, be mindful of the ICD-10 transition effects when comparing over time, and prefer validated code sets and algorithms when measuring outcomes for research or quality improvement [^117AzMk5] [^1141gFEt] [^113zgatf] [^113AVMaE] [^111e2TLS] [^116frLSA].

The ICD-10-CM code for routine postpartum care is **Z39.2** (encounter for routine postpartum follow-up). This code is used for standard postpartum visits within 6 weeks after delivery and should be sequenced first when postpartum care is the primary reason for the encounter. For complications, use specific ICD-10-CM codes (e.g. O72 for postpartum hemorrhage, O86.0 for infection, F53 for postpartum mental health) and sequence them before Z39.2 when the complication is the main reason for the visit [^117AzMk5] [^112p5LmB] [^1141gFEt] [^112Ddr5f].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for routine postpartum care

The primary ICD-10-CM code for routine postpartum care is **Z39.2**, defined as "encounter for routine postpartum follow-up". This code applies to standard postpartum visits within 6 weeks after delivery and should be sequenced first when postpartum care is the primary reason for the encounter.

---

## Clinical scenarios for using Z39.2

Z39.2 is appropriate for routine postpartum visits, including:

- **Routine postpartum check-ups**: Standard visits within 6 weeks after delivery to assess maternal recovery, wound healing, and overall well-being.
- **Postpartum counseling**: Counseling on breastfeeding, contraception, and maternal-infant care.
- **Screening and assessment**: Screening for postpartum depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions [^112Ddr5f].

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for postpartum complications

While Z39.2 covers routine care, postpartum complications require **specific ICD-10-CM codes**. Common examples include:

| **Condition** | **ICD-10-CM code** |
|-|-|
| Postpartum hemorrhage | O72.0, O72.1, O72.2, O72.3 |
| Postpartum infection | O86.0, O86.1, O86.2, O86.3, O86.4 |
| Postpartum depression | F53.0, F53.1 |
| Postpartum hypertension | O16.1, O16.2, O16.3, O16.4 |
| Lactation disorders | O92.0, O92.1, O92.2, O92.3, O92.4, O92.5, O92.6 |

---

These codes should be sequenced before Z39.2 when the complication is the **primary reason for the visit**.

---

## Coding guidelines and documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on **thorough documentation**:

- **Primary diagnosis**: Document the main reason for the visit (e.g. routine postpartum care vs. complication).
- **Specificity**: Use the most specific ICD-10-CM code available for complications.
- **Sequencing**: Sequence the complication code first when it is the primary reason for the encounter, followed by Z39.2 if routine care is also provided [^notfound].

---

## Impact of ICD-10-CM coding on healthcare delivery

ICD-10-CM coding supports:

- **Accurate billing**: Ensures appropriate reimbursement for postpartum services.
- **Clinical tracking**: Enables monitoring of postpartum outcomes and complications.
- **Quality improvement**: Facilitates identification of trends and gaps in postpartum care [^116frLSA].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Challenges include **coding variability** — inconsistent use of ICD-10-CM codes can affect data accuracy and comparability — and **documentation gaps**, where incomplete records may lead to undercoding or miscoding of postpartum conditions.

---

## Recent updates and changes

Recent updates include **expanded mental health codes** — new ICD-10-CM codes for postpartum mental health conditions (e.g. F53.0, F53.1) — and **enhanced specificity**, with more detailed codes for postpartum complications, improving clinical granularity [^116GATvr].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for routine postpartum care is **Z39.2**, used for standard postpartum visits within 6 weeks after delivery. For complications, use specific ICD-10-CM codes and sequence them before Z39.2 when the complication is the main reason for the visit.

Birth at safety net hospitals (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.37–1.51; P < .001), minority-serving hospitals (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08–1.20; P < .001), and at hospitals with fewer than 500 births per year (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.14–1.39; P < .001) relative to those with 2001 or more annual births were associated with higher adjusted odds of postpartum ED visits. Birth at a teaching hospital (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.91; P < .001) or in a metropolitan area (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85; P < .001) was associated with lower adjusted odds of postpartum ED visits. The adjusted odds of postpartum ED visits decreased as the ratio of obstetric to total births increased (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91–0.94; P = 0.01).

The 3 most common primary ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes associated with ED visits after obstetric discharge were nonspecific descriptors for postpartum complications (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1). This was followed by ICD codes for postpartum hemorrhage, infections, headaches, cesarean birth wound complications, hypertensive disorders, and abnormal uterine bleeding.

Discussion

Definitions of PPH

While no single definition for PPH is promulgated for clinicians, in the United States and Canada, for example, a blood loss of 500 mL for a vaginal delivery and 1,000 mL for a caesarean birth are often used. In contrast, a blood loss of 500 mL for a vaginal delivery and 750 mL for a caesarean delivery is used in Australia, and in other data 500 mL blood loss is used to define PPH irrespective of the mode of delivery. Regardless of the definitions used, routine visual estimates of blood loss are frequently inaccurate, and analyses using calculated blood loss demonstrate that many and perhaps most women lose enough blood at delivery to meet the diagnostic criteria for PPH. Moreover, while women delivered by caesarean section lose more blood on average than women who have vaginal births, there is no reason to believe that the physiologic impact of blood loss differs according to the route of delivery, suggesting that the use of a unified definition irrespective of the route of delivery is more appropriate. Alternatively, PPH has been defined as a 10% or more drop in hematocrit. How these definitions are used, their inherent inaccuracies, and the translation of definitions to administrative ICD coding complicates the interpretation of trend data. For example, instructions to medical coders may not discriminate between modes of delivery and instead use 500 mL of vaginal blood loss regardless of delivery route.

### Postpartum hospital use among survivors of intimate partner violence [^115onuwH]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

More than 1 in 3 individuals who identify as female, experience either intimate partner violence (IPV) or sexual assault during their lifetime, and sexual violence committed by an intimate partner is at its highest during their reproductive years. 1 As many as 20% of pregnant individuals may experience IPV, and IPV during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, making pregnant individuals an especially vulnerable population. 1 In fact, > 50% of pregnancy-associated suicides and > 45% of pregnancy-associated homicides are associated with IPV and these often occur during the postpartum period. 2 Although > 50% of maternal deaths occur postpartum, 3 little research has examined whether IPV is associated with markers of postpartum maternal morbidity, including hospital readmission and emergency department (ED) visits. 4 In addition, few studies have examined the feasibility of ascertaining IPV at the delivery hospitalization using billing codes. Although the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes include factors related to social determinants of health, ICD-10 codes are largely underutilized for the purpose of understanding risk of disease and adverse outcomes. 5 The primary objective of this study was to investigate the association of IPV screening at delivery with the incidence of postpartum hospital use. Another objective was to examine the possibility of using ICD-10 codes at the delivery hospitalization to identify IPV in pregnant individuals.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort of birth data linked with inpatient and outpatient hospital claims data, including deliveries of individuals residing in the New York City metropolitan area between 2016 and 2018. Thirty-day hospital use was ascertained by either a readmission or an ED visit within 30 days of discharge. We identified the incidence of IPV from the delivery hospital discharge records using 36 IPV-related ICD-10 codes that we identified in the literature, including those defined for adult psychological and sexual abuse. We estimated the associations between IPV identified during the delivery hospitalization and postpartum hospital use using a multivariable logistic regression and separately adjusting for demographic and structural determinants of health, psychosocial factors, comorbidities, and obstetrical complications. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). This study was approved by our institutional review board.

Results

IPV was indicated on the discharge records of 348 individuals (0.11%). As shown in the Table, the overall incidence of ED visits among individuals with an IPV-related diagnosis was 12.9%. The incidence of a postpartum ED visit was significantly higher among individuals with an IPV diagnosis than among those without (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1–3.9), and this was true after sequentially adjusting for demographic and structural determinants of health (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4–2.7), comorbidities and pregnancy complications (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), psychosocial factors (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0), and obstetrical complications (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0). The incidence of either a postpartum ED visit or readmission was also higher among those patients with an IPV-related diagnosis (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0–3.6). However, there was no significant difference in postpartum readmissions alone among patients with or without an IPV-related diagnosis.

Conclusion

This study established that postpartum ED visits are significantly higher among individuals with an IPV-related diagnosis during the delivery hospitalization in a large citywide database, even after adjusting for established risk factors for postpartum ED use. Because ED visits have been identified as a possible marker of maternal morbidity and mortality, 4 this finding may suggest that individuals affected by IPV could benefit from screening throughout pregnancy, including during the delivery hospitalization, to prevent adverse postpartum outcomes. However, as established in this study, IPV identified solely by ICD-10 codes during the delivery hospitalization is rare and likely underreported. It is possible that underdetection of IPV is because of insufficient clinician screening, a lack of documentation in the medical records using ICD-10 codes, and the medical status of the pregnant individual at the time of delivery. This finding demonstrates a need to screen and record findings thoroughly during the pregnancy period, including at delivery hospitalization, for any IPV-related diagnoses. A limitation of our data is that we were not able to ascertain hospital use outside of New York City and did not include other time points during an individual's pregnancy. Future research should identify at which time points IPV screening occurs during care of a pregnant individual and whether this may affect postpartum ED visit rates. As a clinical outcome, maternal mortality is preventable and screening for risk factors such as IPV throughout the perinatal period, including at delivery admission and during the postpartum period, is imperative for comprehensive obstetrics care.

### Using longitudinally linked data to measure severe maternal morbidity [^112p61aq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether application of a standard algorithm to hospitalizations in the prenatal and postpartum (42 days) periods increases identification of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) beyond analysis of only the delivery event.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the PELL (Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal) database, a Massachusetts population-based data system that links records from birth certificates to delivery hospital discharge records and nonbirth hospital records for all birthing individuals. We included deliveries from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2018, distinguishing between International Classification of Diseases Ninth (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding. We applied the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention algorithm for SMM used by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health to hospitalizations across the antenatal period through 42 days postpartum. Morbidity was examined both with and without blood transfusion.

Results

Overall, 594,056 deliveries were included in the analysis, and 3,947 deliveries met criteria for SMM at delivery without transfusion and 9,593 with transfusion for aggregate rates of 150.1 (95% CI 146.7–153.5) using ICD-9 codes and 196.6 (95% CI 189.5–203.7) using ICD-10 codes per 10,000 deliveries. Severe maternal morbidity at birth increased steadily across both ICD-9 and ICD-10 from 129.4 in 2009 (95% CI 126.2–132.6) using ICD-9 to 214.3 per 10,000 (95% CI 206.9–221.8) in 2018 using ICD-10. Adding prenatal and postpartum hospitalizations increased cases by 21.9% under both ICD-9 and ICD-10, resulting in a 2018 rate of 258.7 per 10,000 (95% CI 250.5–266.9). The largest increase in detected morbidity in the prenatal or postpartum time period was attributed to sepsis cases.

Conclusion

Inclusion of prenatal and postpartum hospitalizations in the identification of SMM resulted in increased ascertainment of morbid events. These results suggest a need to ensure surveillance of care quality activities beyond the birth event.

### Trends and risk markers for severe maternal morbidity and other obstetric complications [^116XUEej]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Studies of obstetric quality of care have almost exclusively focused on severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and have rarely examined more common complications. Methods: This 2016–2018 retrospective, population-based cohort study analyzed maternal delivery outcomes at 127 Illinois hospitals. International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 Revision codes were used to describe the incidence of SMM and route-specific complications. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association of maternal sociodemographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics with the likelihood of coded complications. Results: Among 421,426 deliveries, the SMM rate was 1.4% overall, 0.4% for vaginal, and 2.8% for cesarean delivery. Other complications were documented for 6.9% of women with vaginal and 10.0% of women with cesarean deliveries. While SMM rates were stable, vaginal delivery complications increased 5.9% from 2016 to 2018 and cesarean delivery complications increased 13.8%. Patient age, minority race and ethnicity, high poverty level, and preexisting and pregnancy-related clinical conditions were significantly associated with each complication outcome. Higher hospital delivery volume was associated with higher route-specific complications. Conclusion: SMM significantly underestimates the incidence of maternal complications. Complicated deliveries have much higher charges and length of stay, although ICD-10 coding intensity may influence incidence. New outcome measures based on more detailed clinical data and linked antepartum and postpartum care will be necessary to improve obstetric quality of care measurement.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage from 2000 to 2009: a population-based study [^1144dBJx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

The study population included all women, residents of British Columbia, who delivered between 2000 and 2009. Data were obtained from the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, a population-based registry whose purpose is to collect and disseminate perinatal data for research, surveillance and planning. The database contains information on approximately 99% of births in the province, including detailed clinical and diagnostic information. Standardized forms were filled-out by care providers (physicians, midwives, obstetricians, and nurses) during pregnancy, labour and delivery and postpartum, and then compiled and coded by trained data abstractors. Accuracy and validity of data is ensured through ongoing quality checks by staff, automated data rules and ongoing use in research and surveillance. All women who gave birth between April 1 st, 2000 and March 31 st, 2010 (hereafter referred to as years 2000 to 2009) and who resided in British Columbia were included in the study. This study received ethical approval from the University of British Columbia Children's & Women's Health Centre Research Ethics Board.

Postpartum hemorrhage in Canada is defined as an estimated blood loss of ≥ 500 mL after vaginal delivery or ≥ 1000 mL after cesarean delivery or as otherwise diagnosed by a care provider. Postpartum hemorrhage diagnoses were based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes recorded in the Perinatal Database (ICD-9 from 2000 to 2003 and ICD-10 from 2004 to 2009). Subtypes of postpartum hemorrhage identified with ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnostic codes included: 1) postpartum hemorrhage due to retained placenta (third stage hemorrhage), 2) postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony (occurring within 24 hours following delivery), 3) delayed and secondary postpartum hemorrhage (occurring after the first 24 hours following delivery) and 4) postpartum hemorrhage due to coagulation defects. Code details for postpartum hemorrhage did not change between ICD-9 and ICD-10.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage from 2000 to 2009: a population-based study [^112jTFKv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

The declining trend in postpartum hemorrhage among women from the Northern Health Authority may provide some etiologic insight into the increases seen elsewhere. The inter-relationship between risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage such epidural analgesia, oxytocin induction and instrumental vaginal delivery require further investigation in order to delineate their relative contributions to the change in postpartum hemorrhage rates. On the other hand, the Northern Health Authority represented one of the smaller regions and rates by year fluctuated somewhat even though the linear trend was statistically significant (Table 2). The fact that postpartum hemorrhage with hysterectomy did not increase over the latter half of the study period is a welcome development as Canada (and British Columbia in particular) has higher postpartum hemorrhage with hysterectomy rates as compared with other countries. Increasing use of procedures other than hysterectomy to control bleeding may be responsible for the trend in hysterectomy for postpartum hemorrhage.

Key strengths of our study include use of procedure code definitions for procedures to control bleeding that did not change over time, and postpartum hemorrhage code definitions that remained unchanged between ICD-9 and ICD-10. However, as noted, there was a change in the definition of postpartum hemorrhage in 2006. Besides blood transfusions and hysterectomies, other interventions with postpartum hemorrhage have not been reported in previous studies and it is unclear to what extent they have been consistently documented over time. Limitations of our study include use of information from a large perinatal database, which could contain some coding and transcription errors. In addition, multiple comparisons may increase the probability of falsely significant findings. Other limitations include problems with the clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage since estimation of blood loss during childbirth is difficult to standardize. Our use of different measures of severe postpartum hemorrhage was important for identifying increasing trends in clinically relevant cases of postpartum hemorrhage.

### Risk of postpartum readmission for depression in relation to ischaemic placental disease: a population-based study [^116rrtkT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Postpartum depression

We identified patients admitted for postpartum depression based on ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM (see eTable S1 in the supplement). We included codes to focus only on postpartum depression, rather than including other major psychiatric illnesses, given its prevalence and the ability to perform targeted impactful interventions in advance if identified. To avoid temporal bias regarding historical versus new diagnoses, women with diagnoses of any psychiatric diseases before or during the index delivery hospitalisation were excluded. This additionally allowed us to exclude those with a prior diagnosis of depression, which could also impact pregnancy and risk for postpartum depression.

Patient characteristics including maternal age, insurance payer, and median ZIP code income quartile were analysed. Hospital factors including hospital teaching status, hospital type, and hospital bed size were also studied. The primary outcome was one-year hospital readmission. Readmission was defined as readmission to the same or different hospital within one calendar year of discharge from the index hospitalisation. Hospital transfers were not included as readmissions, and only the first readmission was included in the analysis to account for multiple readmissions. Secondary outcomes included the analysis of the contribution of combined IPD factors on depression readmission.

### Differences in self-reported and billed postpartum visits among medicaid-insured individuals [^117AzMk5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

We measured routine postpartum visit attendance in PRAMS using the survey question "Since your new baby was born, have you had a postpartum checkup for yourself? (A postpartum checkup is the regular checkup a woman has about 4–6 weeks after she gives birth)". We identified postpartum care visits in outpatient Medicaid claims using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code Z39.2, which is used in South Carolina to reimburse for postpartum visits. South Carolina is 1 of 14 states that bills for postpartum visits separately from antepartum, labor, and delivery care rather than grouping payment for these services into a single perinatal care bundle billed at the time of delivery. Between 2017 and 2020, fewer than 0.5% of postpartum visits were reimbursed using bundled payment codes in South Carolina. We restricted postpartum visits in claims to those billed within 60 days after delivery to align with the postpartum care–identification strategy used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

The study outcome was data source disagreement between PRAMS and Medicaid claims because a respondent reported a postpartum visit in PRAMS without a Medicaid claim for a visit or had a Medicaid claim for a visit without reporting a visit in PRAMS. In eTable 3 in Supplement 1, we also examined these types of data source disagreement individually.

### Doula care across the maternity care continuum and impact on maternal health: evaluation of doula programs across three States using propensity score matching [^115kP8Mm]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

We assessed maternal outcomes during pregnancy (from the estimated start of pregnancy until delivery), at delivery, and during the postpartum period (up to 84 days after delivery). Outcomes included severe maternal morbidity (defined by the presence of at least one of the 21 conditions (see Supplemental Table 1) the CDC has indicated can result in significant or short-or long-term consequences to women's health), behavioral health (diagnosis of postpartum depression (PPD) or anxiety (PPA)), cesarean delivery, labor induction, rehospitalization within 60 days of delivery, emergency room (ER) visit from pregnancy complication within 30 days of delivery, and health care utilization (e.g. prenatal visits and postnatal visits). We did not evaluate maternal mortality because there were too few cases to evaluate. Outcomes were identified in claims using relevant ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, and HCPCS codes (see Supplemental Table 2).

### Postpartum emergency care visits among North Carolina medicaid beneficiaries, 2013–2019 [^111L139H]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: To describe the rate, timing, and primary diagnosis codes for emergency care visits up to 8 weeks (56 days) after live birth among Medicaid beneficiaries in North Carolina (NC). Materials and Methods: Using a linked dataset of Medicaid hospital claims and certificates of live birth, which included Medicaid beneficiaries who had a live-born infant in NC between January 1, 2013, and November 4, 2019, and met inclusion criteria (n = 321,879), we estimated week-specific visit rates for emergency care visits that did not result in hospital admission (outpatient) and those that did (inpatient). We assessed the 10 leading diagnosis code categories for emergency care visits and described the characteristics of people with 0, 1, or ≥ 2 outpatient emergency care visits. Results: One in eight (12.4%) Medicaid beneficiaries had an emergency care visit that did not result in inpatient hospital admission during the first 8 weeks postpartum. Visit rates peaked in postpartum week 2. Diagnosis codes for nonspecific symptoms and substance use were the two leading diagnosis code categories for outpatient emergency care visits. Respiratory concerns and gastrointestinal concerns were the two leading diagnosis code categories for inpatient emergency care visits. Compared with those with zero outpatient emergency care visits, a greater proportion of people with ≥ 2 visits had less than a high school education, used tobacco during pregnancy, had Medicaid insurance outside of pregnancy, had mental health as a medical comorbidity, and/or had ≥ 2 medical comorbidities. Conclusions: These findings support scheduling health care visits early in the postpartum period, when emergency care visits are most frequent, and point to unmet needs for substance use support.

### The relationship between severe maternal morbidity and a risk of postpartum readmission among Korean women: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^113nF7Sv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of this study must be discussed. First, the incidence of postpartum readmission can change depending on the method of calculating readmission based on the administrative data. Although our readmission rate was underestimated, it might more accurately reflect the real-world readmission rate. Second, we did not estimate cause-specific postpartum readmission but included all-cause postpartum readmission. The aspects of cause-specific readmission might be overestimated. It might have been better to determine which factors were more likely to affect the risk of postpartum readmission. Further research is needed to determine the specific causes of postpartum readmission. Third, we used administrative data that did not include relevant clinical data on the severity of disease; therefore, we did not identify the severity of SMM. Moreover, there was a problem with conversion of the ICD-9 procedural codes. The ICD-10 codes did not include the procedural codes; therefore, we converted the ICD-9 procedural codes to match the EDI codes. During this process, some codes did not match the EDI codes; hence, some procedure-based SMM indicators might have been less precise.

Nevertheless, our study has several strengths. First, this is a unique study of SMM and postpartum readmission. Until recently, there has been little evidence regarding SMM and postpartum readmission with any maternal, clinical, and provisional indicators. Our research might provide important evidence for use in future maternal health care. Second, this study had a population-based design and included long-term follow-up and nationwide data; therefore, the results could be representative of the nation. Lastly, this database was continuously updated for 12 years without periods of interruption.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage in high resource countries: a review and recommendations from the international postpartum hemorrhage collaborative group [^117DhANX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Several recent publications have noted an increasing trend in incidence over time. The international PPH collaboration was convened to explore the observed trends and to set out actions to address the factors identified.

Methods

We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of PPH over time in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, the incidence of PPH was stratified by cause.

Results

We observed an increasing trend in PPH, using heterogeneous definitions, in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. The observed increase in PPH in Australia, Canada and the USA was limited solely to immediate/atonic PPH. We noted increasing rates of severe adverse outcomes due to hemorrhage in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA.

Conclusion

Key Recommendations 1. Future revisions of the International Classification of Diseases should include separate codes for atonic PPH and PPH immediately following childbirth that is due to other causes. Also, additional codes are required for placenta accreta/percreta/increta. 2. Definitions of PPH should be unified; further research is required to investigate how definitions are applied in practice to the coding of data. 3. Additional improvement in the collection of data concerning PPH is required, specifically including a measure of severity. 4. Further research is required to determine whether an increased rate of reported PPH is also observed in other countries, and to further investigate potential risk factors including increased duration of labor, obesity and changes in second and third stage management practice. 5. Training should be provided to all staff involved in maternity care concerning assessment of blood loss and the monitoring of women after childbirth. This is key to reducing the severity of PPH and preventing any adverse outcomes. 6. Clinicians should be more vigilant given the possibility that the frequency and severity of PPH has in fact increased. This applies particularly to small hospitals with relatively few deliveries where management protocols may not be defined adequately and drugs or equipment may not be on hand to deal with unexpected severe PPH.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^111e2TLS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Figure 3 shows monthly diagnostic category prevalence rates for 6 selected pregnancy-related categories. Additional pregnancy-related categories are included in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. We found no change overall in the broad WHO chapter including complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), nor for pregnancies without complications in the HHS-HCC or AHRQ-CCS systems. The AHRQ-CCS system had a large negative level change in other complications of birth (−58.8% [95% CI, −62.6% to −55.0%]) and an increase in other complications of pregnancy (66.6% [95% CI, 61.3% to 71.9%]). No other pregnancy categories examined in the AHRQ-CCS system had large changes in level or trend (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

Figure 3.
Monthly Diagnostic Category Rates of Selected Pregnancy-Related Conditions Stratified by Classification System

The diagnostic category prevalence rate per 10 000 enrollees in September 2015 is presented in the lower left corner of each panel as the reference rate. Curves are fitted with a discontinuity at October 2015. Circles indicate the normalized rate (rate of enrollees with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic category divided by the September 2015 rate); orange lines, predicted rate using a piecewise linear model; blue lines, predicted rate using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithm; AHRQ-CCS, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System; HHS-HCC, Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Category; and ICD-10-CM, International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification.

Our clinical review noted that the number of obstetrical codes doubled in ICD-10-CM vs ICD-9-CM and that the ICD-10-CM coding system was restructured to remove designation of antepartum, delivery, and postpartum status and to add separate codes to indicate weeks of gestation for ongoing pregnancies or pregnancy results for individuals who are no longer pregnant. Among HHS-HCCs, some conditions, such as breech presentation and previous cesarean delivery, were removed from the category for completed pregnancies with complications, contributing to declines in the prevalence of these diagnostic categories. In contrast, the AHRQ-CCS system adapted to the increased detail and restructuring of the obstetrical codes by adding many more specific codes to its existing categories, resulting in abrupt increases in their prevalence at the ICD-10-CM transition.

### Postpartum medicaid use in birthing parents and access to financed care [^116RNmDN]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Policy Timing and Cohort Definition

On March 18, 2020, the beginning of the PHE, Congress established a moratorium on disenrollment from Medicaid, effectively extending coverage for pregnant people beyond 60 days. While the PHE ended in May 2023, North Carolina adopted and implemented a 12-month postpartum extension for MPW in April 2022, which conferred guaranteed 12-month coverage for those who gave birth on February 1, 2022, or later. While this change occurred during the PHE moratorium, it increased the certainty around postpartum coverage so we consider it a separate policy period. People who gave birth on or after April 1, 2022, were eligible for a guaranteed 12 months of coverage post delivery; in contrast, the length of the postpartum coverage period was uncertain for people who gave birth between March 18, 2020, and March 30, 2022, due to the uncertainty regarding when the PHE would end.

We identify 3 cohorts of beneficiaries differentiated by their eligibility for postpartum Medicaid coverage at the time of their delivery: (1) pre-PHE, who delivered between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019; (2) PHE, who delivered between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2022, prior to the postpartum extension; and (3) extension, who delivered between April 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022. The second and third groups effectively had at least 12 months of coverage, but only the third group had certainty on the length of coverage. Although the PHE did not start until March 2020, coverage was retained for people who gave birth starting in January 2020, since their 60 days of coverage ended after the start of the PHE.

Birth Identification

We identified births in Medicaid claims databased on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes indicating labor and delivery (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We coded the delivery date as the date on the professional claim (with a delivery code) during an inpatient stay. To identify distinct deliveries, we included deliveries that were more than 300 days apart. Pregnancy episodes included 280 days before to 12 months after obstetric delivery.

### Pregnancy and the risk of in-hospital coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality [^112BEvkd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

A patient was defined as pregnant if the encounter included any pregnancy-related diagnosis (an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code beginning with O). A gestational age was assigned using the Z3A ICD-10-CM code. If no Z3A code and no delivery procedure were coded, the patient was recategorized as nonpregnant. The remainder of patients were categorized as nonpregnant.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, identified from discharge disposition. Both mortality on the index encounter and mortality on any readmission in the data set were included in the primary outcome for both groups to ensure that deaths on readmissions postpartum were captured in the pregnancy group. Secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation and ICU admission during the index encounter. In addition, delivery of the neonate during the index encounter was described for pregnant patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation use status was assessed using ICD-10 procedure codes (ie, 5A1935Z, 5A1945Z, and 5A1955Z). Intensive care unit admission was defined as patients who had any ICU service charge during the index hospitalization. Delivery of the neonate was assessed using ICD-10-PCS procedure codes (ie, 10D00Z0, 10D00Z1, 10D00Z2, 10D07Z3, 10D07Z4, 10D07Z5, 10D07Z6, 10D07Z7, 10D07Z8, 10E0XZZ). Appendix 1 lists all codes used.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^112Ddr5f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

ACOG perinatal mental health — definition and scope: Perinatal mental health conditions are defined as conditions occurring in pregnancy or in the first 12 months after delivery, and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) uses a peripartum-onset modifier rather than separate diagnoses; the American Psychiatric Association considers postpartum time within 4 weeks, whereas experts including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extend it to 12 months, inclusive of the "fourth trimester" and the full year assessed for maternal mortality. This guideline focuses on depression and anxiety for obstetric care clinicians and also includes recognition and initial management of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis, and suicidality, emphasizing additional support such as consultation and follow-up with mental health professionals.

### Patterns of postpartum primary care follow-up and diabetes-related care after diagnosis of gestational diabetes [^116iC4L6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Study Variables

The primary outcome examined were rates of primary care follow-up, which was identified based on postdelivery outpatient encounters that were billed with evaluation and management or preventive care codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Secondary outcomes included follow-up with an indication of diabetes-related care (by either blood glucose testing procedure codes or a diagnosis code related to diabetes or prediabetes) or diabetes-related care encounters among those who had a primary care follow-up. Of note, follow-up not identified as primary care or indicating an infant attached were excluded. To determine the proportion of patients with GD receiving guideline-concordant care of blood glucose testing within 12 weeks post partum, blood glucose testing (by procedure codes) in the first 12 weeks was considered a secondary outcome. Diabetes diagnosis was the primary independent variable. Patients were classified in 1 of 3 categories based on their diagnosis status (no diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or GD) using ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes. Other variables included in the study were age, region, and year of delivery for descriptive purposes. Racial or socioeconomic disparities beyond rurality were not included as variables given the deidentified nature of the database. Rurality was analyzed to test the hypothesis that individuals in what the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services refers to as "super rural areas" (ie, patients residing in zip codes not classified as a metropolitan statistical area) would have lower rates of follow-up and blood glucose testing. To determine if pregnancy comorbidities affected follow-up rates in patients with GD, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth were analyzed.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage in high resource countries: a review and recommendations from the international postpartum hemorrhage collaborative group [^1141gFEt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Canada

As described elsewhere, information for Canadian trends was based on all hospital deliveries as documented in the Discharge Abstract Database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information from 1991 to 2005. All medical diagnoses were coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 up to 2000, and increasingly in ICD-10 from 2001 onwards), while procedures were coded using the Canadian Classification of Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Surgical Procedures (CCP) and the Canadian Classification of Interventions (CCI). PPH was coded if blood loss after childbirth exceeded 500 mL after a vaginal delivery and 1,000 mL after a caesarean delivery or if the physician made a notation of PPH in the medical chart. Data from Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia were excluded because complete data for these provinces were not available for the entire study period.

Cases of postpartum hemorrhage were identified using ICD-9 codes 666.0, 666.1, 666.2 and 666.3 and ICD-10 codes O720, O721, O722 and O723 for postpartum hemorrhage due to retained placenta (third stage hemorrhage), uterine atony (immediate postpartum hemorrhage, within the first 24 hours following delivery of placenta), delayed and secondary postpartum hemorrhage (after the first 24 hours following delivery) and postpartum hemorrhage due to coagulation defects, respectively.

Women whose deliveries were complicated by postpartum hemorrhage and who additionally had an abdominal hysterectomy were identified using the relevant CCP and CCI codes. Blood transfusions were identified using a specific code introduced in the database in 1994 (blood transfusion rates were thus unavailable for 1991 to 1993).

A validation study using 2002 data (with information from a clinically focused database in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia as the gold standard) showed high rates of accuracy for the information on PPH in the Discharge Abstract Database. The sensitivity and specificity rates for PPH were 90.2% and 98.2%, respectively, while the same rates for blood transfusion were 85.7% and 99.8%, respectively.

France

Published maternal mortality data were reviewed.

United Kingdom

Scottish data were derived from the Scottish Confidential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity. A standardized, objective case assessment was developed to allow hospital clinical risk management teams to assess their own local cases of major obstetric hemorrhage. All consultant-led maternity units in Scotland participated in data collection.

UK data on postpartum hemorrhage, including data from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, were obtained from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) survey of hemorrhage-associated peripartum hysterectomy.

### Characteristics of a global classification system for perinatal deaths: a Delphi consensus study [^113oUsn9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An estimated 5.5 million perinatal deaths occur worldwide each year, many of which are preventable. These deaths have enduring psychosocial consequences for parents, families and clinicians, with wide-reaching impacts on communities and society as a whole. Perinatal deaths include both stillbirths (defined for international comparisons as fetal death from 28 weeks' gestation onwards) and neonatal deaths (defined as death within the first 28 days of life). The recently proposed United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a goal to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030. As neonatal deaths make up 44% of the global under-five mortality rate, substantial progress towards this goal will not occur without reductions in neonatal deaths. Stillbirths, too, require accelerated attention. An estimated 2.6 million babies will be stillborn in 2015, with further deaths in earlier pregnancy.

At the heart of prevention of perinatal deaths is understanding of their causes within a given population. Perinatal death classification systems aim to meet this need by allowing analysis of the factors leading to stillbirth within a population, but the use of multiple, incongruent systems hampers comparison of the underlying causes of perinatal death in different regions of the world. A recent systematic review of perinatal death classification systems reported that 81 new or modified classification systems were used between 2009–2014 across 40 countries. These systems differ in many important ways, including the number of primary causes recorded; whether an underlying cause is recorded; whether both stillbirths and neonatal deaths are included; whether antepartum stillbirths are distinguished from intrapartum stillbirths; and whether International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes are used.

The ICD is currently the only global system for classifying perinatal deaths. There are however some limitations in the existing scope of the perinatal cause of death codes. In addition to this, the maternal condition contributing to the perinatal death is coded differently to when the same maternal condition results in a maternal death, which may make the system less desirable to users. While the current ICD (ICD-10) includes extensive coding for newborns, it does not consistently treat the fetus as a distinct entity with its own diseases to be recorded separately from the mother. Because of the potential loss of such information, ICD-10 has only limited utility for the accurate classification of stillbirths.

### Trends, characteristics, and maternal morbidity associated with unhoused status in pregnancy [^113Z8UCd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

Key limitations of this study included unmeasured bias with lack of information on the unhoused status (underlying reason, setting, and duration); cause of death; use of antenatal care, such as gestational medical screening, indication of delivery; neonatal information; medication use and type for mental health condition; and postdischarge data for the postpartum period. Causality of and chronological relationship to certain risk factors were unknown. Identification of unhoused pregnancy status was based solely on administrative coding, and the accuracy of data, including unhoused status (ICD-10-CM code Z59.0), was not assessable without medical record review. The observed increase in the prevalence of unhoused status in pregnancy may be associated with the increase in the use of ICD-10-CM code Z59.0, as recommended by the National Health Care for the Homeless Council in October 2016. Similarly, the accuracy of study covariates for behavioral factors, pregnancy characteristics, and medical comorbidities was not assessable and may have been underreported.

Other limitations included lack of information on individual-level socioeconomic status, nonhospital deliveries, multiple statistical comparisons, and possible multiple entries for the same pregnant patients. Ascertainment bias and unknown generalizability to other populations and countries were also limitations.

### Using ICD codes alone may misclassify overdoses among perinatal people [^114s6Pxq]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As perinatal drug overdoses continue to rise, reliable approaches are needed to monitor overdose trends during pregnancy and postpartum. This analysis aimed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ICD-9/10-CM codes for drug overdose events among people in the MATernaL and Infant clinical NetworK (MAT-LINK) with medication for opioid use disorder during pregnancy.

Methods

People included in this analysis had electronic health record documentation of medication for opioid use disorder and a known pregnancy outcome from January 1, 2014, through August 31, 2021. Data were analyzed during pregnancy through 1 year postpartum. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's drug overdose case definitions were used to categorize overdose based on ICD-9/10-CM codes. These codes were compared to abstracted electronic health record data of any drug overdose. Analyses were conducted between May 2023 and May 2024.

Results

Among 3,911 pregnancies with electronic health record-documented medication for opioid use disorder, the sensitivity of ICD-9/10-CM codes for capturing drug overdose during pregnancy was 32.7%, while specificity was 98.5%, positive predictive value was 23.4%, and negative predictive value was 99.0%. The sensitivity of ICD-9/10-CM codes for capturing drug overdose postpartum was 30.9%, while specificity was 98.4%, positive predictive value was 25.9%, and negative predictive value was 98.8%.

Conclusions

The sensitivity and positive predictive value of ICD-9/10-CM codes for capturing drug overdose compared with abstracted electronic health record data during the perinatal period was low in this cohort of people with medication for opioid use disorder during pregnancy, though the specificity and negative predictive value were high. Incorporating other data from electronic health records and outside the healthcare system might provide more comprehensive insights on nonfatal drug overdose in this population.

### Association of maternal age with severe maternal morbidity and mortality in Canada [^11386go1]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was SMM during an episode of care (pre–life-threatening condition) defined by the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System. Severe maternal morbidity originally consisted of 34 conditions (eg, eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion), diagnosed with the ICD-10CA and the Canadian Classification of Health Interventions. In this study, HIV and blood transfusion were removed from the list because these do not reflect life-threatening conditions. Also, chronic congestive heart failure and preexisting hypertension and renal disease were removed from the list because these conditions were not acute SMM.

Maternal death (during pregnancy and within 6 weeks after termination of pregnancy) was the secondary outcome. This was determined based on either the ICD-10CA codes or death as vital status at hospital discharge.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^1132fTQ7]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In Denmark, all diagnoses are recorded using the ICD-10 classification system since 1994, and before 1994, the ICD-8 classification system was used. Perinatal psychiatric episodes were defined in one of the following ways: (1) any type of recorded and/or treated psychiatric diagnoses at psychiatric treatment facilities (both inpatient and outpatient settings) or (2) were prescribed either antidepressants or antipsychotics. More precisely, the treated psychiatric episodes were defined as either any type of F chapter ICD-10 code: mental and behavioral disorders at inpatient or outpatient treatment psychiatric treatment sites in Denmark. Similarly, we used equivalent ICD-8 codes: 290–315 before 1994, to identify whether ICD-10 contacts were incident or prevalent. Also, we identified psychiatric episodes treated with antidepressants or antipsychotics, using the following Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical classification codes: N03-N07, which covered all prescriptions from GPs treating women in primary care during the defined pregnancy and postpartum period. Note that prescription data were used as a diagnostic proxy measure for moderate perinatal psychiatric episodes identified and treated in primary care settings by GPs.

For our study, we defined three different pregnancy and postpartum psychiatric episode groups ranging in disease severity, which were identified and treated at three different treatment settings:
Severe perinatal psychiatric episodes. Treatment setting: psychiatric inpatient treatment facility (secondary and tertiary care). Definition: all recorded F-diagnoses (ICD-10: mental and behavioral disorders).
Moderate perinatal psychiatric episodes. Treatment setting: psychiatric outpatient treatment facility (secondary care). Definition: all recorded F-diagnoses (ICD-10: mental and behavioral disorders).
Moderate perinatal psychiatric episodes. Treatment setting: Medical doctor/GP clinics (primary care). Definition: pharmacological treatment/prescriptions: N03-N07 (Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical codes).

The above-mentioned categorizations were made to capture perinatal psychiatric episodes, which range in severity and subsequently will be treated at different treatment sites. The episodes were therefore named moderate and severe for clarification, with the distinction being based on the information regarding treatment sites.

### Multivariable risk model for postpartum re-presentation with hypertension: development phase [^116wCrN8]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Cases: postpartum hospital re-presentations with hypertension

We considered the definition of a case to be: all patients who re-presented to hospital within 28 days post partum, with either hypertension as the primary diagnosis, or if the investigation or treatment of hypertension was a significant part of the presentation. Re-presentations included presentations to the emergency department and those admitted to the ward.

To identify the cases, we first identified all patients who re-presented to hospital within 28 days post partum for any cause.

The International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes for all re-presentations were reviewed and those considered to be potentially related to hypertension were selected for a manual electronic medical records search (online supplemental file 1). We included codes that were clearly hypertension related such as 'pre-existing hypertension complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium' and 'severe pre-eclampsia' and also included those that were more loosely related such as 'diseases of the circulatory system in pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium'. We identified 45 ICD-10 codes potentially related to hypertension from within our database.

A manual electronic medical records search of all of these patients identified re-presentations considered to be related to hypertension with either hypertension as the primary diagnosis or if the investigation or treatment of hypertension was a significant part of the admission (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart for selection of randomised sample controls (left) and hypertension re-presentation cases (right). ICD, International Classification of Disease; HITH, hospital in the home; HTN, hypertension.

In addition to this, the medical records of all ambulatory care hospital in the home (HITH) patients who re-presented to the emergency department were also manually reviewed. These patients are considered admitted to the hospital and, therefore, are not flagged as re-presentations in the DSU database (figure 1).

The HITH programme provides up to twice daily nursing care in the home. Around 5% of all patients are referred post partum mostly for the management of vacuum-assisted closure dressings for caesarean wounds, the delivery of intravenous antibiotics or subcutaneous enoxaparin for those unable to self-inject.

### Patterns of postpartum primary care follow-up and diabetes-related care after diagnosis of gestational diabetes [^1117ka6W]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Gestational diabetes (GD) affects up to 10% of pregnancies and increases lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes 10-fold; postpartum diabetes evaluation and primary care follow-up are critical in preventing and detecting type 2 diabetes. Despite clinical guidelines recommending universal follow-up, little remains known about how often individuals with GD access primary care and type 2 diabetes screening.

Objective

To describe patterns of primary care follow-up and diabetes-related care among individuals with and without GD in the first year post partum.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a private insurance claims database to compare follow-up in the first year post partum between individuals with GD, type 2 diabetes, and no diabetes diagnosis. Participants included postpartum individuals aged 15 to 51 years who delivered between 2015 and 2018 and had continuous enrollment from 180 days before to 366 days after the delivery date. Data were analyzed September through October 2021 and reanalyzed November 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary care follow-up visits and diabetes-related care (blood glucose testing and diabetes-associated visit diagnoses) were determined by evaluation and management, Current Procedural Terminology, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes, respectively.

Results

A total of 280 131 individuals were identified between 2015 and 2018 (mean age: 31 years; 95% CI, 27–34 years); 12 242 (4.4%) had preexisting type 2 diabetes and 18 432 (6.6%) had GD. A total of 50.9% (95% CI, 49.9%-52.0%) of individuals with GD had primary care follow-up, compared with 67.2% (95% CI, 66.2%-68.2%) of individuals with preexisting type 2 diabetes. A total of 36.2% (95% CI, 35.1%-37.4%) of individuals with GD had diabetes-related care compared with 56.9% (95% CI, 55.7%-58.0%) of individuals with preexisting diabetes. Only 36.0% (95% CI, 34.4%-37.6%) of individuals with GD connected with primary care received clinical guideline concordant care with blood glucose testing 12 weeks post partum.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of postpartum individuals, individuals with GD had lower rates of primary care and diabetes-related care compared with those with preexisting type 2 diabetes, and only 36% of those with GD received guideline-recommended blood glucose testing in the first 12 weeks post partum. This illustrates a missed opportunity for early intervention in diabetes surveillance and prevention and demonstrates the need to develop a multidisciplinary approach for postpartum follow-up.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^113AVMaE]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injuries are a prevalent and problematic complication of pregnancy in the USA. Traumatic injuries complicate approximately 8% of all pregnancies, and are the leading non-obstetric cause of maternal death in the USA. Pregnancy has also been demonstrated as a risk factor for traumatic injuries and trauma-related mortality. Pregnant women are both more likely to experience certain traumatic injuries (namely, violent traumas) and more likely to die when traumatic injuries occur. Women who are pregnant at the time of a traumatic injury are at a two-fold higher risk for mortality compared with their non-pregnant counterparts.

Despite the risk of poor injury-related outcomes among pregnant women, research concerning traumatic injuries in pregnant and puerperal patients is limited. This is in part due to shortcomings in the ability to identify pregnant and puerperal patients in morbidity data. Administrative data from hospital and emergency department admissions are primary sources for injury morbidity surveillance used to inform public health interventions. On 1 October 2015, medical coding in the US transitioned from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the 10th Revision (ICD-10-CM). The number of injury diagnosis codes increased from approximately 2600 codes in ICD-9-CM to 43 000 codes in ICD-10-CM, and also included new codes specific to injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (PCP) (O9A.2-O9A.5). In July 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an ICD-10-CM surveillance case definition for injury hospitalisations. This definition included principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5, injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, in the inclusion criteria.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^112p5LmB]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting, codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) 'have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions'. Specifically, O9A.2 'should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing'. Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as 'that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care'. This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents 'the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician'.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes' positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

### Diagnosis of perinatal mental health conditions following medicaid expansion to include low-income immigrants [^115REMCD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcome Variables

Our primary outcome was the diagnosis of perinatal mental health conditions. Our secondary outcome was the rates of treatment (medication or therapy) received among people diagnosed with a perinatal mental health condition.

We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis and procedure codes, as well as pharmacy claims to identify births and our outcomes of interest (eTables 1–3 in Supplement 1). We identified perinatal mental health conditions through the Clinical Classifications Software Refined, which aggregates ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes into clinically meaningful categories (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Treatment of perinatal disorders was defined as receipt of at least 1 prescription for antidepressants, anxiolytics, and other pharmacotherapy indicated for bipolar disorder, or at least 1 encounter for therapy among people with a diagnosis of a perinatal mental health condition. Prenatal care expansion provided health coverage from pregnancy diagnosis through childbirth. We measured perinatal mental health conditions diagnosis and treatment from the start of pregnancy through 60 days postpartum for this policy change. The policy change covering postpartum care ensured additional coverage from birth to 60 days; these individuals also had insurance prenatally. We captured diagnosis and treatment of perinatal mental health conditions in the same way (from pregnancy diagnosis until 60 days following birth) for postpartum care expansion. We abstracted demographic and clinical information from the birth certificate files and claims data. We included the demographic variables of maternal age, multiparity, race and ethnicity, county of residence (metropolitan, nonmetropolitan, missing), state, maternal tobacco use, and prepregnancy body mass index from birth certificate data. Race and ethnicity were categorized as Asian, Black, Hawaiian Native or Pacific Islander, Latina, White, other (includes the subgroup variable reported as other on the birth certificate), and unknown. We included self-reported information on race and ethnicity from the birth certificate files due to reported racial disparities in perinatal mental health conditions. We incorporated clinical data relevant to perinatal mental health conditions, including maternal age and rurality, history of mental health disorders, substance abuse, pregnancy complications, preterm birth, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Rurality was defined by zip code classification using Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes.

### Trends in postpartum hemorrhage in high resource countries: a review and recommendations from the international postpartum hemorrhage collaborative group [^11384rhJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of PPH over time in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, the incidence of PPH was stratified by cause (Table 1). Because of variations in definitions of PPH used between countries and between data sources, we did not restrict our analysis to PPH defined using any one particular classification. The definitions used in each country are set out below.

Table 1
Classifications and coding for causes of PPH

Data sources

Australia

In New South Wales (NSW) data were obtained from the Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) a census of all hospital discharges from public and private hospitals. Diagnoses and procedures obtained from the medical records for each hospitalization are coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Australian Modification (ICD9 to July 1998 and ICD10 subsequently) and the affiliated Australian Classification of Health Interventions. Childbirth hospitalizations were identified by linkage of the hospital separation data with birth data.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) cases were identified using the ICD codes outlined in Table 1. In the Australian Modification of the ICD, PPH is defined as a hemorrhage of 500 mL or more following vaginal delivery or 750 mL or more following a caesarean delivery resulting in a recorded clinical diagnosis of PPH and identified during the birth hospitalization from the hospital data. In NSW PPH in the hospital data is reported with 74% sensitivity and 99% specificity when compared with the medical record.

Data for Victoria was derived from the perinatal data collection form which is completed by the birth attendant (usually the midwife) for each birth. The form includes a check-box for PPH. The ICD-10AM definition of PPH was also used. The most recent validation of the accuracy of the data was carried out for births in 2003. Data relating to a random sample of 1% was collected from the original medical record and compared with that in the database of the Perinatal Data Collection Unit. PPH as determined from the estimated blood loss recorded in the medical record was coded as 'Yes' or 'No' and compared with the record of PPH in the perinatal data collection. Sensitivity was 83.6%; specificity 97.5%, PPV 76.7%, NPV 98.4% and accuracy 96.3% (unpublished data).

Belgium

Hospital discharge data for the Flanders region was examined to determine the proportion of women receiving a blood transfusion within 24 hr of birth as a proxy for PPH.

### Levels of maternal care: obstetric care consensus No, 9 [^112Z6diq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Levels of maternal care — classification definitions establish levels of maternal care that pertain to basic care (level I), specialty care (level II), subspecialty care (level III), and regional perinatal health care centers (level IV), and maternal care refers to all aspects of antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care. The table also refers to low-, moderate-, and high-risk care, and defining what constitutes these levels of risk should be individualized by facilities and regions, with input from their obstetric care providers. Accredited birth centers (freestanding facilities that are not hospitals) are an integral part of many regionalized care systems and are included in the table; however, capabilities and health care providers are not delineated in the table because well-established standards governing birth centers in the United States are already available.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^113JzmNc]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Estimated positive predictive values (PPVs) for ICD-10-CM codes O9A

Among the 43 inpatient cases with a principal diagnosis in the range O9A.2-O9A.4, 39 were confirmed as injuries and 38 were confirmed as injuries complicating PCP. Therefore, the estimated PPV for an inpatient principal diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture an injury was 90.7% (95% CI 82.0% to 99.4%) and to capture an injury PCP was 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 98.4%). Of the 30 inpatient cases with a secondary diagnosis in the range O9A.2-O9A.4, six were confirmed as injuries and seven were confirmed as injuries complicating PCP (note: there was one complicated encounter that required adjudication and was determined as an encounter not involving care for an injury but involving care for pregnancy complications due to a previous injury/assault). Therefore, the estimated PPV for an inpatient secondary diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture an injury was 20.0% (95% CI 4.8% to 35.2%) and to capture an injury complicating PCP was 23.3% (95% CI 7.3% to 39.4%).

### Severity of anemia during pregnancy and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes [^111qrW8e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Definition of Variables

Exposure

Anemia during pregnancy (not puerperium), including mild anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 100–109 g/L), moderate anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 70–99 g/L), and severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration, < 70 g/L), was identified using the relevant ICD-10 codes (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Pregnant females with a diagnosis of anemia that could not be differentiated by severity with ICD-10 codes were classified separately as having anemia of unknown severity.

Maternal and Fetal Outcomes

The maternal outcomes identified using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes included placental abruption, preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks' gestation), cesarean delivery, severe postpartum hemorrhage (females with ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes of postpartum hemorrhage who were treated with blood transfusion or hysterectomy), shock, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and maternal death during hospital delivery. Fetal outcomes included growth restriction, malformation (congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed during hospitalization), and stillbirth (death before or during delivery after 20 weeks of pregnancy) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Complications During Pregnancy

Complications during pregnancy for which the time sequence relative to onset of anemia was unknown but that might have been associated with outcomes were identified as confounding variables using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10 codes. These included in vitro fertilization, multiple pregnancies, hypertension disorders, diabetes, thyroid diseases, circulatory diseases, urinary diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, coagulation disorders, scarred uterus, placenta accreta spectrum, placenta previa, antepartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, abnormal amniotic fluid, cervical incompetence, and abnormal placenta.

### Prevalence and risk factors of severe postpartum hemorrhage: a retrospective cohort study [^1134giep]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Ethical approval (approval number: [2020] 055) was obtained for this retrospective analysis, and the need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study. This study comprised of an evaluation of the institutional perinatology database of all women giving birth after 28 weeks of gestation in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Guangzhou Medical Centre for Critical Pregnant Women) from January 2015 to August 2019 (34,178 mothers). Administrative permission from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University was acquired by our team to access the institutional perinatology database used in our research. Management of PPH in our center (since 2015) follows the guidelines of the Management and Prevention of Postpartum Hemorrhage published by the Gynecology and Obstetrics of Chinese Medical Association. The database used in this study was derived from medical records and contained information on maternal health before and during pregnancy, detailed information about delivery and complications occurring intrapartum or postpartum and information about the newborns. Volume of PPH, transfusion information, modes of delivery, and various candidate risk factors were registered, thereby facilitating case ascertainment. Other diseases were identified by the presence of diagnostic codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).

### Genetic risk scores for major psychiatric disorders and the risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders [^117KtMSB]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychiatric disorders

We defined a postpartum psychiatric disorder either as (1) a treated psychiatric episode recorded in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or (2) at least one redeemed prescription of psychotropic drugs recorded in the Danish National Prescription Registry within 12 months after delivery. Consequently, our case group consisted of moderate (prescription defined) and severe (treated in secondary health care and diagnosed by a psychiatrist) cases (Supplementary Table S1). We selected the time period of interest as one year after childbirth to account for a potential delay in seeking psychiatric care and to apply a widely used clinical definition. Prior work in these data showed similar familial risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. A postpartum psychiatric episode may represent a new-onset disorder, a continuation or recurrence of a psychiatric disorder prior to childbirth, or a different psychiatric disorder after childbirth in a woman who had a prior psychiatric disorder.

The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register contains information on inpatient contacts at psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric wards from 1969 onwards. Psychiatric outpatient treatment and emergency room contacts have been included since 1995. Treated psychiatric episodes included any psychiatric diagnosis (Primary diagnosis, ICD-10 codes F00–F99), excluding mental retardation and substance abuse (ICD-10 codes F10–F19 and F70–F79). The Danish National Prescription Registry was established in 1995, and contains information on all prescriptions dispensed at community pharmacies in Denmark. We included psychotropic drugs of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes N05 (psycholeptics) and N06 (psychoanaleptics). Detailed diagnostic codes and categorization are described in the Supplementary Methods.

Personal and parental psychiatric history

We defined previous personal psychiatric history as one in-patient or out-patient treatment for the psychiatric disorders described above or one redeemed prescription for psychotropic medications before the date of delivery. We similarly defined parental psychiatric history as one in-patient or out-patient treatment for psychiatric disorders in a mother or father before the date of delivery. Note, as information on prescriptions only dates back to 1995, prescription data were not used to define parental psychiatric history.

Definition of postpartum depression and non-postpartum depression

We defined depression as a diagnosis of single and recurrent depressive disorders (ICD-8 codes: 296.09, 296.29, 298.09, and 300.49; ICD-10 codes F32–33) recorded in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. The first depressive episode was defined as the date of first hospital contact for the above-mentioned diagnostic codes. Women were categorized as PPD cases if they were diagnosed with a first depressive episode within 12 months after delivery, and if contacts were outside the postpartum period, women were defined as MDD cases. We used the diagnosis of depression within 1-year postpartum to include all women with depression with postpartum onset, also women with a notable diagnostic delay between the onset of symptoms and the time of diagnosis, as recommended by the World Health Organization.

Maternal care refers to all aspects of antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, and Table 1 also refers to low-, moderate-, and high-risk care, with defining what constitutes these levels of risk individualized by facilities and regions with input from their obstetric care providers. Accredited birth centers are included in the table; however, capabilities and health care providers are not delineated because well-established standards governing birth centers in the United States are already available.

### Zero-shot interpretable phenotyping of postpartum hemorrhage using large language models [^1117CHEA]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) subtype definitions.

The natural language processing (NLP)-based approach that leverages the extracted PPH concepts is on the left. A note is labelled with a given subtype if any of the concepts are present in the note. One exception is the "laceration" concept, which only signifies the "trauma" subtype if no other subtypes have been assigned to the note. The baseline international classification of diseases (ICD)-based approach is on the right. Similarly, a note is assigned to a subtype if any of the ICD codes are present. Here x refers to any number 0−9, meaning that any more specific ICD code under that in the ICD ontology will suffice. For example, 666.14 is a valid ICD code for the "tone" subtype. 664.x only signifies the "trauma" subtype if no 666.x ICD code is present (i.e. there are no other attributable causes of the hemorrhage). These rules for the "laceration" subtype are designed to mitigate false positives due to lacerations during the delivery that do not result in significant hemorrhage.

NLP natural language processing, PPH postpartum hemorrhage, ICD international classification of diseases.

We performed subtyping on all deliveries that the NLP-based model predicted as describing postpartum hemorrhage. We validated the performance of the classification algorithms via manual chart review of the confirmed PPH deliveries identified above (See "Identification of deliveries with PPH"). We compared the NLP-based approach to a subtyping approach that leveraged ICD codes. The ICD definitions for each subtype based on conversion from ICD10 codesare in Table 5.

Validation of model performance

We performed manual annotation of discharge summaries to assess the performance of our models for extracting PPH-related concepts, identifying patients with PPH, and classifying subtypes of PPH. In each use case, one of four annotators with experience in reading obstetrics notes (M.R. R.F. A.G. and V.K.) first annotated the notes with the relevant PPH-related concepts or subtypes, and a clinician (V.K. and K.G.) subsequently reviewed all annotations.

### Neighborhood socioeconomic status and postpartum depression among commercial health insurance enrollees: a retrospective cohort study [^112qt7v7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Study timeline

To distinguish new onset of depressive illness during the postpartum period from an ongoing episode, we excluded women with prenatal depression disorder during the baseline, using appropriate ICD-10 codes.

We analyzed a set of demographic and clinical variables at baseline. Age was determined from the relevant field in the Kythera data and was categorized as < 20, 21–24, 25–29, 30–34, and 35 years and older. Three different comorbidity indices were derived during the baseline period to control for differences in overall comorbidities between patients with and those without PPD: updated Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Chronic Disease Score (CDS), and Elixhauser Index. The original CCI encompassed 19 categories of medical comorbidities that were identifiable within medical conditions. The original index has since adopted several weights, some of which allow outpatient diagnoses to contribute to the score, and was translated to the updated ICD-10 codes. CDS is an aggregate comorbidity measure based on current medication use. The score increases with the number of chronic diseases under treatment and the complexity of the treatment regimen. The Elixhauser Index is based on a comprehensive set of 30 ICD-9-CM comorbidity flags and has been updated to ICD-10 codes. Current coding for the index is available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It has been shown that using all these indexes improves the performance of the outcomes research models. Obstetrical and maternal complications as well as lifestyle factors were identified using appropriate ICD-10 codes (Appendix Table A1).

### Patterns of postpartum primary care follow-up and diabetes-related care after diagnosis of gestational diabetes [^115m6GRF]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This analysis used a deidentified data set and was deemed exempt for human subject research review by the Office of Responsible Research Practices at the Ohio State University. The data were extracted in September 2021. This study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines.

Data Source

Data on women aged 15 to 51 years old who gave birth between 2015 and 2018 were identified from MarketScan (IBM Watson Health), a large administrative database for health care research that contains deidentified data from patients with commercial health insurance or Medicare supplemental health insurance, including inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug claims. Because this database is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and contains secondary data, no informed consent was feasible or applicable. Women up to age 51 years, the average age of menopause in the US, were included given the increase in pregnancy rates in women in their 40sand the increased risk of GD in women of advanced maternal age. Consistent with previously published studies, eligible patients were identified using claim records (or encounters) containing an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code indicating the delivery of an infant (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Using the date of the earliest claim following delivery, patients included in the study had continuous enrollment from 180 days before to 365 days after the delivery date to ensure adequate capture of follow-up. Those with a diagnosis of GD postdelivery were excluded to ensure that hyperglycemia was documented in pregnancy and to avoid incorrect classification of those with ongoing glucose intolerance post partum. Encounters indicating a death in-hospital, missing discharge status, or unknown region were excluded. In instances where a patient had more than 1 record with a delivery code during the study period, only the first entry was analyzed.

### Comparing a model of augmented postpartum primary care to usual care in an urban medical center [^111oqKmG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Collection

Socio-demographic and health characteristics were collected, including age, race/ethnicity, insurance, parity, prenatal care entry, and physical and behavioral health diagnoses. Race/ethnicity were collected from self-reported data within the EMR and were categorized as mutually exclusive groups: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other, or not reported. Insurance was categorized as Medicaid, private, or other. Parity was categorized as one or more-than-one live births. Gestational age at first prenatal visit at UI Health was dichotomized as first trimester entry or not. Diagnoses were obtained from the EMR within the problem list (International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Tenth Revision codes) or documented in clinical notes. Similar diagnoses were combined into categories. For example, "diabetes" includes patients who have any type of diabetes including pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes (see Supplementary Table 1). Categories were selected based on comorbidities associated with maternal morbidity but were not exhaustive. –

### Trends in postpartum depression by race, ethnicity, and prepregnancy body mass index [^115E94T6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cross-sectional studiesand was performed with the approval and oversight of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) institutional review board with a waiver of informed consent because data were deidentified.

Data from electronic health records (EHRs) at KPSC were used to conduct this serial cross-sectional study. KPSC is a large integrated health care delivery system servicing care to over 4.8 million members across 15 medical centers and 236 medical offices. The demographic composition of KPSC members reflects the diversity of the Southern California region.KPSC's EHR system encompasses comprehensive information on member patients receiving in- and outpatient care, including diagnostic and procedural codes, pharmacy and laboratory records, and member demographics and behavioral information.

For this analysis, we identified all live and stillbirths at 20 or more weeks of gestation between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Eligibility for inclusion in the study required KPSC membership at the time of pregnancy delivery.

Outcome

PPD was defined as the presence of a depressive disorder diagnosis according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10) diagnostic codes provided by a mental health specialist and/or by use of antidepressants prescribed for PPD within 12 months following childbirth (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

PPD diagnosis at KPSC follows a 2-step process. First, depression status is routinely assessed during well-child visits for postpartum individuals; over 95% of individuals with KPSC pregnancies with live birth deliveries were assessed for their depression status during the first 6 months of well-child visits. Then, those exhibiting signs and symptoms of depression undergo further evaluation using standardized questionnaires, such as the EPDS, administered by social workers. Individuals who score 10 or higher on the EPDS are referred for a clinical interview with mental health professionals, who conduct a comprehensive assessment and provide follow-up care, diagnosis, and treatment. Our recent validation study demonstrated that supplementing diagnostic codes with pharmacy use records significantly enhanced the completeness and accuracy of PPD case identification (sensitivity, 98.3%; specificity, 83.3%; positive predictive value, 93.7%; negative predictive value, 95.0%) compared with relying solely on EPDS/Patient Health Questionnaire-9 surveys or diagnostic codes.

### Obesity and postpartum hospital use among individuals without additional medical comorbidities [^111DfUCS]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine whether obesity without preexisting or gestational comorbidities is associated with postpartum hospital use (PHU).

Methods

We studied 2016 to 2018 birth certificate and discharge data on 178,729 New York City births without International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes at delivery for diabetes; hypertension; placental disease; anemia; thyrotoxicosis; bariatric surgery; and pulmonary, cardiac, renal, bleeding, autoimmune, digestive, neuromuscular, mental, or substance-use disorders. We defined PHU as ≥ 1 readmission or emergency department visit within 30days of delivery discharge. We used ICD-10 codes to specify postpartum hypertension, infection, or hemorrhage during PHU (i.e., "cause-specific PHU") because these are leading mortality causes. We examined associations between prepregnancy BMI and PHU using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

PHU incidence was 3.7% for those with normal weight, 5.1% for those with overweight, 6.3% for those with class 1 or 2 obesity, and 9.1% for those with class 3 obesity. A positive association persisted after adjustment. Obesity was associated with cause-specific PHU of postpartum hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.2, 95% confidence limits [CL]: 1.8–2.7, normal weight referent) and wound infection (aOR: 1.5, 95% CL: 1.2–1.8), but not hemorrhage (aOR: 0.9, 95% CL: 0.7–1.3), mastitis, or genitourinary infection (aOR: 1.1, 95% CL: 0.9–1.3).

Conclusions

Among individuals without other comorbidities, elevated BMI was associated with PHU. Findings can inform obstetric management to reduce morbidity during the critical fourth trimester.

### The relationship between severe maternal morbidity and a risk of postpartum readmission among Korean women: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^112P9Ci7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source, study design, and population

This retrospective cohort study used the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) from 2002 to 2013. The NHIS-NSC included approximately 1 million Koreans' information since 2002. This database collected 2.5% (n = 1,025,340) of total Koreans using a stratified random sampling method in 2002. It included Koreans' age, sex, residential area, type of health insurance, household income decile, medical diagnosis and procedure, prescription drugs, and individual total medical costs. The NHIS-NSC can track patient and clinical characteristics over time, reveal epidemiological causes of disease, and be used to develop health policies. These data did not include direct personal identifiers but included the unique de-identified numbers of patients' sociodemographic and medical information. Furthermore, individuals with unique de-identified numbers were connected to mortality information from the Korean National Statistical Office.

This study included all women aged 15 years or older and less than 50 years who had a delivery in the hospital and were enrolled for at least a year before childbirth to 42 days after childbirth between January 1, 2003 and November 19, 2013. Childbirth was defined as any inpatient admission records with a delivery-related diagnosis or procedural code for vaginal delivery or CS among women who delivered full-term babies (i.e. ≥ 37 weeks' gestational age). We excluded women who had preterm births, those whose delivery hospitalization was more than 42 days, or those who died during delivery hospitalization. The total population was 90,035 cases of delivery between January 2003 and November 2013.

Postpartum readmission

The outcome variable was postpartum readmission within 42 days after the first date of delivery hospitalization. We excluded women who were continuously admitted 42 days after delivery hospitalization and those who died during delivery hospitalization.

Severe maternal morbidity

SMM was determined using an algorithm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which consisted of 25 indicators for SMM including 18 diagnoses and 7 procedure codes. The indicators for SMM were either serious complications of pregnancy or delivery. Eighteen indicators were identified using diagnostic codes converted from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) Clinical Modification ICD-9-CM to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), and 7 indicators were procedure codes. We defined women who met at least 1 of the 25 indicators for SMM during delivery hospitalization has having SMM.

### Trends and outcomes of postpartum haemorrhage, 2003–2011 [^1175hvcc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The study population consisted of all women with livebirths or stillborn infants of at least 20 weeks gestation in New South Wales (NSW) hospitals between 2003 and 2011. Data on maternal demographics, the pregnancy, labour and birth were obtained from the Perinatal Data Collection ('Birth data'). This is a legislated statewide record of all births in NSW, and is completed by the midwife or doctor at the time of birth. Data on maternal diagnoses and procedures were obtained from the Admitted Patients Data Collection ('Hospital data'), which contains data collected on all private and public hospital discharges in NSW. Diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital discharges are coded according to the 10 th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Australian Modification (ICD10-AM) and the Australian Classification of Health Interventions (ACHI) respectively.

The Centre for Health Record Linkage performed probabilistic linkage of the hospital and birth data, to assign unique project identifiers to each mother, allowing both longitudinal linkage of pregnancies and hospitalisations during and following pregnancy. For this study, rates of missed and incorrect links were less than 0.5%.

Postpartum haemorrhage was identified from the hospital data using ICD codes (O72 and subcodes). Blood loss of equal or greater than 500 mL following a vaginal birth, or equal or greater than 750 mL following a caesarean birth is classified as a postpartum haemorrhage. Validation studies have indicated that postpartum haemorrhage is accurately reported, although under-enumerated with sensitivity and specificity of 73.8% and 98.9%, respectively. Previous postpartum haemorrhage was defined as a postpartum haemorrhage reported in any previous pregnancy (since July 2001) and was obtained from the longitudinal linkage of a woman's pregnancies.

### Global, regional, and national burden of maternal hemorrhage: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease 2021 and projections to 2030 [^116Hnbx7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of maternal hemorrhage

Within the GBD 2021 framework, maternal hemorrhage is defined as postpartum hemorrhage (blood loss exceeding > 500 mL following vaginal delivery or > 1,000 mL after cesarean delivery), antepartum hemorrhage (vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation but before delivery), or hemorrhagic placental disorders, regardless of blood volume lost or the timing of the hemorrhagic event. Disease classification adhered to the ICD-10, encompassing codes O72, O67, O62.2, O44-O46, O43.2 and O20. A detailed mapping of disease subcategories is presented in Table S1.

The WHO defines maternal mortality as the death of a woman during pregnancy or within one year after the termination of pregnancy, regardless of the duration and site of the pregnancy, where the cause of death is directly related to or exacerbated by the pregnancy or its management, excluding deaths from accidental or incidental causes. In this study, death counts refer to the number of deaths attributed to maternal hemorrhage occurring in a population during a certain period, whereas MMR is specifically defined by WHO as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths.

### Postpartum pyelonephritis and risk of severe maternal morbidity [^116GVgrb]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pyelonephritis is the most common nonobstetric cause for hospitalization during pregnancy. The maternal and obstetric complications associated with antepartum pyelonephritis are well described. However, it is not clear whether these risks extend into the postpartum period. The primary objective of this study was to describe the morbidity associated with postpartum pyelonephritis, by comparing the morbidity associated with pyelonephritis in the postpartum period to morbidity seen during pregnancy or delivery.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), an all-payor sample of discharges from approximately 60% of U.S. hospitalizations. Discharges between October 2015 and December 2018 were included. Maternity-associated hospitalizations, diagnosis of pyelonephritis, comorbid conditions, and incidence of severe maternal morbidity were identified using International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis and procedure codes. Bivariate statistics, weighted to account for the complex survey methods in the NRD, were used to evaluate the association between antepartum, delivery, and postpartum hospital stays associated with pyelonephritis and maternal morbidity. Weighted regression models were used to evaluate the association between admission timing and maternal outcomes.

Results

A total of 32,850 pyelonephritis admissions were identified, corresponding to a national estimate of 61,837 admissions. Of these, 1,465 (2.4%) were postpartum, 55,056 (89.0%) were antepartum, and 5,317 (8.6%) involved a delivery stay. Rates of severe maternal morbidity were higher in the postpartum group than the antepartum or delivery hospitalization groups (59.5 vs. 12.9 and 15.8%, respectively, p < 0.001); when compared with antepartum hospitalizations, the adjusted relative risk for composite severe maternal morbidity for postpartum hospitalizations was 4.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.33, 5.05). Most of this difference was driven by rates of sepsis (53.2 vs. 11.0 vs. 10.9%).

Conclusion

Though relatively uncommon, postpartum hospitalizations for pyelonephritis are associated with higher rates of severe maternal morbidity, driven by differential rates of sepsis, than are antepartum or delivery-associated hospitalizations.

### Amniotic fluid embolism incidence, risk factors and outcomes: a review and recommendations [^113DJGwp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of AFE in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, data on the risk factors and outcomes of AFE were also reviewed. Because of variations in definitions of AFE used between countries and between data sources, we did not restrict our analysis to AFE defined using any one particular classification. The definitions and codes used to identify cases in each country are shown in table 1. Maternal death was defined throughout as death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy.

Table 1
Definitions and codes used for AFE

Data sources

Australia

Fatal cases were identified through four published triennial Maternal Deaths in Australia reports. The Maternal Deaths in Australia reports are a compilation of confidential death reviews conducted at the jurisdictional level. Information for incident cases (fatal and non-fatal) was obtained from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD) an administrative collection of hospital separations for the years 1994–2005. The NHMD is a collection of confidential summary records for admitted patients separated in public and private hospitals in Australia. The NHMD is based on data from the state and territory health authorities and is compiled nationally by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Diagnoses and procedures were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), tenth revision, Australian Modification (ICD10 AM) (ICD-9 prior to 1999). Records were selected based on a diagnosis of AFE using ICD9 Clinical Modification (CM) code of 637.10–637.14 with a birth code (V27.0-V27.2) or a code for care immediately following delivery (V24.0) or postpartum examination and care (V24.3). The ICD9 coding system includes a fifth digit (0–4) for obstetric codes that indicates the timing of the diagnosis of the condition relative to the birth; and for ICD-10AM O88.1 with Z37.0-Z37.9 used to flag a birth episode and Z39.01 to flag an immediate postpartum episode. Data were available for all jurisdictions in Australia, accounting for 100% of all women giving birth in hospital.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^1154SH85]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Neighborhood socioeconomic status and postpartum depression among commercial health insurance enrollees: a retrospective cohort study [^117BmtMq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent psychological condition. Although the effect of obstetrical and maternal complications on PPD are well described, the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on PPD is relatively unexplored.

Objectives

This study examined the relationship between neighborhood SES score and PPD.

Methods

A summary SES measure for each U.S. zip code was constructed using income, education, and occupational 2021 Census data and linked to national commercial claims for 2017–2023. PPD status using diagnosis codes at outpatient and inpatient visits, and prescription drug use 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum, were determined. Multivariate analysis controlled for potential confounders.

Results

PPD prevalence in commercial claims was 11.48%. Patients with PPD had higher rates of obstetrical (OR: 1.555, p < .0001) and maternal complications (OR: 1.145, p < .0001), and more lifestyle risk factors (OR: 1.113, p < .0001). Comorbidity scores were higher for patients with PPD. Controlling for age and clinical factors, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood was associated with an increased incidence of PPD (OR: 1.137, p < .0001).

Limitations

Claims data may include potential inaccurate coding of diagnoses/procedures. Clinical information is limited to conditions and treatments defined by ICD-10-CM codes. Area-based SES measures inevitably misclassify people on both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum (this misclassification is random; direction of bias is known).

Conclusions

The inverse and significant effect of area-based high SES on PPD rates demonstrates that preventive efforts may require interventions focusing on both the patient and the lived environment.

### Comparison of postpartum health care use and spending among individuals with medicaid-paid births enrolled in continuous medicaid vs commercial insurance [^112Fii2d]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Measures

The primary exposure variable was continuous enrollment in Medicaid vs commercial insurance during months 3 to 12 post partum, measured as mutually exclusive continuous enrollment in either type of coverage for the full 9 months. Medicaid coverage does not end until the last day of the month 60 days after childbirth, thus months 3 to 12 are the period to which postpartum Medicaid extensions under the ARP would apply.

We assessed the rate and number of health care use that occurred during this same period (months 3–12 post partum). We defined postpartum outpatient visits as all visits with place of service or revenue codes indicating an outpatient setting claim code, excluding laboratory claims and claims that occurred as part of an ED visit or inpatient hospitalization but including prenatal visits for a subsequent pregnancy. We defined primary care visits as the subset of outpatient visits that included any Current Procedural Terminology codes for a preventive office visit as well as those with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes for a general adult medical examination, such as well-woman examinations and postpartum care. We examined the number of outpatient and primary care visits as well as the probability of having at least 1 visit during months 3 to 12 post partum. Secondary outcomes included the number and rate of ED visits and hospitalizations. We defined ED visits as any claim with an ED place of service or revenue code. In addition, hospitalizations were defined using place of service or revenue codes indicating an inpatient setting and limited to lengths of stay greater than 24 hours (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement has the full list of codes).

### Postpartum mental health care use among parents during simultaneous parental leave [^113WPmVz]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Parental Leave Exposures and Mental Health Outcomes

We identified simultaneous parental leave use (any vs none) in the 12 months post partum using the Swedish Social Insurance Agency Microdata Register. We specified the length (1–15 days or 16–30 days) and timing (0–5 months or 6–12 months post partum) of simultaneous parental leave use within this period.

In Sweden, new parents are invited to routine checkups with Child Health Services (CHS), including screenings for PPD and related symptoms for mothers around 2 months post partum, and less commonly screenings for nonbirthing partners between 3 and 5 months post partum. Up to 12% of mothers and 6% of fathers in Sweden have been shown to exhibit PPD-related symptoms. If symptoms are detected, parents may receive supportive counseling within CHS or be referred elsewhere. Psychotropic prescriptions are available through primary care, whereas both psychotherapy and psychotropic prescriptions are available through specialist outpatient care for more severe symptoms.

First, using the National Patient Register, we identified whether parents had any outpatient visits for mental and behavioral disorders associated with psychoactive substance use disorder (SUD) with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F10 to F19; mood or affective disorders with ICD-10 codes F30 to F39; or neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders with ICD-10 codes F40 to F49 in the first postpartum year. Second, using the Prescribed Drug Register, we captured parental prescriptions for antidepressants (with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code N06A) and anxiolytics (with ATC code N05B) in the year after childbirth, specifically dispensed prescriptions made via all treatment channels (primary, specialist outpatient, and inpatient care). Third, to assess potential selection into simultaneous parental leave use, we included a dichotomous covariate of parents' prebirth mental health care use (outpatient visits for mental health or psychotropic prescriptions) up to 2 years before childbirth.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^117V14q4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Cause of death reporting

The present review has focused on the reporting of the death event and timing of the death, not the cause of death. Reporting of perinatal deaths by timing is an important marker of quality of care. At a minimum it requires assessment of fetal heart rate on admission in labor and vital status at birth, both of which should be routinely assessed for births in a facility by the healthcare provider. However, whilst these are usually assessed by health workers, although vital status at birth is recorded in routine data systems few low‐ and middle‐income settings record fetal heart rate on admission. Further efforts are needed to capture these data in health records and registers and provision made for these data to be collated for reporting at a local, regional and national level. Improving its measurement should be the first step towards enhancing data for deaths in the perinatal period, investments will also be needed in improving data around cause of death. Whilst accurate reporting of levels and timings of deaths in the perinatal period give high‐level insights into potential areas to target health systems investments, for example, if very high levels of intrapartum stillbirths are observed investment in referral and emergency obstetric and neonatal care systems could be targeted. However, to inform investments into targeted programmatic action and to close remaining implementation and biomedical research gaps will require investment to further understanding of the individual causes of death.

ICD‐11 also covers the standardized reporting of the causes of death in the perinatal period. In 2016 for the previous version of ICD, ICD‐10, WHO produced guidance for a standardized system for classifying causes of stillbirth and neonatal deaths globally: "The WHO application of ICD‐10 to deaths during the perinatal period: ICD‐PM". This is an important step towards comparable estimates of cause of deaths in the perinatal period, especially for stillbirths where large number of classification systems current in use have limited comparability. However, a recent review found that ICD‐PM is applied inconsistently and suggesting possible solutions such as including a category for perinatal deaths of unknown timing, providing clearer explanations for consistent coding, and highlighting potential pitfalls of the system. Updated global guidance on classifying perinatal deaths according to the new ICD‐11 guidance, incorporating experiences and learnings from users of the ICD‐10 version, would be an important next step towards comparable cause of death estimates for this period.

### Psychological comorbidities are more prevalent amongst pregnant and postpartum patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^113wp5md]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of data on the epidemiology of IBS in pregnant and postpartum patients in the United States.

Methods

A retrospective claims analysis was conducted in a cohort of 1,618,379 patients with ≥ 1 delivery hospitalization between 2013–2019 utilizing ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes after merging inpatient and outpatient claims. Obstetric, psychological, and other medical comorbidities were also examined.

Key Results

The prevalence of IBS in our cohort was 1.38%. Pregnant and postpartum patients with IBS were more likely to have psychological comorbidities including depression (OR 2.93, CI 2.83–3.03), postpartum depression (OR 3.00, CI 2.91–3.09), and anxiety (OR 3.74, CI 3.64–3.84). They were also more likely to have migraines (OR 3.04, CI 2.94–3.15) and connective tissue disease or autoimmune disease (OR 3.54, CI 3.22–3.89).

Conclusion

The prevalence of IBS in pregnant and postpartum patients in a large claims database was 1.38%. Pregnant and postpartum patients with IBS have a higher odd of psychological comorbidities in addition to medical comorbidities such as migraines, connective tissue, and autoimmune disease. Future studies should focus on validating and characterizing the impact and directionality of co-existing comorbidities on IBS severity and the development of new-onset IBS during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Characteristics and incidence of lactational mastitis using state-wide data from 2016 to 2022 [^112X37My]. Journal of Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: To estimate the characteristics and describe the incidence of lactational mastitis among postpartum people. Methods: We used Maine Health Data Organization's All Payer Claims Data for people who delivered during 2016–2022 with insurance coverage throughout pregnancy and 12 months postpartum and had a breast pump claim (as a proxy for breastfeeding) (N = 22520). We estimated the incidence of lactational mastitis within one year postpartum using International Classification of Diseases-Clinical Modification 10 diagnosis codes. We examined mastitis incidence by rurality of residence, delivery year, maternal age, parity (using a proxy measure), insurance type, pregnancy condition, and history of mastitis. We also assessed the timing and setting of the first mastitis diagnosis. Results: The incidence of lactational mastitis was 4.4% (95% CI: 4.1, 4.7). Persons with a higher incidence of mastitis included those living in metro areas (4.9%), 25–29 years old (4.6%), having commercial insurance coverage at delivery (5.0%), with their first or second delivery in the dataset (4.5%), and with a history of mastitis (13.9%). Overall, 15% of lactational mastitis was first diagnosed during an acute care encounter; however, this was higher among those living in isolated rural areas (22%), 20–24 years old (32%), having Medicaid insurance (24%), with three or more deliveries in the dataset (21%), and without a history of mastitis (18.5%). Conclusion: The incidence of diagnosed lactational mastitis varies by several maternal and pregnancy characteristics. Persons who are younger, live in rural areas, have Medicaid or have higher parity may face barriers to care in the primary care setting and ultimately be diagnosed with lactational mastitis during acute care encounters.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^114mNuCt]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

High quality comparable perinatal mortality data are critical to track progress towards global goals to end preventable deaths for stillbirth and newborn. Despite recent large increases in the proportion of all births taking place in health facilities where labor ward records are ubiquitous, large gaps currently exist in the availability and quality of data particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Implementation of the ICD‐11 standard methods for recording and reporting all births and deaths in the perinatal period in every setting would be an important first step towards improving data. High quality data would both allow appropriate regional and international comparisons to be made and serve as a resource to improve clinical practice and epidemiological and health surveillance, enabling focusing of limited programmatic and research funds towards improving outcomes for every woman and every baby, everywhere.

### Past psychiatric conditions as risk factors for postpartum depression: a nationwide cohort study [^114HtYoq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare risk for postpartum depression across prior psychiatric diagnoses.

Methods

The deidentified Optum© Clinformatics Data Mart of national commercial insurance claims was used to identify 1,166,577 women of reproductive age with first-observed incidence of pregnancy across all 50 United States from 2003 to 2016. Women with insurance coverage for at least 6 months prior to conception and following delivery were eligible (n = 336,522). Psychiatric diagnoses prior to pregnancy were identified by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, including depression, anxiety and panic disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders. Primary outcomes included postpartum depression diagnosis at 2 months and 1 year after delivery. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis assessed for independent associations between predictors and outcomes.

Results

Among 336,522 pregnancies, 9.4% of women were diagnosed with postpartum depression (n = 31,610). Five percent of women with no depression history developed postpartum depression, compared to 65% of women with depression prior to and during pregnancy. Among women with history of depression who were euthymic during pregnancy, 20% were diagnosed with postpartum depression. A major risk factor was a history of depression (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.6–2.8; P < .001), and depression in pregnancy was a risk factor for continued depression in the postpartum period (OR = 13.1; 95% CI, 12.6–13.6; P < .001). All other psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and panic disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders, conferred risk for postpartum depression, independent of a comorbid depression history.

Conclusions

We report that all psychiatric diagnoses investigated independently increase risk for postpartum depression and suggest that care providers inquire about psychiatric history to identify and closely monitor women at increased risk for postpartum depression.

### Comparisons of severe maternal morbidity and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant people with sickle cell disease vs anemia [^113wub4n]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

We quantified APOs using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) SMM Index, which includes 21 highly morbid obstetric complications, as our primary outcome measure. Due to confounding by SCD, we excluded 2 SMM outcomes from the analysis: transfusion and sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis. Final analytic models included 19 of 21 SMM outcomes considered individually and in a composite SMM variable (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes listed in the CDC SMM Index have an 86% positive predictive value for identifying SMM in administrative data. Although transfusion was excluded in the SMM analysis, it was analyzed as an independent secondary outcome. Additional APOs analyzed were gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean delivery, instrumented vaginal delivery, preterm delivery, peripartum infection (urinary tract infection, endomyometritis, wound infection, or sepsis), postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal demise.

### Differential effects of different delivery methods on progression to severe postpartum hemorrhage between Chinese nulliparous and multiparous women: a retrospective cohort study [^116cnPFF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study will determine the sample size according to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, according to the purpose and hypothesis of this research, this study firstly analyzed the difference of maternal characteristics, neonatal characteristics, and the delivery methods between the nulliparous and multiparous women. On the basis of the basic situation, this study then examined the associations between maternal, neonatal characteristics, delivery methods and the severity of PPH in the nulliparous and multiparous women, respectively. After that, this study will use regression analysis methods to explore the effects of different delivery methods on PPH of the nulliparous and multiparous women, on the basis of comprehensive consideration of maternal characteristics and neonatal characteristics.

Sample

The retrospective sample cohort was extracted from the databank of a standardized administrative system of electronic health records (EHRs) maintained by the Health Commission in Shanxi province of China. The databank has more than 220 variables that describe medical characteristics for each parturient, including basic demographic information, essential diagnosis (up to 10), pathological diagnosis, surgical procedure (up to 7), categories of cost and subcategories of service charges, length of stay, outcomes at discharge, etc. All diagnoses and surgical procedures at birth were coded based on the International Classification of Diseases code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-9-CM3). The rigorous process for the data collection used by the databank was described as followed: a chief physician in a hospital reviewed every case in the hospital initially. Then, trained coders certified by the Medical Record Management Association (MRMA) entered the patient's data into the administrative system and submitted it to a case manager of the hospital for crosscheck before uploading the data to the databank to ensure the accuracy and quality.

### Impact of the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity among delivery hospitalizations in the United States [^116frLSA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surveillance of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity is important to identify temporal trends, evaluate the impact of clinical practice changes or interventions, and monitor quality of care. A common source for severe maternal morbidity surveillance is hospital discharge data. On October 1, 2015, all hospitals in the United States transitioned from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for diagnoses and procedures.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding systems on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in the United States in hospital discharge data.

Study Design

Using data from the National Inpatient Sample, obstetrical deliveries between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, were identified using a validated case definition. Severe maternal morbidity was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (January 1, 2012, to September 30, 2015) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017) codes provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An interrupted time series and segmented regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding on the incidence of severe maternal morbidity per 1000 obstetrical deliveries.

Results

From 22,751,941 deliveries, the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding era was 19.04 per 1000 obstetrical deliveries and decreased to 17.39 per 1000 obstetrical deliveries in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding era (P < .001). The transition to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding led to an immediate decrease in the incidence of severe maternal morbidity (-2.26 cases of 1000 obstetrical deliveries) (P < .001). When blood products transfusion was removed from the case definition, the magnitude of the decrease in the incidence of SMM was much smaller (-0.60 cases/1000 obstetric deliveries), but still significant (P < .001).

Conclusion

After the transition to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification coding for health diagnoses and procedures in the United States, there was an abrupt statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in the incidence of severe maternal morbidity in hospital discharge data. Changes in the underlying health of the obstetrical population are unlikely to explain the sudden change in severe maternal morbidity. Although much work has been done to validate the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe maternal morbidity, it is critical that validation studies be undertaken to validate the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe maternal morbidity to permit ongoing surveillance, quality improvement, and research activities that rely on hospital discharge data.

### Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal depression into pediatric practice [^115dzn98]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Coding and billing — The AAP, USPSTF, and CMS recognize that postpartum depression (PPD) screens are a measure of risk in the infant's environment, and therefore, billing is appropriate at the infant's visit with the infant as the patient. Current Procedural Terminology code 96161 (effective as of January 2017) allows reporting of the administration of a caregiver-focused health risk assessment. Because billing codes may vary by payer and by state, PCCs are advised to consult AAP state chapter pediatric councils and payers for updated coding guidance, and when a screen result is positive the PCC should be familiar with coding on the basis of counseling time and complexity when indicated.

### Association of insurance status with provision of recommended services during comprehensive postpartum visits [^113VE8RC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and a cross-sectional design, we estimated the frequency of ACOG-recommended procedures and screening for women during a comprehensive postpartum visit. We analyzed differences in care received by insurance type, controlling for factors associated with use of preventive screening services. This study was reviewed by the University of Massachusetts institutional review board and determined to be not human participants research, which did not require informed consent given the use of deidentified data. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data and Analytic Sample

We use data on ambulatory care visits to office-based physicians from annual NAMCS surveys for December 28, 2008, to December 31, 2016, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. The NAMCS surveys physicians annually and includes detailed information abstracted from clinical records for 50 patient visits in a 1-week period. The National Center for Health Statistics constructs visit weights to correct for physician selection and nonresponse; these weights make the sample nationally representative of office-based physician visits.

The analytic sample includes all comprehensive postpartum visits identified using code V24.2 from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and code V39.2 from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision as well as primary reason for visit codes classified by the National Center for Health Statistics (3215.0). We limited the sample to visits for women aged 18 to 44 years with family medicine or obstetrical/gynecological (ob/gyn) physicians. Based on NAMCS inclusion criteria, the sample included visits to office-based physicians, including physicians employed by hospital-owned practices in 2014 to 2016. The sample excluded physicians practicing in community health centers and hospital outpatient facilities and federally employed physicians; it did not include certified nurse-midwives practicing independently. We also excluded observations missing data on control variables.

### Association of race and ethnicity and social factors with postpartum primary care or cardiology follow-up visits among individuals with preeclampsia [^117PqjzK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Population

We used Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (Eden Prairie, MN;, hereafter Clinformatics), which is a geographically diverse claims database representing over 68 million individuals with commercial and Medicare Advantage insurance coverage in the United States who are similar to the insured population. The Clinformatics database includes inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, pharmacy, and laboratory health claims. Medical claims include International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9/10‐CM) diagnosis and procedure codes, Current Procedural Terminology version 4 procedure codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System procedure codes, and site‐of‐service codes. These data are commercially licensed, and interested parties may obtain them directly from the vendor. As per licensing agreement, the authors do not have the permission or authority to share these data.

We selected individuals ≥ 18 years old with all deliveries (not limited to live births) defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes and a preeclampsia diagnosis no more than 6 months prior to delivery as defined by ICD‐9/ICD‐10 diagnosis codes from 9/2014 to 9/2019. Table S1 provides a comprehensive list of ICD‐9/ICD‐10 and Current Procedural Terminology codes used in the analysis to determine delivery date and preeclampsia diagnosis as done in prior studies. We then followed individuals prospectively for 1 year and concluded follow‐up in March 2020 to accommodate for the COVID‐19 pandemic. We excluded those with noncontinuous insurance enrollment for 1 year after delivery or delivery < 12 months from March 2020, male sex, and missing or unknown race or income. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board deemed this study as exempt from human subject review as it uses previously collected, deidentified data. The need to obtain consent was waived for this study as participant data were deidentified.

3 DISCUSSION

The WHO, through the ICD, has been producing guidance for the reporting of perinatal deaths for over 70 years. Despite efforts to provide clarity on definitions for reporting of perinatal mortality, including stillbirths and neonatal death, there remains substantial heterogeneity in the understanding and application of standard definitions, limiting comparability of these data between countries and over time. This in part has resulted from the large changes in the field of maternal and perinatal health. These decades have seen large advances in clinical obstetric and neonatal care, with the advent of interventional obstetrics and neonatal intensive care changing perceptions of viability, and in measurement, with the increasing recognition of the importance and ability to measure, gestational age.

Since ICD‐10 was introduced in 1990, there have been large increases in understanding of epidemiology and measurement of perinatal mortality. Work using routine data from high‐income settings led through the EURO‐PERISTAT project, North American and Australian researchers have highlighted some of the challenges in comparability between these settings. Additionally, work has been undertaken to improve understanding of these data from a global perspective, seeking to better understand perinatal mortality measurement in data systems commonly used in high burden settings, such has household surveys. For this revision (ICD‐11), we brought together perinatal epidemiologists and measurement experts with experience across a wide range of contexts as part of the Mother and Newborn Information for Tracking Outcomes and Results (MoNITOR) and the Core Stillbirth Estimation Group (CSEG) of the UN IGME to produce a unified proposal to align and simplify the recommended standard definitions. Key learnings from these researchers included in the revised ICD‐11 guidance include: using gestational age as the primary threshold to be used for reporting, providing further guidance on the measurement and recording of gestational age, reporting mortality rates by gestational age subgroups to enable country comparisons to include similar populations, for example, all births from 154 days (22 +0 weeks) or from 196 days (28 +0 weeks) and clearer guidance around exclusion of terminations of pregnancy (induced abortions) from perinatal mortality statistics. The guidance also recommends that gestational age be recorded in calendar days to minimize confusion often associated with the interpretation of completed weeks with additional days. In addition, this version of ICD standardized spelling of key terms, for example, fetal, stillbirth and live birth across the guidance.

### Association of primary intracerebral hemorrhage with pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111DkLW5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

We also evaluated other potential causes of ICH during pregnancy and the postpartum period in our data. The influence of physiological changes associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period on rupture rates of arteriovenous malformations remains controversial. In both the cohort and crossover periods, the number of patients with ICH and arteriovenous malformation was fewer than 10. This is lower than numbers in prior reports using the same ICD-9 code and could be the result of inclusion of all intracranial hemorrhages (ie, subarachnoid hemorrhage) rather than solely ICH. Although it is possible that arteriovenous malformation was underdiagnosed, our data suggest that it is unlikely that arteriovenous malformation rupture significantly contributes to ICH incidence reported here. Similarly, we identified fewer than 10 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and no cases of sickle cell anemia in our analysis cohort.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^115BJ9c8]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Postpartum venous thromboembolism: incidence and risk factors [^11343p3u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To calculate incidence of postpartum venous thromboembolism by week after delivery and to examine potential risk factors for venous thromboembolism overall and at different times during the postpartum period.

Methods

A deidentified health care claims information database from employers, health plans, hospitals, and Medicaid programs across the United States was used to identify delivery hospitalizations among women aged 15–44 years during the years 2005–2011. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify instances of venous thromboembolism and associated characteristics and conditions among women with recent delivery. Incidence proportions of venous thromboembolism by week postpartum through week 12 were calculated per 10,000 deliveries. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for selected risk factors among women with postpartum venous thromboembolism and among women with venous thromboembolism during the early or later postpartum periods.

Results

The incidence proportion of postpartum venous thromboembolism was highest during the first 3 weeks after delivery, dropping from nine per 10,000 during the first week to one per 10,000 at 4 weeks after delivery and decreasing steadily through the 12th week. Certain obstetric procedures and complications such as cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, hemorrhage, and postpartum infection conferred an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 6.4), which persisted over the 12-week period compared with women without these risk factors.

Conclusion

Risk for postpartum venous thromboembolism is highest during the first 3 weeks after delivery. Women with obstetric complications are at highest risk for postpartum venous thromboembolism, and this risk remains elevated throughout the first 12 weeks after delivery.

### The impact of physical activity on the development of postpartum depression [^113zgatf]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a heterogeneous illness, both in terms of manifested symptoms and the circumstances under which they emerge.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) establishes a timeframe of 4 weeks following childbirth as the threshold for identifying the postpartum onset of PPD. In contrast, the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision (ICD-10) categorizes mental disorders as related to the puerperium if they commence within 6 weeks after delivery. Moreover, a group of experts from different countries assembled in Sweden previously proposed that the "postnatal onset" be defined as a period of 3 months post-birth. This was influenced by the findings of Kendell et al. showing that there is an elevated risk of hospitalization for various psychiatric disorders within the first 90 days following childbirth. Recently, the modification from the diagnostic label "postpartum depression" in DSM-IV to "peripartum onset" in DSM-Fifth Edition is based on empirical findings indicating that approximately half of the episodes of depression commonly referred to as PPD typically manifest before childbirth. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines perinatal depression as the experience of both severe and moderate depressive episodes during pregnancy or the first year after delivery.

### Maternal morbidity rates in a managed care population [^113jvzF2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify and estimate prevalence rates of maternal morbidities by pregnancy outcome and selected covariates during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods in a defined population of pregnant women.

Methods

We used electronic data systems of a large, vertically integrated, group-model health maintenance organization (HMO) to develop an algorithm that searched International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes for 38 predetermined groups of pregnancy-related complications among women enrollees of this HMO between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001.

Results

We identified 24,481 pregnancies among 21,011 women. Although prevalence and type of morbidity varied by pregnancy outcome, overall, 50% of women had at least one complication. The most common complications were anemia (9.3%), urinary tract infections (9.0%), mental health conditions (9.0%), hypertensive disorders (8.5%), and pelvic and perineal trauma (7.0%).

Conclusion

A range of mild-to-severe pregnancy complications were identified using linked inpatient and outpatient databases. The most common complications we found usually do not require hospitalization so would be missed in studies that use only hospitalization data. Our data allowed examination of a broad scope of conditions and severity. These findings increase our understanding of the extent of maternal morbidity.

### Suicide attempts among pregnant and postpartum women in Japan: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^116qSkE2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women in Japan with psychoneurological disorders who attempt suicide.

Method

A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, a national database on acute-care inpatients in Japan. All pregnant and postpartum women who had psychoneurological disorders (ICD-10 codes: O993, F530, F531) and were admitted to participating hospitals from January 2016 to March 2018 were identified. Among eligible patients, the prevalence of suicide attempts, risk factors for suicidal behaviors, maternal outcomes, and other characteristics were investigated.

Results

Among the 3,286 eligible patients (3,026 pregnant women and 260 postpartum women), 22 pregnant women and 16 postpartum women had attempted suicide. The prevalence of suicide attempts was significantly higher among postpartum women (6.2%) than among pregnant women (0.7%; P < .001). Postpartum patients were more likely to be aged 30 years or older and to have depression. Wrist cutting was the main method of suicide attempt among pregnant patients, whereas hanging was the main method among postpartum patients. Three postpartum patients died during hospitalization.

Conclusions

Postpartum patients were more likely to be in critical condition and to use fatal suicide attempt methods compared with pregnant women.

### Risk factors associated with peripartum suicide attempts in Japan [^111goWyF]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Psychiatric Outcomes

The psychiatric outcomes included (1) admission with prepartum suicide attempt and delivery during the same hospital stay, (2) readmission to the same hospital of delivery for depression within 1 year post partum, and (3) readmission to the same hospital of delivery for suicide attempt within 1 year post partum. Information on suicide attempts was based on the hospitalization summary on admission. Information on suicide attempts was registered when a suicide attempt was confirmed as a trigger for hospitalization by the patients themselves, their family members or acquaintances, or attending paramedics. Based on the current ICD-10, postpartum depression can be incorporated into 1 of the following disease classifications: major depressive episode (ICD-10 code F32); recurrent depressive disorder (ICD-10 code F33); or mental and behavioral disorders associated with the puerperium, or not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code F53). To distinguish self-remitting postpartum emotional instability from postpartum depression, patients given the ICD-10 code F53 within the first week post partum were not considered to have postpartum depression. Furthermore, women with manic episode (ICD-10 code F30) or bipolar affective disorder (ICD-10 code F31) after childbirth were not regarded as having postpartum depression. Based on the current general agreement for the latest period to diagnose postpartum depression at approximately 12 months post partum, all episodes of readmission with depression or suicide attempt to the same hospital of delivery within 1 year post partum were considered as eligible outcomes.

### Migraines during pregnancy linked to stroke and vascular diseases: US population based case-control study [^114YBDdR]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The nationwide inpatient sample, from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, contains data from five to eight million hospital stays from approximately 1000 hospitals and is the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. The nationwide inpatient sample is a 20% stratified sample of all discharges and allows for national estimates. It includes information derived from typical discharge abstracts. This information contains primary and secondary discharge diagnoses, with the corresponding codes, determined from the description in the discharge summary. In addition, these records have safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals. Data are available for the purposes of aggregate statistical reporting, analysis, and research. Although the data are limited, the nationwide inpatient sample is the most reliable source of data on hospital admissions and discharges. Reliability is supported by agreement between the sample, a telephone survey, and the national health interview survey (a national door to door survey). Invalid or inconsistent diagnostic codes are flagged. All data are anonymised, so informed consent was waived.

We used the ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, 9th revision) to identify records in the nationwide inpatient sample for all pregnancy related discharge codes for the years 2000–3 (the latest data available at the start of the study). We classified the pregnancy related discharge records included in the sample from that time period as to whether they were an antepartum admission, an admission at the time of delivery, or a postpartum admission. We defined an antepartum admission as any discharge record with a pregnancy related code (ICD-9 codes 630–648) that did not also include a delivery code. We defined an admission for delivery as any discharge record that included a delivery code (ICD-9 codes 74 for caesarean delivery and 72, 73, 75, v27, or 650–659 for vaginal delivery). We defined a postpartum admission as any discharge record that included a postpartum diagnosis (ICD-9 codes 660–677) and did not also include a delivery code.

### Zero-shot interpretable phenotyping of postpartum hemorrhage using large language models [^112TMaLt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We further examined the relationship between model-extracted estimated blood loss and presence of PPH ICD codes on the entire notes cohort (n = 271,081). As the blood loss amount increases, there is more likely to be a PPH ICD code associated with the admission, as expected (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 2). When no estimated blood loss is extracted, the prevalence of PPH ICD codes is less than 5%. When the extracted blood loss values are between 1000 and 1500 mL, criteria which meet both historical and current definitions of PPH, less than 50% of notes have an associated PPH ICD code.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^115y4Epa]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for injury, poisoning, physical or sexual assault complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (PCP) to capture injury encounters within both hospital and emergency department claims data.

Methods

A medical record review was conducted on a sample (n = 157) of inpatient and emergency department claims from one Kentucky healthcare system from 2015 to 2017, with any diagnosis in the ICD-10-CM range O9A.2-O9A.4. Study clinicians reviewed medical records for the sampled cases and used an abstraction form to collect information on documented presence of injury and PCP complications. The study estimated the PPVs and the 95% CIs of O9A.2-O9A.4 codes for (1) capturing injuries and (2) capturing injuries complicating PCP.

Results

The estimated PPV for the codes O9A.2-O9A.4 to identify injury in the full sample was 79.6% (95% CI 73.3% to 85.9%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 72.0% (95% CI 65.0% to 79.0%). The estimated PPV for an inpatient principal diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture injuries was 90.7% (95% CI 82.0% to 99.4%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 98.4%). The estimated PPV for any mention of O9A.2-O9A.4 in emergency department data to capture injuries was 95.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 99.9%) and the PPV for capturing injuries complicating PCP was 81.0% (95% CI 72.4% to 89.5%).

Discussion

The O9A.2-O9A.4 codes captured high percentage true injury cases among pregnant and puerperal women.

### Risk factors and timing of acute myocardial infarction associated with pregnancy: insights from the national inpatient sample [^111b6kBq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data Source

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), collected by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. It is the largest, publicly available all‐payer inpatient healthcare database in the United States and contains ≈7 million unweighted stays yearly and 35 million weighted inpatient visits. We included discharge records related to pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum periods from 2003 to September 2015 and utilized the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes to identify discharge records. We did not utilize data beyond September 2015 because hospital administrative data began using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, Procedure Coding Classification System (ICD-10-PCS). The data within the NIS are de‐identified and therefore International Review Board approval was not required for this study.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^113QZ5Mf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

### Association of primary intracerebral hemorrhage with pregnancy and the postpartum period [^116nMmLk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) during pregnancy and the postpartum period results in catastrophic maternal outcomes. There is a paucity of population-based estimates of pregnancy-related ICH risk, including risk during the extended postpartum period.

Objective

To evaluate ICH risk during pregnancy and an extended 24-week postpartum period in a population-level cohort and to determine fetal and maternal outcomes as well as demographic and comorbidity factors associated with ICH during pregnancy and post partum.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study used a cohort-crossover design in which patients serve as their own controls when no longer exposed (pregnant or post partum). Administrative data were obtained from all hospital admissions for New York, California, and Florida for a 7- to 10-year period. Participants included all women admitted for labor and delivery who were older than 12 years and did not have a prior diagnosis of ICH. Conditional Poisson regression models were used to evaluate ICH risk, and data were reported as rate ratios and 95% CIs. Data analysis was performed from August 2018 to February 2020.

Exposures

Women were tracked using hospitalization records for the duration of pregnancy (40 weeks), for 24 weeks post partum, and for an additional 64 weeks when no longer exposed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnosis of ICH during both 64-week observation periods was determined using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes.

Results

A total of 3 314 945 pregnant women were included (mean [SD] age, 28.17 [6.47] years; 1 451 780 white [43.79%], 474 808 black [14.32%], 246 789 Asian [7.44%], and 835 917 Hispanic [25.22%]). The risk of ICH was significantly higher during the third trimester (2.9 vs 0.7 cases per 100 000 pregnancies; rate ratio, 4.16; 95% CI, 2.52–6.86) and remained elevated during the first 12 weeks post partum (4.4 vs 0.5 cases per 100 000 pregnancies; rate ratio, 9.15; 95% CI, 5.16–16.23). Advanced maternal age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.10), nonwhite race (adjusted ORs, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.73–3.44] for black patients, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.34–3.35] for Asian patients, and 1.59 [95% CI, 1.12–2.26] for Hispanic patients), hypertension (adjusted OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.19–3.42), coagulopathy (adjusted OR, 14.17; 95% CI, 9.17–21.89), preeclampsia or eclampsia (adjusted OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 6.99–12.19), and tobacco use (adjusted OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.53–5.23) were independently associated with ICH during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy-related ICH was associated with a higher risk of maternal (relative risk difference, 792.6; absolute risk difference, 0.18) and fetal (relative risk difference, 5.3; absolute risk difference, 0.03) death, compared with pregnancies without ICH.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the risk of ICH is significantly higher during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first 12 weeks post partum. There are age and race disparities in ICH risk that are associated with devastating maternal and fetal outcomes. These data illustrate the critical need for continuous monitoring and aggressive management of ICH-associated risk factors. These findings suggest that extended postpartum monitoring of high-risk women may be warranted.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 5: severe maternal morbidity: screening and review [^111EmZoe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) screening and review — facilities should have a screening process in place to detect cases for review, and The College and SMFM recommend using two criteria to screen: transfusion of 4 or more units of blood and admission of a pregnant or postpartum woman to an intensive care unit (ICU). Severe maternal morbidity is not always reported and may not be well coded in record systems; definitions relying on diagnosis codes may miss cases and have a relatively low positive predictive value (0.40), whereas the two-criteria approach has high sensitivity and specificity and a high positive predictive value (0.85). Facilities should review all cases that meet at least one of these screening criteria to determine whether the case is truly a severe maternal morbidity and to determine if an identified morbidity is judged to have been potentially avoidable, recognizing that not all cases will be preventable and some are thus unavoidable.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 748: the importance of vital records and statistics for the obstetrician-gynecologist [^117JsKXL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Death registration — maternal mortality coding, underreporting, and pregnancy checkbox — notes that every state is required to report all maternal deaths and that maternal deaths are identified when the cause of death is coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, with the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) expanding these coding guidelines in 1999 to be more inclusive of maternal deaths. Reports have indicated a 39–93% rate of underreporting of maternal deaths. The revised U.S. standard certificates of live birth and death from 2003 were expected to be adopted in all states by 2016, and pregnancy status questions include a checkbox to designate a pregnancy within 42 days before death or within 43–365 days before death. Because of inconsistent use of checkbox categories, NCHS has not published a national mortality rate since 2010. The physician's principal responsibility is to complete the medical portion of the death certificate, including cause of death.

### The association between sickle cell disease and postpartum severe maternal morbidity [^116TUQXU]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) from the delivery admission to 42 days' postdischarge among persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) to those without SCD.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included deliveries ≥ 20 weeks' gestation at an urban safety net hospital in Atlanta, GA from 2011 to 2019. The exposure was SCD diagnosis. The outcome was a composite of SMM from the delivery admission to 42 days' postdischarge. SMM indicators as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions (ICD-9/10) codes; transfusion of blood products and sickle cell crisis were excluded.

Results

Of N = 17,354 delivery admissions, n = 92 (0.53%) had SCD. Persons with SCD versus without SCD had an increased risk of composite SMM (15.22 vs. 2.29%, p < 0.001), acute renal failure (6.52 vs. 0.71%, p < 0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (4.35 vs. 0.17%, p < 0.001), puerperal cerebrovascular disorders (3.26 vs. 0.10%, p < 0.001), sepsis (4.35 vs. 0.42%, p < 0.01), air and thrombotic embolism (5.43 vs. 0.10%, p < 0.001), and ventilation (2.17 vs. 0.09%, p < 0.01). Ultimately, those with SCD had an approximately 6-fold higher incidence risk ratio of SMM, which remained after adjustment for confounders (adjusted incidence risk ratio [aIRR]: 5.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4–9.19, p < 0.001). Persons with SCD in active vaso-occlusive crisis at the delivery admission had an approximately 9-fold higher risk of SMM up to 42 days' postdischarge compared with those with SCD not in crisis at the delivery admission (incidence: 25.71 vs. 8.77%, p < 0.05; aIRR: 8.92, 95% CI: 4.5–10.04, p < 0.05). Among those with SCD, SMM at the delivery admission was primarily related to renal and cerebrovascular events, whereas most postpartum SMM was related to respiratory events or sepsis.

Conclusion

SCD is significantly associated with an increased risk of SMM during the delivery admission and through 42 days' postdischarge. Active crisis at delivery further increases the risk of SMM.

Key Points

· Sickle cell disease was associated with an approximately 6-fold increased risk of SMM. · Active vaso-occlusive crisis at delivery was associated with an approximately 9-fold increased risk of SMM. · 48% of SMM events in persons with SCD occurred postpartum and were respiratory- or sepsis-related.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^113xMHXz]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS) in pregnancy — risk, monitoring, and care considerations: In general, women with IAS should continue to be treated throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period as indicated by their underlying diagnosis, and monitoring for in utero fetal growth restriction is necessary during pregnancies in which beta-blockers are used. Delivery and the postpartum period are times of increased arrhythmic risk, and delivery and postpartum care in a location with cardiac monitoring and prompt life support, including defibrillation, are important because of the increased arrhythmic risk of IAS. ICD implantation is supported by a broader literature showing safety of an existing ICD in pregnancy. Genetic testing results can predict severity of presentation, influence choice of antiarrhythmic drugs, and assist risk stratification, and trained multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics teams reduce mortality and provide consistency of care in high-risk conditions. Quantitatively, of women with prior unexplained stillbirth, 5–10% may have fetuses with IAS, and in a retrospective series examining 148 pregnancies, pregnant patients with IAS had an 8-fold higher fetal stillbirth rate and a 2-fold higher miscarriage rate compared with the normal population.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116GATvr]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study of commercial claims from 2010 to 2017 revealed striking changes in levels and trends for many diagnostic categories associated with the transition to ICD-10-CM. Only small changes in levels or trends were found for the WHO disease chapters, while 16% of HHS-HHCs and AHRQ-CCS categories displayed large and significant level changes, while 9% to 10% displayed large changes in trend.

Our clinical review found that abrupt level changes were largely due to different decisions about which codes to include or exclude in post– ICD-10-CM diagnostic categories, such as diabetes coded jointly with hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia leading to a complicated diabetes category, non-STEMI being included (or not) in the AMI category, and breech presentation leading to classification (or not) as a complication of pregnancy. We also identified some changes in coding instructions and coding practice that may have affected disease prevalence trend rates. Many ICD-10-CM codes have no corresponding ICD-9-CM code. For certain conditions, the new, more specific ICD-10-CM codes were rarely used in 2015 and 2016 but began to appear more regularly in 2017. For example, the strong upward trend in diabetes with acute and chronic complications is partially due to increasing use of codes for drug or chemical induced diabetes not available in ICD-9-CM. Likewise, refined codes, such as STEMI myocardial infarction of anterior wall (available starting in 2016), only began to appear in 2017, and many new codes for preeclampsia introduced in 2015 were infrequently used before 2017.

### Hospitalizations and emergency department visits for psychiatric illness during and after pregnancy among women with schizophrenia [^1131hBup]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Almost 50% of women with schizophrenia become pregnant. Little is known about their psychiatric service use patterns during or shortly after pregnancy.

Methods

Using health administrative data, we identified 1,433 women in Ontario, Canada, with schizophrenia (ICD-9, ICD-10, or DSM-IV-TR) who had a live birth delivery from January 2003 through March 2011 and described their use of acute psychiatric care services including hospitalizations, emergency department visits not requiring hospitalization, and self-harm-related emergency department visits during pregnancy and in the first year postpartum. Incidence rates of psychiatric hospitalization during pregnancy, and also within 1 year postpartum, were each compared to the incidence rate of psychiatric hospitalization in the 1-year period before conception. Results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Similar comparisons were made for psychiatric emergency department visits not requiring hospitalization, as well as for self-harm-related emergency department visits.

Results

About 12% of the women had at least 1 psychiatric hospitalization during pregnancy, and 19% in the first year postpartum. About 10% had at least 1 psychiatric emergency department visit without hospitalization during pregnancy, and 16% had at least 1 emergency department visit postpartum. Self-harm-related emergency department visits were rarer, affecting only about 1% of the women in each time period. Relative to that in the 1-year period before conception (50 per 100 person-years), the incidence rate of psychiatric hospitalizations was lower during pregnancy (25 per 100 person-years), which is equivalent to an IRR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.43–0.60). While the IRR of psychiatric hospitalizations was lower over the entire 1-year period postpartum (0.66; 95% CI, 0.57–0.76), it was transiently higher in the first 9 days postpartum (3.59; 95% CI, 2.74–4.69) and then waned by days 10 to 29 postpartum (0.87; 95% CI, 0.56–1.24). Emergency department visits for psychiatric and self-harm reasons were consistently lower during pregnancy and postpartum compared to the year before conception.

Conclusions

Psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency department visits are not uncommon for women with schizophrenia during pregnancy and the postpartum period. However, except for a brief period after delivery, women with schizophrenia are at relatively lower risk of requiring acute psychiatric inpatient and emergency care during and 1 year after pregnancy compared to the 1-year period prior to conception. This is key prognostic information for women with schizophrenia, their families, and providers who counsel them regarding pregnancy, motherhood, and management of schizophrenia. Identifying women at risk of requiring acute psychiatric services in the perinatal period warrants further investigation.

### Clinical features and outcomes of peripartum obstetric patients admitted to the intensive care unit: a nationwide inpatient database in Japan [^117MPpLR]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Study design and data collection

This retrospective observational study utilized a nationwide inpatient database comprising discharge summaries and healthcare utilization information from acute care hospitals in Japan. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Tokyo [approval number: 3501-(5)]. Because all data were de-identified, the requirement for patient informed consent was waived.

We used the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) inpatient database for the period from July 2010 to March 2022. The database contains discharge abstracts and detailed healthcare service information derived from both medical records and reimbursement claims from more than 1,000 acute care hospitals, covering approximately 90% of tertiary care emergency hospitals in Japan. All academic hospitals are required to contribute to the database, while community hospitals provide data voluntarily.

The database contains the following variables for each patient: sex; age; diagnoses, comorbidities at admission, and complications after admission, according to International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes and Japanese text; procedures recorded according to the Japanese medical procedure codes; device codes; drug codes; referral from other facilities; intensive care unit admission; teaching hospital; pregnancy status (pregnant or not); gestational age at the time of hospital admission and delivery during hospitalization; date of admission, procedures, and discharge; readmission within one week after delivery; and discharge status (in-hospital mortality, transportation to other hospital, or discharge to home). Validation of the various diagnostic records in this database was conducted to a high standard. The sensitivity and specificity of the primary diagnosis in the database were 78.9% and 93.2%, respectively.

Study population

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria: (i) either antepartum at the time of hospital admission or assigned any of the ICD-10 codes listed in Additional file 1; (ii) delivered during hospitalization or within one week before hospital admission; and (iii) admitted to the ICU during hospitalization. We defined the ICU as a separate unit providing critical care services with at least one physician on site 24 h per day, around-the-clock nursing, necessary equipment to care for critically ill patients, and a nurse-to-patient ratio of at least 1:4 (Additional file 2). This definition corresponds to the criteria required to claim higher levels of ICU management fees in Japan. It is also comparable to the Level 2 or Level 3 ICU classification defined by the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^112re7WE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Severe maternal morbidity among pregnant people with opioid use disorder enrolled in medicaid [^114WUd7M]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Data

The data source was an extract from the TAF from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 2016 to 2018. The extract included claims for enrollees with any International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis or procedure codes or diagnostic related group codes indicative of the prenatal or postpartum period, delivery, maternal health conditions, or obstetric-related services from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. For this study, we had access to the Inpatient (IP) files, the Other Services (OT) files, and the Demographic and Eligibility (DE) files.

The IP and OT files contain claims-based health service encounter information, including ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes, in addition to the dates of service and the service setting (eg, hospital or office). The IP files contain claims from inpatient hospital services, whereas the OT files contain a mix of claims from outpatient (eg, office-based services and outpatient specialty services) and inpatient hospital services. The extent to which hospitalization claims are contained in the OT file varies across states. The DE file contains data on enrollee eligibility characteristics (eg, enrollment dates and eligibility mechanism), enrollee demographic characteristics (eg, age, gender, residence, and race and ethnicity), and Medicaid plan characteristics (eg, plan type). The completeness of enrollee characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, income, and marital status, vary across states and over time owing to differences in enrollment practices across state Medicaid programs. All files can be linked using the unique beneficiary identification number, which is consistent across states and years. We excluded New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia owing to data-quality issues in these states. This cross-sectional study was approved by the Boston University institutional review board and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^116QNnrY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite efforts to reduce stillbirths and neonatal deaths, inconsistent definitions and reporting practices continue to hamper global progress. Existing data frequently being limited in terms of quality and comparability across countries. This paper addresses this critical issue by outlining the new International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) recommendations for standardized recording and reporting of perinatal deaths to improve data accuracy and international comparison. Key advancements in ICD-11 include using gestational age as the primary threshold to for reporting, clearer guidance on measurement and recording of gestational age, and reporting mortality rates by gestational age subgroups to enable country comparisons to include similar populations (e.g., all births from 154days [22 +0 weeks] or from 196days [28 +0 weeks]). Furthermore, the revised ICD-11 guidance provides further clarification around the exclusion of terminations of pregnancy (induced abortions) from perinatal mortality statistics. Implementing standardized recording and reporting methods laid out in ICD-11 will be crucial for accurate global data on stillbirths and perinatal deaths. Such high-quality data would both allow appropriate regional and international comparisons to be made and serve as a resource to improve clinical practice and epidemiological and health surveillance, enabling focusing of limited programmatic and research funds towards ending preventable deaths and improving outcomes for every woman and every baby, everywhere.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^115JGJwV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Depressive disorders — perinatal depression definition, duration, and prevention — are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as a major depressive disorder with a time-onset specifier, including onset in pregnancy or up to 4 weeks postpartum, although most clinical experts recommend the application of this terminology until 12 months postpartum. The importance of treatment should not be minimized; one quarter of women with perinatal depression will have symptoms for 3 years postpartum. This document will focus primarily on the pharmacologic management of mental health conditions, including perinatal depression. More recent data suggest prevention among those at high risk through counseling interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (eg, Mothers and Babies) and interpersonal therapy (eg, the ROSE [Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns] program), which has been shown to be cost effective, though how best to implement these interventions remains an area of active research.
