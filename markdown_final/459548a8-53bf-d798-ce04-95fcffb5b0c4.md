## Question

Indications corticosteroids in acute back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for corticosteroids in acute back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "acute back pain" and distinguish non-radicular from radicular pain. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews say about systemic corticosteroids for acute non-radicular low back pain. Next, I will examine the evidence for systemic corticosteroids in acute radicular pain. After that, I need to check the role of epidural corticosteroid injections in acute radiculopathy. Finally, I should weigh benefits versus harms and synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Acute back pain is typically defined as less than 6 weeks' duration, and I should separate non-radicular mechanical low back pain from radicular pain due to nerve root compression, because the pathophysiology and evidence base differ and that will shape indications or lack thereof for corticosteroids [^e8f7c332] [^ac326097].

> Now, for acute non-radicular low back pain, I should confirm the highest-quality guidance. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends against systemic corticosteroids, oral or intramuscular, for acute low back pain with or without radicular symptoms, citing that most trials show no significant benefit in pain or function across dosing regimens, and the single RCT showing a signal for disability improvement was low quality and not replicated [^69bd0317]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in that RCT; the prednisone taper showed a small improvement in disability and mental health at short-term follow-up, but no difference in pain and no durable benefit, reinforcing that routine use is not justified [^69bd0317]. The Cochrane review likewise concludes systemic corticosteroids are ineffective for non-radicular low back pain, and contemporary network meta-analyses of analgesics for acute non-specific low back pain do not support steroids as effective therapy, aligning with this recommendation [^ac326097] [^bbc5ee1e] [^82c2377c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about radicular pain. I need to check the evidence for systemic corticosteroids in acute radiculopathy. The Cochrane review suggests a small, short-term functional benefit in radicular pain, with a mean difference around 0.5–0.6 points on a 0–10 scale for pain and a modest increase in likelihood of functional improvement, but effects are small and not sustained, and there is no reduction in surgery risk, so the clinical relevance is limited [^ac326097]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline endorses routine systemic steroids for acute radiculopathy; the VA/DoD still advises against systemic corticosteroids even in radicular presentations, reflecting that any benefit is modest and offset by potential harms and lack of durable outcomes [^69bd0317]. So, if considered at all, it should be reserved for select cases with severe, incapacitating radicular pain after NSAIDs and activity, and even then, expectations should be tempered [^803e54c5].

> Next, I should review epidural corticosteroid injections, because clinicians often ask whether injections are indicated in the acute setting. The Cochrane review of epidural steroids for lumbosacral radicular pain shows a small, short-term reduction in leg pain and disability at 2 weeks to 3 months, with no long-term benefit, and effects below typical minimal clinically important difference thresholds, so any benefit is modest and transient [^8074e303]. I should double-check guideline positions: ACOEM recommends epidural injections only in selected circumstances for acute or subacute radicular pain, typically after NSAIDs and at least 3 weeks of conservative care, and not for axial pain without radiculopathy, which aligns with a conservative, stepwise approach [^94460a08] [^6439cd47]. But wait, what if the patient is in the first week of severe radiculopathy? Even then, most guidelines still prioritize NSAIDs, activity, and time, reserving injections for persistent, function-limiting radicular pain after a short trial of conservative therapy, given the small and short-lived benefit and procedural risks [^94460a08] [^8074e303].

> I need to ensure I weigh harms appropriately. Short courses of systemic corticosteroids can cause insomnia, mood changes, hyperglycemia, and immunosuppression, and observational data link even short courses to increased risks of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture, albeit with low absolute risk, which becomes important when benefit is uncertain or minimal [^5bcf8b36] [^b8126712]. For epidural injections, serious complications are rare but include infection, hematoma, and neurologic injury; the FDA has warned about serious neurologic events with epidural steroids, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and image guidance when used [^90edf77f] [^8074e303].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing any legitimate indication. For acute non-radicular low back pain, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroids, and they should not be prescribed given lack of efficacy and potential harms [^69bd0317] [^ac326097]. For acute radicular pain, routine systemic corticosteroids are not recommended; a short oral course may be considered only in select patients with severe, incapacitating pain after NSAIDs and activity, with counseling that benefits are small and short-term, and many will not experience meaningful improvement [^69bd0317] [^ac326097]. For epidural corticosteroid injections, they may be considered in acute or subacute radicular pain after a brief period of conservative therapy, recognizing the modest, short-term benefit and procedural risks, and they are not indicated for axial pain without radiculopathy [^94460a08] [^8074e303].

> Finally, I should confirm what to do instead. First-line management of acute low back pain, whether radicular or not, should emphasize education, activity, and NSAIDs as appropriate, with nonpharmacologic options like heat, manual therapy, or exercise tailored to patient preference and tolerance; opioids and systemic corticosteroids are not first-line for acute low back pain, and decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making about uncertain benefits and known risks [^e8f7c332] [^1f124db6] [^2fe73713].

Systemic corticosteroids are **not recommended** for acute non-specific low back pain because they do not improve pain or function and carry risks of adverse effects [^500d11b7] [^ac326097]. They may be considered only for **severe radicular pain** from acute lumbar radiculopathy when NSAIDs and activity fail, and even then, benefits are modest and short-term [^ac326097] [^8074e303]. Epidural corticosteroids are not first-line for acute radiculopathy; reserve them for persistent symptoms after 3–6 weeks of conservative care, and avoid systemic steroids in patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, or infection risk [^94460a08] [^6439cd47] [^5bcf8b36].

## Evidence for systemic corticosteroids in acute non-specific low back pain

Multiple high-quality studies and guidelines show that systemic corticosteroids **do not improve pain or function** in acute non-specific low back pain:

- **VA/DoD guideline**: Recommends against systemic corticosteroids for acute low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, citing lack of benefit [^69bd0317].
- **Cochrane review**: Systemic corticosteroids are ineffective for acute non-radicular low back pain [^ac326097].
- **ACP/APS guideline**: Found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective for acute low back pain [^500d11b7].

---

## Evidence for systemic corticosteroids in acute radicular pain (sciatica)

For acute radicular pain, evidence is mixed but generally shows only **modest, short-term benefits** at best:

- **Cochrane review**: Systemic corticosteroids may slightly improve short-term function in radicular pain, but effects are small and not sustained; no long-term benefit or reduction in surgery risk [^ac326097].
- **VA/DoD guideline**: Still recommends against systemic corticosteroids even for radicular pain due to limited benefit and potential harms [^69bd0317].
- **RCT evidence**: A 15-day prednisone taper showed no significant improvement in pain or function vs placebo in acute radiculopathy [^b8126712].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids carry **meaningful risks**, especially with repeated or high-dose use:

- **Short-term risks**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, insomnia, dyspepsia, increased infection risk [^5bcf8b36].
- **Long-term risks**: Osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, cataracts, avascular necrosis, and rebound pain on withdrawal [^2de1aff2].
- **Serious harms**: Even short courses can increase risks of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fractures, albeit with low absolute risk [^b8126712].

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in acute back pain** |
|-|-|
| VA/DoD guideline | Strongly against systemic corticosteroids for acute low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms [^69bd0317] |
| American College of Physicians (ACP) | Good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective for acute low back pain [^500d11b7] |
| Cochrane review | Ineffective for acute non-radicular low back pain; modest, short-term functional benefit in radicular pain only [^ac326097] |
| American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) | No recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in acute low back pain |

---

## Situations where corticosteroids may be considered

Despite the general lack of support, **selective use** may be reasonable in specific scenarios:

- **Severe radicular pain**: Incapacitating pain from acute lumbar radiculopathy unresponsive to NSAIDs and activity, with informed consent about limited benefit and risks [^803e54c5].
- **Short course only**: Limit to a brief taper (e.g. 6–12 days) to minimize adverse effects [^803e54c5].
- **Avoid in high-risk patients**: Diabetes, osteoporosis, immunocompromise, or active infection [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments for acute back pain

First-line management should prioritize **nonpharmacologic and safer pharmacologic options**:

- **Nonpharmacologic**: Education, activity, heat, manual therapy, and supervised exercise [^e8f7c332] [^2fe73713].
- **Pharmacologic**: NSAIDs are first-line; acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and short-term opioids may be considered selectively [^e8f7c332] [^500d11b7].
- **Epidural steroids**: Not first-line; consider only after 3–6 weeks of conservative care for persistent radicular pain, with modest, short-term benefit [^94460a08] [^8074e303].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Systemic corticosteroids are **not indicated for acute non-specific low back pain** because they are ineffective and carry risks [^500d11b7] [^ac326097]. For acute radicular pain, they may be considered only in select, severe cases after NSAIDs and activity have failed, with counseling that benefits are modest and short-term. Epidural corticosteroids are not first-line; reserve them for persistent radicular symptoms after conservative care. Avoid systemic steroids in patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, or infection risk [^5bcf8b36].

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — systemic corticosteroids (Recommendation 28): For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, we suggest against systemic corticosteroids (oral or intramuscular injection) (Weak against | Not reviewed, Amended). The discussion notes that systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic LBP with or without radiculopathy are not recommended and that most trials in a systematic review showed no significant improvements in pain or function across dosing regimens. One randomized controlled trial using a 15 day course of oral prednisone (five days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg) versus placebo showed a statistically significant improvement in disability and favored prednisone for the mental health component of an SF-36, with no difference for the physical component; study quality was determined to be low, and there is inconclusive evidence that corticosteroids decrease healthcare utilization.

### Nonsurgical management of acute and chronic low back pain [^2e2df89d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

A variety of nonsurgical treatment alternatives exists for acute and chronic low back pain. Patients should receive appropriate education about the favorable natural history of low back pain, basic body mechanics, and methods (eg, exercises, activity modification, behavioral modification) that can reduce symptoms. Nonprescription medication is efficacious for mild to moderate pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alone or in combination with muscle relaxants, relieve pain and improve overall symptoms of acute low back pain. Exercise therapy has limited value for acute low back pain, but strong evidence supports exercise therapy in the management of chronic low back pain. Moderately strong evidence supports the use of manipulation in acute back pain. Evidence is weak for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with acute low back pain, strong for short-term relief of chronic low back pain, and limited for long-term relief of chronic low back pain. The use of facet injections in the management of acute low back pain is not supported by evidence, nor is the effectiveness of orthoses, traction, magnets, or acupuncture. Trigger point injections are not indicated for nonspecific acute or chronic low back pain, and sacroiliac joint injections are not indicated in the routine management of low back pain. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

### Short-term systemic corticosteroids: appropriate use in… [^5bcf8b36]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

An analysis of national claims data found that 21% of adults received at least one outpatient prescription for a short-term systemic corticosteroid over a three-year period, even after excluding patients who had asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, or inflammatory conditions for which chronic steroids may be indicated. The most common diagnoses associated with outpatient prescribing of short-term corticosteroids included upper respiratory infection, spine conditions, allergic rhinitis, acute bronchitis, connective tissue and joint disorders, asthma, and skin disorders. 1 Most of these short courses of corticosteroids were prescribed by family medicine and internal medicine physicians.

1 Several recent studies have confirmed high rates of prescribing systemic corticosteroids for patients with acute respiratory tract infections, ranging from 11% of all outpatient respiratory infections in a national study 2 to 70% of patients with at least one week of cough in a small study at two urgent care clinics. 1 The estimated number needed to harm after a short course of steroids was 140 for fracture, 454 for venous thromboembolism, and 1, 250 for sepsis. There are also case reports of avascular necrosis developing after even one course of systemic steroids. 4, 5 It is well understood that short-term systemic steroids can cause hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, immunocompromised state, mood and sleep disturbance, and fat necrosis when injected. This review summarizes the evidence base for the effectiveness of short-term systemic steroid use in adults in the outpatient primary care setting.

This review does not address the role of systemic corticosteroids for conditions where there is a clear consensus supporting effectiveness, such as for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. This review also does not address localized steroid use, as with joint injection, and topical and inhaled formulations. Acute Bronchitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed for patients with acute bronchitis. 1–3 This may be appropriate for bronchitis associated with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; however, it is not appropriate for most other patients with acute bronchitis. The Oral Steroids for Acute Cough trial was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 401 adults with acute cough, 6 including approximately one-third with audible wheeze at baseline; patients who had asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded.

Acute Pharyngitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids may provide some benefit for patients with peritonsillar abscess. Acute Sinusitis Regarding treatment of clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, a Cochrane review identified five randomized trials comparing a corticosteroid to placebo. Allergic Rhinitis One study compared the effectiveness of oral and intranasal steroids for allergic rhinitis and found no difference between the two routes of administration. 13 Current allergy society guidelines do not recommend systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, especially because nasal steroids are effective for this condition and do not have systemic side effects.

### Use of steroids in spine surgery [^3168524d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Steroids are commonly used in spine pathologies. A broad range of providers from different specialties such as primary care, emergency medicine, and spine surgeons use steroids. The indications and controversies of steroid use are discussed in this article. A literature review was conducted on the use of steroids in spine pathologies. Steroids have been successfully used in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to prevent dysphagia, in spinal cord injuries to improve neurological function, in acute back and neck pain for pain control, and in spinal metastasis. Steroid injections have been used for axial as well as radicular pain. Techniques and complications are further discussed. Local and systemic steroids have been successful in preventing dysphagia after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. Steroids failed to improve the neurologic outcomes after spinal cord injuries, and they were associated with multiple complications. Systemic steroids have not been proven to provide better clinical outcomes for acute low back pain. Steroid injections are more effective in radicular pain rather than axial pain. There are not enough high-quality studies on the use of steroids for metastatic spinal cord compression.

### Medications for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society / American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^500d11b7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Medications are the most frequently prescribed therapy for low back pain. A challenge in choosing pharmacologic therapy is that each class of medication is associated with a unique balance of risks and benefits.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, tramadol, and systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain).

Data Sources

English-language studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE (through November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts.

Study Selection

Systematic reviews and randomized trials of dual therapy or monotherapy with 1 or more of the preceding medications for acute or chronic low back pain that reported pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, work disability, or patient satisfaction.

Data Extraction

We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To grade methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials.

Data Synthesis

We found good evidence that NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain) are effective for pain relief. The magnitude of benefit was moderate (effect size of 0.5 to 0.8, improvement of 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale, or relative risk of 1.25 to 2.00 for the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant pain relief), except in the case of tricyclic antidepressants (for which the benefit was small to moderate). We also found fair evidence that opioids, tramadol, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin (for radiculopathy) are effective for pain relief. We found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective. Adverse events, such as sedation, varied by medication, although reliable data on serious and long-term harms are sparse. Most trials were short term (≤ 4 weeks). Few data address efficacy of dual-medication therapy compared with monotherapy, or beneficial effects on functional outcomes.

Limitations

Our primary source of data was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language trials only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews.

Conclusions

Medications with good evidence of short-term effectiveness for low back pain are NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain). Evidence is insufficient to identify one medication as offering a clear overall net advantage because of complex tradeoffs between benefits and harms. Individual patients are likely to differ in how they weigh potential benefits, harms, and costs of various medications.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^ade19c4f]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — oral or IV steroids (Grade B) is suggested to be not effective; trials in emergency department (ED) patients found no benefit with prednisone 50 mg (n = 39) versus placebo (n = 40) and no differences with methylprednisolone acetate 160 mg (n = 44) versus placebo (n = 43). Adults aged 18–55 years with LBP intensity ≥ 5 out of 10 on a VAS had no statistically-significant difference in 3‑point verbal rating scale pain at 5 days, and authors concluded oral corticosteroids did not provide a benefit and that oral steroid (prednisone) is no more effective than placebo; in nonradicular LBP, subjects assessed at one week and one month on an 11‑point numerical rating scale (NRS) and 4‑point descriptive scale had no between‑group differences, and authors concluded parenteral corticosteroids did not provide any benefit and that intravenous steroids are not more effective than placebo.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^94460a08]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to epidural injections, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to offer epidural corticosteroid injections in selected circumstances for the treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically after treatment with NSAIDs and waiting at least 3 weeks.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^bbc5ee1e]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-network meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA) statement for this article. This report is part of a larger project (PROSPERO CRD42019145257) evaluating analgesic medicines for low back pain. The published protocol appears in supplement 1, and protocol updates are in supplement 2a and 2b.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults (≥ 18 years) with acute non-specific low back pain. We included randomised controlled trials that compared an analgesic medicine with another analgesic medicine, placebo medicine, or no treatment (including continuation of usual care or being placed on a waitlist). We did not restrict our criteria by language or publication status. We excluded randomised controlled trials with enriched enrolment because this method violates the transitivity assumption.

We included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids from the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system (supplement 2c). Medicines must have had a license for use in humans in 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration, UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, European Medicines Agency, or Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. We included additional licensed medicines in these classes that were identified during the review process. Medicines must have been administered systemically (eg, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular) as a single drug or combination formulations, at any dose. We excluded non-systemic administrations (eg, topical and epidural). Trials that used non-pharmacological co-interventions were included and were considered in the assessment of transitivity.

We only included trials that assessed the effects of medicines that had been administered for a minimum of 24 h or, where single administration was used, outcomes at the end of treatment had to have been measured a minimum of 24 h later. This threshold excluded trials that tested the analgesic effect of medicines on immediate term outcomes only, which typically examined acute emergency care or experimental settings and is different to primary care.

Data sources

We searched five electronic databases and three clinical trial registers (Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform) from database inception until 20 February 2022. Full search strategies appear in supplement 2d. We also searched previous reviews and reference lists of included trials, which returned no additional records.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^6e9d87c5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to epidural injections, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer epidural corticosteroid injections for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic LBP in the absence of significant radicular symptoms.

### Corticosteroids for pain of spinal origin: epidural and intraarticular administration [^6ef330fb]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Targeted interventional delivery of corticosteroids remains a mainstay of treatment for spinal pain syndromes because this approach has a wider therapeutic index than other approaches. The best evidence for analgesic efficacy is in subacute radicular syndromes associated with new-onset or recurrent lumbar radiculitis. Complications often relate to drug delivery technique as much as actions of the steroid itself and require careful consideration and vigilance by the administering physician. Considerable uncertainty persists concerning which patients with chronic pain are most likely to benefit from corticosteroid injections. Matching this treatment option with specific spinal pain syndromes remains a major challenge.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^6439cd47]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar epidural glucocorticosteroid injections (ESIs) — a total of 18 high-quality and 41 moderate-quality studies were included. Evidence is consistent that ESIs result in up to 6 weeks modest improvement compared with placebo injections. As the main alternative is surgery, this Spine Panel's opinion is that an ESI is Recommended (I), Moderate Confidence for select circumstances as an option for treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically after treatment with NSAID and waiting at least 3 weeks; its purpose is to provide a few weeks of partial pain relief while awaiting spontaneous improvement and remaining as active as practical. Effects of series of injections should be assessed, and there should not be a series of injections (eg, three) ordered. Epidural glucocorticosteroid injections are Moderately Not Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence for treatment of spinal stenosis, and are Not Recommended (D), Evidence (C), High Confidence for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain in the absence of significant radicular symptoms. Fluoroscopic guidance improves placement accuracy, as blind targeting has been shown to be 77% accurate.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^2fe73713]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest NMA to date in the field of low back pain (46 RCTs involving 8765 participants assigned to pharmacological, non-pharmacological or inert treatment). We found that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were more efficacious than inert treatment for reducing pain intensity and disability due to acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP. Overall, the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, with high certainty of evidence for manual therapy compared with usual care and education.

For reducing pain intensity, the most efficacious interventions at immediate-term follow-up (close to 1 week) were heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise, NSAIDS and opioids, whereas at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month), the most efficacious treatment was manual therapy. For reducing disability, similar findings are found in the subgroup analysis showing that heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise and education for non-pharmacological group and muscle relaxants and NSAIDs for pharmacological group are effective at immediate-term follow-up. Manual therapy confirmed the effects also for decreasing disability at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month). Limited evidence was found for steroids when compared with NSAIDs (one study) to reduce disability.

The present analysis highlights a potentially minor role for medicines in the management of NS-LBP: initial treatment should be non-pharmacological as confirmed by the SUCRA. However, only a minority of pharmacological interventions are included in the networks. In particular, steroids and opioids are under-represented (only three studies) and their desirable effects should be weighed against side effects. In fact, mild or moderate adverse events were most often recorded for the opioids, the NSAIDs and the steroids arms. This observation is shared by recent systematic reviews that found that at least 50% of people with NS-LBP taking opioids withdrew from the study owing to adverse events or lack of efficacy, with trends noted for higher harm rates and higher percentages of severe harm.

Given that paracetamol offer limited or no benefit, its clinical value might be questionable. This finding is not reflected in all current guidelines, however. A recent Cochrane systematic reviewfound that paracetamol does not result in better outcomes compared to placebo in people with acute low back pain reporting evidence from a large multicentre RCT included in our NMA (1652 randomised people with NS-LBP) that showed no benefit of any dose of paracetamol (until 4000 mg) compared with placebo in people with moderate intensity acute low back pain.

### Systemic pharmacologic therapies for low back pain: a systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^10583026]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A 2007 American College of Physicians guideline addressed pharmacologic options for low back pain. New evidence and medications have now become available.

Purpose

To review the current evidence on systemic pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular or radicular low back pain.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (January 2008 through November 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized trials that reported pain, function, or harms of systemic medications versus placebo or another intervention.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, and a second verified accuracy; 2 investigators independently assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

The number of trials ranged from 9 (benzodiazepines) to 70 (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). New evidence found that acetaminophen was ineffective for acute low back pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had smaller benefits for chronic low back pain than previously observed, duloxetine was effective for chronic low back pain, and benzodiazepines were ineffective for radiculopathy. For opioids, evidence remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects for chronic low back pain; trials were not designed to assess serious harms. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective for short-term pain relief in acute low back pain but caused sedation. Systemic corticosteroids do not seem to be effective. For effective interventions, pain relief was small to moderate and generally short-term; improvements in function were generally smaller. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of antiseizure medications.

Limitations

Qualitatively synthesized new trials with prior meta-analyses. Only English-language studies were included, many of which had methodological shortcomings. Medications injected for local effects were not addressed.

Conclusion

Several systemic medications for low back pain are associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain. New evidence suggests that acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain, and duloxetine is associated with modest effects for chronic low back pain.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^026745ba]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to 20 February 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials of analgesic medicines (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anti-convulsant drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids) compared with another analgesic medicine, placebo, or no treatment. Adults (≥ 18 years) who reported acute non-specific low back pain (for less than six weeks).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Primary outcomes were low back pain intensity (0–100 scale) at end of treatment and safety (number of participants who reported any adverse event during treatment). Secondary outcomes were low back specific function, serious adverse events, and discontinuation from treatment. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was done and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis method.

Results

98 randomised controlled trials (15134 participants, 49% women) included 69 different medicines or combinations. Low or very low confidence was noted in evidence for reduced pain intensity after treatment with tolperisone (mean difference -26.1 (95% confidence intervals -34.0 to -18.2)), aceclofenac plus tizanidine (-26.1 (-38.5 to -13.6)), pregabalin (-24.7 (-34.6 to -14.7)), and 14 other medicines compared with placebo. Low or very low confidence was noted for no difference between the effects of several of these medicines. Increased adverse events had moderate to very low confidence with tramadol (risk ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5)), paracetamol plus sustained release tramadol (2.4 (1.5 to 3.8)), baclofen (2.3 (1.5 to 3.4)), and paracetamol plus tramadol (2.1 (1.3 to 3.4)) compared with placebo. These medicines could increase the risk of adverse events compared with other medicines with moderate to low confidence. Moderate to low confidence was also noted for secondary outcomes and secondary analysis of medicine classes.

Conclusions

The comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain are uncertain. Until higher quality randomised controlled trials of head-to-head comparisons are published, clinicians and patients are recommended to take a cautious approach to manage acute non-specific low back pain with analgesic medicines.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^82c2377c]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to 20 February 2022.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Randomised controlled trials of analgesic medicines (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anti-convulsant drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids) compared with another analgesic medicine, placebo, or no treatment. Adults (≥ 18 years) who reported acute non-specific low back pain (for less than six weeks).

Data extraction and synthesis

Primary outcomes were low back pain intensity (0–100 scale) at end of treatment and safety (number of participants who reported any adverse event during treatment). Secondary outcomes were low back specific function, serious adverse events, and discontinuation from treatment. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was done and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis method.

Results

98 randomised controlled trials (15 134 participants, 49% women) included 69 different medicines or combinations. Low or very low confidence was noted in evidence for reduced pain intensity after treatment with tolperisone (mean difference −26.1 (95% confidence intervals −34.0 to −18.2)), aceclofenac plus tizanidine (−26.1 (−38.5 to −13.6)), pregabalin (−24.7 (−34.6 to −14.7)), and 14 other medicines compared with placebo. Low or very low confidence was noted for no difference between the effects of several of these medicines. Increased adverse events had moderate to very low confidence with tramadol (risk ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5)), paracetamol plus sustained release tramadol (2.4 (1.5 to 3.8)), baclofen (2.3 (1.5 to 3.4)), and paracetamol plus tramadol (2.1 (1.3 to 3.4)) compared with placebo. These medicines could increase the risk of adverse events compared with other medicines with moderate to low confidence. Moderate to low confidence was also noted for secondary outcomes and secondary analysis of medicine classes.

Conclusions

The comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain are uncertain. Until higher quality randomised controlled trials of head-to-head comparisons are published, clinicians and patients are recommended to take a cautious approach to manage acute non-specific low back pain with analgesic medicines.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^1f124db6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Systemic corticosteroids for radicular and non-radicular low back pain [^ac326097]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are medications with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. Systemic corticosteroids administered through the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes have been used to treat various types of low back pain, including radicular back pain (not due to spinal stenosis), non-radicular back pain, and spinal stenosis. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid for radicular low back pain, non-radicular low back pain, and symptomatic spinal stenosis in adults.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was September 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials in adults of systematic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The major outcomes were pain, function, need for surgery, serious adverse effect, and presence of hyperglycemia. The minor outcomes were quality of life, successful outcomes, non-serious adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (1047 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain For radicular low back pain, moderate-certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long-term follow-up (MD -7.40, 95% CI -12.55 to -2.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non-radicular low back pain Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non-radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short-term pain or function.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short-term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long-term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non-radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^d7dd5395]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Trigger point injections (TPIs) — corticosteroid utility: Corticosteroids in TPIs lack supportive evidence and offer minimal benefit, as stated that "no evidence supports corticosteroid use in TPIs" and that "several studies concluded that corticosteroids have a minimal, if any, benefit on treatment success". The section summary reinforces that "there is no evidence showing benefit, and their use may increase risk of infection in addition to other systemic effects of steroid exposure".

Intradiscal steroids — A total of five moderate-quality studies were included. For radicular pain and herniated discs, one study is available and it did not include a placebo group, thus there is no quality evidence regarding efficacy. For chronic LBP, two moderate-quality trials suggest lack of efficacy and one suggests efficacy. These injections are Not Recommended (D), Moderate Confidence for treatment of acute LBP and Not Recommended (C), Moderate Confidence for treatment of subacute or chronic LBP.

Recommendation 2b — corticosteroids for acute SCD pain indicates that for adults and children presenting for acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests against corticosteroids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects). Remarks clarify that steroids should still be used when appropriate for other medical indications such as asthma, and that systemic corticosteroid exposure, particularly cessation of steroids, has been associated with rebound pain and other complications; therefore decisions for other indications should be made in collaboration with experts in SCD.

### Injection therapy and denervation procedures for chronic low back pain: a systematic review – clinical value? [^918baea4]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

"Injection therapy and denervation procedures for chronic low back pain: a systematic review" evaluates the effect of two broadly defined treatment options for chronic low back pain. This forms indeed a burden to patients, society and physicians. Lack of knowledge of the causes of chronic pain and poor understanding of patient heterogeneity in pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment response are a major explanation for unsuccessful trials. Clinical research reaches the conclusion that a "mechanism-based" treatment approach in which therapeutic interventions target the specific mechanisms of a patient's pain is recommended.

Low back pain is divided into specific form due to fracture tumor, infection, etc and the aspecific form. We generally differentiate between degenerative diseases of the facet joints or of the intervertebral disc and radicular pain.

The described inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies to be withheld in this systematic review; however, suggest that the research group lacks the input of a clinical experts who can provide information regarding the clinical diagnoses and the potential underlying mechanisms. In contrast, instead of following recent recommendations, pain syndromes with different underlying mechanisms are clearly mixed in the expectation to draw clinically relevant information on a therapeutic intervention. Moreover, also treatments with no indication in a clinical setting are analyzed, which troubles even more the evidence.

Under the heading injection therapy, injections of medication and proteolytic agents are considered and it is for the clinician strange to have epidural and facet joint injections discussed in the same line as local injections in spinal muscles. Moreover, the epidural injections are recommended for the management of subacute low back pain radiating into the leg. This means pain of a duration between 6 weeks and 3 months. Obviously because of the predefined criteria for inclusion of studies on patients with pain of duration of more than 3 months, the authors eliminate the most important trials on this treatment option. Of the three studies that are maintained for further analysis only the trial on targetted steroid placement deals with patients suffering radicular pain. Evidence-based practice guidelines clearly indicate that the only indication for epidural corticosteroid administration is the management of subacute radicular pain. Epidural administration of local anesthetic may be used in surgery and postoperative pain control, but is not recommended for the management of chronic pain, mainly because of the short duration of action of the local anesthetic and the lack of mechanism/cause oriented mode of action.

### Analgesic effects of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised trials [^fea285ff]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for adults with low back pain compared with placebo.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating non-surgical and non-interventional treatments compared with placebo or sham in adults (≥ 18 years) reporting non-specific low back pain.

Information Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to 14 April 2023.

Risk Of Bias

Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the 0 to 10 PEDro Scale.

Synthesis Of Results

Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals on outcome pain intensity (0 to 100 scale) at first assessment post-treatment for each treatment type and by duration of low back pain-(sub)acute (< 12 weeks) and chronic (≥ 12 weeks). Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach.

Results

A total of 301 trials (377 comparisons) provided data on 56 different treatments or treatment combinations. One treatment for acute low back pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), and five treatments for chronic low back pain (exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonists) were efficacious; effect sizes were small and of moderate certainty. Three treatments for acute low back pain (exercise, glucocorticoid injections, paracetamol), and two treatments for chronic low back pain (antibiotics, anaesthetics) were not efficacious and are unlikely to be suitable treatment options; moderate certainty evidence. Evidence is inconclusive for remaining treatments due to small samples, imprecision, or low and very low certainty evidence.

Conclusions

The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo. The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain due to the limited number of randomised participants and poor study quality. Further high-quality, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to address the remaining uncertainty in treatment efficacy along with greater consideration for placebo-control design of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments.

### Chronic low back pain in adults: evaluation and management [^1c5403a9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.

### Efficacy and safety of steroid use for postoperative pain relief. update and review of the medical literature [^f4162f51]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of various analgesic regimens, patient surveys have indicated that moderate-to-severe postoperative pain is still poorly managed. The use of corticosteroids for postoperative pain relief, although popular, has yet to gain wider acceptance because of concerns over side effects, in particular adrenal suppression, osteonecrosis, impaired wound-healing, and concerns about efficacy. The medical literature provides evidence that should substantially decrease these concerns with regard to low and short-dose applications. The results of randomized trials have shown low, short-dose corticosteroid regimens to be safe and effective for reducing postoperative pain. There is strong, grade-A evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids in multimodal analgesia protocols to contribute to the postoperative recovery of the patient by minimizing opioid doses and therefore side effects. However, the optimal mode, dose, and timing of administration remain unclear.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^42813b9d]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids given orally or IV can decrease the use of opioid analgesics by 50%. Benefits of corticosteroids include a decrease in postoperative nausea, decrease in opioid requirements, decrease in the length of hospital stay, and more complete pain relief. The smallest dose that is effective should be prescribed. Doses ranging from 15 mg of dexamethasone to 0.1 mg/kg have been shown to be effective with no complications.– A meta-analysis of perioperative use corticosteroids concludes that an "intermediate-dose dexamethasone (0.11–0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy after surgical procedures. The preoperative administration of the drug provides a greater effect on postoperative pain". Physicians should consider perioperative dosing of corticosteroids in low-risk patients, especially in patients at risk of dependency.

Managing Acute Pain for Patients on Long-Term Opioids at Presentation

The panel recommends that perioperative analgesia should be managed with a MMA regimen in all opioid-tolerant patients (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends coordinating with acute pain service (APS) (or addiction medicine or psychiatry depending on resources) when inpatient and the patient's prescriber when outpatient to ensure that there is only 1 prescriber for patients on medication-assisted therapy (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone), patients using illicit opioids, or patients misusing prescription opioids (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Opioid-tolerant patients present a clinical challenge to effective perioperative pain management. These patients have a medical condition and should be treated with the same respect and dignity as a patient with any other presurgical medical condition. Developed nations have observed a large increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients over the last decade. In the United States, a combination of expanding heroin abuse, pain control metrics, and pharmacologic development of long-acting opioids has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients. Managing perioperative pain in the opioid-tolerant patient is both a medical and a social challenge. Opioid-tolerant patients are at an increased risk of receiving inadequate perioperative analgesia. This risk exists as the result of (1) a social stigmatization of opioid prescription and consumption; (2) concerns for drug-seeking behavioror relapse of recovering addicts, or both; and (3) an incomplete understanding of opioid agonist and opioid replacement therapy pharmacokinetics.

Low, "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Strength of recommendations: Strong indicates "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa" and "Applies to most patients in most circumstances" with policy implication that "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs". Conditional indicates "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty" and "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", with policy implications that "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

Local anesthetics and steroids in neuraxial blockade — Local anesthetic injection aims to block sensory signals and, while often used diagnostically or for acute pain, when used in chronic pain can provide long-term relief beyond pharmacologic duration due to decreased sensitization and other mechanisms. In practice, steroids are typically combined with local anesthetics to prolong pain relief. The rationale for neuraxial steroids builds on neural blockade benefits that include pain relief lasting hours, days, and sometimes weeks, attributed to postulated effects that alter or interrupt nociceptive input, reflex mechanisms, self-sustaining neuronal activity, and central neuronal patterns.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain: a systematic review [^fabfb593]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injection of corticosteroids is one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic spinal pain. However, there has been a lack of well-designed randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections. Consequently, debate continues as to the value of epidural steroid injections in managing spinal pain.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of various types of epidural steroid injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), in managing various types of chronic spinal pain (axial and radicular) in the neck and low back regions.

Study Design

A systematic review utilizing the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for evaluation of randomized and non-randomized trials, and criteria of Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group for randomized trials were used.

Methods

Data sources included relevant English literature performed by a librarian experienced in Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), as well as manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles and abstracts from scientific meetings within the last 2 years. Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for the quality of their methods. Subgroup analyses were performed among trials with different control groups, with different techniques of epidural injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), with different injection sites (cervical/thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and with timing of outcome measurement (short- and long-term).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure is pain relief. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, and return to work. Short-term improvement is defined as 6 weeks or less, and long-term relief is defined as 6 weeks or longer.

Results

In managing lumbar radicular pain with interlaminar lumbar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. In managing cervical radiculopathy with cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is moderate. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radicular pain is strong for short-term and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing cervical nerve root pain is moderate. The evidence is moderate in managing lumbar radicular pain in post lumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief, in managing chronic pain of lumbar radiculopathy and postlumbar laminectomy syndrome.

Conclusion

There is moderate evidence for interlaminar epidurals in the cervical spine and limited evidence in the lumbar spine for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical and lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term improvement in managing nerve root pain. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term relief in managing nerve root pain and chronic low back pain.

Benzodiazepines

Small trials conducted in the 1970s to 1990s report some effect on acute or chronic low back pain (effect size and level of certainty not reported). Other studies indicate that benzodiazepines do not possess meaningful analgesic properties separate from their sedative properties. A 2017 RCT of 114 patients conducted in the US did not find that that adding diazepam to diclofenac in people attending an emergency department improved functional outcomes or pain at one week. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased falls, cognitive impairment, and risk of addiction.

Non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants

This category of medicine is broad and includes a variety of pharmacologically unrelated medications such as cyclobenzaprine, tolperisone, baclofen, and orphenadrine with similar indications. In both acute and chronic low back pain, there is low and very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants might offer small benefits (mean difference −0.8 (−1.2 to −0.3) from 14 RCTs from the US, Finland, UK, Turkey, and India) but increase the risk of harms, primarily sedation.

Oral corticosteroids

Limited evidence suggests they may be not effective for acute or chronic low back pain (mean difference 0.6 (−2.2 to 1.0) from one RCT conducted in the US), and may not cause harm in short courses.

Cannabinoids

A single RCT of oral cannabidiol in 100 patients conducted in Australia found no effect on low back pain compared with placebo (mean difference −0.3 (−1.3 to 0.6)) and no increase in short term harms in a hyperacute, emergency department setting. There are no data for chronic low back pain, and no data on harms associated with long term use in other chronic conditions.

Oral combination medicines

There is low certainty evidence that combining medicines does not produce superior effect sizes and may increase the risk of harms. An example of combination medicines sometimes used to treat low back pain is an opioid plus an NSAID or paracetamol.

Topical preparations

There is some indirect evidence (level of certainty not assessed) that some formulations of NSAIDS and rubefacients may reduce back pain attributed to muscle strains or sprains more than placebo (effect size not reported), which may apply to some cases of acute low back pain, with no increased risk of harms. There are no data on efficacy for chronic low back pain, but indirect evidence from other chronic pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis has shown limited effect.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^7cae5905]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) for lumbosacral radicular pain — evidence from systematic reviews indicates variable certainty and outcomes. Benny and Azari examined 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and concluded there was strong evidence for transforaminal injections in the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain for both short-term and long-term relief, and another radiology review concluded there was moderate to strong evidence supporting transforaminal therapeutic epidural injections for lumbar nerve-root compression. Roberts et al concluded there was fair evidence supporting transforaminal epidural injections as superior to placebo for treating radicular symptoms and good evidence that they should be used as a surgery-sparing intervention. Rho and Tang concluded there was strong evidence to support the use of transforaminal injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic in patients with acute to subacute unilateral radicular pain caused by a herniated nucleus pulposus or spinal stenosis, and that a lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection is an effective surgery-sparing procedure that should be a part of conservative care. Quraishi concluded that when appropriately performed, transforaminal epidural steroid injections should result in an improvement in pain, but not disability, and three RCTs followed patients for 3 months with results illustrating no benefit from adding steroids. Manchikanti et al identified 70 studies of which 25 met inclusion criteria, with 15 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies, with 2 duplicate publications and 3 studies failing to meet inclusion criteria; they reported the evidence for lumbar disc herniation is good for transforaminal epidural with local anesthetic and steroids, fair for local anesthetics alone and the ability to prevent surgery, fair for local anesthetic and steroids in spinal stenosis, and poor, inadequate, limited, or unavailable for axial low back pain and post lumbar surgery syndrome. Macvicar et al assessed 39 publications and reported that for disc herniation lumbar transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is not universally effective but benefits a substantial portion of patients and is not a placebo, whereas for other conditions the available evidence was limited and neither compelling nor conclusive. Pinto et al concluded corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, with long-term effects that were positive but smaller and not statistically significant.

### Commonly used interventional procedures for non-cancer chronic spine pain: a clinical practice guideline [^7983a530]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness and safety of commonly used interventional procedures (such as spinal injections and ablation procedures) for chronic axial and radicular spine pain that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy?

Current Practice

Chronic spine pain is a common, potentially disabling complaint, for which clinicians often administer interventional procedures. However, clinical practice guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations for their use.

Recommendations

For people living with chronic axial spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: joint radiofrequency ablation with or without joint targeted injection of local anaesthetic plus steroid; epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; joint-targeted injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; and intramuscular injection of local anaesthetic with or without steroids. For people living with chronic radicular spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: dorsal root ganglion radiofrequency with or without epidural injection of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic plus steroids; and epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including four people living with chronic spine pain, 10 clinicians with experience managing chronic spine pain, and eight methodologists, produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provided methodological support. The guideline panel applied an individual patient perspective when formulating recommendations.

The Evidence

These recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials and a systematic review of observational studies, summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of common interventional procedures for axial and radicular, chronic, non-cancer spine pain. Specifically, injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination into the cervical or lumbar facet joint or sacroiliac joint; epidural injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; radiofrequency of dorsal root ganglion; radiofrequency denervation of cervical or lumbar facet joints or the sacroiliac joint; and paravertebral intramuscular injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

Understanding The Recommendations

These recommendations apply to people living with chronic spine pain (≥ 3 months duration) that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy and do not apply to the management of acute spine pain. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future: in particular, whether there are differences in treatment effects based on subtypes of chronic spine pain, establishing the effectiveness of interventional procedures currently supported by low or very low certainty evidence, and effects on poorly reported patient-important outcomes (such as opioid use, return to work, and sleep quality).

### Predictors of opioid prescription among a sample of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia [^b46cbafd]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although multiple non-pharmacologic treatments, such as physiotherapy and acupuncture, are used in the management of musculoskeletal pain, pharmacotherapy (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective COX-2 inhibitors, oral and injectable corticosteroids, and opioids) remains the mainstay of musculoskeletal pain treatment. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed analgesics used in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain. Nearly 90% of patients who visit pain clinics in the United Kingdom are prescribed some forms of opioid analgesics. Although opioids are deemed to be the most effective analgesics in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain, their use is associated with higher risk of abuse, misuse, and serious adverse events. Therefore, the lowest effective dose of opioids should be used for the shortest appropriate period of time whenever needed in the management of musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, it was found that the early use of opioids in the management of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain has been associated poorer clinical outcomes especially in the case of low back pain according to a recently published systematic review of clinical practice guidelines. However, another systematic review and meta-analysis has found that the use of opioids in the management of low back pain is associated with greater pain relief in the short term, but this effect was not observed in the long term.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^296bed73]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sacroiliac joint injections — indications and effectiveness: There are zero high-quality and nine moderate-quality RCTs incorporated into this analysis, and the sacroiliac joints are believed to cause a minority of chronic LBP cases, with estimates ranging from 10% to 26.6%. SI joint corticosteroid injections are Recommended (C), Low Confidence as a treatment option for select patients with a specific known cause of sacroiliitis with proven rheumatologic inflammatory arthritis involving the SIJs with symptoms of at least 1 to 2 months and prior treatment that has included NSAIDS, and each injection should be evaluated before additional injections are scheduled, rather than scheduling a series of injections. In contrast, there are no quality studies showing a long-term improvement in pain function in those receiving SIJ injections for chronic non-specific LBP, and SIJ injections are Not Recommended (D), Low Confidence for treatment of acute LBP including LBP thought to be SIJ related; subacute or chronic non-specific LBP, including pain attributed to the sacroiliac joints, but without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis (rheumatologic disease); or any radicular pain syndrome.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^e8f7c332]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Corticosteroids

The recommendations for corticosteroids were also heterogenous. Eleven (39%, 11/28), advised a short course of corticosteroids if no response to analgesia. A number of additional indications were given, including severe joint pain refractory to analgesia (80%, 8/10);, highly inflammatory forms (exhibiting bursitis, severe synovitis, joint swelling or persistently raised inflammatory markers) (30%, 3/10);, disabling arthritis/arthralgia (40%, 4/10), or when NSAIDs are contraindicated (10%, 1/10). Prednisolone was the most commonly recommended (50%, 5/10), but with variations in recommend dosing for adults ranging from 10 mg to 20 mg per day (60%, 3/5) based on clinical judgment, to escalation to 0.5 mg/kg/day (80%, 4/5), for severe cases. Four CMGs (80%, 4/5), provided guidance on the duration, ranging from 5 days (60%, 3/5), to weaning over 10 days to 1–2 months for severe cases (40%, 2/5). Two CMGs (40%, 2/5) recommended that the duration should not exceed one month. Although 80%, (4/5), of CMGs providing corticosteroid guidance, advised on tapering down steroid doses, only one stated the risk of symptom rebound if withdrawn too abruptly. In contrast 43% (12/28), of CMGs advised against steroid use in the acute phase of infection. Only a minority gave justifications for avoidance, stating either a lack of evidence (8%, 1/12), lack of benefit regardless of form of administration (8%, 1/12)or a risk of rebound symptoms (8%, 1/12). One CMG advised use of short-term corticosteroids in the acute phase, for individuals with refractory pain, while also advising against the use in the acute phase.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^5c770db1]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injection (ESI) for low back pain (LBP) — evidence synthesis from systematic reviews (SRs) and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — shows mixed results across timeframes, with the evidence base "assessing ESI outcomes at six and 12 months" including an SR that "found a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain when ESI was compared to conservative treatment", contrasted by another SR "(n = 2,470)… found no improvement in back pain or disability at three to 12 months or greater than 12 months". In an RCT of lumbar disc herniation, the trial "favored epidural steroids for function but not pain at three months", yet the "small sample size (n = 28 in each arm) was not sufficient to impact the findings from the multiple SRs". Safety data were limited as "the quality of data assessing AEs and harms in the reviewed studies was insufficient to draw any conclusions", and there was "a lack of studies assessing the efficacy of ESI in spinal stenosis alone or in LBP alone to draw separate conclusions".

### Epidural steroid injections for radicular lumbosacral pain: a systematic review [^e39700a7]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Most clinical guidelines do not recommend routine use of epidural steroid injections for the management of chronic low back pain. However, many clinicians do not adhere to these guidelines. This comprehensive evidence overview concluded that off-label epidural steroid injections provide small short-term but not long- term leg-pain relief and improvement in function; injection of steroids is no more effective than injection of local anesthetics alone; post-procedural complications are uncommon, but the risk of contamination and serious infections is very high. The evidence does not support routine use of off-label epidural steroid injections in adults with benign radicular lumbosacral pain.

### Recommendations and guidance for steroid injection therapy and COVID-19 vaccine administration from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^bacd8420]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

To date, COVID-19 has spread to more than 108 million people globally, with a death toll surpassing 2 1/2 million. With the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two highly effective COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna, we now have a novel approach to contain COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. Chronic pain care has faced unprecedented challenges for patients and providers in this ever-changing climate. With the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, we now face questions relating to the potential effects of pain treatments utilizing steroids on vaccine efficacy. In this analysis, we address these issues and provide guidance for steroid therapies based on available data and expert recommendations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^8efbbb34]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Because of the possibility that benefits of opioid therapy might diminish or that risks might become more prominent over time, clinicians should elicit patients' experiences and preferences and review expected benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients periodically (see Recommendation 7).

Interventional Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain

Office-based interventional approaches, such as arthrocentesis and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis and subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease, can provide short-term improvement in pain and function to supplement or facilitate exercise, physical therapy, and other conservative approaches. Evidence is insufficient to determine the extent to which repeated glucocorticoid injection increases potential risks such as articular cartilage changes (in osteoarthritis) and sepsis.

Interventional pain management specialists offer additional interventions that can alleviate pain as part of a comprehensive pain management approach for patients with indications including back pain, persistent pain after spinal surgery, neuropathic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Certain more common procedures include epidural steroid injections (for lumbar radiculopathy with herniated disc), nerve ablation procedures (e.g. radiofrequency denervation for low back pain), and neurostimulation procedures (e.g. peripheral nerve stimulation and spinal cord stimulation). Descriptions of common interventional procedures are available. Level of evidence for effectiveness and risks varies by procedure, and additional research is needed to establish the clinical benefits as well as risks of specific interventional procedures for specific pain conditions compared with risks of opioid pain medications and other pharmacologic therapies. Rare, serious adverse events have been reported with epidural injection. Interventional procedures should be performed by properly trained clinicians following meticulous infection control protocols. Clinicians can consult with a qualified pain management specialist who is well versed in benefits and risks of diagnostic and therapeutic options to determine potential appropriateness of specific interventional procedures for their patients' indications and clinical circumstances.

### Recommendations and guidance for steroid injection therapy and COVID-19 vaccine administration from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^937c7276]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary Recommendations

The following are the summary recommendations and guidelines based on the aforementioned data and evidence. We want to acknowledge that the following recommendations are fluid and will be updated based on ongoing data. We would also recommend that physicians determine each individual patient's level of acuity and weigh out specific risks/benefits while applying these broad recommendations set forth.

1) There is no evidence that patients receiving epidural steroid therapy for the management of pain are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 vaccination.

2) There is no evidence that bolus steroids in the epidural space will impact vaccine responsiveness.

3) Neuraxial steroid injections do not need to be deferred when indicated in the context of COVID-19 vaccination.

4) No specific guidance suggests withholding NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatories prior to receiving vaccination.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^45253109]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Epidural injection recommendations by indication state that the evidence is good for caudal epidural, interlaminar epidural, and transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing disc herniation or radiculitis. For axial or discogenic pain, the evidence is fair for either caudal epidural or lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids, while the evidence is limited for transforaminal epidural injections. For spinal stenosis, the evidence is fair for caudal and interlaminar injections and limited for transforaminal epidural injections with or without steroids. For post surgery syndrome, the evidence is fair for caudal epidural injections with or without steroids. Accordingly, for axial or discogenic pain, either lumbar interlaminar or caudal epidural injections are recommended, and for post surgery syndrome, the preferred modality of treatment is with caudal epidural with or without steroids.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^47fc316e]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, and four on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest using patient education, different types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. The guidelines recommend against acupuncture, routine use of imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injection, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from international guidelines. The guideline working groups recommend that research efforts in relation to all aspects of management of LBP and LR be intensified.

### Benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids for… [^cc8ce6f8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the benefits and harms of using systemic corticosteroids for the management of radicular and nonradicular low back pain or symptomatic spinal stenosis in adults. Evidence-Based Answer In patients with radicular low back pain, systemic corticosteroids increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up. In adults with nonradicular low back pain, the use of systemic corticosteroids does not lead to a discernible effect on pain or function. Systemic corticosteroids are not beneficial in treating pain or function in those with spinal stenosis. A short course of systemic corticosteroids does not appear to cause harm. 1 Practice Pointers Low back pain can be categorized by etiology as radicular, nonradicular mechanical, symptomatic due to spinal stenosis, or back pain secondary to rheumatologic, inflammatory, metabolic, or malignant conditions. Management of low back pain may be specific to etiology and guided by duration of symptoms: acute pain, subacute pain, or chronic pain. The authors sought to determine the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids two to 12 weeks after administration for low back pain that was radicular, nonradicular mechanical, or symptomatic due to spinal stenosis.

The Cochrane review included 13 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1, 047 participants, and sample sizes ranged from 29 to 269. 1 Nine trials evaluated participants with radicular low back pain. Of the nine trials, three evaluated participants with acute symptoms, two evaluated those with mixed acute and nonacute symptoms, one evaluated those with nonacute symptoms, and in three trials the duration of symptoms was unclear. Two trials studied participants with acute nonradicular low back pain. Two trials studied participants with spinal stenosis: one trial included patients with chronic symptoms whereas the other did not report the duration of symptoms. Radiologic confirmation of conditions was required in only two of the nine trials for radicular low back pain; radiologic confirmation was also required in both of the trials for spinal stenosis.

Patient demographics were not consistently provided; however, in studies that reported this information, the median age of participants was 40 years in the radicular and nonradicular low back pain trials and 58 years in the spinal stenosis trials. Corticosteroids were given as a one-time treatment or over the course of several days and were administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly; studies that evaluated epidural injections were excluded. Corticosteroid type, dosage, and length of treatment varied between studies. Total doses of prednisone equivalents ranged from 50 to 1, 050 mg. Multiple scales were used to determine treatment effect. There was no evidence that systemic corticosteroids improved pain or function in the short-or long-term in patients with nonradicular low back pain or spinal stenosis. Adverse effects were inconsistently reported but, in studies that included this information, no serious adverse effects were noted.

### Corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related pain in adults [^c078fd46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

One of the most feared symptoms associated with cancer is pain. Opioids remain the mainstay of pain treatment but corticosteroids are often used concurrently as co- or adjuvant analgesics. Due to their anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, corticosteroids are said to provide effective analgesia for pain associated with inflammation and in the management of cancer-related complications such as brain metastasis and spinal cord compression. However, corticosteroids have a wide range of adverse effects that are dose and time dependent.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating cancer-related pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OVID) (1966 to 29 September 2014), EMBASE (OVID) (1970 to 29 September 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 29 September 2014), Science Citation Index (Web of Science) (1899 to 29 September 2014) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science) (1990 to 29 September 2014).

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or prospective controlled trial that included patients over 18 years with cancer-related pain were eligible for the review. Corticosteroids were compared to placebo or usual treatment and/or supportive care.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used arithmetic means and standard deviations for each outcome to report the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, enrolling 1926 participants. The trial size varied from 20 to 598 patients. Most studies compared corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, to standard therapy. We included six studies with data at one week in the meta-analysis for pain intensity; no data were available at that time point for the remaining studies. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in less pain (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with a lower score indicating less pain) compared to control at one week (MD 0.84 lower pain, 95% CI 1.38 to 0.30 lower; low quality evidence). Adverse events were poorly documented. Factors limiting statistical analysis included the lack of standardised measurements of pain and the use of different agents, dosages, comparisons and routes of drug delivery. Subgroup analysis according to type of cancer was not possible. The quality of this evidence was limited by the risk of bias of the studies and small sample size. The results were also compromised by attrition, with data missing for the enrolled patients.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids for pain control in cancer patients is weak. Significant pain relief was noted in some studies, albeit only for a short period of time. This could be important for patients with poor clinical status. Further trials, with increased numbers of participants, are needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of corticosteroids for the management cancer pain in adults, and to establish an ideal dose, duration of therapy and route of administration.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^803e54c5]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For radicular pain, whether from radiculitis or radiculopathy, we only recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as a 6-day methylprednisolone taper) if a patient has incapacitating pain interfering with functioning and/or engaging in physical therapy. For lumbar disc herniation, oral corticosteroids have been shown to offer only modest improvement in function and have not been proven to reduce pain. In older adults, the systemic side effects are often limiting and should not be prescribed without carefully considering the risks and benefits and involving the patient and/or caregiver in the decision-making process.

Another treatment option for patients with incapacitating pain limiting function is fluoroscopically-guided epidural corticosteroid injections. Full discussion of the indications and expected efficacy of these injections is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important to appreciate that these injections must be utilized thoughtfully because in an improperly selected older patient, there is a risk for significant side effects from the procedure itself and from epidural corticosteroid administration, potentially without a high likelihood for clinical improvement. Based on a modified Delphi method, our expert panel believes that best practice is for primary care clinicians who are considering the use of an injection to first refer the patient to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist (such as a physiatrist, anesthesia pain physician, or sports medicine physician), prior to ordering the injection, in order to evaluate for proper patient selection.

LSS is another common condition in older adults and can cause positional-dependent nerve root irritation due to degenerative changes resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal. The most common presenting symptom of LSS is progressive pain down the leg with continued walking that improves with sitting. In a study by Kalichman et al. up to 20% of 60–69-year-olds had CT-evidence of LSS, and while not everyone with the finding was symptomatic, people with imaging-diagnosed LSS were over three times more likely to have LBP. When symptomatic, 42% of patients with LSS present with lateral thigh pain. The diagnosis of LSS is important to consider when older adults present with lateral hip or thigh pain that improves by functionally increasing the spinal canal area with lumbar flexion. Management of LSS is discussed in Part VI of this series.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^c2432c22]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) acute musculoskeletal pain guideline — evidence review scope and methods: The key question was, "In adult patients with acute (< 4 weeks), non–low back, musculoskeletal pain in the outpatient setting, what are the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms, both short-term and long-term) of nonpharmacologic treatments, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and opioid treatments?" An additional review asked, "What factors are associated with prolonged opioid use after prescription to treat acute musculoskeletal pain in adults?" Reviewers searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, and CENTRAL from inception through February 2018, assessed risk of bias, and studied adults with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries; interventions included both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, were compared versus placebo and versus each other, and outcomes included pain at 15 minutes to 2 hours, 1 to 7 days, and 3 weeks to 6 months, function, symptom relief, patient satisfaction, and GI, dermatologic, and neurologic adverse events. The target audience is all clinicians and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries; development incorporated perspectives and preferences of 2 nonphysician CCG members and a 7-member CCG Public Panel and underwent peer review, with the guideline posted online for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors and also reviewed by members of AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^69c19704]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Steroid mechanisms and evidence limitations in epidural injections — Corticosteroids in neuraxial blockade are postulated to reduce inflammation and have several modes of action including membrane stabilization, inhibition of neural peptide synthesis or action, blockade of phospholipase A2 activity, local anesthetic effect, prolonged suppression of ongoing neuronal discharge, and suppression of dorsal-horn neuron sensitization; they inhibit phospholipase A2 and thereby downstream eicosanoid pathways, and can inhibit ectopic discharges from nerve fibers. Despite extensive use, there is no evidence that steroid injections are disease-modifying agents with a direct effect on pain generation or transmission, except for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and there are no studies demonstrating the anti-inflammatory role of steroids or differentiating inflammatory from noninflammatory radiculopathies. Historically, the first evidence suggesting inflammation in radiculopathy was published in 1981, leading to the classification of 2 categories of radiculopathy, compressive and inflammatory.

### Suzetrigine approval breaks a 25-year silence: a new era in non-opioid acute pain management [^d538c7f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultations, accounting for approximately 40% of primary care visits. A systematic review by (Gregory and McGowan, 2016)found that hospital-wide pain prevalence among hospitalized adults ranged from 37.7% to 84%, highlighting the significant burden of pain in clinical settings. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage". Pain is classified into acute and chronic types based on duration and cause. Acute pain, lasting less than three months, often results from injury, surgery, illness, trauma, or painful medical procedures. In contrast, chronic pain persists or recurs beyond three months and may arise from conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic low back pain, chronic headaches or migraines, endometriosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Analgesics, broadly classified into non-opioids, opioids, and adjuvant analgesics, have long been utilized in pain management. Non-opioid analgesics are primarily indicated for mild to moderate pain and include aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. These drugs exert their analgesic effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, and subsequently decreasing inflammation, peripheral nociceptor sensitization, and central pain transmission. In contrast, opioids are predominantly used for moderate to severe pain and include codeine, tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. They bind to mu (μ), kappa (κ), and delta (δ) opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system, inhibiting neurotransmitter release and pain signal transmission, thereby altering pain perception. Adjuvant analgesics, which enhance the effects of primary analgesics or target specific pain types, include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids, offering additional therapeutic benefits in pain management.

Interlaminar epidural injections — evidence from systematic reviews and guidelines indicates mixed or limited benefit for lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections. Multiple systematic reviews provided negative opinions, and prior reviews reported evidence ranging from indeterminate to moderate. In 1995 Koes et al reviewed 12 trials of lumbar and caudal epidural steroid injections and reported positive results from only 6 studies, and their updated review with 15 trials again found no evidence that epidural steroid injections are effective in patients with chronic back pain without sciatica. Watts and Silagy's meta-analysis utilized 11 studies involving a total of 907 patients and concluded that pooled randomized data supported epidural corticosteroids as effective for lumbosacral radicular pain. Armon et al concluded that epidural steroid injections for radicular lumbosacral pain do not impact average functional status or provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months and issued a negative recommendation. Parr et al found the available interlaminar literature comprised only blind injections without fluoroscopy and determined the evidence as poor, and the APS and ACOEM guidelines reported negative results or evidence for interlaminar injections except for short-term benefit in radicular pain. Rho and Tang reported strong evidence for transforaminal injections but only short-term efficacy for interlaminar and caudal approaches, while concluding that lumbar epidural steroids can be an effective tool in the conservative management of low back pain with radicular symptoms.

### WITHDRAWN: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low-back pain [^e7d44167]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs in the treatment of non-specific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Medline and Embase databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) up to and including September 1998 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low back pain with or without radiation were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. A methodological quality score was applied, and studies meeting at least six of 11 specified criteria were considered high quality studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model for statistically homogeneous subgroups and a random effects model for statistically heterogeneous subgroups. If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no).

Main Results

A total of 51 trials (total number of patients = 6057) were included in this review, of which 46 were published in English and five in German. Sixteen trials (31%) were of high quality. The pooled Relative Risk for global improvement after one week was 1.24 (95% CI 1.10, 1.41) and for additional analgesic use 1.29 (95% CI 1.05, 1.57), indicating a statistically significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo. The results of the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence (level 3) that NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence (level 2) that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence (level 1) that various types of NSAIDs are equally effective for acute low back pain.

Authors' Conclusions

In conclusion, the evidence from the 51 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on chronic low back pain is still lacking.

### Costs and cost-effectiveness of epidural steroids for acute lumbosacral radicular syndrome in general practice: an economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomized control trial [^438f8e3d]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

A pragmatic, randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial in Dutch general practice.

Objective

Assessing the costs and cost-effectiveness of adding segmental epidural steroid injections to care as usual in radiculopathy in general practice.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbosacral radicular syndrome (radiculopathy) is a benign, generally self-limiting but painful condition caused by a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc, which results in an inflammatory process around the nerve root. Segmental epidural steroid injections could lessen pain. Low back pain and sciatica form a large financial burden on national health care systems. Improving pain treatment could lower costs to society by diminishing loss of productivity.

Methods

Patients with acute radiculopathy were included by general practitioners. All patients received usual care. Patients in the intervention group received one segmental epidural steroid injection containing 80 mg of triamcinolone as well. Follow-up was performed using postal questionnaires at 2, 4, 6, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Main outcomes were pain, disability and costs. Economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 1 year.

Results

Sixty-three patients were included in the analysis. Mean total costs were €4414 or $5985 in the intervention group and €5121 or $6943 in the control group. This difference was mostly due to loss of productivity. The point estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -€730 or -$990 (1-point diminishment on the numerical rating scale back pain score in 1 patient in the course of 1 yr would save €730 or $990). Bootstrapping showed a 95% confidence interval of -€4476 to €951 or -$6068 to $1289. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that without additional investment the probability that epidural steroids are cost-effective is more than 80%.

Conclusion

The effect on pain and disability of epidural steroids in lumbosacral radicular syndrome is small but significant, and at lower costs with no reported complications or adverse effects. Segmental epidural steroid injections could be considered by policy makers as an additional treatment option.

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^b8126712]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians generally agree that we should be more thoughtful and selective about the use of antibiotics in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and about the use of opioids for conditions such as back pain. However, prescriptions for antibiotics remain common in patients with acute respiratory infections. 1 Patients are increasingly seeking care for acute infections at urgent care centers, which prescribe antibiotics for respiratory infections more often than primary care practices. 1 Physicians also commonly prescribe short courses of oral corticosteroids, with one study finding the most common indication to be acute respiratory tract infection.
2. Meta-analyses have suggested that corticosteroids may have a small benefit for acute cough and sore throat, but they included studies that were small or had a high risk of bias. 3, 4 The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials.

In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. This was true even for patients with wheezing on initial presentation. Regarding back pain, a study randomized 269 adults with sciatica to a 15-day course of prednisone, 60 mg once daily tapering to 20 mg once daily, or placebo, and found no reduction in pain, function, or other outcomes.

7 However, adverse effects such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite were more common in the prednisone group. Thus, the best evidence to date does not support a significant benefit for corticosteroids in patients with cough, sore throat, or back pain. However, there may be harms. A recent study identified 1. 5 million U. S. adults who had been continuously enrolled in a health insurance plan for two years. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone. The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies.

Patients receiving an oral corticosteroid in the previous year and those receiving an inhaled or intranasal corticosteroid were excluded, as were organ transplant recipients and patients with malignancies. The researchers found a clinically and statistically significant increase in the risk of serious complications during the five to 30 days after the corticosteroid was prescribed; this risk declined over the subsequent two months. The relative risks over that initial month were 5. 3 for sepsis,
3. 3 for venous thromboembolism, and 1. 9 for fracture. The absolute increases were 0. 8 additional episodes of sepsis,
2. 2 additional episodes of venous thromboembolism, and 7. 1 additional fractures per 1, 000 person-years, or approximately one additional serious complication per 100 person-years.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain and radiculopathy [^fa36e82a]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Epidural injections with or without steroids are used extensively in the management of chronic spinal pain. However, evidence is contradictory with continuing debate about the value of epidural steroid injections in chronic spinal syndromes. The objective of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections in the treatment of chronic spinal pain. Data sources include relevant literature identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE (Jan 1966- Mar 2003), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and abstracts from scientific meetings. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included in the review based on the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Studies were excluded from the analysis if they were simply review or descriptive and failed to meet minimum criteria. The results showed that there was strong evidence to indicate effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain. Further, evidence was moderate for caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radicular pain. The evidence in management of chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, cervical radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, and post laminectomy syndrome was limited or inconclusive. In conclusion, the evidence of effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain was strong, whereas, effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy was moderate, while there was limited or inconclusive evidence of effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain without radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, and cervical radiculopathy.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain [^8074e303]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbosacral radicular pain (commonly called sciatica) is a syndrome involving patients who report radiating leg pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections deliver a corticosteroid dose into the epidural space, with the aim of reducing the local inflammatory process and, consequently, relieving the symptoms of lumbosacral radicular pain. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review published in Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012. Some placebo-controlled trials have been published recently, which highlights the importance of updating the previous review.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection on pain and disability in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language limitations up to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Back and Neck group trial register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and two trial registers. We also performed citation tracking of included studies and relevant systematic reviews in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that compared epidural corticosteroid injections of any corticosteroid drug to placebo injections in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. We accepted all three anatomical approaches (caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal) to delivering corticosteroids into the epidural space. We considered trials that included a placebo treatment as delivery of an inert substance (i.e. one with no pharmacologic activity), an innocuous substance (e.g. normal saline solution), or a pharmacologically active substance but not one considered to provide sustained benefit (e.g. local anaesthetic), either into the epidural space (i.e. to mimic epidural corticosteroid injection) or adjacent spinal tissue (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, or interspinous tissue). We also included trials in which a local anaesthetic with a short duration of action was used as a placebo and injected together with corticosteroid in the intervention group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed the screening, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessments. In case of insufficient information, we contacted the authors of the original studies or estimated the data. We grouped the outcome data into four time points of assessment: immediate (≤ 2 weeks), short term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months), intermediate term (> 3 months but < 12 months), and long term (≥ 12 months). We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and time point using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) investigating the effects of epidural corticosteroid injections compared to placebo in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. The included studies provided data for a total of 2470 participants with a mean age ranging from 37.3 to 52.8 years. Seventeen studies included participants with lumbosacral radicular pain with a diagnosis based on clinical assessment and 15 studies included participants with mixed duration of symptoms. The included studies were conducted mainly in North America and Europe. Fifteen studies did not report funding sources, five studies reported not receiving funding, and five reported receiving funding from a non-profit or government source. Eight trials reported data on pain intensity, 12 reported data on disability, and eight studies reported data on adverse events. The duration of the follow-up assessments ranged from 12 hours to 1 year. We considered eight trials to be of high quality because we judged them as having low risk of bias in four out of the five bias domains. We identified one ongoing trial in a trial registry. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -4.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0 to 100 scale; 8 trials, n = 949; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). For disability, epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing disability at short-term follow-up (MD -4.18, 95% CI -6.04 to -2.17, on a 0 to 100 scale; 12 trials, n = 1367; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). The treatment effects are small, however, and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. MD lower than 10%). Most trials provided insufficient information on how or when adverse events were assessed (immediate or short-term follow-up) and only reported adverse drug reactions - that is, adverse events that the trialists attributed to the study treatment. We are very uncertain that epidural corticosteroid injections make no difference compared to placebo injection in the frequency of minor adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 8 trials, n = 877; very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision)). Minor adverse events included increased pain during or after the injection, non-specific headache, post-dural puncture headache, irregular periods, accidental dural puncture, thoracic pain, non-local rash, sinusitis, vasovagal response, hypotension, nausea, and tinnitus. One study reported a major drug reaction for one patient on anticoagulant therapy who had a retroperitoneal haematoma as a complication of the corticosteroid injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This study found that epidural corticosteroid injections probably slightly reduced leg pain and disability at short-term follow-up in people with lumbosacral radicular pain. In addition, no minor or major adverse events were reported at short-term follow-up after epidural corticosteroid injections or placebo injection. Although the current review identified additional clinical trials, the available evidence still provides only limited support for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in people with lumbosacral radicular pain as the treatment effects are small, mainly evident at short-term follow-up and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. mean difference lower than 10%). According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, suggesting that further studies are likely to play an important role in clarifying the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment. We recommend that further trials should attend to methodological features such as appropriate allocation concealment and blinding of care providers to minimise the potential for biased estimates of treatment and harmful effects.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is the most common pain symptom experienced by American adults and the second most common reason for primary care physician visits.LBP is a significant socioeconomic problem, estimated to cost $30 billion in direct healthcare expenditures and $100–$200 billion in decreased wages and disability in the USA annually. As the population ages, LBP prevalence has been increasing, with one study showing a 169% rise over 15 years (from 3.9% in 1992 to 10.2% by 2006). Multifactorial aetiologies including age-related degeneration and structural pathology, as well as occupational, lifestyleand psychological factors, potentially contribute to this ubiquitous, often debilitating condition.

The first line of treatment for LBP in patients without 'red flags'is conservative medical management (ie, oral analgesics, physical therapy (PT)). However, when these steps fail to provide relief, epidural steroid injections (ESIs), often a combination of steroid and analgesics, are commonly used to treat LBP when there is pathoanatomical correlate (ie, disc protrusion impinging on nerve root). In fact, ESIs are the most commonly performed intervention in the USA to manage chronic/subacute LBP. Although these injections can be useful for short-term management of chronic/subacute LBP, they have not demonstrated a long-term effect on pain or surgical rates.ESIs are also not without risk. Procedural risks include bleeding, infection and nerve injury, and effects secondary to systemic absorption of injected steroid include suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis resulting in decreased cortisol levels, disruption of glucose levels in patients with diabetes resulting in hyperglycaemia, and decreased bone mineral density over time.

### Addition of corticosteroids to local anaesthetics for chronic non-cancer pain injections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^9e09b116]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite common use, the benefit of adding steroids to local anaesthetics (SLA) for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) injections is uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of English-language RCTs to assess the benefit and safety of adding steroids to local anaesthetics (LA) for CNCP.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases from inception to May 2019. Trial selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Outcomes were guided by the Initiative in Methods, Measurements, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) statement with pain improvement as the primary outcome and pooled using random effects model and reported as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Among 5097 abstracts, 73 trials were eligible. Although SLA increased the rate of success (42 trials, 3592 patients; RR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03–1.25; number needed to treat [NNT], 13), the effect size decreased by nearly 50% (NNT, 22) with the removal of two intrathecal injection studies. The differences in pain scores with SLA were not clinically meaningful (54 trials, 4416 patients, MD = 0.44 units; 95% CI, 0.24–0.65). No differences were observed in other outcomes or adverse events. No subgroup effects were detected based on clinical categories. Meta-regression showed no significant association with steroid dose or length of follow-up and pain relief.

Conclusions

Addition of cortico steroids to local anaesthetic has only small benefits and a potential for harm. Injection of local anaesthetic alone could be therapeutic, beyond being diagnostic. A shared decision based on patient preferences should be considered. If used, one must avoid high doses and series of steroid injections.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^0d42220b]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The evidence for the three types of epidural steroid injections and analysis of the literature will serve as the foundation to provide recommendations and guidelines for each type of injection. There have been 48 systematic reviews and 42 RCTs examining the efficacy of epidural steroid injections in the management of chronic spinal pain. These studies have suggested that epidural steroid injections have clear but often not long-lasting reduction in chronic spinal pain. The most recent and authoritative of these systematic reviews was performed by Manchikanti et al. This review outlined the efficacy and the evidence-based recommendations for conditions treated with epidural injection therapy. Additionally, this review comprehensively evaluated the efficacy of each epidural treatment approach (caudal, interlaminar, transforaminal) for given spinal indications (disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, etc.). Given the comprehensive nature and recency of that review, we will briefly summarize the results from that manuscript as: 1) no new studies were identified in our search process and 2) there have been numerous authoritative reviews of this modality.

Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection

The Manchikanti review identified 13 high-quality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of interlaminar steroid injections. Ten studies were rated as high quality. The review concluded that there is Level I evidence treatment of lumbar disc herniation with interlaminar epidural steroid injections and Level II evidence for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and axial/discogenic pain. The manuscript also suggests that overall the treatment effect has been rated as significant with the exception of systematic reviews with methodological flaws. These reviews were not specified. No new or additional studies were identified in our review process in the interval between publication of the Manchikanti study and the preparation of this manuscript.

Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection

In the Manchikanti review, there were 13 high-quality RCTs evaluating the efficacy of transforaminal epidural steroid injections. The majority of the studies examined the efficacy of transforaminal approaches in the setting of disc herniation. The evidence synthesis suggested Level I evidence for transforaminal injections in the setting of disc herniation and Level II evidence in the setting of lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy and spinal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^edaaa74c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Use of epidural corticosteroid injections is increasing.

Purpose

To review evidence on the benefits and harms of epidural corticosteroid injections in adults with radicular low back pain or spinal stenosis of any duration.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (through May 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, prior systematic reviews, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of epidural corticosteroid injections versus placebo interventions, or that compared epidural injection techniques, corticosteroids, or doses.

Data Extraction

Dual extraction and quality assessment of individual studies, which were used to determine the overall strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

30 placebo-controlled trials evaluated epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy, and 8 trials were done for spinal stenosis. For radiculopathy, epidural corticosteroids were associated with greater immediate-term reduction in pain (weighted mean difference on a scale of 0 to 100, -7.55 [95% CI, -11.4 to -3.74]; SOE, moderate), function (standardized mean difference after exclusion of an outlier trial, -0.33 [CI, -0.56 to -0.09]; SOE, low), and short-term surgery risk (relative risk, 0.62 [CI, 0.41 to 0.92]; SOE, low). Effects were below predefined minimum clinically important difference thresholds, and there were no longer-term benefits. Limited evidence showed no clear effects of technical factors, patient characteristics, or comparator interventions on estimates. There were no clear effects of epidural corticosteroid injections for spinal stenosis (SOE, low to moderate). Serious harms were rare, but harms reporting was suboptimal (SOE, low).

Limitations

The review was restricted to English-language studies. Some meta-analyses were based on small numbers of trials (particularly for spinal stenosis), and most trials had methodological shortcomings.

Conclusion

Epidural corticosteroid injections for radiculopathy were associated with immediate reductions in pain and function. However, benefits were small and not sustained, and there was no effect on long-term surgery risk. Limited evidence suggested no effectiveness for spinal stenosis.

### Effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for patients with acute and subacute sciatica: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^18707fb1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for adults with acute and subacute sciatica. DESIGN: Intervention systematic review with network meta-analysis LITERATURE SEARCH: Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched up to June 7, 2024. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of nonsurgical interventions in adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute or subacute sciatica (less than 3 months) were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and physical function at different follow-up time points. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, mental health, and low back pain intensity. Two reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment. Random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted, and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) method. RESULTS: Forty randomized controlled trials (5381 participants) were included. At short-term follow-up, compared to sham treatment/placebo, the most efficacious interventions for leg pain intensity were NSAIDs + physical therapy modalities, antibiotics, and antidepressants. Music therapy was effective for improving physical function at short-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, steroids had a significant effect in reducing leg pain and improving physical function. No intervention showed a significant increase in adverse events compared with sham-treatment/placebo. All the evidence was based on very low confidence, primarily due to within-study bias and imprecision in effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Very low-confidence evidence supported some nonsurgical interventions for improving leg pain intensity and physical function in people with acute and subacute sciatica.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^013b08d0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a separate ACP guideline that has also been endorsed by AAFP.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults in the outpatient setting and a systematic review on the predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at ≤ 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain; improve physical function; and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2a

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2b

ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians treating patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### Effects of implementing evidence-based appropriateness guidelines for epidural steroid injection in chronic low back pain: the EAGER (esi appropriateness guidElines pRotocol) study [^e3e90ae2]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

An evidence-based EAGER helps guide patients into a better LBP care pathway with multisubspecialty expertise providing a comprehensive approach to LBP management. Implementation of such guidelines also correlates with benefits at the individual patient level, such as decreased BMI, decreased or discontinued opioid usage, and increased PT referral. ESIs are useful, relatively safe interventions for short-term pain management in appropriately selected patients, and with a multidisciplinary, multifaceted approach those patients who will most benefit can be selected for ESI treatment.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^9848e0c5]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic spinal pain is the most prevalent chronic disease with employment of multiple modes of interventional techniques including epidural interventions. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, systematic reviews, and guidelines have been published. The recent review of the utilization patterns and expenditures show that there has been a decline in utilization of epidural injections with decrease in inflation adjusted costs from 2009 to 2018. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) published guidelines for interventional techniques in 2013, and guidelines for facet joint interventions in 2020. Consequently, these guidelines have been prepared to update previously existing guidelines.

Objective

To provide evidence-based guidance in performing therapeutic epidural procedures, including caudal, interlaminar in lumbar, cervical, and thoracic spinal regions, transforaminal in lumbar spine, and percutaneous adhesiolysis in the lumbar spine.

Methods

The methodology utilized included the development of objective and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards. The literature pertaining to all aspects of epidural interventions was viewed with best evidence synthesis of available literature and recommendations were provided.

Results

In preparation of the guidelines, extensive literature review was performed. In addition to review of multiple manuscripts in reference to utilization, expenditures, anatomical and pathophysiological considerations, pharmacological and harmful effects of drugs and procedures, for evidence synthesis we have included 47 systematic reviews and 43 RCTs covering all epidural interventions to meet the objectives. The evidence recommendations are as follows: Disc herniation: Based on relevant, high-quality fluoroscopically guided epidural injections, with or without steroids, and results of previous systematic reviews, the evidence is Level I for caudal epidural injections, lumbar interlaminar epidural injections, lumbar transforaminal epidural injections, and cervical interlaminar epidural injections with strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness. The evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing disc herniation based on one high-quality, placebo-controlled RCT is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement in patients nonresponsive to conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections. For thoracic disc herniation, based on one relevant, high-quality RCT of thoracic epidural with fluoroscopic guidance, with or without steroids, the evidence is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness. Spinal stenosis: The evidence based on one high-quality RCT in each category the evidence is Level III to II for fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injections with moderate to strong recommendation and Level II for fluoroscopically guided lumbar and cervical interlaminar epidural injections with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term effectiveness. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural injections is Level IV to III with moderate recommendation with fluoroscopically guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injections for long-term improvement. The evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in lumbar stenosis based on relevant, moderate to high quality RCTs, observational studies, and systematic reviews is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement after failure of conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections. Axial discogenic pain: The evidence for axial discogenic pain without facet joint pain or sacroiliac joint pain in the lumbar and cervical spine with fluoroscopically guided caudal, lumbar and cervical interlaminar epidural injections, based on one relevant high quality RCT in each category is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement, with or without steroids. Post-surgery syndrome: The evidence for lumbar and cervical post-surgery syndrome based on one relevant, high-quality RCT with fluoroscopic guidance for caudal and cervical interlaminar epidural injections, with or without steroids, is Level II with moderate to strong recommendation for long-term improvement. For percutaneous adhesiolysis, based on multiple moderate to high-quality RCTs and systematic reviews, the evidence is Level I with strong recommendation for long-term improvement after failure of conservative management and fluoroscopically guided epidural injections.

Limitations

The limitations of these guidelines include a continued paucity of high-quality studies for some techniques and various conditions including spinal stenosis, post-surgery syndrome, and discogenic pain.

Conclusions

These epidural intervention guidelines including percutaneous adhesiolysis were prepared with a comprehensive review of the literature with methodologic quality assessment and determination of level of evidence with strength of recommendations.

### Corticosteroids for managing acute pain subsequent to surgical extraction of mandibular third molars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ef1723d3]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroids for mandibular third-molar extraction — systematic review methods included broad database screening and predefined assessment procedures. Searches leveraged Epistemonikos screening of major sources, including "the US clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov)", and used the Living Overview of Evidence (L•OVE) platform mapping to PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering "from the inception date of each database through April 2023" with no language restrictions. Study selection and data collection were conducted by pairs of reviewers with arbitration by a third reviewer, and risk of bias for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used "Version 2 of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool", rating trials across standard domains and classifying as high risk overall "if 1 or more domains were rated as probably high risk of bias or at high risk of bias". Data synthesis used odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes, risk difference when events were rare, mean difference for continuous outcomes, calculated "95% CIs", and created forest plots; when standard deviation (SD) data were missing, SDs were derived from "SE, CIs, means, and sample sizes", or imputed "by means of averaging the SDs of 3 studies with similar means", with random-effects meta-analyses in Review Manager (Cochrane). Certainty of evidence "using the GRADE approach" was assessed by trained methodologists.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain [^ee7da025]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low-back pain.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All studies were also assessed on clinical relevance, from which no further interpretations or conclusions were drawn. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were lacking for clinically homogeneous trials, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no evidence).

Main Results

In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^41dbc168]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Caudal epidural injections for lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis — evidence synthesis and randomized outcomes: Several systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of epidural steroids including caudal epidural injections, but the majority, including Cochrane reviews, have arrived at erroneous conclusions, whereas Abdi et al, Boswell et al, Bogduk et al, Conn et al, and Parr et al evaluated caudal epidural injections as separate procedures for various pathologies, illustrating the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in managing low back and lower extremity pain. Parr et al reaffirmed prior conclusions with review of 73 available studies and included randomized trials and fluoroscopic observational studies, and due to the availability of 7 randomized trials, only randomized trials were utilized; our literature search yielded 2 additional trials. As shown for disc herniation and radiculitis, there were a total of 7 randomized trials with one trial with 3 publications, and only 4 used fluoroscopy. In another randomized study of 102 patients comparing conservative treatment versus blind caudal epidural steroid injection with follow-up at 6 months, complete relief at 6 months was 86% in the caudal epidural steroid group and 24% in the conservative management group, while no relief was seen in 28% of the conservative management group and 2% of the caudal epidural injection group. A separate meta-analysis by Pinto et al included all types of studies with inappropriate analysis and concluded that corticosteroid injections offer only small short-term, but not long-term, benefit for leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, and noted that the long-term effects were also positive; however, they were smaller size and not statistically significant.

Injection Therapy

Epidural Steroid Injections

LBP has consistently been one of the most common causes of functional limitation and absence from work, as it impacts over 80% of the general population around the world. A common diagnosis of LBP is lumbar radiculopathy, with a prevalence between 9.9% and 25%. Lumbar radiculopathy is generally defined as LBP that radiates down below the knees to the foot and toes and can be associated with neurological findings such as paresthesia and weakness. Radiculopathy is not only secondary to mechanical compression but may also be due to the release of inflammatory mediators at the site of pathology. When comparing to LBP without radicular symptoms, lumbar radiculopathy is associated with more disability and pain, and thus causes decreased quality of life and increased utilization of health resources. Per current guidelines around the world, treatment for lumbar radiculopathy includes spinal injections, specifically lumbar epidural steroid injections.

Epidural steroid injections are generally performed with three different approaches: interlaminar (midline or parasagittal), transforaminal or caudal. The interlaminar approach is widely used, but limitations can include lack of target specificity and the injectate being distributed to the dorsal epidural space, as opposed to the ventrolateral space. The transforaminal approach, however, is considered to be more specific as this injection localizes the injectate into the ventrolateral epidural space, which is anatomically located in close proximity to the nerve root. The caudal approach can be specifically utilized and may be advantageous in patients with previous spine surgeries, such as a lumbar fusion or laminectomy, in which cases it may be unsafe or anatomically impossible to utilize the interlaminar or transforaminal approach.

Corticosteroid injectable agents are divided into two groups: non-particulate and particulate. Non-particulate corticosteroids are faster in onset but have much shorter acting anti-inflammatory properties. On the other hand, particulate corticosteroids have a slower onset with a longer anti-inflammatory effect. Particulate corticosteroids include triamcinolone, methylprednisolone and betamethasone acetate and are insoluble in saline, local anesthetic and iodinated contrast agents, whereas non-particulate corticosteroids such as betamethasone sodium phosphate and dexamethasone are soluble in all agents. Of the corticosteroids, methylprednisolone is the largest in size while betamethasone is the smallest.

Caudal Epidural Steroid Injection

In the Manchikanti review, there were ten high-quality RCTs meeting inclusion criteria. Two compared caudal epidural injections to interlaminar and transforaminal injections in the management of disc herniation, while one study compared transforaminal injections to caudal injections in the management of lumbar disc prolapse. The remaining studies evaluated treatment of spinal stenosis, axial back pain or post-surgery syndrome. None of the RCTs were placebo controlled. Using the criteria methodology from that review the following conclusions were drawn concerning caudal epidural steroid injections: Level III evidence that caudal and interlaminar approaches are equivalent, Level II–III evidence for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with caudal approaches, Level II in post-surgery syndrome, Level III evidence that transforaminal approaches are superior to caudal approaches.

Evidence Summary

For epidural interventions, RCTs and observational studies with functional status improvement measures were included. Short-term relief was defined as less than six months whereas greater than six months was considered long-term relief. The ASPN consensus guideline committee reviewed the 36 RCTs mentioned above as being of high quality. No additional studies were identified in our search process. For epidural interventions, there was sufficient evidence in the form of RCTs (Table 3), for the committee to make recommendations. Table 4 summarizes those recommendations.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^7b330336]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Ninety two trials reported measuring safety, but only 68 trials (74%) were analysed for the number of participants who reported an adverse event. The primary reasons for data unavailability were reports of only numbers of adverse events, rather than number of participants, or no data for the subset of participants with acute non-specific low back pain. Nine trials were at low risk of bias, 41 trials had some concerns, and 18 trials were at high risk of bias (supplement 2r). One network compared 55 interventions (54 medicines and placebo) in 66 trials (fig 5), and two trials did not connect to the network. All comparisons in the network consisted of a one or two trials and the number of closed loops was small. Direct evidence was available for 70 (4.7%) of 1485 comparisons. Effect estimates were analysed as risk ratios.

### Epidural steroids for cervical and lumbar radicular pain and spinal stenosis systematic review summary: report of the AAN guidelines subcommittee [^8e211153]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) systematic review scope and key questions: The review asks, "In patients with radiculopathy (lumbar, cervical), do epidural corticosteroid injections, compared with placebo or active control, reduce short-term or long-term pain or reduce short-term or long-term disability?" and "In patients with spinal stenosis (lumbar, cervical), do epidural corticosteroid injections, compared with placebo or active control, reduce short-term or long-term pain or reduce short-term or long-term disability?" Scope exclusions are explicit: "This SR does not address pain caused by etiologies other than radiculopathy and spinal stenosis". Given controversy over inactive controls, "the author panel for this review was asked to recommend an appropriate inactive control intervention for future trials of the efficacy of ESIs". The page also notes control arms "used in most clinical trials of ESIs" were "epidural injections of saline or a local anesthetic without steroids", and adds that "Epidural saline injections could, in theory, remove chemical mediators promoting sensitization, thus having a therapeutic effect".
