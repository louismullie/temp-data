## Question

Is alendronate an appropriate treatment for acute epididymitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alendronate is an appropriate treatment for acute epididymitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about alendronate's pharmacology and labeled indications. Then, I should define acute epididymitis, its usual pathogens, and guideline-directed therapy. Next, I need to check whether any evidence links alendronate to epididymitis treatment and whether there is any biological plausibility. After that, I should verify the potential harms of using alendronate in this context and the risks of delaying antibiotics. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical recommendation, including supportive care, partner management, torsion exclusion, and note any pediatric nuances, while confirming alendronate's appropriate uses remain bone-related only [^112grdfc] [^112DQcwx].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic profile of alendronate. Alendronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that localizes to bone hydroxyapatite and inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; its labeled uses are osteoporosis (postmenopausal, male, glucocorticoid-induced), and Paget's disease, with no antimicrobial or anti-infective activity and no indications in genitourinary infections; mechanistically it does not target pathogens or inflammatory cascades relevant to epididymal infection, so I need to be careful not to infer any infectious benefit where none exists [^1138g7iX] [^112tJA7o] [^112grdfc].

> Next, I should review what acute epididymitis is and who the likely pathogens are. Hold on, let me verify the epidemiology and causative organisms: in sexually active men < 35 years or with STI risks, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae predominate; in older men or those with urinary tract instrumentation or obstruction, enteric gram-negatives are more common; this pathogen profile anchors the antibiotic choices and underscores why an antiresorptive like alendronate has no role here [^112DQcwx] [^11245LVj] [^1173XH2k].

> I will now examine guideline-directed antimicrobial therapy, because I need to ensure appropriate empiric coverage is started promptly. For presumed STI-associated epididymitis, recommended therapy is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1,000 mg if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days; for likely enteric organisms with gonorrhea excluded, levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days is advised; for men practicing insertive anal intercourse where mixed STI and enteric pathogens are possible, ceftriaxone plus a fluoroquinolone is recommended; these regimens reflect standard of care across CDC, EAU, and IUSTI guidance, and none include bisphosphonates [^112nyLca] [^114DZQT2] [^1159jTK5] [^116viPZu] [^114hQZT2].

> Wait, let me verify supportive care and timing because inappropriate substitution could delay recovery. Guidelines emphasize bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs as adjuncts, advise starting presumptive antibiotics at the visit before lab results to prevent complications and transmission, note that pain may take weeks to fully resolve after antibiotics, and recommend reevaluating the diagnosis and therapy if symptoms fail to improve within 72 hours; again, nothing here suggests a role for alendronate as an analgesic or anti-inflammatory alternative [^112DQcwx] [^111FN5jq] [^115z4QsF] [^1171BRpJ].

> Hold on, I should verify key diagnostic caveats so we don't miss emergencies; sudden severe unilateral pain or atypical findings should raise concern for torsion with urgent urology evaluation and scrotal ultrasound for vascular assessment; misdirecting therapy with a bone agent like alendronate would not address torsion or abscess risk and could be harmful [^113c9qu6] [^111aACwo] [^115oYZq8] [^117L1kG2].

> Now, I need to check whether any credible evidence supports alendronate for epididymitis. A careful review shows no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines that include alendronate for epididymitis; alendronate labels and compendia list only bone-related indications and off-label uses, while epididymitis guidelines uniformly recommend pathogen-directed antibiotics and supportive care, further confirming no role for bisphosphonates here [^112grdfc] [^112DQcwx] [^116viPZu] [^11245LVj].

> But wait, what if there is a mechanistic rationale via RANK/RANKL signaling in the male reproductive tract; I should double-check that. Basic science reports show RANKL and RANK expression in the epididymis and spermatozoa, and denosumab exposure did not alter sperm calcium responses or acrosome reactions in human sperm; importantly, alendronate does not inhibit RANKL, and these studies do not implicate antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory effects relevant to epididymitis treatment, so invoking this pathway to justify alendronate would be a mechanistic mismatch [^112j3t2g] [^114Yt37K] [^112tJA7o].

> I need to ensure I weigh the harms of inappropriate alendronate use, because delaying effective antibiotics can lead to serious complications. Using alendronate instead of antibiotics risks testicular abscess, progression to epididymo-orchitis, infertility, chronic scrotal pain, and rare necrotizing infections; alendronate also carries its own adverse effects including esophagitis, upper GI ulceration or bleeding, hypocalcemia, severe musculoskeletal pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures, and the effervescent formulation adds a significant sodium load relevant for some patients; none of these risks bring benefit in epididymitis [^1173XH2k] [^1119xMb9] [^113cdCQh].

> Let me consider special populations briefly so I don't overgeneralize. In prepubertal boys, bacterial etiology is less common and antibiotics may be reserved for those with pyuria or positive culture; however, even in that context, there is still no therapeutic role for alendronate, reinforcing that management decisions pivot on infection likelihood and supportive care rather than bone-active drugs [^116sJFvD] [^112nh3kZ].

> Synthesis and final check: Alendronate is not an appropriate treatment for acute epididymitis because its mechanism is bone-specific antiresorptive with no anti-infective activity, there is no supportive clinical evidence, guidelines consistently require pathogen-directed antibiotics with supportive measures, and misuse would delay effective therapy and add avoidable harms; appropriate care is to start recommended antibiotics based on STI versus enteric risk, provide NSAIDs and scrotal support, ensure partner management when STI is suspected, and reassess promptly if not improving, while reserving alendronate strictly for labeled bone indications [^112DQcwx] [^112nyLca] [^1159jTK5] [^112grdfc] [^1171BRpJ] [^111PsXPB].

---

For acute epididymitis, alendronate is not indicated [^112grdfc] and is therefore **not recommended** because it is a bisphosphonate that targets bone resorption [^112tJA7o] and has no antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity relevant to this condition [^1138g7iX]. Acute epididymitis is managed with pathogen-directed antibiotics [^114DZQT2] and supportive care [^112DQcwx]; alendronate offers no clinical benefit and is **not recommended by any guideline** [^112nyLca] [^116viPZu]. Use of alendronate in this context risks unnecessary adverse effects [^113cdCQh] without therapeutic gain.

---

## Pharmacological properties of alendronate

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate [^112tJA7o] that **inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption** [^1138g7iX], increasing bone mineral density [^113UoHtP] and reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis and related bone disorders [^112sm93Z]. It has **no antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity** relevant to acute epididymitis.

---

## Pathophysiology of acute epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is typically caused by **bacterial ascent from the urethra or bladder** [^116peCSC], most often due to sexually transmitted pathogens (e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) in younger men [^112nyLca], or to enteric organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli) in older men or those with urinary tract abnormalities [^114DZQT2]. The condition is characterized by acute inflammation, pain, swelling [^1173XH2k], and potential complications such as abscess formation, infertility, and chronic pain if left untreated.

---

## Current standard treatment guidelines

Current guidelines from the CDC and EAU recommend **antibiotic therapy tailored to the likely causative organisms** [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM]. For **sexually transmitted pathogens**, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM (1,000 mg if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 10 days [^112nyLca]. For **enteric organisms**, use levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for 10 days or ofloxacin 300 mg PO BID for 10 days. **Supportive measures** — such as bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs — are also recommended [^115z4QsF] [^112DQcwx].

---

## Evidence regarding alendronate in acute epididymitis

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** [^116peCSC] [^112nyLca] for alendronate in acute epididymitis. Its mechanism of action does not address the underlying infectious or inflammatory processes [^112tJA7o], and it lacks antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to epididymitis [^1138g7iX].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Using alendronate for acute epididymitis carries unnecessary risks, including [^113cdCQh]:

- **Gastrointestinal irritation**: Esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and gastrointestinal discomfort [^1119xMb9] [^113cdCQh].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Severe bone, joint, or muscle pain [^1119xMb9].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Particularly in patients with predisposing conditions [^1119xMb9] [^111K4XYY].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Rare but serious complication [^1119xMb9] [^113cdCQh].

These risks **outweigh any hypothetical benefit**, given the lack of evidence for efficacy in this setting [^112nyLca].

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given the absence of evidence and guideline support, alendronate **should not be used** for acute epididymitis [^112nyLca] [^116viPZu]. Clinicians should adhere to established antibiotic regimens and supportive care tailored to the likely causative organisms and patient-specific factors [^1169FdTM].

---

Alendronate is **not indicated** for acute epididymitis [^112grdfc] due to its lack of antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity [^1138g7iX]. The condition should be managed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care [^112nyLca], and alendronate use in this context is not supported by clinical evidence or guidelines [^116peCSC].

### Fosamax [^1138g7iX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e. the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption is decreased.

Post-marketing experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of alendronate sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Body as a whole**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angioedema. Transient symptoms of myalgia, malaise, asthenia, and fever have been reported with alendronate, typically in association with the initiation of treatment. Symptomatic hypocalcemia has occurred, generally in association with predisposing conditions. Peripheral edema.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Esophagitis, esophageal erosions, esophageal ulcers, esophageal stricture or perforation, and oropharyngeal ulceration. Gastric or duodenal ulcers, some severe and with complications, have also been reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.3); Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dental**: Localized osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Musculoskeletal**: Bone, joint, and/or muscle pain, occasionally severe and incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]; joint swelling; low-energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Nervous system**: Dizziness and vertigo.

- **Pulmonary**: Acute asthma exacerbations.

- **Skin**: Rash (occasionally with photosensitivity), pruritus, alopecia, and severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of alendronate sodium PO (also known as Binosto, Fosamax):

- **Increased serum sodium**: Use caution in patients requiring sodium restriction, including those with a history of heart failure (HF), hypertension, or other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as alendronate effervescent tablets contain 650 mg of sodium.

- **Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Use caution in patients with poor oral hygiene, periodontal and/or other dental diseases, ill-fitting dentures, undergoing invasive dental procedures, having comorbid disorders (such as cancer, anemia, coagulopathy, infection), or receiving chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or angiogenesis inhibitors. Perform a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before initiating alendronate.

- **Musculoskeletal pain, atypical femoral fracture**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as alendronate has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Evaluate patients with new thigh or groin pain to rule out an incomplete femoral fracture. Consider discontinuing treatment.

- **Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, esophagitis, esophageal perforation**: Use caution in patients with active upper gastrointestinal diseases, including Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, gastritis, duodenitis, or peptic ulcers. Advise patients to take alendronate with an adequate amount of water and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes.

### Binosto [^114EXt8Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one-third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate sodium (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than what was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).

- **Fracture intervention trial (FIT)**: The FIT consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women. The Three-Year Study involved patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture, while the Four-Year Study included patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e. had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength, which increases the risk of fractures. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, with more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occurring annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, which has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period.

- **Discussion of management**: In this Beyond the Guidelines, two experts discuss the management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient. They address the role of bone density monitoring during and following a 5-year course of alendronate and provide treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after the 5-year course of alendronate.

### Bisphosphonates in renal osteodystrophy [^116WFbc5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The present review evaluates the role that bisphosphonates might play in patients with renal failure. Although bisphosphonates are commonly used to reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, few studies have documented their effect on patients with renal osteodystrophy. The review describes the pathogenesis of bone loss after renal transplantation and the role of the recently identified osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB system. Inhibition of bone resorption may be beneficial when high bone turnover is present. However, potential drawbacks exist with the widespread use of bisphosphonates. These issues are discussed, with an emphasis on reports published within the past 18 months.

Contraindications regarding the use of alendronate sodium PO (also known as Binosto, Fosamax):

- **Delayed esophageal emptying**: Do not use alendronate in patients with conditions delaying esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia, or in patients unable to sit upright for at least 30 minutes.

- **Hypocalcemia**: Correct hypocalcemia before initiating alendronate. Correct other mineral metabolism disturbances, including vitamin D deficiency, if present. Monitor serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia throughout treatment.

### Pamidronate disodium [^111YLiG6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of pamidronate disodium, approximately 20% were 65 and over, while approximately 15% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This approach reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as the presence of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Regarding medical management for acute epididymitis, particularly with antibiotic therapy, the IUSTI 2017 guidelines recommend initiating any of the following medications as second-line therapy for patients with sexually transmitted epididymo-orchitis:

- **Ofloxacin PO**: 200 mg BID for 14 days
- **Levofloxacin PO**: 500 mg once daily for 10 days.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^112j3t2g]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The marked expression of RANKL in the epithelia lining the epididymis, prostate gland, and seminal vesicle indicates that inhibition of extra-gonadal RANKL may influence reproductive function. RANK was also expressed in all organs lining the reproductive tract, while OPG was found in a few of the luminal epithelial cells of all organs lining the male reproductive tract. RANKL signaling may have a role in the epithelia but could also signal to the spermatozoa, as the expression of RANK and RANKL in spermatids and the acrosomal region of human spermatozoa supports a role during sperm maturation and possibly even during ejaculation.

However, Denosumab induced no change in intracellular calcium concentration, the progesterone response, or the acrosome reaction in human spermatozoa. This indicates that the possible role of RANKL in human spermatozoa may be different and could, in theory, be involved in binding to the epithelia of the female reproductive tract or the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. The 100-fold higher sRANKL concentration in seminal fluid compared with serum supports a biological role. It is plausible that RANKL is secreted, cleaved, or released from the epithelial cells in the reproductive tract under the control of local regulators, as there was no link between serum and seminal concentrations of sRANKL.

A biological role of seminal RANKL was indicated by the negative associations between seminal sRANKL concentrations and semen quality variables, including the total number of progressive motile sperm and the total number of morphologically normal sperm.

### A randomized double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of teriparatide [recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34)] with alendronate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113V7G65]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). High credibility.

Teriparatide (rDNA origin) injection [recombinant human PTH (1–34)] stimulates bone formation, increases bone mineral density (BMD), and restores bone architecture and integrity. In contrast, bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption and increase BMD. We compared the effects of teriparatide and alendronate sodium on BMD, nonvertebral fracture incidence, and bone turnover in 146 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomized to either once-daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide 40 micrograms plus oral placebo (n = 73) or oral alendronate 10 mg plus placebo injection (n = 73). The median duration of treatment was 14 months. At 3 months, teriparatide increased lumbar spine BMD significantly more than did alendronate (P < 0.001). Lumbar spine BMD increased by 12.2% in the teriparatide group and 5.6% in the alendronate group (P < 0.001 teriparatide vs. alendronate). Teriparatide increased femoral neck BMD and total body bone mineral significantly more than did alendronate, but BMD at the one-third distal radius decreased compared with alendronate (P ≤ 0.05). Nonvertebral fracture incidence was significantly lower in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated despite transient mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia with teriparatide treatment. In conclusion, teriparatide, a bone formation agent, increased BMD at most sites and decreased nonvertebral fractures more than alendronate.

### Role of bisphosphonates in prostate cancer [^1127JNyN]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the role of bisphosphonates in the long-term supportive care of patients with prostate cancer, an emerging medical challenge. Although the success of therapeutic options has extended the survival of patients with prostate cancer, they often develop skeletal morbidity from disease and treatment-related effects that undermine skeletal integrity.

- **Methods**: Studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings.

- **Results**: Low bone mass is prevalent in patients in early stages of prostate cancer, although the reasons for this correlation are unknown. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by either pharmaceutical (including hormonal) or surgical castration causes significant decreases in bone mineral density. Pamidronate has been shown to prevent bone loss, whereas zoledronic acid has been shown to increase bone mass in men undergoing ADT. Finally, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing objectively measurable skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer.

- **Conclusion**: Bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid in particular, have potent activities against osteoclasts, which affect bone integrity. Zoledronic acid has now become an additional option that can provide benefits to patients with prostate cancer throughout the course of their disease.

### Effect of oral alendronate on bone mineral density and the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study Group [^112sm93Z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1995). High credibility.

The Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study, published in 1995 in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigated postmenopausal osteoporosis. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the role of alendronate therapy in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis. The study population consisted of 994 female patients. Inclusion criteria required postmenopausal female patients with osteoporosis, while key exclusion criteria included treatments with corticosteroids, vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, active peptic ulcer disease, abnormal renal function, or abnormal hepatic function.

- **Interventions**:
	- Alendronate group (n = 526): Received 5 or 10 mg daily for three years, or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year.
	- Placebo group (n = 355): Received matching placebo.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in new vertebral fractures (3.2% vs. 6.2%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95) was observed.
	- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant decrease in the progression of vertebral deformities (33% vs. 41%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.51).

This study highlights the efficacy of alendronate in reducing fracture risk and progression of vertebral deformities in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^114Yt37K]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

RANKL signaling is notably present in the male reproductive tract and human spermatozoa. Interestingly, RANKL was abundantly expressed in the luminal cytoplasm of all human epididymal compartments, the prostate gland, and the seminal vesicle. The expression varied across different organs, with abundant expression in the luminal cytoplasm of the epithelial cells in the corpus, cauda epididymis, and prostate. RANK was also expressed in the caput and cauda epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle, with the strongest expression in the cauda epididymis. In contrast, OPG was expressed predominantly in the basal cells surrounding the luminal epithelial cells and in very few epithelial cells on the luminal side of the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle.

RANKL was also expressed in the acrosomal region of most human spermatozoa, suggesting a possible role in mature spermatozoa. Denosumab induced no change in intracellular calcium concentration in human spermatozoa and had no relevant effects on the subsequent progesterone response, which is an important stimulating signal during fertilization. Moreover, Denosumab had no effect compared with vehicle treatment on the acrosome reaction.

### Severely suppressed bone turnover: a potential complication of alendronate therapy [^116DRbTG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Alendronate, an inhibitor of bone resorption, is widely used in osteoporosis treatment. However, concerns have been raised about potential oversuppression of bone turnover during long-term use. We report on nine patients who sustained spontaneous nonspinal fractures while on alendronate therapy, six of whom displayed either delayed or absent fracture healing for 3 months to 2 years during therapy. Histomorphometric analysis of the cancellous bone showed markedly suppressed bone formation, with reduced or absent osteoblastic surface in most patients. Osteoclastic surface was low or low-normal in eight patients, and eroded surface was decreased in four. Matrix synthesis was markedly diminished, with absence of double-tetracycline label and absent or reduced single-tetracycline label in all patients. The same trend was seen in the intracortical and endocortical surfaces.

Our findings raise the possibility that severe suppression of bone turnover may develop during long-term alendronate therapy, resulting in increased susceptibility to, and delayed healing of, nonspinal fractures. Although coadministration of estrogen or glucocorticoids appears to be a predisposing factor, this apparent complication can also occur with monotherapy. Our observations emphasize the need for increased awareness and monitoring for the potential development of excessive suppression of bone turnover during long-term alendronate therapy.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-associated severe epididymo-orchitis [^116BEu2f]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his late 50s, with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and morbid obesity, presented to the hospital with complicated epididymo-orchitis. The onset of symptoms, including scrotal pain, erythema, and swelling, occurred after the use of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, for two months. His baseline antidiabetic medications were insulin, glipizide, and metformin. Initially, he experienced treatment failure of epididymo-orchitis with oral levofloxacin for three weeks, followed by two weeks of doxycycline therapy.

Upon presentation to the hospital, an ultrasound of the scrotum revealed a scrotal and right testicular abscess. The patient underwent a right inguinal orchiectomy. Postoperatively, pus culture was positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Candida glabrata; hence, he was treated with oral antibiotics, including high-dose antifungal medications. Adequate wound care and regular follow-up demonstrated the resolution of infection. This case highlights the risk of severe urogenital infection associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the context of uncontrolled T2DM.

### Are antibiotics necessary for pediatric epididymitis [^116sJFvD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the percentage of cases of epididymitis in pediatric patients that is of bacterial cause and to identify factors that predict a positive urine culture, we conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis in one pediatric emergency department over 11 years. Charts were reviewed for historical, physical, laboratory, and radiologic data. A positive urine culture was used to identify patients with a bacterial cause of epididymitis.

A total of 160 patient records were initially identified as having a diagnosis of epididymitis. Of these, 20 met exclusion criteria or did not have records available for review, and 140 cases of epididymitis were reviewed. Patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 17 years, with a median age of 11 years. Of these patients, 91% received empiric antibiotic therapy. Additionally, 97 of these patients (69%) had a urine culture sent, of whom 4 (4.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.1%-10.2%) were positive. Of the 4 positive urine cultures, 3 had organisms not sensitive to usual empiric therapy for urinary tract infections. The boys with positive urine cultures were not significantly different from the other patients in terms of age, maximum temperature, or number of white blood cells on urinalysis.

Given the low incidence of urinary tract infections in boys with epididymitis, in prepubertal patients, antibiotic therapy can be reserved for young infants and those with pyuria or positive urine cultures.

### Antibiotic regimens and intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli [^111wtewj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The intestinal tract serves as a significant reservoir for antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobacteriaceae species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The selective pressure exerted by antibiotics plays a crucial role in the emergence and dissemination of these pathogens. Many classes of antibiotics can promote intestinal colonization by healthcare-associated gram-negative bacilli due to their multidrug resistance.

While antibiotics may inhibit colonization by gram-negative pathogens that remain susceptible, the benefits of this effect are often limited because of the emergence of resistance. Alterations in antibiotic formularies and standard infection control measures have proven effective in controlling outbreaks of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Further research is necessary to clarify the role of strategies such as selective decontamination of the digestive tract, as well as the decontamination of environmental surfaces and patients' skin and wounds.

### Epididymitis after prostate brachytherapy [^114xcAV4]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To analyze the incidence, time-course, and potential predisposing factors for what was clinically diagnosed as postimplant epididymitis, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Of 517 patients randomized and treated on two treatment protocols, with a planned total accrual of 1200, five patients were identified who developed clinically diagnosed epididymitis after iodine-125 or palladium-103 prostate brachytherapy. Implants were performed using standard techniques and a modified peripheral loading pattern. Perioperative antibiotics (cefazolin and ciprofloxacin) were administered to 258 patients per physician preference. Treatment-related morbidity was monitored through mailed questionnaires, utilizing standard American Urological Association (AUA) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients who did not respond to the mailed questionnaires were interviewed by telephone. Although the patients were not queried specifically regarding epididymitis, its occurrence was noted during follow-up examinations.

- **Results**: Postimplant epididymitis occurred in five (1%) of 517 consecutive brachytherapy patients. None of these five patients had a prior history of orchitis, epididymitis, vasectomy, or preimplant catheterization. The symptoms of epididymitis first appeared at 4, 7, 10, 150, and 300 days after implantation. Patients with epididymitis had prostate volumes, preimplant AUA scores, and ages typical of other implant patients. No association was apparent between postimplant epididymitis and the degree of implant-related prostate swelling.

### Binosto [^113ZH4jm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted with once-weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg, enrolling a total of 167 men between the ages of 38 and 91 (mean age 66). Patients in the study had either: 1) a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, 2) a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the lumbar spine and less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck, or 3) a baseline osteoporotic fracture and a BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At one year, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate sodium 70 mg once weekly were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 2.8%; femoral neck, 1.9%; trochanter, 2.0%; and total body, 1.2%. These increases in BMD were similar to those observed at one year in the alendronate sodium 10 mg once-daily study.

BMD responses in both studies were similar regardless of age (greater than or equal to 65 years vs. less than 65 years), gonadal function (baseline testosterone less than 9 ng/dL vs. greater than or equal to 9 ng/dL), or baseline BMD (femoral neck and lumbar spine T-score less than or equal to -2.5 vs. greater than -2.5).

### Ibandronate sodium [^112yZ62i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of ibandronate sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Renal toxicity**: Acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Osteonecrosis of the jaw and other oro-facial sites, including the external auditory canal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Atypical femoral shaft fracture**: Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Eye inflammation**: Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued.

### Early use of alendronate as a protective factor against the development of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in childhood-onset rheumatic diseases: A cross-sectional study [^1139kA8V]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Among the participants treated with alendronate, the period between the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and alendronate therapy was significantly shorter in patients without bone loss (p = 0.02). The proportion of patients who received alendronate within 3 months after initiating glucocorticoid therapy was significantly greater among those without bone loss (90.0%) compared to those with bone loss (37.5%, p = 0.04). In contrast, the weekly dose per body surface area and the length of alendronate therapy did not differ markedly between the groups. Among patients who received alendronate within 3 months of glucocorticoid therapy initiation, the presence of bone loss was significantly lower, and the LS BMD Z-score was significantly higher, compared to those who received alendronate more than 3 months after glucocorticoid therapy initiation. Due to the absence of participants with osteoporosis among the alendronate-treated individuals, we could not evaluate the risk factors for osteoporosis development in this population.

### The effects of parathyroid hormone, alendronate, or both in men with osteoporosis [^111Z1Dox]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Because parathyroid hormone increases both bone formation and bone resorption, it is possible that combining parathyroid hormone with an antiresorptive agent will enhance its effect on bone mineral density.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 83 men who were 46 to 85 years of age and had low bone density to receive alendronate (10 mg daily; 28 men), parathyroid hormone (40 microg subcutaneously daily; 27 men), or both (28 men). Alendronate therapy was given for 30 months; parathyroid hormone therapy was begun at month 6. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, radial shaft, and total body was measured every six months using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was measured at baseline and month 30 by means of quantitative computed tomography. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were measured every six months. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in the bone mineral density at the posteroanterior spine.

- **Results**: The bone mineral density at the lumbar spine increased significantly more in men treated with parathyroid hormone alone than in those in the other groups (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The bone mineral density at the femoral neck increased significantly more in the parathyroid hormone group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.001) or the combination-therapy group (P = 0.01). The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased significantly more in the combination-therapy group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.001). At 12 months, changes in the serum alkaline phosphatase…

### Alendronate reduces periprosthetic bone loss after uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty: A prospective randomized study [^113BzUwN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2001). Low credibility.

Periprosthetic bone loss, especially in the proximal part of the femur, is common after cemented and uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA). Bone loss can be progressive and, in the extreme, may threaten the survival of the prosthesis. To study whether alendronate therapy can reduce bone loss adjacent to prostheses, 13 uncemented primary THA patients were randomized to the study. They received 10 mg of alendronate plus 500 mg of calcium (n = 8) or 500 mg of calcium only (n = 5) daily for a 6-month follow-up after THA. Periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

Decreases in periprosthetic BMD in the alendronate-treated group were lower compared to the changes in the calcium-only group in the same regions of interest at the same follow-up time. In the proximal femur, the mean BMD decrease was 17.1% in the calcium-only group, whereas in the alendronate-treated group, the decrease was only 0.9% (p = 0.019). The mean periprosthetic BMD change was also significantly different in the total periprosthetic area between the study groups at the end of the follow-up (calcium-only group -9.9% vs. alendronate-treated group -2.6%; p = 0.019).

Alendronate therapy led to a significant reduction in periprosthetic bone loss after primary uncemented THA compared to the changes found in patients without therapy. This kind of bone response may improve the support of the prosthesis and may result in better survival of the prosthesis. However, the study's follow-up time was too short, and the study population was too small to make any long-term conclusions.

### Epididymitis: An overview [^114piZPz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the epididymis, known as epididymitis, is commonly observed in outpatient settings. The etiology and treatment are influenced by the patient's age and the likely causative organisms. Epididymitis typically presents as a gradual onset of posterior scrotal pain, which may be accompanied by urinary symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency. Physical examination usually reveals a swollen and tender epididymis, with the testis in a normal anatomical position.

Although the etiology is largely unknown, reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts is considered the most common cause of epididymitis in children under 14 years of age. In sexually active males aged 14 to 35, the most common pathogens are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. For this age group, the recommended treatment is a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone followed by 10 days of oral doxycycline.

- **Men practicing insertive anal intercourse**: An enteric organism is also likely, and the combination of ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral levofloxacin or ofloxacin is the suggested treatment.

- **Men over 35 years**: Epididymitis is usually caused by enteric bacteria transported by reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts secondary to bladder outlet obstruction. In such cases, levofloxacin or ofloxacin alone is sufficient to treat the infection.

Recognizing and promptly treating epididymitis is crucial, as untreated acute epididymitis can lead to infertility and chronic scrotal pain, thereby reducing patient morbidity.

### Case report on secondary testicular necrosis due to fulminant epididymitis: Ultrasonographic evaluation and diagnosis [^111DXEzz]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common condition with possible severe complications. If epididymitis is suspected, we suggest starting medical treatment promptly. In our experience, scrotal ultrasound should be performed for the diagnosis of epididymitis and orchitis and should be repeated if there is a suspicion of doubtful blood supply to the testicle. This case provides the first clinical evidence to support associated funiculitis in this disease. Also, this case stresses the usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of testicular necrosis secondary to epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis.

### Kit for the preparation of technetium Tc 99m medronate [^114XkU1Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient. Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection, as well as other radioactive drugs, must be handled with care. Appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and clinical personnel in line with proper patient management.

To minimize radiation dose to the bladder, patients should be encouraged to drink fluids and void immediately before the examination and as often thereafter as possible for the next 4 to 6 hours. Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection should be formulated within six hours prior to clinical use for optimal imaging results, which are obtained 1 to 4 hours after administration.

The finding of an abnormal concentration of radioactivity implies the existence of underlying pathology; however, further study is required to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Image quality may be adversely affected by obesity, old age, or impaired renal function.

The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Consequently, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used.

### Alendronate inhibits bone resorption at the bone-screw interface [^1121W4BQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

In the study, we investigated whether the systemic administration of alendronate, a third-generation bisphosphonate, suppressed the loosening of screws at the bone-screw interface. We systemically administered alendronate to rats fitted with external fixators. External fixators with two half pins were applied to the right femurs of rats, and alendronate was administered once a week during a 5-week postoperative period. Radiographic, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings were subsequently analyzed. Treatment with alendronate reduced the width of the fibrous loosening membrane and the number of osteoclasts at the bone-screw interface. These findings indicate that systemic treatment with alendronate exerts an inhibitory effect on local bone resorption at the bone-screw interface.

### Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview [^112P6Kr4]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Epididymitis and orchitis are commonly seen in the outpatient setting. Men between 14 and 35 years of age are most often affected, and *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* are the most common pathogens in this age group. In other age groups, coliform bacteria are the primary pathogens. Men with epididymitis and orchitis typically present with a gradual onset of scrotal pain and symptoms of lower urinary tract infection, including fever. This presentation helps differentiate epididymitis and orchitis from testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Typical physical findings include a swollen, tender epididymis or testis located in the normal anatomic position with an intact ipsilateral cremasteric reflex.

Laboratory studies, including urethral Gram stain, urinalysis and culture, and polymerase chain reaction assay for *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae*, help guide therapy. Initial outpatient therapy is empirical and targets the most common pathogens. When *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* are suspected, ceftriaxone and doxycycline are recommended. When coliform bacteria are suspected, ofloxacin or levofloxacin is recommended.

### Binosto [^112tJA7o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in the bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e. the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption is decreased.

### Ibandronate sodium [^117W9t3j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The recommended dose is 3 mg every 3 months, administered intravenously over 15 to 30 seconds.

- **Dosing instructions**: Only administer intravenously by a healthcare professional. Do not mix with calcium-containing solutions or other intravenously administered drugs. Ensure administration does not exceed once every 3 months. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate.

- **Important administration instructions**: Appropriate medical support and monitoring should be available when administering ibandronate sodium injection. Discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment if anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Before administration, visually inspect the prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration; do not use if either is present. Use only the enclosed needle and discard any unused portion. Prefilled syringes are for single-dose only.

- **Laboratory testing and oral examination prior to administration**: Prior to administration of each dose, obtain necessary testing and evaluations.

### Alendronate does not interfere with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scanning [^11119bLS]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Several studies have found that administration of etidronate results in competitive interference with 99mTc-labeled bone scanning reagents. In contrast, other studies have not encountered this problem with other bisphosphonates.

- **Methods**: We prospectively studied 9 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scanning was performed before they received alendronate, and scanning was repeated a mean of 16.6 days afterward, when the patients had been receiving 40 mg alendronate daily for a mean of 6 days. Additionally, 7 patients who underwent delayed scanning, having taken alendronate for a mean of 111 days, were also restudied. Quantitative whole-body bone scanning was performed, and radioactivity deposited in the bone metastasis was determined using region-of-interest analysis.

- **Results**: A less than 6% increase in whole-body retention of 99mTc-MDP was observed on the initial post-alendronate scan compared with the baseline scan. No significant differences in activity were seen in the bone lesion evaluated on the baseline and initial post-alendronate studies. The delayed post-alendronate scan generally showed similar or higher tracer accumulation compared with the baseline scan.

- **Conclusion**: Alendronate did not competitively inhibit uptake of 99mTc-MDP in the skeleton or tumor metastasis. The use of alendronate before bone scanning is unlikely to result in decreased detection of lesions or falsely decreased 99mTc-MDP activity at metastatic bone tumor sites.

The impact of two osteoclast inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, alendronate (ALN) and denosumab (DMAB), was examined during fracture healing. Male human RANKL knock-in mice that express a chimeric (human/murine) form of RANKL received unilateral transverse femur fractures. Mice were treated biweekly with ALN (0.1 mg/kg), DMAB (10 mg/kg), or PBS (control, 0.1 ml) until death at 21 and 42 days after fracture.

Treatment efficacy was assessed by serum levels of TRACP 5b, showing almost a complete elimination of TRACP 5b levels in the DMAB-treated animals but only approximately 25% reduction of serum levels in the ALN-treated mice. Mechanical testing showed that fractured femurs from both ALN and DMAB groups had significantly increased mechanical properties at day 42 compared with controls. μCT analysis showed that callus tissues from DMAB-treated mice had significantly greater percent bone volume and BMD than both control and ALN-treated tissues at both 21 and 42 days, whereas ALN-treated bones only had greater percent bone volume and BMC than control at 42 days.

Qualitative histological analysis showed that the 21- and 42-day ALN and DMAB groups had greater amounts of unresorbed cartilage or mineralized cartilage matrix compared with the controls, whereas unresorbed cartilage could still be seen in the DMAB groups at 42 days after fracture. Although ALN and DMAB delayed the removal of cartilage and the remodeling of the fracture callus, this did not diminish the mechanical integrity of the fractured bones.

### Binosto [^111dUwLd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Binosto (alendronate sodium) is a bisphosphonate that acts as a specific inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that bind to the hydroxyapatite found in bone.

Alendronate sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic acid, monosodium salt, trihydrate. The molecular formula of alendronate sodium is C4H12NNaO7P2•3H2O, and its molecular weight is 325.12. It is a white or almost white crystalline powder, soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in methylene chloride.

Binosto is available for oral administration as an effervescent tablet formulation that must be dissolved in water before use. Each individual tablet contains 91.37 mg of alendronate sodium, which is equivalent to 70 mg of free alendronic acid. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: monosodium citrate anhydrous, citric acid anhydrous, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate anhydrous as buffering agents, strawberry flavor, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose.

Once the effervescent tablet is dissolved in water, the alendronate sodium is present in a citrate-buffered solution.

### Bone health in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: the role of bisphosphonates [^112GcehB]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Androgen-deprivation therapy, a mainstay in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, is associated with significant bone loss and related complications, such as fractures. Bisphosphonates, which are osteoclast inhibitors, are effective in preventing skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and also in preventing bone loss in patients with locally advanced disease. Understanding the management of bone health, including identifying patients at risk, determining the most appropriate therapy, and monitoring and managing side effects, is critical. This review provides the most recent bone health risk factor and bisphosphonate data available for prostate cancer patients.

### Binosto [^113UoHtP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of alendronate sodium, 10 mg once daily, on bone mineral density (BMD) was demonstrated in postmenopausal women aged 44 to 84 years with osteoporosis. The studies showed lumbar spine BMD of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean. This was shown in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of 2 or 3 years' duration.

Figure 2 illustrates the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate sodium 10 mg/day, relative to placebo-treated patients, at three years for each study.

At 3 years, significant increases in BMD, relative to both baseline and placebo, were observed at each measurement site in all studies for patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, indicating that the increases in bone mass in the spine and hip did not compromise other skeletal sites. These increases in BMD were evident as early as 3 months and continued throughout the 3 years of treatment. (See figures below for lumbar spine results.)

In the 2-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter, with absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5 being 0.94% and 0.88% respectively. BMD at the femoral neck, forearm, and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied.

### Evaluating the necessity of antibiotics in the treatment of acute epididymitis in pediatric patients: A literature review of retrospective studies and data analysis [^112nh3kZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

This literature review and data analysis aims to evaluate the percentage of pediatric patients with acute epididymitis found to have bacterial etiology and the percentage of patients in these studies that were treated with antibiotic therapy versus conservative therapy.

- **Methods**: A search of EBSCO through January 13, 2016, using the keywords epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis and child, children, or pediatric, identified 542 potential studies. Twenty-seven retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria, containing patients aged 21 years or younger with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis. The number and age of patients, urine cultures and urinalysis results, number of patients treated with antibiotics, and incidence were extracted.

- **Results**: A total of 1,496 patients with acute epididymitis were identified. A urinalysis was obtained for 1,124 patients, and 190 (16.9%) were positive. A urine culture was obtained for 670 patients, and 100 (14.9%) were positive. Fourteen studies addressed antibiotic administration wherein 652 patients were with acute epididymitis and 554 (85%) received antibiotics. Of 502 patients with urinalysis results, urine culture results, and antibiotic treatment rates, 54 (10.8%) were positive for a bacterial source. Antibiotics were administered to 410 (81.7%) of these 502 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Practitioners should consider only prescribing antibiotics to patients with acute epididymitis if there is an abnormal urinalysis or urine culture.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute onset of scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies, including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as six hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The patient with chronic epididymitis: Characterization of an enigmatic syndrome [^117FykPe]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

We provide a baseline description of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, explore relevant associations that may be important etiological factors, and suggest a classification system and specific symptom assessment tool.

- **Materials and methods**: Men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, defined as symptoms of discomfort or pain for at least 3 months in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis, localized to one or both epididymides on clinical examination, completed an extensive specific clinical inventory questionnaire. Evaluation included demographics, clinical history, duration since diagnosis, associated and previous clinical associations, frequency and severity of prostatitis, voiding and sexual symptoms, specific and general quality of life, and history of investigation and/or treatment for the condition. Volunteers with no history of chronic epididymitis completed similar clinical inventory questionnaires.

- **Results**: A total of 50 consecutive men aged 21 to 83 years (average age 46) diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, with an average symptom duration of 4.9 years (range 0.25 to 29 years), were enrolled in the study. The average pain score, plus or minus standard deviation, was 4.7 ± 2.1 (range 0 to 10). Of the men, 16% were reasonably satisfied with their quality of life. Although 66% of the patients thought about the symptoms some or a lot, in only 30% did symptoms prevent them from engaging in their usual activities. The most common therapies reported by the patients were antibiotics (74%).

### Randomized trial of effect of alendronate continuation versus discontinuation in women with low BMD: Results from the Fracture Intervention Trial long-term extension [^116LuYtv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of alendronate on BMD and markers of bone turnover, we conducted an extension trial in which 1,099 older women who received alendronate in the FIT were re-randomized to alendronate or placebo. Compared with women who stopped alendronate, those continuing alendronate for 3 years maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing the benefit of continued treatment. However, among women who discontinued alendronate and took placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher, and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline, showing persistence of alendronate's effects on bone.

- **Introduction**: Prior trials, including the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), have found that therapy with alendronate increases BMD and decreases fracture risk for up to 4 years in postmenopausal women with low BMD. However, it is uncertain whether further therapy with alendronate results in preservation or further gains in BMD and if skeletal effects of alendronate continue after treatment is stopped.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a follow-up placebo-controlled extension trial to FIT (FIT long-term extension [FLEX]) in which 1,099 women aged 60–86 years who were assigned to alendronate in FIT, with an average duration of use of 5 years, were re-randomized for an additional 5 years to alendronate or placebo. The results of a preplanned interim analysis at 3 years are reported herein. Participants were re-randomized to alendronate 10 mg/day (30%), alendronate 5 mg/day (30%), or placebo (40%).

### The utility of scrotal ultrasonography in the emergent setting: beyond epididymitis versus torsion [^113baDKy]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Scrotal pain is a common acute presentation for medical care. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are two diagnoses for which early detection is critical, and their sonographic imaging features have been thoroughly described in the radiologic literature. However, there are other important conditions that radiologists must be aware of, which have received less attention. This article highlights key traumatic and non-traumatic causes of acute scrotal pain, other than testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis, that may present in the emergency department setting.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^116JMJMv]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

RANKL, RANK, and OPG are expressed in the testis of mice, and inhibition of RANKL increases testicular weight and sperm count. RANKL, RANK, and OPG were detected in the mouse testis and epididymis at 16–18 weeks of age (Fig. 1a–d; Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). RANKL was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm/membrane of mature Sertoli cells co-expressing SOX9 in the nuclei (Fig. 1a). RANKL expression was also detected in the cytoplasm of most spermatocytes and some spermatids, but not in spermatogonia (Fig. 1a, d; Supplementary Fig. 1a). RANK was expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of the VASA-positive germ cells, particularly spermatogonia and spermatids, and in some spermatocytes (Fig. 1b, d; Supplementary Fig. 1a). OPG was expressed in the cytoplasm of most spermatogonia, the junction between peritubular cells and spermatogonia, spermatids, and some peritubular cells (Fig. 1c, d). In the epididymis, RANKL was markedly expressed in the caput, while being undetectable or with low RANKL expression in the corpus and cauda epididymis. RANK and OPG were also expressed in the epididymis, and the expression varied in the different segments (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

To manipulate gonadal cell–cell signaling of RANKL, the RANKL inhibitor OPG (1 mg/kg) was injected twice a week for two or five weeks into C57BL/6 mice. OPG treatment for two weeks significantly increased testicular weight and germ cell epithelial height of seminiferous tubules at stage VII–VIII when compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 2a). Two weeks of OPG treatment also increased sperm count.

### Epididymitis: An overview [^1173XH2k]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute epididymitis:

- **Definition**: Acute epididymitis is the acute inflammation of the epididymis characterized by pain and scrotal swelling present for less than six weeks.

- **Pathophysiology**: Acute epididymitis is caused by a bacterial ascent (urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted infections), viral genesis (adenovirus, enterovirus), fungi (Candida albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum), and parasites (Trichomonas vaginalis, Schistosoma species, Filariasis). Other causes include drug-induced inflammation (amiodarone), rheumatic conditions (Behçet's disease, vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura), obstruction (vasectomy), genital trauma, and sterile reflux.

- **Disease course**: The inflammation of the epididymis results in acute epididymitis, causing clinical manifestations of gradual unilateral scrotal pain and epididymal swelling, accompanied by symptoms of fever, hematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency. Disease progression may lead to abscess formation, Fournier gangrene, infertility, and chronic pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute epididymitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### The role of bisphosphonates in the management of metastatic prostate cancer [^112jVaW1]. Current Oncology Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Most men with advanced prostate cancer primarily have skeletal metastases, which are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer. Although bone lesions appear osteoblastic in radiographic images, recent evidence has demonstrated that anti-osteoclast therapy with bisphosphonates reduces skeletal-related complications in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This observation may be explained by the finding that osteoclast activity is greatly upregulated even in osteoblastic metastases.

Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy, the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, leads to increased bone resorption and reduces bone mineral density. These effects can be ameliorated, and potentially completely prevented, by coadministration of bisphosphonates. These findings may indicate a role for bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer even before the development of skeletal metastases. Determination of whether such early therapy ultimately results in delayed time to skeletal progression or improved survival will require large randomized studies.

### Efficacy of alendronate in the treatment of low bone density in the pediatric and young adult population [^116FPq8S]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Pediatric osteoporosis is uncommon but can result in painful and debilitating insufficiency fractures. Treatment options for osteoporosis in children are limited. Bisphosphonate therapy for children has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, but its use in this population has been increasing. Randomized controlled studies have not been conducted due to the small subject pool and the challenge of randomizing a child with an insufficiency fracture to a placebo arm of a study. This retrospective case-control study of a pediatric population with primarily neuromuscular disease was conducted to review changes in bone mineral density as reflected by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.

- **Methods**: Medical records and DXA scans were screened to identify children with low bone density who had been treated with alendronate, as well as similar control subjects with low bone density for their age who had not received alendronate. Medication acquisition was confirmed by refill records, and cumulative exposure was calculated. Interval DXA scans were reviewed to correlate bone mineral density change in grams per square centimeter, as well as the percent change and percent change over time, for both alendronate-treated and control subjects.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight alendronate-treated subjects and thirty control subjects met the inclusion criteria. No significant improvement in bone mineral density was observed in the alendronate-treated subjects compared with the control subjects. Some patients in both groups exhibited marked improvement, with…

### Therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 35 milligrams once weekly and 5 milligrams daily in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vmkcz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared with alendronate 5 mg daily in the prevention of osteoporosis, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy and safety of treatment with alendronate 35 mg once weekly (n = 362) and alendronate 5 mg daily (n = 361) in a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women (6 months or greater), aged 40–70 years, with lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density T-scores between -2.5 and 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparability of lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, defined by strict prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: Mean increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months were equivalent. The difference between the alendronate 35 mg once-weekly group and the alendronate 5 mg daily group [90% confidence interval] at month 12 was -0.3% [-0.6, 0.1], well within the prespecified bounds of ± 1.0%. Bone mineral density increases at other skeletal sites and effects on bone turnover were also virtually identical for the two dosing regimens. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, and the larger weekly unit dose was not associated with an increased frequency of upper gastrointestinal events.

- **Conclusion**: Alendronate 35 mg once weekly is therapeutically equivalent to alendronate 5 mg daily and provides patients with greater dosing convenience, in addition to the proven efficacy of alendronate and good tolerability.
