## Question

Should cirrhosis patients be restricted on sodium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with cirrhosis should be restricted on sodium, and if so, how much and in what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, distinguishing compensated cirrhosis without ascites from decompensated cirrhosis with ascites or volume overload. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for sodium restriction in each scenario. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including randomized trials and observational data, to ensure the guidance is supported. After that, I need to consider special populations such as those with sarcopenia, frailty, or hyponatremia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized recommendation and outline monitoring and safety checks, including when to liberalize sodium for nutrition while balancing ascites control.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the answer hinges on whether ascites or clinically significant volume overload is present. In compensated cirrhosis without ascites, routine sodium restriction is not recommended, whereas in decompensated cirrhosis with ascites or hepatic hydrothorax, moderate sodium restriction is a core component of therapy alongside diuretics, so I need to keep that distinction front and center [^113o4iib] [^112E82xt] [^111Dhgxj].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus for patients with ascites or volume overload. AASLD recommends moderate sodium restriction to about 2 g/day (90 mmol/day) in patients with grade 2 ascites, typically implemented with spironolactone with or without furosemide, and continued in refractory ascites to slow accumulation of fluid, which aligns with BASL/BSG and EASL guidance for 80–120 mmol/day sodium intake with a no-added-salt approach and avoidance of pre-prepared meals [^113o4iib] [^112QsiRS] [^111nvHCi] [^112E82xt] [^116df35D]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance here: some summaries equate this to 5–6.5 g/day of salt, but that 5–6.5 g figure refers to grams of salt, not grams of sodium; the sodium target remains about 2 g/day, so I need to be precise in counseling to avoid confusion [^111nvHCi] [^112E82xt].

> I will now examine the evidence base to ensure this moderate approach is justified. Wait, let me verify the concern about overly strict restriction: multiple studies and guideline syntheses show that severe sodium restriction below about 5 g/day salt worsens caloric intake, increases sarcopenia, and may be associated with higher mortality, whereas moderate restriction achieves fluid control without the same nutritional penalty, supporting the 2 g/day sodium target rather than stricter cutoffs [^111Dhgxj] [^112auaBn] [^114anBhj] [^114pdNcB]. I should double-check that these findings are reflected in contemporary guidance; indeed, AASLD and AGA emphasize individualized restriction and dietitian-led education to preserve nutrition while controlling ascites, which matches the evidence signal that extreme restriction can be harmful [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP] [^112crA1i].

> But wait, what if there is no ascites at all. Let me reconsider: in compensated cirrhosis without ascites, major guidelines find little to no evidence supporting routine sodium restriction, so sodium counseling should be moderate and focused on general health rather than strict restriction, which avoids unnecessary dietary limitations that could impair nutrition and quality of life [^111Dhgxj].

> Now, I need to consider special populations, particularly those with sarcopenia or frailty. I should confirm whether sodium restriction can be liberalized to protect intake. AASLD explicitly recommends considering liberalization of sodium restriction in patients with frailty or sarcopenia who cannot meet nutritional targets on a sodium-restricted diet, and to pair this with strategies to improve palatability and protein/calorie intake, ideally with dietitian support [^114VcDug] [^112jJzu3] [^113HDZcP]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: restricted diets reduce palatability and can lower daily calories by roughly 20% and depress protein intake, so a more permissive sodium ceiling may be necessary to preserve lean mass and function in these patients [^113HDZcP] [^114anBhj].

> Next, I should review hyponatremia management because it intersects with sodium and fluid handling. Fluid restriction, not just sodium restriction, becomes important when serum sodium is 125 mmol/L or lower. For mild hyponatremia, monitoring and selective water restriction are reasonable, whereas moderate to severe hyponatremia warrants tighter fluid restriction and careful adjustment of diuretics, with albumin and, in select cases, vaptans considered for refractory cases while avoiding overly rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination [^111vYDb9] [^116D5tVF] [^112jDJSM] [^112qX5xP]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating sodium and fluid restriction: sodium restriction helps negative sodium balance and ascites control, while fluid restriction addresses free-water excess in hypervolemic hyponatremia, and both may be needed when sodium is low [^111vYDb9] [^116D5tVF].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, but I should double-check the units and targets to avoid errors. For patients with cirrhosis and clinically significant ascites or volume overload, prescribe moderate sodium restriction targeting about 2 g/day sodium (approximately 90 mmol/day), translated as a no-added-salt diet with avoidance of pre-prepared and highly processed foods, and implement this alongside diuretics, typically spironolactone with or without furosemide, with dose titration based on weight, urine output, and electrolytes, and with early dietitian involvement to sustain protein and calorie intake [^113o4iib] [^112QsiRS] [^111nvHCi] [^112E82xt] [^112crA1i]. Hold on, I should verify that the sodium target is not misstated as 5–6.5 g/day; that range refers to grams of salt and corresponds to roughly 2–2.6 g of sodium, so counseling should explicitly specify grams of sodium to prevent inadvertent overtreatment [^111nvHCi] [^112E82xt].

> For patients without ascites, I should confirm we are not over-restricting. No routine sodium restriction is recommended; instead, provide general nutrition counseling with attention to overall diet quality, and reserve sodium restriction for if and when ascites or volume overload develops, which avoids compromising nutrition in compensated disease [^111Dhgxj].

> I need to ensure individualized adjustments are built into the plan. If a patient screens positive for sarcopenia or frailty and cannot meet nutritional goals on a 2 g/day sodium diet, consider liberalizing sodium toward 3 g/day while prioritizing high-protein intake and palatability strategies, and document the rationale and monitoring plan, consistent with AASLD guidance to liberalize as needed to protect intake [^114VcDug] [^113HDZcP]. But wait, what if ascites worsens after liberalization. I should verify natriuresis and adherence using 24-hour urine sodium when feasible or spot urine Na/K ratio to distinguish inadequate diuresis from dietary indiscretion, and then adjust diuretics rather than reflexively tightening sodium below what the patient can sustain nutritionally [^1163W3bL] [^115455tV].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety to avoid common pitfalls. Track daily weights with a reasonable diuretic target of 0.5–1 kg/day weight loss if edema is present, check serum creatinine and sodium frequently during diuretic initiation and titration, and watch for renal dysfunction, encephalopathy, or muscle cramps that may necessitate dose reduction or holding diuretics, aligning with AASLD best practices [^111Ut9Le] [^115455tV]. I should confirm the hyponatremia thresholds: if sodium drops to 120–125 mmol/L, tighten fluid restriction and reassess diuretics; if below 120 mmol/L, institute stricter fluid restriction and consider albumin and other measures with close monitoring to avoid overcorrection [^116D5tVF] [^112qX5xP].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, patients with cirrhosis and ascites or volume overload should have sodium restricted, but the restriction should be moderate at about 2 g/day sodium alongside diuretics and dietitian-led nutrition to balance ascites control with preservation of muscle mass and function, whereas patients without ascites should not have routine sodium restriction, and those with sarcopenia or frailty may require liberalization to protect intake, with ongoing reassessment of response and tolerability [^113o4iib] [^111Dhgxj] [^114VcDug] [^112crA1i].

Cirrhosis patients with **ascites** should follow a **moderate sodium restriction** of 2 g/day (88 mmol/day) [^114jpGc3] [^11343XLT] to control fluid retention and reduce the need for paracentesis [^115LFkuj]. Strict sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) is not recommended [^111Dhgxj] because it can worsen malnutrition and sarcopenia [^115LFkuj] without improving outcomes [^111Dhgxj]. Patients without ascites do not require routine sodium restriction [^111Dhgxj], but a general low-sodium diet is reasonable for cardiovascular health. Sodium restriction should be individualized, especially in those with sarcopenia or malnutrition [^112jJzu3], and paired with nutritional counseling to maintain adequate protein and calorie intake [^113HDZcP].

---

## Rationale for sodium restriction in cirrhosis

Sodium restriction is a cornerstone of ascites management because cirrhosis causes **sodium retention and fluid overload** via activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system [^115455tV]. Limiting sodium reduces fluid accumulation, improves comfort, and decreases the need for paracentesis [^116df35D].

---

## Evidence supporting sodium restriction

Multiple guidelines recommend **moderate sodium restriction** for patients with ascites:

- **AASLD 2021**: Moderate sodium restriction (2 g/day) with diuretics is first-line for grade 2 ascites [^114sSMDj].
- **EASL 2018**: Moderate sodium restriction (80–120 mmol/day, 4.6–6.9 g salt/day) for moderate, uncomplicated ascites [^112E82xt].
- **BASL/BSG 2021**: Moderate sodium restriction (≤ 5–6.5 g/day salt) for ascites [^1111Hdv3].

These recommendations are supported by studies showing that moderate sodium restriction improves ascites control and reduces paracentesis frequency [^111Dhgxj].

---

## Risks and drawbacks of sodium restriction

While sodium restriction helps control ascites, **excessive restriction can cause harm**:

- **Malnutrition and sarcopenia**: Strict sodium restriction can reduce appetite and caloric intake, worsening malnutrition and sarcopenia [^112auaBn] [^114anBhj].
- **Increased mortality**: Observational data link strict sodium restriction to higher mortality, possibly via malnutrition and sarcopenia [^115LFkuj] [^114pdNcB].
- **Compliance issues**: Strict sodium restriction is hard to sustain, leading to poor adherence and limited long-term benefit [^111Dhgxj].

---

## Individualized approach to sodium restriction

Given these risks, sodium restriction should be **individualized**, balancing ascites control with nutritional status [^112jJzu3]. The AASLD recommends liberalizing sodium restriction in patients with sarcopenia or malnutrition who cannot meet nutritional targets on a restricted diet [^113HDZcP].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with sodium restriction

Studies show that moderate sodium restriction improves ascites control and reduces paracentesis needs, but **strict restriction does not improve survival** and may increase mortality, particularly in patients with malnutrition or sarcopenia [^111Dhgxj] [^114anBhj].

---

## Current clinical guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation on sodium restriction** |
|-|-|
| AASLD 2021 | Moderate sodium restriction (2 g/day) for ascites; liberalize if malnutrition or sarcopenia [^113o4iib] [^114VcDug] |
| EASL 2018 | Moderate sodium restriction (80–120 mmol/day) for moderate ascites [^112E82xt] |
| BASL/BSG 2021 | Moderate sodium restriction (≤ 5–6.5 g/day salt) for ascites [^1111Hdv3] |

---

## Practical dietary recommendations

Practical dietary counseling should emphasize:

- **Moderate sodium intake**: Aim for 2 g/day (88 mmol/day) [^113gM7bL].
- **Avoid high-sodium foods**: Limit processed, pre-cooked, and restaurant foods [^112E82xt].
- **Maintain adequate nutrition**: Ensure sufficient protein and calorie intake to prevent malnutrition and sarcopenia [^115EECBa].
- **Individualize dietary plans**: Adjust restriction based on nutritional status, adherence, and clinical response [^113HDZcP].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular monitoring of weight, serum electrolytes, renal function, and nutritional status is essential. Sodium restriction should be adjusted based on clinical response, adherence, and nutritional parameters [^113HDZcP].

---

## Special considerations

- **Refractory ascites**: Continue moderate sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) to reduce fluid accumulation [^116df35D].
- **Hyponatremia**: Fluid restriction is indicated for moderate to severe hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 125 mmol/L) [^111vYDb9].
- **Pediatric patients**: Sodium restriction should be carefully managed due to growth and developmental needs [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Cirrhosis patients with ascites should follow a **moderate sodium restriction** of 2 g/day (88 mmol/day) to control fluid retention and reduce paracentesis needs. Strict sodium restriction is not recommended due to risks of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and increased mortality. Sodium restriction should be individualized, especially in patients with sarcopenia or malnutrition, and paired with nutritional counseling to maintain adequate protein and calorie intake [^111nvHCi] [^113HDZcP].

DURING the past three years clinical and metabolic studies1 on patients with Laennec's cirrhosis have demonstrated the value of diets high in protein and calories and low in sodium in the management of this disease. Diet therapy is only one part of the total regimen; other important features are rest, general supportive therapy and prohibition of alcohol and hepatotoxic drugs. All these are necessary to protect the liver from further damage, speed regeneration of hepatic cells, correct tissue wasting and restore hormonal and metabolic aberrations to normal. From the practical point of view it is not easy for the dietitian to provide a palatable high protein diet which is low in sodium without the use of special low sodium protein preparations. It appears, however, that this difficulty may be overcome by the oral use of ion exchange resins, 2 which absorb large amounts of sodium from the bowel and.

### Natural history of grade 1 ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis [^114tZVWV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ascites appearance indicates a poor prognosis, as the 5-year survival decreases from about 80% in patients with compensated cirrhosis to about 30% in decompensated patients with ascites. The overall survival rate in the total population of this study was 60.5%. Previous studies reported lower survival rates (18.7–56.5%) compared to the present results. However, those studies included patients with clinically significant ascites. Survival analysis in our patients demonstrated similar survival rates among all examined groups (P > 0.05): grade 1 patients (64%) vs. grade 2/3 patients (50%) vs. non-ascites group (67.2%).

Some limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. First, the fact that the cessation of alcohol intake was based on the patients' medical record; second, the retrospective nature of the study; and last, the omission of urine sodium measurement. The patients' compliance with the sodium restriction could have been monitored by measurement of urinary sodium excretion. However, considering the physician-imposed salt restriction, the patients' compliance was taken for granted.

In conclusion, these results suggest that the presence of grade 1 ascites does not constitute a precursor of grade 2/3 ascites in patients with cirrhosis; therefore, patients with grade 1 ascites do not require specific treatment.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Ascites is the most common major complication of cirrhosis and constitutes a critical landmark in the natural history of chronic liver disease
Patients with ascites grade 1 do not require specific treatment, but should be followed up carefully and advised to reduce their sodium intake, since they usually progress to the development of grade 2 ascites, according to the International Club of Ascites
There are no data on the evolution of grade 1 ascites, nor it is known whether its treatment modifies its natural history, according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines
No data exist on how frequently patients with grade 1 will develop grade 2 or 3 ascites, according to the EASL guidelines

What the new findings are:

Grade 1 ascites does not constitute an independent predictor of grade 2 or 3 ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis
There is no need for treatment with diuretics in cirrhotic patients with grade 1 ascites

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^115TF8wb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Group allocation

Patients were divided into two groups based on their dietary adherence: the salt-restricted diet (SRD) group and the salt-unrestricted diet (SUD) group. Allocation was performed according to the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DRSQ) questionnaire in two groups. The urinary spot test along with weight loss assessment led to the exclusion of 13 cases with urinary Na/K and insignificant weight loss following both diuresis and abdominal paracentesis (Fig. 1). The remaining 102 patients were grouped as follows: 46 with SRD and 56 with SUD.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of included cases

Sarcopenia, and nutritional status were evaluated once at baseline to compare its prevalence between the two groups. Patients were then followed for six months to assess how salt restriction influenced mortality.

All patients were subjected to the collection of all baseline recruitment data: demographic data (age, sex, distribution, occupation, smoking, and alcohol intake), etiology of liver disease, time since the diagnosis of cirrhosis, time since the appearance of ascites, type of ascites (responsive or refractory) according to the criteria of the International Club of Ascites, and frequency of paracentesis. Laboratory investigations include prothrombin activity, index normalized ratio (INR), serum total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, urea, and the serum concentration of sodium and potassium and a random "spot" urine sodium concentration and (K) concentration.

Questionnaire

All patients included in this study were interviewed by the same operator. The DSRQ, which were translated into the Arabic language. The DSRQ is an assessment instrument used to measure patients' perceptions of their barriers to and attitudes toward following a low-sodium diet. The original instrument is divided into three subscales: 1) attitude; 2) subjective norms; and 3) perceived behavioural control. The attitude subscale comprises six items and assesses patients' beliefs about the results of adopting a given behaviour. The subjective norm subscale consists of three items and refers to the importance of the patient's perception that others approve or disapprove of performing the behaviour. Finally, the perceived behavioural control subscale comprises seven items and evaluates the patient's ability to identify facilitators and barriers related to behaviour.

The spot urine Na/K ratio was evaluated for the objective assessment of actual diuresis.

Nutritional assessment

Patients also underwent nutritional assessment using the Royal Free Hospital-Nutritional Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT).

Conclusion

Our findings challenge the long-standing clinical dogma that strict salt restriction is universally beneficial for cirrhotic patients with ascites. The results indicate that severe sodium restriction despite being beneficial to ascites control- may worsen nutritional status, increase sarcopenia prevalence, and lead to higher mortality rates. These findings emphasize the need for a more individualized approach to dietary sodium management, balancing ascites control with the preservation of nutritional and functional status.

Box 3
Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome

Cirrhosis with ascites
Serum creatinine > 133 µmol/L
No improvement of serum creatinine to < 133 µmol/L after at least 2 days with diuretic withdrawal and volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg up to a maximum of 100 g/day)
Absence of shock
No current treatment with nephrotoxic drugs
Absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by proteinuria (> 500 mg/day) or microhaematuria (> 50 red blood cells per high-power field) and/or a normal renal ultrasonography

Early intervention in patients with AKI can prevent further deterioration in renal function leading to renal failure. Initial management of AKI should include suspension of all diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated with 0.9% saline or 5% albumin, giving boluses of 250 mL with regular volume status reassessment aiming to achieve euvolaemia with a urine output of > 0.5 mL/kg/h based on dry weight. Accurate fluid balance monitoring and daily weight charts should be commenced. Usually 1–2 L of intravenous fluid will correct most losses and render the patient euvolaemic. If after 6 h the target urine output is not achieved, or the patient's clinical parameters are worsening, then escalation to high-dependency care for more invasive monitoring, inotropic support or renal support should be considered.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and can be caused by multiple factors including: hormonal dysregulation of salt and water balance in response to portal hypertension, dehydration, treatment with diuretics, infections and excessive use of hypotonic fluids, such as 5% dextrose. Patients with serum sodium levels < 125 mmol/L are at risk of seizures. A careful history, clinical examination, medication review and review of other biochemistry are essential to determine the cause of hyponatraemia. Assessment of the patient's volume status is fundamental, and subjects who are hypovolaemic should be fluid-resuscitated. Patients with hypervolaemic hyponatraemia should be treated with fluid restriction. However, it should be noted that some patients with significant ascites, peripheral oedema and low serum albumin levels who appear hypervolaemic are actually intravascularly deplete, and treatment with intravenous albumin can correct the hyponatraemia. Correction of hyponatraemia should be slow (< 10 mmol/L increase per 24 h), as rapid changes in serum sodium can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### An optimal diuretic regimen for cirrhotic ascites… [^112wAHVP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of diuretics in mobilizing fluid, but frequent complications occur with their use in treating ascites. To develop an effective but safe regimen for treatment of cirrhotic ascites, a two-part crossover study was done. Subjects with life-threatening complications of cirrhosis were excluded. In part one it was demonstrated that a sixday diuretic regimen with dietary sodium restriction of 10 mEq/day is safe and more effective than sodium restriction alone. In part two the duration of diuretic therapy was safely extended from six to nine days with mobilization of significantly more fluid. Careful selection of subjects, use of diuretics in modest dosages for brief periods of time, and daily monitoring of subjects were important for the success of this study.

Monitoring response to therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis

Treatment of decompensation events is essential to cirrhosis management. Equally important is monitoring responses to treatment, which enables clinicians to adjust treatment duration and strategy, as well as evaluate treatment success. Furthermore, there is an unmet need to develop and validate predictive biomarkers that can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from treatments and those who are most likely to experience adverse events.

Monitoring response to diuretics in the treatment of ascites and edema

Ascites and edema develop with cirrhosis because of a marked alteration in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume. Sodium and associated water retention cause accumulation of extracellular fluid, which results in ascites and leg edema, leading to discomfort, impaired walking, and decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy with aldosterone antagonists, alone or combined with loop diuretics, can increase sodium excretion. The goal of this treatment is to achieve a negative sodium balance, which results in a negative fluid balance because water is eliminated with sodium. A low-sodium diet should also be implemented.

The ideal test for monitoring the efficacy of the treatment of ascites and edema would be an NIT to quantify fluid in extracellular spaces. Diuretics would be administered until fluid volume in the extracellular spaces had returned to normal. Unfortunately, such a tool does not exist. Instead, patients are monitored with less sophisticated tools that estimate the effect of treatment on total fluid (eg, by monitoring body weight). Alternatively, the biological effect of diuretics can be monitored easily by measuring changes in urinary sodium excretion (in mEq/day, measured accurately by 24 h urine collection). An effective treatment of ascites is associated with a reduction in body weight of no more than 0.5–1 kg per day (1 kg if peripheral edema is also present). Effective diuretic treatment should increase sodium excretion compared to baseline, with 24 h sodium excretion exceeding the presumed sodium intake (90–100 mEq/day with a low-sodium diet). The major risks associated with such treatment include diuretic-induced AKI and hypovolemia (Table 3).

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^112auaBn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis, a chronic liver condition characterized by irreversible fibrosis, poses significant challenges in clinical management, particularly in advanced stages when complications such as ascites develop. Approximately 50% of cirrhotic patients develop ascites within ten years of diagnosis, making management a central component of care for this population. Sodium retention plays a pivotal role; therefore, dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended as a first-line intervention to manage ascites. Cirrhotic patients with ascites are advised to limit their salt intake, with recommendations ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 g daily, with most guidelines recommending around 5 g (equal to a teaspoon of table salt).

However, despite its long-standing use, the role of strict salt restriction in ascites management remains a subject of debate. While sodium restriction aims to control fluid retention, emerging evidence suggests that excessive restriction may negatively impact nutritional status, muscle mass, and overall prognosis. Cirrhotic patients are already at high risk of protein-energy malnutrition and sarcopenia due to factors such as anorexia, hypermetabolism, and impaired nutrient absorption. Severe sodium restriction may exacerbate these issues, leading to increased catabolism, muscle wasting, and worse clinical outcomes.

Despite the widespread adoption of sodium restriction, there is a lack of longitudinal studies systematically evaluating both its benefits and potential risks, particularly regarding its impact on sarcopenia, nutritional status, and mortality. Previous studies have primarily focused on short-term ascites control, overlooking the long-term consequences of dietary sodium restriction on body composition, functional status, and survival. Furthermore, the relationship between sodium intake, paracentesis frequency, and nutritional deterioration remains poorly understood.

Given this knowledge gap, our study aims to assess the impact of salt restriction on sarcopenia, nutritional status, and mortality in cirrhotic patients with ascites. By evaluating these parameters over a six-month follow-up period, we seek to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits of sodium restriction and challenge the long-held assumption that strict sodium limitation is universally beneficial in this patient population. Accordingly, this study was designed to evaluate the impact of salt restriction on nutritional status, muscle mass, mortality added to ascites control in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Recommendations

In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/day). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case-by-case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Cirrhosis of the liver treated with prolonged sodium restrictions… [^112QerRy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis of the liver is characteristically associated with a moderate or a severe degree of undernutrition that is evidenced by wasting of muscle mass and loss of subcutaneous tissue. Massive ascites usually accompanies this state of chronic, severe liver disease, so that the patient with cirrhosis and massive ascites has been likened to a spider because of his large fluid-filled abdomen and spindly extremities. That this state of undernutrition in cirrhosis is often reversible was shown particularly by the classic work of Patek and his colleagues. 1 The complications of liver disease, such as massive hematemesis, hepatic coma, and, of more particular concern here, ascites requiring frequent paracenteses, has limited the effectiveness and possible duration of nutritional therapy, thus shortening the time available to permit improvement in nutrition and, presumably, in the liver disease.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^1114R5iZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 key concepts — outcomes and interventions in liver disease emphasize that presence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is associated with higher risk of mortality (in-hospital, waitlist, and posttransplant), length of stay, complications, and infections compared with patients without malnutrition. Given that sarcopenia is associated with worse patient outcomes before, during, and after liver transplantation, structured programs are needed to assess and treat sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease, especially patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, should have dietary assessment to ensure adequate nutritional intake. Evidence for supplemental vitamin D in chronic liver disease is limited; however, if vitamin D level is low, supplementation may offer bone-related and liver-related health benefits. Zinc supplementation should be considered for patients with liver disease and hypozincemia and/or signs/symptoms of zinc deficiency. Lifestyle modification with diet and exercise decreases adverse clinical outcomes in patients with MASH and should be encouraged independent of MASH pharmacotherapy. In patients with cirrhosis and evidence of fluid retention (ascites and/or edema), free water restriction may be needed when serum sodium is below 126 mEq/L.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1151tNmA]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia is more common in cirrhosis, occurring owing to non-osmotic hypersecretion of vasopressin and enhanced proximal nephron sodium reabsorption with impaired free water clearance, both being caused by effective hypovolaemia. Impaired free water clearance is observed in about 60% of patients with cirrhosis.

Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia requires a negative water balance. Many hepatologists do recommend fluid restriction of between 1 and 1.5 L/day in presence of severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). However, there are few data to support the level of serum sodium at which to initiate fluid restriction and how much fluid to restrict. It is sodium restriction and not fluid restriction that results in weight loss as fluid passively follows the sodium. Although fluid restriction may be helpful in preventing further decrease in serum sodium, it only rarely improves it. This is because on a practical level, fluid restriction to < 1 L /day is not tolerated. Water restriction should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L) with normal serum creatinine and not currently receiving diuretics. These recommendations are based on our consensus and consistent with our earlier guidelines. It is also our consensus that fluid restriction is unnecessary in absence of hyponatraemia.

Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration may improve hyponatraemia at the cost of worsening fluid overload. It is best reserved for those with severely symptomatic acute hyponatraemia, especially if a transplant is imminent. To prevent rapid increase in serum sodium and the risk of developing central pontine myelinolysis, guidelines recommend a serum sodium increase of up to 5 mmol/L in the first hour with a limit of 8–10 mmol/L every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.

### Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113HDZcP]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

AASLD 2021 practice guidance — calorie targets and sodium restriction in cirrhosis: Calorie targets should be personalized to the patient. When possible, indirect calorimetry should be used to provide a personalized intake prescription. In the absence of indirect calorimetry, acceptable approaches include traditional predictive equations (e.g. Harris-Benedict) and weight-based equations using ideal body weight, with nonobese targets of at least 35 kcal/kg body weight/day and obese (nonhospitalized, clinically stable) BMI-stratified targets of 25–35 kcal/kg/day for BMI 30–40 kg/m² and 20–25 kcal/kg/day for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m². The guidance also supports using BMI-adjusted, weight-based energy intake calculations when indirect calorimetry is not available. Sodium restriction can impair intake and adherence; in a study of 120 outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites, only 31% were adherent to a 2 g-sodium diet and adherent patients had a 20% lower daily caloric intake. When sodium restriction impedes meeting nutritional targets, liberalization of sodium restriction should be considered and should be paired with educational resources to improve palatability; in patients with screen positive for frailty or sarcopenia who cannot meet targets on a sodium-restricted diet, liberalization of sodium restriction should be considered to facilitate adequate oral intake.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Urinary sodium assessment to guide diuretics — Determination of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion can be useful during management of ascites and in adjusting diuretic dose; in patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, urinary sodium excretion lower than daily sodium intake (e.g., 80 mmol/day) indicates an insufficient diuretic dose, while persistent ascites despite adequate urinary sodium excretion indicates dietary indiscretion. When a 24-hour urine collection is not feasible, a random spot urine sodium concentration greater than the potassium (K) concentration correlates well with 24-hour sodium excretion; when the spot urine sodium (Na)/K ratio is > 1 the patient should be losing fluid weight, whereas if the spot urine Na/K ratio is ≤ 1 there is insufficient natriuresis and an increase in diuretics should be considered.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

This prospective observational cohort study provides critical insights into the complex interplay between salt restriction, nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality in cirrhotic patients with grade III ascites. Our findings challenge the conventional paradigm that strict dietary sodium restriction is universally beneficial for ascites management. Instead, our results suggest that while sodium restriction may theoretically reduce fluid retention, it is associated with significant adverse effects, including higher mortality rates, increased prevalence of sarcopenia, and poorer nutritional status. These findings align with emerging literature questioning the indiscriminate application of sodium restriction in cirrhotic patients and highlight the need for a more nuanced, individualized approach to dietary management.

Malnutrition is a well-recognized complication in patients with cirrhosis, with prevalence rates reaching up to 80%. Protein-energy malnutrition, compounded by increased metabolic demands and anorexia, is exacerbated by excessive sodium restriction, as demonstrated in our study. One of the most striking findings was the significant increase in nutritional risk among patients on a salt-restricted diet. Patients in the SRD group had a higher proportion of high nutritional risk (58.1%) than those in the SUD group (41.9%) (p = 0.001). The logistic regression analysis revealed that SRD was an independent predictor of high nutritional risk (OR = 0.129, p = 0.004). This suggests that excessive sodium restriction may contribute to insufficient caloric and protein intake, leading to muscle wasting. Similar findings were reported by Sorrentino et al. emphasizing that restricting sodium without compensatory nutritional strategies may lead to deterioration in muscle and protein stores.

Dietary salt restriction

There is little evidence to support salt restriction in patients with cirrhosis in absence of ascites. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, seven RCTs and one cross-sectional survey have examined the role of salt restriction (online supplemental table 2). One of the studies has only been published as an abstract. Four of the earlier RCTsfound no difference in ascites control in those with and without salt restriction. Two recent RCTs found that a salt unrestricted diet (5–6.5 g/day) in contrast to a salt restricted diet (< 5 g/day), resulted in ascites disappearance in a larger proportion (45% vs 16%) over a shorter time period and also significantly reduced the need for large volume paracentesis (LVP). Additionally, five of the eight above-mentioned studies reported significant adverse events with salt restriction, including hyponatraemia, reduced caloric intake, higher risk of renal impairment (0% vs 14%), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), SBPand mortality. In a study by Sorrentino et al,1-year mortality was 45–60% (salt unrestricted diet) versus 82.5% (salt restricted diet).

Thus salt restricted diets (< 5 g m of salt, < 85 mmol sodium/day) in patients with cirrhosis and ascites do not improve ascites control and, on the contrary, can result in complications. Additionally, such diets are difficult to comply with, especially since the average European ingests about 10 g of salt/day. A cross-sectional surveyindicated that only about a third of cirrhotic patients were compliant with salt restriction, with an additional 45% incorrectly stating that they were. Based on these data, patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet, with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87 mmol–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. An ongoing systematic review is assessing the role of salt restriction in patients with ascites due to cirrhosis.

However, there are limitations to consider. Being a single-center study, the generalizability of the findings to broader populations may be limited. Furthermore, while baseline sarcopenia was assessed, the absence of serial sarcopenia measurements precludes the evaluation of its progression over time. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period, though adequate for short-term mortality and nutritional impact evaluation, does not account for long-term outcomes related to sodium intake, necessitating further longitudinal studies.

Our study underscores the need for an individualized, patient-centered approach to dietary sodium management in cirrhotic patients. Rather than a blanket recommendation for strict sodium restriction, a tailored approach that considers each patient's nutritional status, sarcopenia risk, and fluid balance is warranted. Future multicenter, randomized controlled trials are necessary to refine sodium intake recommendations and develop evidence-based dietary guidelines that optimize both ascites control and nutritional status.

### Poor disease knowledge is associated with higher healthcare service use and costs among patients with cirrhosis: an exploratory study [^115upoSb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is the leading cause of liver-related death globally and is an increasing contribution to the health burden of many countries. In Australia, liver disease is among the top ten leading causes of years of life lost, and the disease burden increased during 2003–2015. In the past two decades, preventive and treatment strategies have been established to reduce transmission of viral hepatitis C and B. However, this effect is postulated to be offset by sustained hazardous alcohol consumption and rising burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In fact, in the state of Queensland, the number of hospital admissions for cirrhosis increased 1.6-fold during 2008–2016. Although Australian data are limited, the productivity impacts and healthcare costs of managing advanced liver disease are staggering, and the disease has a substantial impact on patients' activities of daily living and health-related quality of life.

Optimal management of cirrhosis can be challenging, with many patients required to follow complex medication regimens, dietary restrictions, and engage in disease monitoring activities. Chronic disease management is more effective if patients have the knowledge to manage their health. However, previous studies have shown that patient knowledge about cirrhosis and self-care tasks is variable. While most patients with cirrhosis understand the need to cease alcohol consumption, many lack understanding about key aspects of the management of cirrhosis complications, such as sodium restriction to control ascites and avoidance of constipation to prevent hepatic encephalopathy. In other chronic diseases, lack of knowledge and skills have been associated with poor self-management and lower levels of adherence to clinician recommendations. People with low health literacy have a poorer comprehension of their disease, poorer ability to take medications and interpret labels and health messages correctly without guidance, and these patients also have more hospitalisations. Moreover, experiences in other chronic disease settings (e.g. heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes) with nurse-led patient education interventions demonstrate improvements in health-related quality of life, reduced hospital admissions and readmissions, and cost-effectiveness.

Aimed at informing the development and evaluation of an educational intervention specific to the needs of Australians with chronic liver disease, we assessed patient knowledge about cirrhosis and self-care tasks through a cross-sectional survey of a well-characterised cohort of patients with cirrhosis for whom detailed clinical data including hospital admissions, emergency department presentations, and costs were available. We also explored factors associated with patient knowledge and compared clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life and survival), healthcare service use (hospital admissions, emergency department presentations) and healthcare costs according to patient knowledge.

ACG Clinical Guideline nutritional recommendations in liver disease include the following with on-page strength and quality labels: We suggest early administration of oral or enteral nutrition supplementation therapy in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis, we suggest implementation of nutritional supplementation therapy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) without cirrhosis, we suggest treatment with natural vitamin E 800 IU daily (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest coffee consumption, preferably ≥ 2 cups per day, in patients with chronic liver disease to reduce risk of hepatic fibrosis progression or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are managed with diuretic therapies, we cannot recommend for or against strict sodium restricted diets (insufficient evidence, no recommendation). We suggest not restricting dietary protein in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest a diet enriched in vegetarian sources of protein in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who require nutritional supplementation. We recommend the use of branched chain amino acids (when available) in addition to standard-of-care treatment in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend incorporating late evening snacks in patients with cirrhosis to improve body mass index, lean muscle tissue, and reduce the risk of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Management of hyponatremia in cirrhosis and ascites — acute versus chronic and volume-specific strategies — notes that patients with acute hyponatremia can, and typically should, have hyponatremia corrected rapidly to prevent cerebral edema without a concern for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), while patients with chronic hyponatremia require more gradual and measured correction to avoid overcorrection and mitigate the risk of ODS. For hypovolemic hyponatremia, treatment is the discontinuation of diuretics and/or laxatives and providing fluid resuscitation, typically with 5% intravenous (IV) albumin or crystalloid (preferentially lactated Ringer's) solution, whereas treatment of hypervolemic hyponatremia includes fluid restriction, reduction or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives, administration of hyperoncotic albumin, and/or vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans). An observational study of 595 patients reported relapse occurring in 55% after correction; only 36% of patients with moderate and severe hyponatremia had serum Na increase by ≥ 5 mEq/L with fluid restriction by day 3, whereas 71% with tolvaptan and 78% with hypertonic saline met this endpoint. Raising serum sodium by fluid restriction alone generally means fluid intake < 750 mL/day. Albumin infusion was associated with improvement in hospitalized patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) and more severe fluid restriction together with albumin infusion is recommended for severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L). In one study, only a minority (22%) achieved > 130 mEq/L that persisted throughout treatment, whereas in another study hyponatremia relapsed by 7 days after discontinuation of tolvaptan; the US Food and Drug Administration limits tolvaptan treatment duration to 30 days with a "black box" warning related to serious hepatocellular liver injury. Hypertonic saline can correct serum sodium but often results in worsening hypervolemia and ascites and is reserved for short-term treatment of patients with symptomatic or severe hyponatremia or those with imminent LT.

### Tolvaptan versus other interventions for hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis [^113Szo6q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review, and PRISMA 2020 for the reporting.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include only randomised clinical trials with a parallel‐group design that compare tolvaptan with standard medical management, placebo, or other vaptans in adults with hyponatraemia in cirrhosis. We will include trials irrespective of objectives, studied or reported outcomes, blinding, setting, language, size, duration of participants' follow‐up, and publication status. If we identify cross‐over trials, we will only include data from the first trial period, i.e. before the cross‐over, to avoid the risk of carry‐over effects.

Cluster‐randomised trials, where groups of individuals are randomised to different interventions, are unlikely to have been performed with the topic of this review. We will not include quasi‐randomised studies as the allocation in these parallel‐arm studies is determined by an approximation of randomisation (e.g. allocation by participant ID number or day of birth).

Types of participants

We will include trials where participants are 18 years or older, have cirrhosis (as defined by the trial authors; for details on the definition of cirrhosis, please see Description of the condition), have low sodium levels (as described in Description of the condition), and come from any background or setting. We will include participants irrespective of their body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, or medical history.

If trial reports include mixed populations, we will contact study authors to request published or unpublished data for the participants with hyponatraemia in cirrhosis. We will exclude trials if fewer than 10% of the randomised participants had hyponatraemia in cirrhosis or if relevant data for the subgroup cannot be obtained.

Types of interventions

In our review, we plan to do three separate comparisons: tolvaptan versus standard medical care, versus placebo, or versus other vaptans.

Experimental intervention

Tolvaptan, administered orally at any dose, treatment schedule, and duration, either as monotherapy or in addition to standard medical care.

Control interventions

Standard medical care (e.g. fluid restriction, diuretics)
Placebo
Other vaptans (e.g. satavaptan, lixivaptan, conivaptan), given orally at any dose and duration

We will consider interventions administered equally to the experimental and control groups in a trial as co‐interventions.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112ovsQC]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia

Recent guidelines define hyponatraemia as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, with 130–135 mmol/L, 125–129 mmol/L and < 125 mmol/L, constituting mild, moderate and severe hyponatraemia, respectively. A prospective population survey among patients with cirrhosis found serum sodium < 130 mmol/L in 21.6%. Hyponatraemia has been associated with higher prevalence of refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, HRS and mortality. Acknowledging this, the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score now incorporates serum sodium (MELD-Na). Those with cirrhosis and chronic hyponatraemia are often asymptomatic and seldom need treatment.

Both hypovolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia is observed in cirrhosis. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia results from overzealous diuretic therapy, being characterised by a prolonged negative sodium balance with marked loss of extracellular fluid. Its management requires expansion of plasma volume with normal saline and cessation of diuretics. Most hepatologists would discontinue diuretics if serum sodium is < 125 mmol/L.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy — Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss, and fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present; a formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) are the mainstay of diuretic treatment of cirrhotic ascites, and the recommended initial dose of spironolactone is 100 mg/day. Two studies addressing the best way to use these diuretics showed that for the first episode of ascites, treatment with aldosterone antagonists alone generated an adequate response with fewer side effects, whereas those with long-standing ascites responded better to a combined diuretic treatment.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^113WU9cz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary rationale for sodium restriction in cirrhosis is to reduce fluid retention and decrease the need for paracentesis. This study data suggests that sodium restriction was necessarily translated into superior ascites control.

Remarkedly, the SUD group showed significantly higher modified weight than in the SRD group (p = 0.001). Total body water (TBW) was also significantly higher in the SUD group (mean 40.31 ± 12.08) than in the SRD group (mean 33.84 ± 6.86, p < 0.001), which could indicate that patients on an unrestricted diet retained more fluid, leading to higher TBW. Water retention increases body weight without necessarily reflecting improved nutritional or muscle status, as it primarily represents extracellular fluid accumulation.

Hence, these results demonstrate that salt restriction significantly improves ascites control, and the regression analysis confirmed that SRD was an independent predictor of improved ascites control (OR = 2.461, p < 0.001). These findings align with previous studies supporting sodium restriction as a fundamental component of ascites management. However, our study suggests that while ascites control is enhanced, it comes at the cost of worsening nutritional status, warranting careful dietary adjustments.

### Refractory ascites in liver cirrhosis [^1116crqP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ascites, a common complication of liver cirrhosis, eventually becomes refractory to diuretic therapy and sodium restriction in ∼10% of patients. Multiple pathogenetic factors are involved in the development of refractory ascites, which ultimately lead to renal hypoperfusion and avid sodium retention. Therefore, renal dysfunction commonly accompanies refractory ascites. Management includes continuation of sodium restriction, which needs frequent reviews for adherence; and regular large volume paracentesis of 5 L or more with albumin infusions to prevent the development of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction. In the appropriate patients with reasonable liver reserve, the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) can be considered, especially if the patient is relatively young and has no previous hepatic encephalopathy or anatomical contraindications, and no past history of renal or cardiopulmonary disease. Response to TIPS with ascites clearance can lead to nutritional improvement. Devices such as an automated low-flow ascites pump may be available in the future for ascites treatment. Patients with refractory ascites and poor liver function and/or renal dysfunction, should be referred for liver transplant, as this will eliminate the portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction prior to liver transplant largely improves after transplant without affecting post-transplant survival.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^1141STCu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Contradictory, was the observation reported by Ruiz-Margáin et al. who noted that a less restrictive sodium approach did not worsen ascites control but improved nutritional outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

While paracentesis frequency is a widely used marker for ascites control, it does not fully capture the complex interplay of fluid balance, nutritional status, and renal function in cirrhotic patients. To address this limitation, our study also considered changes in body weight, TBW measured by BIA, and serum sodium levels as additional markers of ascites management. Our results indicate that patients in the SRD group exhibited lower TBW and required fewer paracenteses, suggesting better ascites control. However, the significant weight loss observed in the SRD group raises concerns about nutritional depletion and potential muscle loss due to excessive sodium restriction. These findings mirror similar results in literature. For instance, Gu et al. and Sorrentino et al. reported that patients following a less restrictive sodium regimen had better nutritional outcomes, including higher caloric and protein intake, which contributed to improved ascites control and reduced need for paracentesis. Bernardi et al. also highlighted that excessive sodium restriction can exacerbate malnutrition and muscle wasting, ultimately leading to more frequent ascites' recurrence. These findings highlight the delicate balance between sodium restriction, fluid management, and nutritional status in cirrhotic patients. Future studies should integrate longitudinal assessments of ascitic fluid volume, renal function, and body composition to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of ascites control in response to dietary interventions.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114sSMDj]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Guidance statements — Moderate sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) and diuretics (spironolactone with or without furosemide) are the first-line treatment in patients with cirrhosis and grade 2 ascites. After ascites is adequately mobilized, attempts should be made to taper the diuretics to the lowest dose necessary to maintain minimal or no ascites to prevent the development of adverse effects. Fluid restriction is not necessary for ascites management unless there is concomitant moderate or severe hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 125 mmol/L). In patients receiving diuretics, body weight and serum creatinine and sodium should be regularly monitored to assess response and to detect the development of adverse effects. Human albumin solution (20–40 g/week) or baclofen administration (10 mg/day, with a weekly increase of 10 mg/day up to 30 mg/day) may be helpful for muscle cramps.

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^114anBhj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Few studies, with varying methodological quality and inconsistent findings, have examined the effects of salt restriction on nutrition in patients with cirrhosis. Soulsby et al. found that patients without salt restrictions experienced reduced ascites, better nutritional status, and shorter hospital stays. Similarly, Gu et al. in the largest study to date, randomized 200 patients with ascites into unrestricted (8.8 g NaCl) and restricted (4.2 g NaCl) sodium groups, finding that the unrestricted group experienced better renal function, higher calorie intake, increased serum albumin, and shorter hospital stays, along with greater ascites resolution (P = 0.001). Similarly, Sorrentino et al. observed that the sodium-restricted group required paracentesis more frequently and had higher mortality rates. Morando et al. in a study of 120 outpatients, noted that in the salt-restricted diet group (4.6 g NaCl/day) there was reduced caloric intake by 20%, with only 30.8% adhering to the diet. Many patients misunderstand their sodium intake levels, likely due to inadequate dietary guidance, leading some to unintentionally lower their calorie intake to reduce salt intake.

The present study highlights the critical role of sarcopenia in cirrhotic patient outcomes. Sarcopenia was significantly more prevalent in the SRD group (p < 0.006), with a lower skeletal muscle index (SMI) and trunk protein muscle mass (TR PMM). More importantly, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of mortality (OR = 2.684, p = 0.02) in our multivariate analysis. These findings corroborate previous reports by Montano-Loza et al. and Kalafateli et al. who identified sarcopenia as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients.

The lower PMM in the SRD group may stem from dietary restrictions and cirrhosis-related catabolism, whereas fluid overload in the SUD group may artificially inflate PMM readings because increased extracellular fluid can distort body composition. It is likely that the results of a small study by Soulsby et al. who reported reduced dry body weight and mid-arm muscle circumference over four weeks on a low-sodium diet, although this timeframe is too brief to assess long-term impacts. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association likely involve increased catabolism due to inadequate protein intake, loss of muscle mass secondary to sodium restriction-induced metabolic alterations, and impaired nitrogen balance.

1.3	Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis or Nephrotic Syndrome

ALDACTONE is indicated for the management of edema in the following settings:

Cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction.
Nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response.

Because it increases serum potassium, ALDACTONE may be useful for treating edema when administration of other diuretics has caused hypokalemia.

1.4	Primary Hyperaldosteronism

ALDACTONE is indicated in the following settings:

Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism.
Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery.
Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism).

### Impacts of salt restriction on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality of cirrhotic patients with ascites [^115LFkuj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Salt restriction is a cornerstone in managing ascites in cirrhotic patients; however, its impact on nutritional status, sarcopenia, and mortality remains unclear.

Aim

To evaluate the effects of a salt-restricted diet (SRD) on ascites control, body composition, sarcopenia development, and patient survival in cirrhotic patients with decompensated liver disease.

Methods

This prospective study included 102 patients with grade III ascites, categorized into two groups based on dietary adherence: Salt-Restricted Diet (SRD), (n = 46) and Salt-Unrestricted Diet (SUD) (n = 56). Sodium intake was assessed using the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ) and spot urine Na/K ratio. Nutritional status, sarcopenia, ascites control, and six-month mortality were evaluated.

Results

The SRD group showed better ascites control, with fewer paracentesis sessions per month (1.57 ± 0.65 vs. 4.07 ± 1.43, p < 0.001). Sarcopenia was more prevalent in the SRD group (p < 0.001), with lower SMI (4.88 ± 7.13 vs. 16.7 ± 544.8, p < 0.001) and TR PMM (19.03 ± 3.68 vs. 71.92 ± 191.9, p < 0.001). Higher nutritional risk was significantly associated with SRD (p = 0.001). Mortality was significantly higher in the SRD group (67.4%) compared to the SUD group (35.7%), p = 0.001. Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia (OR = 2.684, p = 0.006) and SRD (OR = 1.65, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

While effective in ascites control, sodium restriction may compromise nutritional status, heighten sarcopenia risk, and increase mortality, highlighting the need for a more individualized dietary approach.

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

### An effective treatment of refractory ascites in cirrhosis of the liver… [^113DKkEP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

REDEKER AG, KUZMA OT, REYNOLDS TB. An Effective Treatment of Refractory Ascites in Cirrhosis of the Liver. AMA Arch Intern Med. 1960; 105: 594–600. doi:
10. 1001/archinte.
1960. 00270160092011. One of the commonest complications of cirrhosis of the liver is the formation of ascites. While in some patients the ascites can be easily controlled with sodium restriction and the use of diuretics, in others these measures are ineffective. In this latter instance, rigid restriction of dietary sodium is mandatory if frequent paracenteses are to be avoided. Even with a restricted sodium intake, if the use of diuretics is ineffective in enhancing urinary sodium excretion there is usually a very slow progression in the accumulation of ascitic fluid. These patients, with cirrhosis and ascites resistant to treatment with potent diuretics, present a very difficult therapeutic problem.

Such radical measures as a surgical portacaval shunt and bilateral adrenalectomy have been applied in an effort to control the ascites formation in this type of patient. The organomercurial diuretics are frequently ineffective in promoting a sodium diuresis, and potentiation of their Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

Long term care

This section covers patient and caregiver training and support, long-term prophylaxis, monitoring, nutrition and long-term complications.

Patients' health care is often managed by general practitioners (GPs). Alfapump ® -specific treatment should not be changed without consulting the hepatologist. The GP and other health care providers, especially those whose assessments and/or treatments could potentially influence pump function, should be made aware of limitations (such as, importantly, device damage by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and long-term complications) to facilitate early identification and appropriate referral.

Patients and their primary caregiver should be familiarised with pump use, especially charging, diet guidance and use of over-the-counter analgetics. Importantly, they should be familiar with early signs of complications and should be encouraged to contact the hepatologist or implant centre upon detection of any warning signs. Educational material should be provided by the centre and the patient should be walked through the important points before discharge.

Dietary restrictions may be relaxed in order to improve quality of life, general nutrition and sarcopenia. Guidelines may be a useful starting point, however, adherence to a strict low sodium diet might be difficult. A protein-rich "no added salt" diet is proposed. In case of TDV increase to volumes larger than 1 L following dietary changes, a sodium-restricted diet needs to be re-introduced.

Fluid intake should not exceed 2 L per day. Hyponatremia should be managed as in any other cirrhotic patient (fluid intake restriction) and the pump settings left unaltered. Excessive fluid intake might result in ascites volumes that are uncontrollable by the pump.

Similar to post-implantation care, albumin should be substituted according to current guidelines and local standards of the treating expert centre.

An overview of symptoms and management of common complications that may appear in the long term is provided in Table 2. Although the risk of developing MDR infections related to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis remains a matter of concern, patients receiving alfapump ® are at a very high risk of infection, and consequently antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued until explant.
