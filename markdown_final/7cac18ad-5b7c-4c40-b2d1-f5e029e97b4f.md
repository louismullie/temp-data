## Question

Prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis in ambulatory patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis in ambulatory patients receiving systemic therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and why prevention matters. Then, I should verify validated risk stratification tools and thresholds. Next, I will review guideline positions across societies and reconcile differences. After that, I need to examine the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic options, including DOACs and LMWH, and consider special populations. Finally, I should outline a practical, risk-adapted algorithm, address implementation barriers, and summarize the bottom line with clear recommendations and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its magnitude. Ambulatory patients with cancer have a four- to seven-fold higher VTE risk than those without cancer, and most cancer-associated thromboses now occur in the outpatient setting, which underscores the need for outpatient risk stratification and targeted prophylaxis rather than blanket approaches [^1115QFAf] [^111guGXe]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although VTE is common, routine pharmacologic prophylaxis for all outpatients is not supported because absolute risk varies widely and bleeding risk must be balanced carefully [^115teoXM].

> I need to check the validated risk stratification tools. The Khorana score remains the most widely used and validated instrument for ambulatory solid tumors initiating systemic therapy, incorporating tumor type, prechemotherapy platelet count, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and BMI; a score of 2 or more identifies intermediate-to-high risk and is the threshold used in pivotal trials and most contemporary guidelines [^116C3omc] [^113n3mpK]. Wait, let me verify whether a more granular threshold improves targeting; a CATScore-derived 6‑month VTE risk of at least 8% (often enriched by elevated D‑dimer) better identifies patients who benefit from prophylaxis and yields a lower number needed to treat than Khorana alone, though this requires prospective validation before routine adoption [^114zA4jF] [^116DEiee].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them. ASH 2021 recommends no routine prophylaxis for low-risk patients, suggests no prophylaxis for intermediate-risk (with a conditional allowance for DOACs in some statements), and conditionally supports prophylaxis for high-risk patients using LMWH or DOACs, with explicit caution about bleeding risk and drug interactions [^113zfeDq] [^111iFJ3m]. ASCO 2023 advises against routine pharmacologic prophylaxis for all outpatients but supports considering prophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH in high-risk patients (Khorana ≥ 2) without significant bleeding risk or interactions, emphasizing shared decision-making and cost considerations [^115teoXM] [^1145PPXq]. ESMO 2023 aligns by recommending consideration of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH for a maximum of 6 months in high-risk ambulatory patients starting systemic therapy, again contingent on low bleeding risk [^111FG9D8]. ITAC 2022 provides the strongest endorsement, recommending primary pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs for ambulatory patients at intermediate-to-high risk (Khorana ≥ 2) who are not actively bleeding or at high bleeding risk, with particular emphasis on pancreatic cancer and immunomodulatory drug regimens in multiple myeloma [^112Y7vRw] [^113Gtkvp] [^115Ud9xi].

> I will now examine the efficacy of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that prophylaxis reduces VTE by roughly 40–60% in appropriately selected ambulatory patients, with the clearest benefit in those with Khorana ≥ 2. For example, AVERT showed apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily reduced VTE to 4.2% vs 10.2% with placebo, and CASSINI showed rivaroxaban 10 mg daily reduced the composite of symptomatic plus asymptomatic VTE, while LMWH trials demonstrate similar relative risk reductions across multiple studies [^113n3mpK] [^114M431v] [^116cKuLn]. Hold on, I should verify absolute risk differences; in higher-risk strata, absolute risk reductions are larger, translating into favorable numbers needed to treat, whereas in lower-risk groups the absolute benefit is small and may be outweighed by bleeding, reinforcing a risk-adapted approach [^114M431v] [^1112G7HG].

> Now, I need to assess safety, especially bleeding. Major bleeding with prophylactic anticoagulation is generally around 2% in pooled analyses, with a modest increase versus control and notable heterogeneity across studies. DOACs appear to have a slightly higher major bleeding signal than LMWH in some meta-analyses, though absolute differences are small and confidence intervals overlap [^114ehBVo] [^116cKuLn]. Wait, let me double-check the DOAC-specific data. AVERT and CASSINI both showed increased clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with DOAC prophylaxis, and a Cochrane analysis judged DOAC prophylaxis as probably increasing major bleeding, so I should counsel patients accordingly and screen for drug–drug interactions and organ dysfunction that elevate bleeding risk [^113n3mpK] [^116cKuLn]. I should confirm that no survival benefit has been demonstrated for prophylaxis, which tempers aggressive expansion beyond truly high-risk groups [^1117bCd1].

> Let me consider special populations where the risk–benefit calculus shifts. In locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, baseline VTE risk is very high, and ITAC gives a strong recommendation for pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs when bleeding risk is low, which is a population where the absolute benefit is most compelling [^113Gtkvp]. For multiple myeloma patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs with corticosteroids, thromboprophylaxis is recommended, with aspirin for lower-risk regimens and LMWH for higher-risk combinations, reflecting the well-described IMiD-associated thrombosis risk [^115Ud9xi]. But wait, what if the patient has active GI or GU bleeding risk or a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage? In those settings, I should avoid DOACs and consider LMWH cautiously or defer prophylaxis altogether, aligning with guideline cautions and the absence of benefit in preventing arterial events with anticoagulation in this population [^111iFJ3m] [^111mH4w2].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic and mechanical strategies. Early ambulation is preferred when feasible, and mechanical prophylaxis can be considered when pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated or as adjuncts in patients at exceedingly high VTE risk with high bleeding risk, though data are limited in the ambulatory setting and should not replace pharmacologic prophylaxis when indicated [^1158ZCow] [^11625WpX]. Hold on, I should verify that mechanical methods alone are not sufficient for high-risk ambulatory patients; current guidance positions them as alternatives or adjuncts rather than substitutes for pharmacologic prophylaxis [^11625WpX].

> I will now translate this into a practical, risk-adapted algorithm. First, I should confirm that all ambulatory patients starting systemic therapy undergo VTE risk assessment using the Khorana score and clinical judgment, and document bleeding risk and potential drug interactions before any prophylaxis decision [^113X8Dsg]. For Khorana ≥ 2 without significant bleeding risk or interactions, I should discuss benefits and harms of prophylaxis with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily, or LMWH for up to 6 months, tailoring to patient preference, access, and cost; for Khorana < 2, I should avoid routine prophylaxis and instead focus on modifiable risks and surveillance, with periodic reassessment if the clinical picture changes [^111FG9D8] [^1145PPXq]. If a patient has a first-degree family history of VTE and is otherwise low or intermediate risk, I should consider thrombophilia testing and offer prophylaxis if thrombophilia is present, recognizing the evidence is low certainty and shared decision-making is essential [^114tECEB] [^114FSbkH]. I need to ensure I reassess risk at each treatment cycle or major clinical change, because VTE and bleeding risks evolve with disease progression, new therapies, and organ function shifts [^notfound].

> Implementation remains a major barrier, so I should double-check system-level solutions. Fewer than 10% of oncologists routinely use structured risk tools, yet programs like VTEPACC demonstrate that EHR-embedded risk scoring, automated alerts, pharmacist-led interaction checks, and multidisciplinary pathways can raise risk assessment rates above 90% and reduce observed VTE by roughly 30–40% in real-world cohorts, supporting adoption of similar models [^113hYRC3] [^111mKosu]. Let me reconsider whether these gains are sustainable; sustained success required iterative quality improvement cycles and leadership buy-in, which I should build into any rollout plan [^114Cv9ar].

> Finally, I should summarize the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Primary pharmacologic prophylaxis is not for all ambulatory patients with cancer. It is best reserved for those at intermediate-to-high thrombotic risk by validated tools such as Khorana ≥ 2 who also have low bleeding risk, with DOACs and LMWH as acceptable options and a typical duration up to 6 months, while routine prophylaxis should be avoided in low-risk patients due to limited absolute benefit and increased bleeding exposure [^111FG9D8] [^1145PPXq]. I need to emphasize that no survival benefit has been demonstrated, bleeding risk is real and higher with DOACs than LMWH in some analyses, and careful attention to drug–drug interactions and organ function is mandatory before prescribing, especially in GI/GU malignancies or thrombocytopenia [^1117bCd1] [^116cKuLn]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: anticoagulation does not prevent arterial thrombotic events in this population, so it should not be used for ATE prevention outside of standard cardiovascular indications like atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves [^111mH4w2].

Primary prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) in ambulatory patients centers on **risk-stratified pharmacologic prophylaxis** for those at high VTE risk, using validated tools such as the Khorana score [^113X8Dsg] [^116C3omc]. For patients with a Khorana score ≥ 2 and low bleeding risk, **DOACs (apixaban or rivaroxaban) or LMWH are recommended** [^111FG9D8] [^112Y7vRw] for up to 6 months [^111FG9D8]; DOACs are favored for convenience, but LMWH is preferred in patients with high bleeding risk or drug interactions [^111RVpX2]. Routine prophylaxis is not advised for low-risk patients [^115teoXM] [^111ATh6U], and all patients should have bleeding risk assessed and prophylaxis monitored regularly [^116aMwXt].

---

## Risk assessment and stratification

- **Validated risk assessment tools**: The Khorana score is the most widely used tool for ambulatory patients initiating systemic therapy, incorporating tumor type, prechemotherapy platelet count, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and BMI [^115vnZmE] [^113hYRC3].

- **Risk categories**: Patients are stratified into low, intermediate, or high risk based on the Khorana score and clinical judgment [^113zfeDq].

- **Special considerations**: Patients with a family history of VTE may benefit from thrombophilia testing to guide prophylaxis decisions [^114tECEB] [^114FSbkH].

---

## Pharmacological prophylaxis

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

- **Agents**: Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the primary DOACs recommended for primary prophylaxis in high-risk ambulatory patients [^111FG9D8] [^112Y7vRw].

- **Efficacy**: DOACs significantly reduce VTE incidence in high-risk patients without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to placebo or no prophylaxis [^114M431v] [^115XXRNF].

- **Duration**: Prophylaxis is typically recommended for up to 6 months, aligning with the period of highest VTE risk during systemic therapy [^111FG9D8].

---

### Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

- **Efficacy**: LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin) is effective in reducing VTE incidence in high-risk ambulatory patients [^116cKuLn] [^114M431v].

- **Safety**: LMWH has a favorable safety profile, particularly in patients with higher bleeding risk or those with contraindications to DOACs [^115pDQ3s].

- **Preference**: LMWH is preferred in patients with renal impairment, obesity, or significant drug interactions [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures include **patient education** on VTE symptoms and when to seek care [^116aMwXt], and **lifestyle modifications** such as physical activity, hydration, and weight management to reduce VTE risk [^115aDoGK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ASCO 2023 | - Consider pharmacologic prophylaxis (apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH) for high-risk outpatients (Khorana ≥ 2) with low bleeding risk [^1145PPXq] |
| ESMO 2023 | - Consider DOACs or LMWH for high-risk ambulatory patients starting systemic therapy, up to 6 months [^111FG9D8] |
| ITAC 2022 | - Strong recommendation for primary prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs in high-risk patients (Khorana ≥ 2) with low bleeding risk [^112Y7vRw] |
| ASH 2021 | - Conditional recommendation for LMWH or DOACs in high-risk patients; strong recommendation against routine prophylaxis in low-risk patients [^111iFJ3m] [^111ATh6U] |

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pancreatic cancer**: High VTE risk warrants strong consideration of primary prophylaxis with LMWH or DOACs [^113Gtkvp] [^112jKukG].

- **Multiple myeloma**: Patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide) have elevated VTE risk and may benefit from aspirin or LMWH prophylaxis [^115Ud9xi] [^114dyiAg].

- **Renal impairment**: LMWH is preferred over DOACs in significant renal dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular assessment should track **bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and adherence**, with therapy adjusted as needed [^notfound]. Patient counseling should emphasize **adherence, bleeding signs, and when to seek immediate care** [^notfound].

---

## Barriers and challenges

Key barriers include **low uptake of risk assessment tools and prophylaxis** despite clear benefits [^113hYRC3] [^114X8Ss8], and the need to balance bleeding risk — especially with DOACs — against thrombosis prevention [^116cKuLn] [^114SmWpX]. Cost and access may limit the feasibility of prolonged prophylaxis, particularly with DOACs [^114SmWpX].

---

Primary prevention of CAT in ambulatory patients relies on **risk-stratified pharmacologic prophylaxis** with DOACs or LMWH for high-risk patients, supported by education and lifestyle measures. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended for low-risk patients, and ongoing monitoring is essential to balance efficacy and safety [^115ii2BX] [^111FG9D8].

### Updated meta-analysis on prevention of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients [^1112G7HG]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Randomized clinical trials have evaluated the role of anticoagulants in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. This meta-analysis is aimed at providing an updated evaluation of the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis in this clinical setting. Medline and Scopus were searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials on the prevention of VTE in ambulatory cancer patients. Two groups of trials were identified with VTE or death as the primary outcome, respectively. VTE was the primary outcome of this analysis. Anticoagulant prophylaxis reduced the incidence of VTE in studies in which the primary outcome was VTE [14 studies, 8,226 patients; odds ratio (OR) = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.36–0.56] or death (8 studies, 3,727 patients; OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47–0.81). When these studies were pooled together, VTE was reduced by 49% (95% CI: 0.43–0.61) with no significant increase in major bleeding (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.98–1.73). The risk of major bleeding was increased in studies with VTE as the primary outcome (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.01–2.04). Similar reductions of VTE were observed in studies with parenteral (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33–0.56) or oral anticoagulants (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.33–0.74). The reduction in VTE was confirmed in patients with lung (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26–0.67) or pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14–0.48), in estimated high-risk patients, in high-quality studies and with respect to symptomatic VTE. In conclusion, prophylaxis with oral or parenteral anticoagulants reduces the risk of VTE in ambulatory cancer patients, with an acceptable increase in major bleeding.

Regarding preventative measures for cancer-associated thrombosis, more specifically with respect to thromboprophylaxis, patients receiving anticancer therapy, ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH for a maximum of 6 months for primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer starting systemic anticancer treatment and having a high thrombosis risk.

### What's new in the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis? [^115XXRNF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Current clinical guidelines recommend against the use of routine primary thromboprophylaxis in unselected ambulatory cancer patients. The Khorana score is a risk assessment tool derived and prospectively validated for the identification of cancer patients at high risk of thrombotic complications. Recently, 2 randomized, controlled trials have assessed the use of low-dose direct oral Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, for the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis in ambulatory patients at intermediate to high risk of VTE (Khorana score ≥ 2). Taken together, these trials have shown that low-dose direct oral Xa inhibitors reduce the risk of VTE in this patient population without a significant increase in major bleeding. These results should encourage clinicians to consider the use of primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients at intermediate to high risk of VTE who do not have any apparent risk factors for bleeding. The direct oral Xa inhibitors have also been assessed in the acute management of cancer-associated thrombosis. Current evidence suggests that these drugs are a convenient, effective, and safe option for the management of acute VTE in many cancer patients. Low-molecular weight heparin, however, may continue to be the treatment of choice depending on the presence of bleeding risk factors, the type of cancer, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences.

### Anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in ambulatory cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111KZ7a1]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials involving over 10,000 participants did not detect a statistically significant reduction in ATE with anticoagulant use among ambulatory cancer patients starting systemic anticancer therapy, whereas major and nonmajor bleeding were increased with anticoagulant use. Our data do not support the routine use of anticoagulation for ATE prevention in ambulatory cancer patients.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, the use of anticoagulants did not prevent arterial thrombotic events. Although anticoagulants are effective to prevent venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer starting chemotherapy, these data do not support their use for the prevention of arterial events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies on optimal risk stratification of arterial thrombotic events among patients with cancer are needed in order to focus interventional studies on patients at highest risk of developing arterial vascular complications.

### Successful model for guideline implementation to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis: venous thromboembolism prevention in the ambulatory cancer clinic [^111mKosu]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The principal goal of thromboprophylaxis is VTE prevention in subgroups of patients who will most benefit. In the clinical trial setting, VTE occurred in 11% of high-risk patients receiving placebo in a study of nadroparin prophylaxis and 10.2% of placebo patients in the AVERT trial (Khorana score ≥ 2). A recent systematic review found the 6-month incidence of VTE was 11% in patients with a Khorana score ≥ 3. In the VTEPACC population, the rate of VTE at 6 months from study initiation was 12.8% and was approximately 40% lower, at 8.2% after full implementation of VTEPACC. These results support VTEPACC as effective in reducing VTE in a real-world setting.

The prospective evaluation and treatment of a large number of consecutive patients in this outpatient cohort allows for applicability of our study results to patients with cancer initiating therapy in the outpatient setting. The major limitation of this study is the single-center design. The applicability to smaller practices is not known, and a perceived barrier could be the lack of hematologists, although a large number of patients in VTEPACC were seen by APPs trained in thrombosis and bleeding related to patients with cancer, and in subsequent work, we are assessing the impact of pharmacist-driven patient consultations. In addition, education and risk assessment rates may not account for all patients because the ability to capture appropriate patients via the EHR across all clinics and treatment regimens was challenging.

The effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to address VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis in oncology patients underscores the need for leveraging multiple areas of expertise to optimize clinical outcomes. Implementation of VTEPACC using a multidisciplinary team and EHR-based approach improved VTE risk assessment and education. VTEPACC was successfully able to identify patients at high risk for developing a VTE and offer personalized VTE prophylaxis. Successful implementation of guidelines to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis could have a significant impact on patient morbidity and mortality.

DOAC thromboprophylaxis vs no thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer — The evidence base included 3 eligible randomized controlled trials in which patients in AVERT and CASSINI had moderate to high risk for VTE (Khorana score ≥ 2), using apixaban in 2 studies and rivaroxaban in 1; thromboprophylaxis probably increases major bleeding slightly and was judged a small effect, and the panel concluded that the balance probably favors the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the intermediate-risk group and favors their use in the high-risk group, noting costs vary by risk and are likely more cost-effective if applied in the high-risk group.

### Successful model for guideline implementation to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis: venous thromboembolism prevention in the ambulatory cancer clinic | JCO oncology practice… [^115VJTzf]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose: Patients and Methods: Results: Conclusion: Introduction 1–6National guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer recommend an individual patient risk assessment and targeted prophylaxis for patients with cancer at the highest risk of VTE 7–9because of the variable rates of reported bleeding risk and the lack of a clear survival advantage. 6, 10However, data from the Association of Community Cancer Centers reported that only 9% of oncology practitioners reported using a structured risk assessment tool in the outpatient setting, and 44% of practices reported < 10% of their outpatients with cancer had clear documentation of VTE risk. 10aA successful model for guidelines implementation is needed to increase VTE risk assessment and prevention in patients with cancer. 11, 12The most well-studied and validated VTE risk assessment tool was developed by Khorana et al 13and focuses on outpatients with cancer initiating chemotherapy.

This risk stratification tool assesses prechemotherapy WBC count, hemoglobin and platelet count, body mass index, and tumor type, and is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network to identify patients with cancer at high risk for VTE. Practical and evidence-based approaches for implementing risk assessments and prophylaxis prescribing in the oncology clinic are not available. 14Primary prophylaxis with LMWH reduces the risk of symptomatic VTE in outpatients with cancer treated with chemotherapy. 6Direct oral anticoagulants are also effective. In the AVERT trial among intermediate- to high-risk patients, a significant reduction in VTE was seen in the apixaban group compared with the group receiving placebo. 17In both trials, an increase in bleeding was seen mitigating some of the benefits of treatment.

Given these findings, systems of care that incorporate both thrombosis and bleeding risk as well as individualized patient preference are a necessity. In the VTEPACC model, 50% of patients received DOAC prophylaxis, and pharmacy evaluation for drug interactions with both DOAC and LMWH were performed. We also observed that DOACs had the lowest number of drug interactions.

Primary prophylaxis for ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy — Recommendation 13 states: For ambulatory patients with cancer at low risk for thrombosis receiving systemic therapy, the ASH guideline panel recommends no thromboprophylaxis over parenteral thromboprophylaxis (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). For ambulatory patients with cancer at intermediate risk for thrombosis receiving systemic therapy, the ASH guideline panel suggests no prophylaxis over parenteral thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). For ambulatory patients with cancer at high risk for thrombosis receiving systemic therapy, the ASH guideline panel suggests parenteral thromboprophylaxis (LMWH) over no thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). Classification of patients as being low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for VTE should be based on a validated risk-assessment tool (ie, Khorana score) complemented by clinical judgment and experience, and the panel noted that, even for patients at high risk for thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis should be used with caution in those with a high risk for bleeding.

### Updated meta-analysis on prevention of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients [^113M1Rev]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The methods for this meta-analysis are in accordance with "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)".

Study objectives and outcomes

The primary objective of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies was to assess the efficacy of anticoagulant prophylaxis in preventing VTE in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. The secondary objective was to assess the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis in these patients.

The primary outcome of the study was objectively confirmed VTE, defined as the composite of pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis adjudicated according to the criteria and procedures of the individual studies. The secondary outcome was major bleeding defined according to the criteria of the individual studies. Ancillary outcomes were symptomatic VTE and fatal VTE.

Search strategy and study inclusion criteria

We performed unrestricted searches in MEDLINE and Scopus using the terms "cancer AND venous thromboembolism AND prevention" and "cancer AND venous thromboembolism AND prophylaxis". Studies were independently selected by two authors (CB and MV) using predetermined criteria (detaied in the Online Supplementary Data).

Randomized controlled trials on the prevention of VTE in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis and results pooled into two groups: (i) studies with VTE as the primary endpoint; and (ii) studies with death as the primary endpoint.

The kappa statistic was used to assess the agreement between reviewers regarding the studies selected.

Hospitalized medical patients with cancer — post-discharge thromboprophylaxis is addressed as follows: The ASH guideline panel suggests discontinuing thromboprophylaxis at the time of hospital discharge rather than continuing beyond the discharge date (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state that continuation may be considered for selected ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy and whose risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is considered to outweigh the risk of bleeding. Reported benefits of extended prophylaxis were small, including for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT): RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.91; ARR, 3 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 1–4 fewer per 1000 using a baseline risk of 0.74%, for mortality: RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.08; ARR, 1 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 0 fewer to 3 more per 1000, and for pulmonary embolism (PE): RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39–1.03; ARR, 3 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 0–5 fewer per 1000 using a baseline risk of 0.74%. Harms included increased major bleeding with RR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.42–2.91; ARI, 3 more per 1000; 95% CI, 1–6 more per 1000 and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with RR, 3.01; 95% CI, 0.12–73.93, with only 1 reported HIT event in the extended prophylaxis group (n = 2975) and 0 events in the group discontinuing prophylaxis at discharge (n = 2988). The panel concluded that the balance probably favors discontinuation and that the cost-effectiveness also probably favors discontinuation of thromboprophylaxis at time of discharge; ambulatory patients with cancer receiving cancer therapy and at high risk for thrombosis are an exception.

### Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^116uN8bD]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In these patients VTE is associated with substantial morbidity and complicates the clinical management of cancer. Emerging research indicates a probable detrimental effect of VTE on cancer survival. Although VTE may develop at any stage of cancer disease, the risk of VTE is particularly high in association with three clinical settings including surgery for cancer, use of a central vein catheter (CVC) and chemotherapy. Guidelines recommend post-operative prophylaxis (for at least 7–10 days) for patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. A prolonged prophylaxis (for upto four post-operative weeks) is recommended in cancer patients at high risk for VTE. The role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in the prevention of CVC-related thrombosis remains controversial. The PROTECHT study has recently evaluated the benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, showing a statistically significant 50% relative risk reduction in symptomatic thromboembolic events. The international guidelines currently agree in non-recommending routine prophylaxis in ambulatory patients who receive anticancer chemotherapy but suggest an individual risk-based evaluation. To better identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE, simple predictive models have been validated. Further intervention studies are currently on-going to explore the benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis in individual high-risk groups of patients. The long-term treatment of cancer-related VTE is based on therapeutic doses of LMWH in preference to warfarin. The optimal duration of antithrombotic treatment in cancer patients remains to be fully defined.

### Parenteral anticoagulation in ambulatory patients with cancer [^117MNVqf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation may improve survival in patients with cancer through an antitumor effect in addition to the perceived antithrombotic effect.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral anticoagulants in ambulatory patients with cancer who, typically, are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.

Search Methods

A comprehensive search included (1) an electronic search (February 2013) of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2013; accessed via OVID) and EMBASE(1980 to February 2013; accessed via OVID); (2) handsearching of conference proceedings; (3) checking of references of included studies; (4) use of the 'related citation' feature in PubMed and (5) a search for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of parenteral anticoagulation in ambulatory patients with cancer. Typically, these patients are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Using a standardized form we extracted data in duplicate on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest including all-cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thrombosis (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction), major bleeding, minor bleeding and quality of life.

Main Results

Of 9559 identified citations, 15 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria. These trials enrolled 7622 participants for whom follow-up data were available. In all included RCTs the intervention consisted of heparin (either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin). Overall, heparin may have a small effect on mortality at 12 months and 24 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.01 and RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00, respectively). Heparin therapy was associated with a statistically and clinically important reduction in venous thromboembolism (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74) and a clinically important increase in the risk of minor bleeding (RR 1.32; 95% 1.02 to 1.71). Results failed to show or to exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of heparin on major bleeding (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85) or quality of life. Our confidence in the effect estimates (i.e. quality of evidence) was high for symptomatic venous thromboembolism, moderate for mortality, major bleeding and minor bleeding, and low for quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Heparin may have a small effect on mortality at 12 months and 24 months. It is associated with a reduction in venous thromboembolism and a likely increase in minor bleeding. Future research should further investigate the survival benefit of different types of anticoagulants in patients with different types and stages of cancer. The decision for a patient with cancer to start heparin therapy for survival benefit should balance the benefits and downsides, and should integrate the patient's values and preferences.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^111iFJ3m]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Ambulatory cancer patients receiving systemic therapy — oral thromboprophylaxis guidance specifies that the ASH guideline panel recommends no thromboprophylaxis over thromboprophylaxis with VKAs (strong recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of benefits but high certainty in the evidence of harms). For ambulatory patients at high risk for thrombosis receiving systemic therapy, the panel suggests thromboprophylaxis with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC; apixaban or rivaroxaban) over no thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks note that classification of low, intermediate, or high VTE risk should be based on a validated risk assessment tool (ie, Khorana score) with clinical judgment, thromboprophylaxis should be used with caution for those at high risk for bleeding, and apixaban and rivaroxaban are the only DOACs evaluated for primary prophylaxis in this setting.

### Anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in ambulatory cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jMRSv]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of arterial thrombotic events (ATEs) is high among patients on systemic anticancer therapies. Despite the efficacy of anticoagulants in the prevention of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, it is unknown whether anticoagulation is effective to prevent ATEs.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of anticoagulants in ATE prevention among ambulatory cancer patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic review using Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to May 21, 2022, and included studies comparing oral or parenteral anticoagulation with no anticoagulation among ambulatory patients receiving systemic anticancer therapy with no other indication for anticoagulation. The primary outcome was ATE (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, intra-abdominal arterial embolism, or peripheral artery occlusion). The secondary outcomes were major and nonmajor bleeding and all-cause mortality.

Results

Fourteen randomized trials involving low-molecular-weight heparins, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin were included. ATEs were captured as coefficacy endpoints or adverse events. Anticoagulant use was not associated with a reduction in ATEs compared with placebo or standard treatment (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.50–1.04; P = 0.08; I² = 0%). RRs of major and minor bleeding were 1.56 (95% CI: 1.12–2.17) and 2.25 (95% CI: 1.45–3.48) with anticoagulant use. In 13 trials that reported all-cause mortality, risk of death was not reduced with anticoagulants (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95–1.02; P = 0.38; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Anticoagulants did not reduce ATE risk among ambulatory patients on systemic anticancer therapy and were associated with increased bleeding. Based on the current data, anticoagulants have a limited role in ATE prevention in this population as a whole.

### Apixaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: rational and design of the AVERT trial [^111RVpX2]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with active cancer have a heightened risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This risk is further increased by the initiation of chemotherapy. Although previous studies have suggested that the use of parenteral thromboprophylaxis in all ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy significantly decreases the rate of VTE, current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend routine use of thromboprophylaxis in this patient population. A major criticism of these studies has been the inclusion of patients at lower risk for VTE, which may have diluted the potential beneficial effect of the parenteral thromboprophylaxis. It is therefore imperative to appropriately risk stratify ambulatory cancer patients using a validated scoring system (e.g. Khorana risk score) in order to identify those most likely to benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, may offer a convenient and safe option for thromboprophylaxis. As such, AVERT will randomize 574 ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy who are at high-risk for VTE (as defined by a Khorana score of ≥ 2) to Apixaban 2.5 mg BID versus placebo. The primary study outcome will be the first episode of objectively documented symptomatic or incidental VTE (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) within the first 6 months (180 days ± 3) following initiation of the blinded study drug for both intervention and placebo groups. The secondary safety outcomes include major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and overall survival rates. This study will hopefully offer evidence regarding the benefit of apixaban in ambulatory patients at high risk for VTE receiving chemotherapy.

Thrombophilia testing for individuals with a family history of VTE and/or family history of thrombophilia to prevent cancer-associated VTE

For ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy with a family history of VTE, should thrombophilia testing (using a panel of tests) be performed to guide the use of thromboprophylaxis?

Recommendation 23

For ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy who have a family history of VTE and are otherwise determined to be at low or intermediate risk for VTE, the ASH guideline panel suggests testing for hereditary thrombophilia. The panel suggests ambulatory thromboprophylaxis for patients with thrombophilia and no thromboprophylaxis for patients without thrombophilia (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- This question only addresses patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy, without a personal history of VTE who are at low or intermediate risk for VTE. The ASH VTE guidelines on prevention and treatment in patients with cancer suggest using DOAC prophylaxis for all ambulatory patients with cancer with high VTE risk as assessed by a validated risk assessment tool complemented by clinical judgment and experience.
- Patient preference is an important factor to consider, as undergoing the thrombophilia test, knowing the positive test result, and receiving additional medication can be an added burden.
- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that ambulatory patients with cancer with thrombophilia would receive thromboprophylaxis, and ambulatory patients with cancer without thrombophilia would not receive thromboprophylaxis.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first-degree relative with VTE.
- This recommendation does not address homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^113MQvPA]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For ambulatory patients with cancer who are at low or intermediate risk for VTE as determined by a validated risk assessment tool and who have a family history of VTE, this thrombophilia guideline suggests testing for hereditary thrombophilia to guide the use of thromboprophylaxis during systemic treatment. This recommendation is novel and not discussed in previously published guidance documents, including the ASH VTE guideline on treatment and prevention of VTE for patients with cancer. However, the ASH guideline on VTE in cancersuggests providing thromboprophylaxis to patients at high risk for other considerations, and therefore, considering the additional risk associated with thrombophilia, this new recommendation should be seen as a new application of an established risk stratification approach.

### Primary prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [^112zjYYU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer disease. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy but the safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched 3 May 2011) and CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2). The authors searched clinical trials registries and reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonists (VKA), direct thrombin inhibitors, direct factor Xa inhibitors or mechanical intervention to no intervention or placebo; or comparing two different anticoagulants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted on methodological quality, patients, interventions and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively.

Main Results

Nine RCTs with a total of 3538 patients were considered. None of the RCTs tested UFH, fondaparinux, direct factor Xa inhibitors or mechanical interventions. Overall, the risk of bias was low in most of the studies. LMWH, when compared with inactive control, significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.93) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). The number needed to treat to prevent a symptomatic VTE was 60. LMWH was associated with a 60% increase in major bleeding when compared with inactive control, although this was not statistically significant (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.60; I(2) = 10%). There was a 45% reduction in overall VTE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.88; I(2) = 0%) while for symptomatic pulmonary embolism, asymptomatic VTE, minor bleeding and one-year mortality the differences between the LMWH and control groups were not statistically significant. The effect of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin on preventing symptomatic VTE, measured in only one study, was not statistically significant (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20). In one RCT of patients with myeloma, LMWH was associated with a 67% reduction in symptomatic VTE (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83) compared with warfarin, with no differences in major bleeding. Antithrombin, evaluated in one study on paediatric patients, had no significant effect on VTE nor major bleeding when compared with inactive control.

Authors' Conclusions

Primary thromboprophylaxis with LMWH significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. However, the lack of power hampers definite conclusions on the effects on major safety outcomes, which mandates additional studies to determine the risk to benefit ratio of LMWH in this setting.

### Successful model for guideline implementation to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis: venous thromboembolism prevention in the ambulatory cancer clinic [^114X8Ss8]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE:

Guidelines recommend venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment in outpatients with cancer and pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in selected patients at high risk for VTE. Although validated risk stratification tools are available, < 10% of oncologists use a risk assessment tool, and rates of VTE prophylaxis in high-risk patients are low in practice. We hypothesized that implementation of a systems-based program that uses the electronic health record (EHR) and offers personalized VTE prophylaxis recommendations would increase VTE risk assessment rates in patients initiating outpatient chemotherapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Venous Thromboembolism Prevention in the Ambulatory Cancer Clinic (VTEPACC) was a multidisciplinary program implemented by nurses, oncologists, pharmacists, hematologists, advanced practice providers, and quality partners. We prospectively identified high-risk patients using the Khorana and Protecht scores (≥ 3 points) via an EHR-based risk assessment tool. Patients with a predicted high risk of VTE during treatment were offered a hematology consultation to consider VTE prophylaxis. Results of the consultation were communicated to the treating oncologist, and clinical outcomes were tracked.

RESULTS:

A total of 918 outpatients with cancer initiating cancer-directed therapy were evaluated. VTE monthly education rates increased from < 5% before VTEPACC to 81.6% (standard deviation [SD], 11.9; range, 63.6%-97.7%) during the implementation phase and 94.7% (SD, 4.9; range, 82.1%-100%) for the full 2-year postimplementation phase. In the postimplementation phase, 213 patients (23.2%) were identified as being at high risk for developing a VTE. Referrals to hematology were offered to 151 patients (71%), with 141 patients (93%) being assessed and 93.8% receiving VTE prophylaxis.

CONCLUSION:

VTEPACC is a successful model for guideline implementation to provide VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis in outpatients. Methods applied can readily translate into practice and overcome the current implementation gaps between guidelines and clinical practice.

### Prediction and prevention of cancer-associated thromboembolism [^116C3omc]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous and arterial thromboembolism are prevalent, highly burdensome, and associated with risk of worse outcomes for patients with cancer. Risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) varies widely across specific cancer subpopulations. The ability to predict risk of cancer-associated VTE is critical because an optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy is best achieved by targeting high-risk patients with cancer and avoiding prophylaxis in patients with cancer at low risk for VTE. A validated risk tool for solid tumors has been available for a decade. Newer tools have focused on specific populations, such as patients with multiple myeloma. Emerging studies continue to optimize risk prediction approaches in patients with cancer. Recent randomized trials have specifically addressed risk-adapted thromboprophylaxis using direct oral anticoagulants, and revised guidelines have included these new data to formulate recommendations for outpatient thromboprophylaxis. Implementation science approaches to enhance use of outpatient prophylaxis in the context of these guideline changes are under way. However, major knowledge gaps remain, including a lack of data for inpatient thromboprophylaxis in the cancer setting and a lack of formal tools for identifying risk of bleeding. This review describes optimal approaches to risk prediction and patient selection for primary pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis of cancer-associated VTE, addresses barriers to implementing these practices, and highlights strategies to overcome them. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) varies widely among patients with cancer. Individual risk can be determined using validated approaches. Inpatient and postsurgical thromboprophylaxis is more widely accepted. However, most patients with cancer develop VTE in the outpatient setting. Recent randomized trials have demonstrated benefit to risk-adapted outpatient thromboprophylaxis. High-risk patients may therefore be considered for outpatient thromboprophylaxis as recommended by recently updated guidelines. System-wide implementation approaches are necessary to improve compliance with prophylaxis.

### Primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients with a high khorana score: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114M431v]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines suggest thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory cancer patients starting chemotherapy with an intermediate to high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) according to Khorana score. Data on thromboprophylaxis efficacy in different Khorana score risk groups remain ambiguous. We sought to evaluate thromboprophylaxis in patients with an intermediate- to high-risk (≥ 2 points) Khorana score and an intermediate-risk score (2 points) or high-risk score (≥ 3 points) separately. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thromboprophylaxis with placebo or standard care in ambulatory cancer patients. Outcomes were VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated in a profile-likelihood random-effects model. Six RCTs were identified, involving 4626 cancer patients. Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) significantly reduced VTE risk in intermediate- to high-risk (RR, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.67), intermediate-risk (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36–0.83), and high-risk patients (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28–0.67); the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were 25 (intermediate to high risk), 34 (intermediate risk), and 17 (high risk), respectively. There was no significant difference in major bleeding (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.69–1.67) or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–1.01). The numbers needed to harm (NNHs) for major bleeding in intermediate- to high-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients were 1000, -500, and 334, respectively. The overall NNH was lower in DOAC studies (100) versus LMWH studies (-500). These findings indicate thromboprophylaxis effectively reduces the risk of VTE in patients with an intermediate- to high-risk Khorana score, although the NNT is twice as high for intermediate-risk patients compared with high-risk patients.

VTE Rates in Outpatients With Cancer Initiating Therapy on VTEPACC

The major clinical outcome tracked after VTEPACC initiation was VTE in the first 6 months of therapy. Patients identified as being at high risk for VTE during initial risk assessment had an 8.0% risk of VTE at 6 months during the 2-year study phase. This compares with a VTE rate of 12.8% in the implementation phase. The VTE rate at 6 months in the study phase was 6.1% in the medium-risk group and 2.1% in the low-risk group.

### The clinical applicability of primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with pancreatic cancer [^1158FsLZ]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thromboembolism is a leading cause of death in ambulatory patients with cancer. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a very high risk of developing venous thromboembolism, especially within the first 6 months of diagnosis. Although primary thromboprophylaxis could reduce this risk, there are unresolved questions concerning choice of agents for anticoagulation, duration of anticoagulation treatment, and criteria for patient selection. Furthermore, the current clinical guidelines on primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with pancreatic cancer are ambiguous. This review seeks out to understand and critically appraise the evidence supporting the use of primary thromboprophylaxis in patients with pancreatic cancer and its clinical applicability.

Discussion

In our systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with over 10,000 participants, we did not detect a difference in ATE with the use of anticoagulation among ambulatory cancer patients undergoing anticancer therapy (Central Illustration). On the other hand, the risks of major and nonmajor bleeding were increased with anticoagulant use. All-cause mortality was similar between the anticoagulation and control groups.

Central Illustration
Anticoagulation and Risk of Arterial Thrombosis and Bleeding in Ambulatory Cancer Patients

The figure describes the overall results of the study by illustrating the comparative effects of anticoagulation and no anticoagulation among ambulatory cancer patients starting systemic therapy on arterial thrombotic events and major bleeding.

The effectiveness of oral or parenteral anticoagulants to prevent ATE in cancer remains a contentious topic of debate. Although international guidelines recommend the use of low-dose anticoagulants among outpatients receiving systemic anticancer therapy at high risk of VTE, there is paucity of systematic data synthesis on the prevention of cancer-associated arterial thrombotic events. Importantly, although the risks of ATE in malignancy are elevated compared with noncancer populations, their absolute incidence appears to be 5-fold lower than those of VTE among patients with cancer. Therefore, understanding the impact of anticoagulants on ATE among ambulatory cancer patients is crucial to optimize primary prevention strategies for cancer-associated thrombosis.

### Updated meta-analysis on prevention of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients [^111gRiRF]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The second concern about the use of prophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is the inconvenience of prolonged parenteral therapy. A not negligible number of patients in the context of the selected clinical studies discontinued anticoagulant prophylaxis for reasons other than thrombosis or bleeding (about 30%). Hence, it may be problematic for large numbers of patients to tolerate longer durations of prophylaxis. In this scenario, the availability of oral anticoagulants that can be used with no laboratory monitoring and with the potential for few drug-drug interactions could solve at least the issue of parenteral administration and make prophylaxis acceptable also for extended periods. Three randomized studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban (2 studies) – and rivaroxaban (1 study)for the prevention of VTE in cancer patients and provided promising results. In particular, our meta-analysis found similar risk reductions with parenteral or oral agents. Direct oral anticoagulants could make prophylaxis feasible for ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy as they will be more acceptable than parenteral agents for those at high risk of VTE.

An additional concern regards the risk-to-benefit ratio of anticoagulant prophylaxis. The pooled incidence of major bleeding was 2% in patients randomized to anticoagulant prophylaxis, with high variability across individual studies as shown by significant heterogeneity. Differences in study populations across individual studies could have had a major role as determinants of heterogeneity. No significant increase in the risk of major bleeding in patients randomized to receive anticoagulant prophylaxis, compared to the risk in controls, was found in this meta-analysis when all studies were pooled together. This finding is reassuring as cancer patients are known to have an increased risk of bleeding, mainly related to the primary site of the cancer, the need for invasive procedures and thrombocytopenia. However, the analysis on risk of major bleeding in high-quality studies and that in studies with VTE as the primary outcome showed a marginally significant increase in the risk of major bleeding by about 50%. Additional evidence on risk factors for major bleeding in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy could help decision-making concerning the use of prophylaxis.

In our study, we did not observe a difference in all-cause mortality with the use of anticoagulation. The association between anticoagulation and overall survival in patients with cancer had been observed previously, although more recent study-level meta-analyses and an individual patient meta-analysis did not corroborate this finding. This finding from our meta-analysis is further supported by a recently published randomized controlled trial enrolling 614 adults with colorectal cancer comparing extended (8 weeks) to inpatient-only tinzaparin administration after surgical resection, which was halted for futility with no difference in 3-year disease-free survival or 5-year overall survival.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in cancer: a consensus statement of major guidelines panels and call to action [^114J5mH1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly frequent complication of cancer and its treatments, and is associated with worsened mortality and morbidity in patients with cancer.

Design

The Italian Association of Medical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the French National Federation of the League of Centers Against Cancer, and the European Society of Medical Oncology have recently published guidelines regarding VTE in patients with cancer. This review, authored by a working group of members from these panels, focuses on the methodology and areas of consensus and disagreement in the various clinical guidelines as well as directions for future research.

Results

There is broad consensus regarding the importance of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cancer, including prolonged prophylaxis in high-risk surgical patients. Prophylaxis is not currently recommended for ambulatory patients with cancer (with exceptions) or for central venous catheters. All of the panels agree that low molecular weight heparins are preferred for the long-term treatment of VTE in cancer. Areas that warrant further research include the benefit of prophylaxis in the ambulatory setting, the risk/benefit ratio of prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with cancer, an understanding of incidental VTE, and the impact of anticoagulation on survival.

Conclusion

We call for a sustained research effort to investigate the clinical issues identified here to reduce the burden of VTE and its consequences in patients with cancer.

### Blood clots, or thrombosis, in patients with cancer… [^115aDoGK]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Multiple factors increase the risk of blood clots in patients with cancer. Cancer cells can produce clotting factors and increase their activation. Patients with cancer can have higher numbers of blood cells and genetic changes that increase clotting factor activity. Higher-stage and certain types of cancers have higher risk because they have genetic changes or produce factors that increase clotting activation. Some cancers can also lead to thrombosis by compressing or damaging blood vessels. Venous catheters and cancer treatments can irritate or damage the lining of blood vessels, causing inflammation and blood clotting. Catheters also reduce blood flow in the veins, which can cause thrombosis. Also, being hospitalized or having surgery can increase the risk of thrombosis. When blood clots form in veins, they can block normal blood flow.

Patients may experience redness, swelling, warmth, or pain when a DVT forms in an arm or leg. If the DVT becomes a PE, patients may experience trouble breathing, low oxygen levels, chest pain, or rapid heartbeat. Sometimes blood clots do not cause any symptoms and are found during imaging studies for other reasons. When a DVT is suspected, your clinician will use Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate the blood flow in the veins of the affected leg or arm. If a PE is suspected, your clinician may order a computed tomography scan to evaluate blood flow in your lungs. Blood clots are treated with medications that prevent blood from clotting, which are called anticoagulants or "blood thinners. " They are usually taken as pills but are also given as injections. Clinicians choose an anticoagulant based on the patient's other medical problems and medications, risk of bleeding, financial considerations, and preferences.

Clots often resolve after 3 to 6 months of treatment, but most patients with cancer will take their anticoagulant for longer to prevent recurrence. The main risk of anticoagulants is bleeding, which is also common in patients with cancer. In some situations, your clinician may recommend taking an anticoagulant to prevent clots. This includes after surgery, while in the hospital, or for certain high-risk cancers. National Blood Clot Alliancewww. stoptheclot. org/about-clots/cancer-and-blood-clots/ Cancer.

### Updated meta-analysis on prevention of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients [^116vaWdW]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study also has some strengths. This is a meta-analysis of randomized studies, with results consistent across different sensitivity analyses and no heterogeneity. Moreover, differently from previous meta-analyses, we limited our primary efficacy analysis to randomized clinical trials with VTE as the primary outcome. Even though high-quality trials with death as the primary outcome have been conducted in this setting, our choice was aimed at reducing heterogeneity related to the use of therapeutic regimens of anticoagulants, to the longer duration of anticoagulant treatment and to gaining a more accurate assessment of the incidence of VTE during follow-up. However, the pooled analysis of all the trials with VTE or death as the primary outcome confirmed the efficacy of anticoagulants without heterogeneity. Moreover, to remain on the safe side, the primary safety analysis of major bleeding in our study included all the trials and did not show any safety signal.

In conclusion, we found that anticoagulant prophylaxis is effective and acceptably safe in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. The selection of the most suitable candidates (patients at increased risk of VTE) for anticoagulant prophylaxis among ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is a crucial issue and further studies are required to optimize the efficacy of this intervention.

### Successful model for guideline implementation to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis: venous thromboembolism prevention in the ambulatory cancer clinic [^113n3mpK]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines have expanded the number of drug options (apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH) for primary prophylaxis in high-risk patients with cancer. Primary prophylaxis with LMWH reduces the risk of symptomatic VTE in outpatients with cancer treated with chemotherapy. Direct oral anticoagulants are also effective. In the AVERT trial (Apixaban for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in High-Risk Ambulatory Cancer Patients) among intermediate- to high-risk patients (Khorana score ≥ 2), a significant reduction in VTE was seen in the apixaban group (4.2%) compared with the group receiving placebo (10.2%; hazard ratio, 0.41). Rivoraxaban efficacy in the primary prevention of a combined endpoint of symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE was also suggested in the CASSINI trial (Rivoraxaban for Preventing Venous Thromboembolism in High-Risk Ambulatory Patients With Cancer) in patients with a Khorana score ≥ 2 initiating cancer-directed therapy. In both trials, an increase in bleeding was seen mitigating some of the benefits of treatment. Given these findings, systems of care that incorporate both thrombosis and bleeding risk as well as individualized patient preference are a necessity. In the VTEPACC model, 50% of patients received DOAC prophylaxis, and pharmacy evaluation for drug interactions with both DOAC and LMWH were performed. We also observed that DOACs had the lowest number of drug interactions.

### Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^1143rGA5]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Robust evidence remains scarce in guiding best practice in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients living with cancer. Recommendations from major consensus guidelines are largely based on extrapolated data from trials performed mostly in noncancer patients, observational studies and registries, studies using surrogate outcomes, and underpowered randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, a personalized approach based on individual risk assessment is uniformly recommended for inpatient and outpatient thromboprophylaxis and there is consensus that anticoagulant prophylaxis is warranted in selected patients with a high risk of thrombosis. Prediction tools for estimating the risk of thrombosis in the hospital setting have not been validated, but the use of prophylaxis in the ambulatory setting in those with a high Khorana score is under active investigation. Symptomatic and incidental thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulant therapy, but little is known about the optimal duration. Pharmacologic options for prophylaxis and treatment are still restricted to unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists because there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of target-specific, non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulants. Although these agents offer practical advantages over traditional anticoagulants, potential drug interaction with chemotherapeutic agents, gastrointestinal problems, hepatic and renal impairment, and the lack of rapid reversal agents are important limitations that may reduce the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with active cancer. Clinicians and patients are encouraged to participate in clinical trials to advance the care of patients with cancer-associated thrombosis.

### Unmet clinical needs in the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^114zFeqi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Based on accumulating evidence, the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer-associated VTE have been changed over the years. Recently, the introduction in clinical practice of the direct oral anticoagulants has radically changed the management of cancer-associated VTE for their easier use and non-inferior efficacy-safety profile compared to low-molecular-weight heparins. However, the heterogeneity of the cancer population in terms of site, type and stage of the malignancy, the presence of comorbidities, and the variability in cancer treatment and prognosis represent major challenges in the management of VTE in patients with cancer. In the present review, we will discuss clinical questions that represent unsolved issues in the setting of cancer-associated VTE and provide an overview on recent evidence on this topic: primary prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and in cancer surgical patients, need of long-term anticoagulation in cancer patients, treatment of VTE in cancer patients at increased bleeding risk and in special categories such as incidental VTE, splanchnic vein thrombosis or catheter-related thrombosis.

### Primary prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [^1139o3uv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in February 2012.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5), and clinical trials registries (up to June 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no intervention or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted on methodological quality, patients, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively.

Main Results

We identified 12 additional RCTs (6323 patients) in the updated search so that this update considered 21 trials with a total of 9861 patients, all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in patients with advanced cancer. Overall, the risk of bias varied from low to high. One large trial of 3212 patients found a 64% (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.60) reduction of symptomatic VTE with the ultra-low molecular weight heparin (uLMWH) semuloparin relative to placebo, with no apparent difference in major bleeding (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.00). LMWH, when compared with inactive control, significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.75; no heterogeneity, Tau(2) = 0%) with similar rates of major bleeding events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.23). In patients with multiple myeloma, LMWH was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE when compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83), while the difference between LMWH and aspirin was not statistically significant (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17). No major bleeding was observed in the patients treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against inactive control and found an incidence of major bleeding of 1% in both study groups while not reporting on VTE. When compared with placebo, warfarin was associated with a statistically insignificant reduction of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20). Antithrombin, evaluated in one study involving paediatric patients, had no significant effect on VTE nor major bleeding when compared with inactive control. The new oral factor Xa inhibitor apixaban was evaluated in a phase-II dose finding study that suggested a promising low rate of major bleeding (2.1% versus 3.3%) and symptomatic VTE (1.1% versus 10%) in comparison with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

In this update, we confirmed that primary thromboprophylaxis with LMWH significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. In addition, the uLMWH semuloparin significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE. However, the broad confidence intervals around the estimates for major bleeding suggest caution in the use of anticoagulation and mandate additional studies to determine the risk to benefit ratio of anticoagulants in this setting. Despite the encouraging results of this review, routine prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients cannot be recommended before safety issues are adequately addressed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis [^115pDQ3s]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in patients with cancer and is greatest in those with cancers of the pancreas, stomach, brain, lung and ovary, late stage disease and in those undergoing treatment including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or surgery. VTE in patients with cancer is associated with a variety of adverse consequences including an increased risk of VTE recurrence, major bleeding, and early mortality. A VTE risk score for ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy has been extensively validated and has been used to select high risk patients for thromboprophylaxis trials. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of these trials have confirmed that LMWHs can significantly reduce the risk of VTE in patients with cancer. While the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved for the general population, previous guideline panels discouraged their use due to a lack of cancer-specific data. Recently RCTs for the treatment of established VTE in patients with cancer have demonstrated that the risk of recurrent VTE is lower while the risk of bleeding greater with DOACs compared to LMWH. Two thromboprophylaxis trials comparing low dose DOACs to placebo in high risk patients receiving cancer therapy have recently reported similar rates of VTE occurrence at 6 months in the control arms. A meta-analysis of the pooled results from these trials in higher risk ambulatory patients receiving cancer therapy confirmed a significant reduction in overall VTE incidence as well as pre-planned secondary outcomes on treatment. Several clinical practice guidelines addressing VTE in patients with malignant disease have been updated including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The addition of DOACs as an option for the management of VTE in patients with cancer is the latest major change to previous guidelines issued by these organizations. The updated recommendations from these guidelines are summarized in this review.

### Risk prediction for cancer-associated thrombosis in ambulatory patients with cancer: past, present and future [^116DEiee]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a preventable disease, thus, in a number of clinical situations primary thromboprophylaxis has been proposed. Although we now know that cancer is one of the most important risk factors for VTE, primary prophylactic anticoagulation is only widely established for high-risk hospitalized patients and peri- and postoperatively after major cancer surgery. Long-term primary thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients has been demonstrated to be effective. However, drawbacks are the additional burden of drug use, the lack of a reduced mortality benefit and costs. Only with reliable risk prediction the recommendation of primary thromboprophylaxis will convince oncologists and patients of its usefulness. This review deals with clinical and laboratory parameters and their combination in risk assessment models to define patients at high and low risk of VTE, in whom targeted thromboprophylaxis could best be applied. At present 90% of patients in the so-called intermediate- to high-risk group according to the Khorana score still do not develop VTE during the first 6 months, whereas there is a high absolute number of patients in the so-called low-risk groups that develop VTE. Improvements in risk assessment have been made by new risk prediction models. However, additional refinements to further improve risk prediction and their applicability in clinical practice are still needed.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline: recommendations for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer [^113yjFUt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop guideline recommendations for the use of anticoagulation in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer.

Methods

A comprehensive systematic review of the medical literature on the prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients was conducted and reviewed by a panel of content and methodology experts. Following discussion of the results, the panel drafted recommendations for the use of anticoagulation in patients with malignant disease.

Results

The results of randomized controlled trials of primary and secondary VTE medical prophylaxis, surgical prophylaxis, VTE treatment, and the impact of anticoagulation on survival of patients with cancer were reviewed. Recommendations were developed on the prevention of VTE in hospitalized, ambulatory, and surgical cancer patients as well as patients with established VTE, and for use of anticoagulants in cancer patients without VTE to improve survival.

Conclusion

Recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology VTE Guideline Panel include (1) all hospitalized cancer patients should be considered for VTE prophylaxis with anticoagulants in the absence of bleeding or other contraindications; (2) routine prophylaxis of ambulatory cancer patients with anticoagulation is not recommended, with the exception of patients receiving thalidomide or lenalidomide; (3) patients undergoing major surgery for malignant disease should be considered for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis; (4) low molecular weight heparin represents the preferred agent for both the initial and continuing treatment of cancer patients with established VTE; and (5) the impact of anticoagulants on cancer patient survival requires additional study and cannot be recommended at present.

### Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical and surgical oncology patients [^1143V4r5]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Additional appropriately powered clinical trials are required to show the benefits and/or risks of mechanical, pharmacological, and inferior vena caval filter thromboprophylaxis in the cancer population. Pharmacological trials with new agents are best conducted in patient populations with specific tumours, particularly in high-risk tumour groups (e.g. pancreas, stomach, kidney, bladder, uterus, and lung) and in medical oncology patients. With the shift of emphasis of care to the community, ambulatory and hospitalised patients should be considered for clinical trials.

Patients with cancer are a particularly vulnerable group for whom appropriate assessment and adequate thromboprophylaxis are essential for those undergoing surgery. All other patients with malignancy require regular assessment and appropriate treatment, according to their risk of thrombosis. The forthcoming National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence final guidelines, 'Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalised Patients', in early 2010 will provide a framework for improved quality thromboprophylaxis care in the United Kingdom, implemented at the hospital Trust level.

### Anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in ambulatory cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178xC6U]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the well-established association between cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE), the link between malignancy and arterial thrombotic events (ATEs), consisting of ischemic strokes, myocardial infarctions, and peripheral arterial events, remains under-recognized. Because of patient-, disease-, and treatment-specific factors that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulability, patients with cancer have a higher risk of ATE compared with matched noncancer cohorts. A recent systematic review of observational studies demonstrated differences in ATE risks by the site of primary malignancy, whereas systemic therapies such as antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors further increase the risk of ATE among patients with cancer.,

Although low-dose anticoagulants are efficacious, safe, and cost-effective means of VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients, it is unknown whether they are effective in the prevention of ATE in this patient group. Given the absence of clinical guidelines on ATE prevention among patients with cancer, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation on ATE prevention in ambulatory cancer patients receiving anticancer therapy.

Harms and burden

Potential harms and burden of thrombophilia testing and providing thromboprophylaxis to patients with cancer with thrombophilia would be an increase in major bleeding. The calculations based on a total of 24 studies showed that a strategy of thrombophilia testing followed by thromboprophylaxis for patients with cancer with thrombophilia and not providing thromboprophylaxis for patients with cancer without thrombophilia would result in 0.33 more major bleeds (ranging from 0.10 fewer to 2.02 more) per 1000 patients per 6 months in those at low risk for VTE, and in 0.74 more major bleeds (ranging from 0.22 fewer to 4.49 more) per 1000 patients per 6 months in those at intermediate risk for VTE, compared with a no-testing strategy.

Certainty in the evidence of effects

We rated the overall certainty in the evidence of effects as very low because our estimates were based on calculations with serious indirectness and imprecision of the estimates.

Other EtD criteria and considerations

The panel determined that on balance, with small desirable effects (preventing VTE during ambulatory cancer treatment) and trivial undesirable effects (more major bleeding) for patients with cancer with a first-degree family history of VTE, thrombophilia testing followed by thromboprophylaxis for patients with thrombophilia would probably be favored.

The panel did consider the potential moderate costs of the intervention by testing for thrombophilia and the subsequent costs of thromboprophylaxis. The intervention of thrombophilia testing was considered acceptable by patients and health care providers and probably feasible, although several studies have described inappropriate and inadequate thrombophilia testing.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The absolute risk of VTE during ambulatory cancer treatment in patients with a family history of VTE in the absence of thromboprophylaxis is based on estimates of the prevalence of thrombophilia in patients with VTE and the RRs of thrombophilia from observational studies with their inherent biases, and the panel used the best available evidence. Risk assessment tools to categorize patients with cancer into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for VTE may be suboptimal.

The guideline panel acknowledges the fact that our recommendation is based on calculations with a prevalence of any type of hereditary thrombophilia in patients with VTE that may vary geographically.

### Thromboembolic disease in cancer patients [^115XxSBn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Thromboembolic events are common among patients with cancer as a consequence of cancer- and treatment-related factors. As these events are the second most frequent cause of death in this population, their prevention and treatment are important. Venous ultrasonography is the technique of choice for diagnosis, with sensitivity and specificity above 95% in symptomatic thrombosis. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended for ambulatory patients, although it could be useful in selected cases. On the other hand, all inpatients should receive prophylactic therapy unless contraindicated. Therapy of thromboembolic disease is based on anticoagulants. Clinical trials demonstrate that the use of low-weight heparins is associated with a lower incidence of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis as compared with non-fractionated heparin or warfarin. Options for recurrent thrombosis include change to another anticoagulant agent, increasing doses of the same agent and cava filters.

Combination of mechanical and pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer — the guideline suggests a combined strategy over single-modality approaches with specific remarks. The panel suggests using a combination of mechanical and pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis rather than mechanical prophylaxis alone or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone, and remarks that early ambulation should be favored over mechanical thromboprophylaxis when indicated. In situations with a high risk for thrombosis and major bleeding, mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone is suggested until the patient is no longer at high risk for major bleeding, then adding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is suggested.

### Anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in ambulatory cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115atVQe]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

We found a 1.48% overall risk of ATE among patients starting systemic anticancer therapy who were assigned to no anticoagulation. This is consistent with recent meta-analyses that reported rates of ATE in this population; a systematic review and meta-analysis by Proverbs-Singh et alreported a 0.67% incidence of ATE among cisplatin-treated patients, whereas a 2011 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in mesothelioma, renal cell, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, and lung cancers reported an incident ATE rate of 1.3% with combination chemotherapy alone, which increased to 2.6% with the addition of bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor.

Despite the increased risk of ATE in the ambulatory cancer population, our systematic review and meta-analysis did not demonstrate ATE risk reduction with anticoagulant use. There are several potential reasons for this null finding; first, anticoagulants alone have not been shown to be superior to antiplatelet agents for ATE prevention outside of atrial tachyarrhythmia, mechanical heart valves, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. For example, a clinical trial involving 7,213 patients did not demonstrate a reduction in stroke recurrence among patients randomized to rivaroxaban 15 mg daily compared with aspirin after an embolic stroke of an undetermined source (5.1% vs 4.8%; HR: 1.07; P = 0.52), with similar findings in the subgroup analysis of cancer patients. Another clinical trial of over 27,000 patients with stable cardiovascular disease showed a reduction in cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction with a combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and aspirin compared with aspirin alone. However, there was no significant difference in this outcome among patients randomized to rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily alone compared with aspirin. Second, dosing studied in primary ATE prevention may be insufficient. Although most studies used low-dose anticoagulants known to be effective in VTE prevention, anticoagulant dosing in ATE prevention in atrial tachyarrhythmias and mechanical heart valves correspond to VTE treatment dosing. Third, therapy discontinuation rates were more than 30% in many included studies, which may have attenuated the true effect of anticoagulants on ATE prevention. Nonetheless, this is reflective of challenges associated with primary prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis in ambulatory patients. Incorporating patient values and preferences into decision making can increase confidence in and adherence to treatments; this is a crucial step in future evaluations of antithrombotic therapy in ATE prevention. Finally, risk factors for ATE among patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy may be different compared with those for VTE. Therefore, new predictive tools for cancer-associated ATE are needed to identify high-risk ambulatory cancer populations who are most likely to benefit from anticoagulation for the prevention of ATE.

Safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis

For the analysis of safety, the results from studies with VTE or death as the primary outcome were pooled in a single analysis. Overall, 24 studies reported on the incidence of major bleeding in patients randomized to anticoagulant prophylaxis or no prophylaxis. The pooled incidence of major bleeding was 2% in patients randomized to prophylaxis or to no prophylaxis, with significant heterogeneity (95% CI: 0.17–0.31; I 2 > 50%). Heterogeneity persisted after removal of outlier studies and disappeared when the analysis was limited to high-quality studies.

Anticoagulant prophylaxis was not associated with an increase in the risk of major bleeding (24 studies, 12,014 patients; OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.98–1.73; I² = 0%) (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained in studies with parenteral anticoagulants (21 studies, 10,713 patients; OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.93–1.73; I2 = 0%) or oral anticoagulants (3 studies, 1,494 patients; OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 0.83–3.83; I² = 0%).

When the analysis was limited to high-quality studies or those with VTE as the primary outcome, the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis was associated with a marginally significant increase in major bleeding (Table 3).

### Venous thromboembolism prevention in cancer outpatients [^111guGXe]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has serious consequences for patients with cancer, including mortality. VTE is preventable with appropriate thromboprophylaxis, but prior public health efforts have focused on prophylaxis in the inpatient setting. However, most VTE events in malignancy currently occur in outpatients. Several recent clinical trials have addressed thromboprophylaxis in the ambulatory setting. Their findings suggest potential benefit, but with significant variation in underlying risk. A risk-adapted approach that incorporates risk of thrombosis, risk of bleeding, and patient preference can target high-risk patients and also allow low-risk patients to avoid prophylaxis. Risk assessment is therefore key to patient selection for outpatient prophylaxis. This article focuses on results of recent trials and updates from major guideline panels, with the intent of providing guidance to clinical providers.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with cancer: when and how? [^116kY9HC]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cancer-associated thrombosis is a leading cause of death among patients with cancer. Historically, thromboprophylaxis efforts have focused on the highest risk patients with cancer, including post-operative patients and hospitalized patients. This review covers not only thromboprophylaxis for these groups but also emerging data supporting prophylaxis in ambulatory medical oncology patients.

Recent Findings

Several leading guidelines, backed by clinical trial data, now support the use of direct oral anticoagulants for select high-risk outpatients for primary thromboprophylaxis. However, uptake of these findings remains low. Pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis strategies continue to improve. However, it remains challenging to balance competing risks of bleeding and thrombosis. The morbidity and mortality associated with cancer associated thrombosis may be preventable. Understanding advancements in risk prediction, anticoagulant options, and implementation of existing data, is critical to provide optimal patient care.

Ambulatory cancer patients receiving systemic therapy — risk-stratified parenteral thromboprophylaxis is outlined as follows: Primary prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy reduces venous thromboembolism (VTE) with a small increase in bleeding and with no impact on overall survival, and the panel made 3 different recommendations depending on baseline thrombosis risk (Khorana score). For patients at low risk for thrombosis, the panel made a strong recommendation against the use of routine parenteral thromboprophylaxis; for patients at intermediate risk, the panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of routine parenteral thromboprophylaxis; and for patients at high risk, the panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of parenteral thromboprophylaxis.

### Successful model for guideline implementation to prevent cancer-associated thrombosis: venous thromboembolism prevention in the ambulatory cancer clinic [^113hYRC3]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been shown to be successful in ambulatory patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, with an average reduction in VTE rates of approximately 50%. - National guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer recommend an individual patient risk assessment and targeted prophylaxis for patients with cancer at the highest risk of VTE - because of the variable rates of reported bleeding risk and the lack of a clear survival advantage. However, data from the Association of Community Cancer Centers reported that only 9% of oncology practitioners reported using a structured risk assessment tool in the outpatient setting, and 44% of practices reported < 10% of their outpatients with cancer had clear documentation of VTE risk. A successful model for guidelines implementation is needed to increase VTE risk assessment and prevention in patients with cancer.

VTE risk assessment models have been studied in outpatients with cancer in an effort to identify the 10%-20% of all patients with cancer most likely to develop a VTE and benefit most from VTE prophylaxis. The most well-studied and validated VTE risk assessment tool was developed by Khorana et aland focuses on outpatients with cancer initiating chemotherapy. This risk stratification tool assesses prechemotherapy WBC count, hemoglobin and platelet count, body mass index, and tumor type, and is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network to identify patients with cancer at high risk for VTE. Practical and evidence-based approaches for implementing risk assessments and prophylaxis prescribing in the oncology clinic are not available.

We report a multidisciplinary intervention, Venous Thromboembolism Prevention in the Ambulatory Cancer Clinic (VTEPACC), designed to improve guideline adherence in outpatients initiating cancer-directed therapy. Our approach focused on integration into systems of practice, incorporation of patient preferences, and inclusion of a multidisciplinary team.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^114A5SDj]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication among patients with cancer. Patients with cancer and VTE are at a markedly increased risk for morbidity and mortality.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the prevention and treatment of VTE in patients with cancer.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The guideline development process was supported by updated or new systematic evidence reviews. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations.

Results

Recommendations address mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients with cancer, those undergoing a surgical procedure, and ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. The recommendations also address the use of anticoagulation for the initial, short-term, and long-term treatment of VTE in patients with cancer.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include not using thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy at low risk of VTE and to use low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for initial treatment of VTE in patients with cancer. Conditional recommendations include using thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients with cancer, LMWH or fondaparinux for surgical patients with cancer, LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy at high risk of VTE and LMWH or DOAC for initial treatment of VTE, DOAC for the short-term treatment of VTE, and LMWH or DOAC for the long-term treatment of VTE in patients with cancer.

### Latest advances in preventing thromboembolic disease in the ambulatory oncology patient [^114CAVTs]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is often cited as a major cause of death and morbidity in cancer patients. Even a non-lethal VTE causes distress and is commonly perceived by patients as a set-back in the cancer journey and a threat to the cancer treatment. It is also known that the risk of VTE varies between cancers (cancer-related risk factors), between patients (patient-related risk factors), and also within the cancer journey of a single patient. Risk can increase during treatments like surgery and chemotherapy and decline during remission. Neither the low molecular weight heparins nor the vitamin K analogues have gained an established role in thromboprevention guidance other than in 'the high risk' patient, who remains a rather ambiguous entity. The recently published randomised studies of rivaroxaban and apixaban in moderate- to high-risk thrombosis patients, assigned by the Khorana Risk Score, has seen the inclusion of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in recent guidelines (e.g. the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2019 guidelines) for this indication. The ease of administration and the demonstrated greater patient adherence to oral agents has heightened the expectation that a practice-changing thromboprevention study in cancer patients should be realizable. However, key unmet needs that pose familiar challenges remain and as yet do not have satisfactory solutions. Anticoagulants carry risks of bleeding that are higher in the cancer population. There is therefore the challenge of sufficient risk reduction of VTE from the intervention balanced against the number of patients that may be harmed from bleeding. There is also the challenge of penetrating the risk threshold beyond which oncologists would deem thromboprevention a clinically meaningful praxis. Thus, identifying the high-risk groups of patients or targeting the length or timing of the thromboprevention to when the risks are highest are major questions that remain the subject of ongoing research. Notably all this is taking place against a backdrop of changing therapeutics for many cancers (e.g. targeted agents, checkpoint inhibitors and combinations) and their assorted impact on VTE incidence. In this review, past data for the ambulatory cancer patient are summarised, the latest evidence for the direct oral anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban are analysed and the challenges of identifying the high-risk patients that have the greater chance of benefiting from thromboprophylaxis are discussed.

### Updated meta-analysis on prevention of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients [^1115QFAf]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is four to seven times higher in patients with cancer than in individuals without this disease. The high incidence of cancer-associated thrombosis is probably related to a combination of the intrinsic prothrombotic activity of cancer cells, aggressive chemotherapy treatment, aging of cancer patients, and enhanced VTE detection owing to improvements in imaging technology and frequency of imaging. – Anti-cancer therapies, either traditional chemotherapy, hormones or biological agents, can potentially increase the risk of VTE up to an annual rate of 15%, depending on the type and combination of agents, or the addition of radiotherapy. Survival of cancer patients has been significantly improved in recent times and this increases the time of risk exposure for VTE in cancer patients.

Based on these epidemiological data, several studies have been conducted aimed at assessing the role of anticoagulants in preventing VTE in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. These studies showed that prophylaxis with anticoagulants reduced the risk of VTE by about 50%, with no significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. However, the use of prophylaxis remains controversial because of concerns over the relatively low incidence of VTE in these patients, the risk-to-benefit ratio, the cost and the inconvenience of prolonged parenteral therapy. As a consequence, antithrombotic prophylaxis is still not recommended in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. On this background, the current availability of oral anticoagulants that can be used with no laboratory monitoring reopens the issue of practicality of antithrombotic prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients. – Three clinical trials on the use of new oral anticoagulants for this indication have recently been published.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized studies to assess the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

### Update on guidelines for the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis [^116aMwXt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with cancer are at high risk of developing arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). They constitute 15% to 20% of the patients diagnosed with VTE. Depending on the type of tumor, cancer therapy, and presence of other risk factors, 1% to 25% of patients with cancer will develop thrombosis. The decision to start patients with cancer on primary thromboprophylaxis depends on patient preference, balancing risk of bleeding versus risk of thrombosis, cost, and adequate organ function. Currently, guidelines recommend against the use of routine primary thromboprophylaxis in unselected ambulatory patients with cancer. Validated risk assessment models can accurately identify patients at highest risk for cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). This review summarizes the recently updated NCCN Guidelines for CAT primary prophylaxis, with a primarily focus on VTE prevention. Two main clinical questions that providers commonly encounter will also be addressed: which patients with cancer should receive primary thromboprophylaxis (both surgical and medical oncology patients) and how to safely choose between different anticoagulation agents.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update… [^114UAmje]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

9Pending a full update of the 2019 guideline, the current update adds apixaban as an option for the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer and addresses recent evidence regarding direct factor Xa inhibitors for extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis. These topics were identified using ASCO's signals approach to guideline updating, which allows for an expedited response to important, recommendation-altering evidence. 10The term direct factor Xa inhibitors is used in this update rather than the previously used direct oral anticoagulants for increased specificity. Results 13–17assessed low molecular weight heparin and did not alter recommendations from the 2019 guideline. 9The remaining three trials assessed a direct factor Xa inhibitor either during hospitalization 18or for extended postoperative thromboprophylaxis. 11, 12The trial during hospitalization involved 94 patients undergoing surgery for glioma, who received rivaroxaban or placebo from admission to discharge.

12Ultimately, 19. 6% of patients in the apixaban arm and
18. 8% of patients in the enoxaparin arm did not have cancer. Exclusion criteria included history of VTE, long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, history of severe renal or hepatic disease, or history of conditions related to abnormal bleeding or hypercoagulability. Patients received heparin on the first postoperative day, with random assignment to apixaban or enoxaparin within the first week after surgery, when deemed safe by the operating surgeon. Study treatment was provided for 28 days, and patients were followed for a total of 90 days. Major bleeding occurred in one patient in each study arm. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 5. 4% of patients in the apixaban arm and
9. 7% of patients in the enoxaparin arm recommendation on extended postoperative prophylaxis with apixaban or rivaroxaban, in addition to prophylactic dose LMWH, after cancer surgery for patients who are candidates for extended prophylaxis. The two studies differ in the design, type of surgery, type of cancer, comparator, and primary outcome. Additional data from randomized clinical trials are necessary to strengthen this recommendation.

### D-dimer enhances risk-targeted thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer [^114zA4jF]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory patients with cancer is effective, although uncertainties remain on who should be targeted. Using D-dimer values from individuals enrolled to the AVERT trial, we sought to identify and validate a more efficient venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk threshold for thromboprophylaxis.

Materials and Methods

The AVERT trial compared thromboprophylaxis with apixaban with placebo among patients with cancer with a Khorana Risk Score ≥ 2. The D-dimer measured at randomization was used to calculate an individualized 6-month VTE risk using the validated CATScore. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess efficacy (VTE) and safety (major and overall bleeding) in the (a) complete cohort and (b) ≥ 8% and < 8% 6-month VTE risk thresholds.

Results

Five hundred seventy-four patients were randomized in the AVERT trial; 466 (81%) with baseline D-dimer were included in the study. Two hundred thirty-seven subjects received apixaban; 229 received placebo. In the complete cohort, there were 13 (5.5%) VTE events in the apixaban arm compared with 26 (11.4%) events in the placebo arm (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.49 [0.25–0.95], p < .05). Number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one VTE = 17. Eighty-two (35%) and 72 (31%) patients in the apixaban and placebo arms, respectively, had a 6-month VTE risk ≥ 8%. In this subgroup, 7 (8.4%) VTE events occurred with apixaban and 19 (26.3%) events with placebo (aHR 0.33 [0.14–0.81], p < .05), NNT = 6. Individuals with a VTE risk < 8% derived no benefit from apixaban thromboprophylaxis (aHR 0.89 [0.30–2.65), p = .84). Increased rates of overall bleeding were observed with apixaban in both the complete (aHR 2.11 [1.09–4.09], p < .05) and ≥ 8% predicted risk cohorts (aHR 2.87 [0.91–9.13], p = .07).

Conclusion

A 6-month VTE risk threshold of ≥ 8% increases the efficiency of risk-targeted thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer.

Implications For Practice

Ambulatory patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A Khorana Risk Score (KRS) ≥ 2 is currently the suggested threshold for thromboprophylaxis. Using baseline D-dimer values from individuals enrolled to the AVERT trial, this retrospective validation study identifies a 6-month VTE risk of ≥ 8% as a more efficient threshold for thromboprophylaxis. At this threshold, the number needed to treat to prevent one VTE is 6, compared with 17 when using a KRS ≥ 2. Conversely, individuals with a predicted risk of < 8% derive no clinical benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Future prospective studies should validate this threshold for outpatient thromboprophylaxis.

### Prevention of thrombosis in ambulatory patients with cancer [^1125voeF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies receive most of their cancer treatment as outpatients. Thromboembolism, when it occurs, complicates the clinical care of these patients because of the associated morbidity and the need for anticoagulant treatment. It would seem that prevention of venous thromboembolism in these patients would be worthwhile. However, to date there are relatively few trials of anticoagulant prophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer and it is not possible to recommend prophylaxis for most patients. Research is needed to better define a population at high enough risk to warrant pharmacologic prophylaxis and to develop new antithrombotic agents for this indication.

### Primary prophylaxis of VTE in cancer outpatients [^114fTLrv]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to non-cancer patients and several studies suggest that VTE risk among ambulatory cancer patients varies widely. Recently, predictive models capable of risk-stratifying a broad range of ambulatory cancer outpatients have been developed and validated; using the Khorana model a score of 2 is associated with an intermediate-high risk for VTE. However, the use of VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory patients who have cancer remains controversial. Even if important randomized clinical trials showed decreased rates of VTE events among patients who were receiving chemotherapy, the effect of prophylaxis on morbidity, mortality, and costs has not been rigorously studied. Outpatients with active cancer should be assessed for thrombosis risk and although most do not routinely require thromboprophylaxis, it should be considered for high risk patients.

### Fine tuning venous thromboembolism risk prediction in patients with cancer… [^115vnZmE]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials of the use of prophylactic dose anticoagulants to prevent VTE in patients with cancer have shown significant reduction in the occurrence of VTE in treated patients compared with controls. Two of the largest studies included 4, 362 patients and assessed the role of low molecular weight heparin for primary prophylaxis in patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. Those assigned to LMWH for 6 months experienced a significant 50% or greater reduction in symptomatic thrombotic events compared with placebo. 3, 4However, the absolute risk in the untreated ambulatory patients was small, at best 4%, making it difficult to recommend primary prophylaxis in all ambulatory patients with cancer given the large number of overtreated patients that would result. A number of VTE prediction tools have been developed to risk stratify patients with cancer. The Khorana score is the most widely used as it is the best validated and is easy to calculate.

8, 9By enrolling patients with increased risk, these trials demonstrated a higher VTE rate in the placebo populations than in the LMWH primary prophylaxis trials of unselected patients. Significant VTE risk reduction was also observed. Although the reduction in absolute risk was about twice as high as in the LMWH trials, this difference became smaller, 2. 5 percentage points, when the occurrence of only symptomatic VTE were analyzed. The new cancer associated VTE risk prediction models by Li et al 10and Muñoz et al, 11with further validation, are steps toward improving the care of our patients with cancer. By decreasing the number needed to treat to prevent one VTE, the risk-benefit equation for use of thromboprophylaxis shifts toward treatment, as thromboprophylaxis is clearly effective.

However, no VTE prophylaxis study in patients with cancer to date has been designed to show a mortality benefit; it must be kept in mind that many of the added elements to improve VTE risk discrimination are also associated with increased risk of bleeding and increased risk of mortality on their own. Even with the improved convenience of oral anticoagulants compared with parenteral agents requiring injections, adherence to treatment in the oral Xa inhibitor RCT by patients with increased VTE risk on the basis of the KS was surprisingly low, with 40%-50% of patients assigned to placebo dropping out.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

VTEPACC was a prospective quality improvement research initiative developed in collaboration with the Jeffords Institute for Quality at the University of Vermont Medical Center using a preimplementation and postimplementation study design. The program was designed to provide VTE education and risk assessment to all patients with cancer initiating any cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy) in the outpatient setting at a single institution, the University of Vermont Cancer Center. Institutional review board approval was obtained (CHRMS 16–145) before initiation.

Patient eligibility was based on a histologic confirmation of cancer that required initiation of cancer-directed therapy. The therapy received by the patient was determined by the treating oncologist. Patients with all malignancy types, including lung, breast, head and neck, renal, pancreatic, upper and lower GI, gynecologic, and urologic cancer, were included. Patients with lymphoma were included; however, patients with a hematologic malignancy, such as those with leukemia, were excluded because therapy initiation was generally in the inpatient setting. Patients at any stage of disease requiring therapy were included; however, patients with early-stage disease who received radiation therapy only were not assessed as part of the VTEPACC program. Patients were excluded if they (1) received hormonal therapy only or (2) had a confirmed diagnosis of VTE at the time of VTE risk assessment. Patients with brain tumors were included at the time of study initiation and subsequently were excluded after the initiation of an investigator clinical trial enrolling this patient group at our institution. Patients who were receiving anticoagulation for another medical reason (eg, atrial fibrillation) were included in the initial risk assessment, as were patients receiving any dose of aspirin therapy.

The VTEPACC program comprised 4 key structural components (Fig 1), including (1) an EHR-based assessment tool for bleeding and thrombosis risk to identify high-risk patients with cancer for targeted VTE prophylaxis; (2) a data capture and electronic reporting methodology; (3) an electronic alert for referral to the thrombosis program for high-risk patients; and (4) an EHR-based communication tool to enhance physician and nursing communication, that is, the Thrombosis Action Plan using EPIC EHR software. The model is based on a multidisciplinary care team including oncologists, hematologists, advanced practice providers (APPs), nurses, and pharmacists (Table 1).

The International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer is an independent academic working group of experts aimed at establishing global consensus for the treatment and prophylaxis of cancer-associated thrombosis. The 2013, 2016, and 2019 International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer clinical practice guidelines have been made available through a free, web-based mobile phone application. The 2022 clinical practice guidelines, which are based on a literature review up to Jan 1, 2022, include guidance for patients with cancer and with COVID-19. Key recommendations (grade 1A or 1B) include: (1) low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) for the initial (first 10 days) treatment and maintenance treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis; (2) direct oral anticoagulants for the initial treatment and maintenance treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis in patients who are not at high risk of gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding, in the absence of strong drug-drug interactions or of gastrointestinal absorption impairment; (3) LMWHs or direct oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 6 months to treat cancer-associated thrombosis; (4) extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWHs to prevent postoperative venous thromboembolism after major abdominopelvic surgery in patients not at high risk of bleeding; and (5) primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism with LMWHs or direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban or apixaban) in ambulatory patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who are treated with anticancer therapy and have a low risk of bleeding.

### Primary prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [^116cKuLn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the trade-off between safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is the third update of a review first published in February 2012.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or an active control intervention.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 3 August 2020. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and contacted content experts and trialists for relevant references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no thromboprophylaxis or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on risk of bias, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively. We applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified six additional randomised controlled trials (3326 participants) for this update, bringing the included study total to 32 (15,678 participants), all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors were imprecision and risk of bias. Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban) may decrease the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.06; 3 studies, 1526 participants; low-certainty evidence); and probably increases the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.68; 3 studies, 1494 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). When compared with no thromboprophylaxis, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83; 11 studies, 3931 participants; high-certainty evidence); and probably increased the risk of major bleeding events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.35; 15 studies, 7282 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In participants with multiple myeloma, LMWH resulted in lower symptomatic VTE compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83; 1 study, 439 participants; high-certainty evidence), while LMWH probably lowers symptomatic VTE more than aspirin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 781 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Major bleeding was observed in none of the participants with multiple myeloma treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against no thromboprophylaxis, but did not report on VTE or major bleeding. When compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, warfarin may importantly reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20; 1 study, 311 participants; low-certainty evidence) and may result in a large increase in major bleeding (RR 3.82, 95% CI 0.97 to 15.04; 4 studies, 994 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study evaluated antithrombin versus no antithrombin in children. This study did not report on symptomatic VTE but did report any VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE). The effect of antithrombin on any VTE and major bleeding is uncertain (any VTE: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.73; major bleeding: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.03 to 18.57; 1 study, 85 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In ambulatory cancer patients, primary thromboprophylaxis with direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (low-certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate-certainty evidence) when compared with placebo. LMWH decreases the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high-certainty evidence), but increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate-certainty evidence) when compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. Evidence for the use of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants other than direct factor Xa inhibitors and LMWH is limited. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis in specific types of chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.

VKA thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer receiving systemic therapy — For ambulatory patients with cancer without venous thromboembolism (VTE) and receiving systemic therapy, there is a strong recommendation for no thromboprophylaxis over thromboprophylaxis with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), based on very low-certainty evidence of net health benefit, high certainty about harms from bleeding, and cost-effectiveness favoring no prophylaxis; the panel judged benefits evidence as very low due to indirectness and imprecision, noted that VKA monitoring and major bleeding are costly despite low drug cost, and concluded that the balance of effects probably favors no thromboprophylaxis.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer. VTE is a main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer and has a significant impact on their quality of life. Preventing VTE in cancer patients reduces both morbidity and mortality. The level of evidence for antithrombotic prophylaxis of VTE in patients with cancer varies for hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Hospitalized patients with active cancer (for both medical or surgical indication) and reduced mobility should receive thromboprophylaxis throughout hospital stay. Prophylaxis of VTE is not routinely recommended for outpatients with cancer on chemotherapy. For these patients, current guidelines suggest that clinicians should consider antithrombotic prophylaxis on a case-by-case basis in highly selected outpatients. Different strategies for identification of high-risk outpatients with cancer who could benefit of thromboprophylaxis are under consideration. The new oral anticoagulants could have a role for VTE prevention in ambulatory patients with cancer who are on chemotherapy, as they are administered at a fixed dose without routine laboratory monitoring and may have fewer drug interactions with anticancer agents.

Parenteral thromboprophylaxis vs no thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer receiving systemic therapy — the guideline evidence synthesis identified 13 systematic reviews and 17 eligible RCTs, and included 12 RCTs in an individual participant data meta-analysis; interventions included UFH, ultra-LMWH, and LMWH. Parenteral thromboprophylaxis compared with no thromboprophylaxis probably reduces mortality slightly, reduces any VTE and symptomatic VTEs, results in little to no difference in asymptomatic VTEs, and reduces PEs slightly; additionally, it results in a large reduction in any symptomatic DVT for patients at high risk for thrombosis, reduces any symptomatic DVT slightly for patients at intermediate risk for thrombosis, and reduces any symptomatic DVT slightly for patients at low risk for thrombosis.
