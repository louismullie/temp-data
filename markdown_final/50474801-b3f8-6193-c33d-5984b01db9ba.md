## Question

Best medications to treat pain in someone with hepatic encephalopathy and an allergy to ketoralac

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best medications to treat pain in someone with hepatic encephalopathy and an allergy to ketorolac. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical constraints imposed by hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the implications of a ketorolac allergy and whether that extends to all NSAIDs. Next, I will review first-line and second-line analgesic options with dosing and safety considerations. After that, I should consider nonpharmacologic strategies and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and confirm it aligns with guidelines and labeling details.

> Let me first confirm the clinical constraints. Hepatic encephalopathy reflects impaired hepatic clearance of ammonia and other toxins, altered drug metabolism, and increased sensitivity to sedatives and psychoactive medications, so I need to avoid agents that worsen encephalopathy or precipitate complications like renal injury, GI bleeding, or constipation, and I should prefer medications with minimal hepatic metabolism and limited systemic effects [^38c3a344] [^49b33752].

> Wait, let me verify the ketorolac allergy implication. A true NSAID allergy typically contraindicates the entire class, so I should avoid all NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and COX-2 inhibitors, to prevent cross-reactivity and serious adverse reactions; this aligns with emergency care protocols that advise avoiding NSAIDs in patients with NSAID allergy and with the fact that ketorolac trials routinely exclude patients with NSAID hypersensitivity, underscoring class risk [^c4e8d6d2] [^3c6b1950].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Acetaminophen is the preferred first-line analgesic in cirrhosis when used at reduced doses because it undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism via sulfation and glucuronidation rather than CYP pathways; the AASLD recommends 500 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 2 g/day, and I should confirm that this applies even when using IV formulations, which it does, with IV acetaminophen dosed at 650–1000 mg every 4–6 hours not to exceed 3–4 g/day in general use, but still capped at 2 g/day in cirrhosis for safety [^38c3a344] [^056c8d21] [^c59f9570].

> Hold on, I should verify opioid strategy because severe pain may require escalation. If pain is moderate to severe or refractory to acetaminophen, short courses of low-dose, short-acting opioids can be considered with extreme caution; hydromorphone 1 mg orally or 0.4 mg IV and oxycodone 2.5 mg orally are reasonable starting points with extended dosing intervals, and I should proactively manage constipation with lactulose or polyethylene glycol to mitigate encephalopathy risk, while avoiding codeine, morphine, and tramadol due to unpredictable metabolism and encephalopathy risk in cirrhosis [^38c3a344] [^04f7a7f4] [^07304cff].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic and topical options to minimize systemic exposure. Localized pain should be addressed with local therapies first, including lidocaine patches, topical NSAIDs where appropriate and not contraindicated by allergy, capsaicin for neuropathic pain, and physical therapy; these approaches reduce systemic drug burden and are endorsed in cirrhosis pain guidance, though I should confirm that topical NSAIDs are acceptable despite a systemic NSAID allergy — given minimal systemic absorption, they are generally considered safe when used judiciously and locally [^38c3a344] [^44a29e5c].

> Next, I should review adjuvant options for neuropathic or mixed pain. Gabapentin can be effective for neuropathic pain but requires very low starting doses in cirrhosis, such as less than 300 mg/day, due to somnolence and mental status effects; SNRIs like duloxetine may be preferable at low doses for some patients, whereas tricyclics are generally avoided for anticholinergic burden and cognitive effects; I need to ensure slow titration and close monitoring for encephalopathy worsening [^85fb62b1] [^38c3a344].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety steps. In cirrhosis, I need to monitor for oversedation, confusion, and constipation with any new psychoactive medication, reassess pain frequently, and avoid combining sedatives or benzodiazepines with opioids; if opioids are used, I should pair them with bowel regimens and consider rifaximin to reduce ammonia-producing bacteria, especially if encephalopathy is present or evolving, while watching renal function if any nephrotoxic agents are contemplated [^38c3a344] [^19a74623].

> But wait, what if the pain is acute and severe in a monitored setting. In the hospital, IV acetaminophen remains appropriate at 650–1000 mg every 4–6 hours within the 2 g/day cirrhosis cap, and for refractory cases, low-dose ketamine as an adjunct can be considered in consultation with specialists, recognizing limited cirrhosis-specific data and the need to monitor for neuropsychiatric effects; this is an opioid-sparing strategy reserved for select scenarios after nonopioid options are optimized [^056c8d21] [^0acf5796].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, initiate scheduled acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 2 g/day and add nonpharmacologic measures such as ice, elevation, physical therapy, and topical agents as indicated. Second, if pain remains moderate to severe, add a low-dose, short-acting opioid such as hydromorphone 1 mg orally or 0.4 mg IV with extended intervals, alongside aggressive constipation prophylaxis and close neurologic monitoring. Third, for neuropathic components, consider gabapentin at very low doses with slow titration or an SNRI at low dose, avoiding tricyclics. Fourth, reassess frequently and de-escalate opioids as soon as feasible to minimize encephalopathy risk [^38c3a344] [^44a29e5c] [^85fb62b1].

> I need to ensure I have addressed the ketorolac allergy explicitly. Given the NSAID class contraindication, I should document the allergy clearly and counsel the patient to avoid all NSAIDs, including over-the-counter ibuprofen and naproxen, and to check labels for hidden NSAIDs in combination products; this reduces the risk of recurrent hypersensitivity and avoids the additional hazards of NSAIDs in cirrhosis such as renal injury and GI bleeding [^c4e8d6d2] [^38c3a344].

> Final recommendation: Acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 2 g/day is the best first-line medication for pain in a patient with hepatic encephalopathy and a ketorolac allergy, with escalation to low-dose, short-acting opioids such as hydromorphone or oxycodone only if pain is severe or refractory and always with constipation prophylaxis and close monitoring; avoid all NSAIDs due to the allergy and cirrhosis-related risks, and incorporate local and nonpharmacologic therapies whenever possible to minimize systemic drug exposure and encephalopathy risk [^38c3a344] [^04f7a7f4] [^c4e8d6d2].

For a patient with hepatic encephalopathy and a ketorolac allergy, **acetaminophen is first-line** [^38c3a344] at 500–1,000 mg every 6 hours, not exceeding 2 g/day [^44a29e5c] due to hepatic risk. Avoid **NSAIDs** because of the allergy and the risk of renal and GI complications in cirrhosis [^38c3a344]. For moderate to severe pain, use low-dose, short-acting opioids (e.g. hydromorphone 1–2 mg PO/IV q4–6h or oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO q6h) with close monitoring and proactive constipation management [^04f7a7f4] [^55c0873d]. Consider topical lidocaine or capsaicin for localized pain, and use gabapentin cautiously for neuropathic pain at reduced doses [^85fb62b1]. Monitor mental status, renal function, and stool output, and adjust therapy to minimize encephalopathy risk [^19a74623].

## Pharmacological considerations in hepatic encephalopathy

Patients with HE have **impaired hepatic metabolism** and increased sensitivity to sedating medications, so agents with minimal hepatic metabolism and low risk of neurocognitive effects are preferred [^5e11da64]. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to renal impairment, GI bleeding, and encephalopathy risk; opioids can precipitate or worsen HE via delayed transit and increased ammonia absorption, so they must be used cautiously and at reduced doses [^38c3a344] [^49b33752].

---

## Recommended analgesic options

### Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

- **First-line therapy**: Acetaminophen is the preferred analgesic for mild to moderate pain in cirrhosis [^38c3a344].
- **Dosing**: 500–1,000 mg orally every 6 hours, not exceeding 2,000 mg/day [^38c3a344] [^44a29e5c].
- **Safety**: At therapeutic doses, acetaminophen is generally safe in cirrhosis; monitor liver function and avoid exceeding the maximum dose [^a615767a].

---

### Opioids (for moderate to severe pain)

- **Indication**: Reserve for moderate to severe pain unresponsive to acetaminophen [^38c3a344].
- **Preferred agents**: Hydromorphone or oxycodone at reduced doses with extended intervals [^04f7a7f4].
- **Dosing**: Hydromorphone 1–2 mg PO/IV every 4–6 hours or oxycodone 2.5–5 mg PO every 6 hours [^04f7a7f4].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for sedation, respiratory depression, and constipation; use prophylactic laxatives to prevent encephalopathy [^04f7a7f4] [^55c0873d].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **Topical agents**: Lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream for localized musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain [^44a29e5c].
- **Gabapentin**: For neuropathic pain, start at very low doses (e.g. 100–300 mg at bedtime) and titrate cautiously due to sedation and encephalopathy risk [^85fb62b1].
- **Regional anesthesia**: Consider for localized pain or surgical procedures when feasible [^notfound].

---

## Medications to avoid

- **NSAIDs**: Contraindicated due to renal impairment, GI bleeding, and encephalopathy risk [^38c3a344].
- **Tramadol**: Avoid due to unpredictable pharmacokinetics and risk of encephalopathy [^04f7a7f4].
- **Codeine and morphine**: Generally avoided due to prolonged sedation and encephalopathy risk [^04f7a7f4].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Regularly assess mental status, renal function, and stool output, and adjust analgesic therapy based on response and adverse effects. Maintain **close clinical monitoring** for encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and constipation [^19a74623].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Pain severity** | **Recommended analgesic** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild to moderate | Acetaminophen | 500–1,000 mg every 6 hours (max 2 g/day) | First-line therapy |
| Moderate to severe | Hydromorphone or oxycodone | Hydromorphone 1–2 mg every 4–6 hours; oxycodone 2.5–5 mg every 6 hours | Use cautiously; monitor closely |
| Localized pain | Topical lidocaine or capsaicin | Apply as directed | Minimal systemic absorption |
| Neuropathic pain | Gabapentin | 100–300 mg at bedtime; titrate cautiously | Monitor for sedation |

---

Acetaminophen is **first-line** for mild to moderate pain in hepatic encephalopathy with a ketorolac allergy; reserve low-dose, short-acting opioids for severe pain with close monitoring and proactive constipation management. Avoid NSAIDs and tramadol, and consider topical or regional options when appropriate.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three single-dose regimens for treating acute pain in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^386a871e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used extensively for the management of acute and chronic pain, with ketorolac tromethamine being one of the most frequently used parenteral analgesics in the emergency department (ED). The drugs may commonly be used at doses above their analgesic ceiling, offering no incremental analgesic advantage while potentially adding risk of harm. We evaluate the analgesic efficacy of 3 doses of intravenous ketorolac in ED patients with acute pain.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to assess the analgesic efficacy of 3 doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 15, and 30 mg) in patients aged 18 to 65 years and presenting to the ED with moderate to severe acute pain, defined by a numeric rating scale score greater than or equal to 5. We excluded patients with peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, allergies to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pregnancy or breastfeeding, systolic blood pressure less than 90 or greater than 180 mm Hg, and pulse rate less than 50 or greater than 150 beats/min. Primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. We recorded pain scores at baseline and up to 120 minutes. Intravenous morphine 0.1 mg/kg was administered as a rescue analgesic if subjects still desired additional pain medication at 30 minutes after the study drug was administered. Data analyses included mixed-model regression and ANOVA.

Results

We enrolled 240 subjects (80 in each dose group). At 30 minutes, substantial pain reduction was demonstrated without any differences between the groups (95% confidence intervals 4.5 to 5.7 for the 10-mg group, 4.5 to 5.6 for the 15-mg group, and 4.2 to 5.4 for the 30-mg group). The mean numeric rating scale pain scores at baseline were 7.7, 7.5, and 7.8 and improved to 5.1, 5.0, and 4.8, respectively, at 30 minutes. Rates of rescue analgesia were similar, and there were no serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes showed similar rates of adverse effects per group, of which the most common were dizziness, nausea, and headache.

Conclusion

Ketorolac has similar analgesic efficacy at intravenous doses of 10, 15, and 30 mg, showing that intravenous ketorolac administered at the analgesic ceiling dose (10 mg) provided effective pain relief to ED patients with moderate to severe pain without increased adverse effects.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^9ad2bc4d]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for 
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation 
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of ketorolac tromethamine in reducing 
inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hepatic Effect

Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients 
with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline 
elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking 
NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may 
progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy. 
Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit 
of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials 
with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including 
jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some 
of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac 
tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease 
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), 
ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three doses for treating renal colic in the emergency department: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^3c6b1950]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is extensively used for the management of renal colic in the emergency department (ED). It has been proposed that ketorolac is used at doses above its analgesic ceiling with no more advantages and increased risk of adverse effects. In this study, we compared the analgesic effects of three doses of intravenous ketorolac in patients with renal colic.

Methods

This noninferiority, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluated the analgesic efficacy of three doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 20, and 30 mg) in adult patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Exclusion criteria consisted of age > 65 years, active peptic ulcer disease, acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, NSAID hypersensitivity, pregnancy or breastfeeding, unstable vital signs, and patients who had received analgesics in the past 24 hours. Pain was recorded every 15 minutes from baseline up to 60 minutes, and the primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. If patients still required additional pain medications at 30 minutes, they would receive 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate as a rescue analgesic.

Results

A total of 165 subjects enrolled in this study, 55 in each group. The median visual analog scale score in 30 minutes was improved from 90 at baseline to 40 among subjects who were randomized to 30-mg group. This improvement was 40 and 50 mm in 20- and 10-mg ketorolac treatment arms, respectively, with no significant difference between the three doses (p < 0.05). Secondary outcomes showed similar rescue analgesic administration and adverse effects. There was no serious adverse event.

Conclusion

Ketorolac at 10-, 20-, and 30-mg doses can produce similar analgesic efficacy in renal colic.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^a679d714]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients not to give oral ketorolac tromethamine to other family members and to discard any unused drug. Remember that the total combined duration of use of oral ketorolac tromethamine and intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking ketorolac tromethamine immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS).
Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).

### Comparison of the analgesic dose of intravenous ketamine versus ketorolac in patients with chest trauma: a randomized double-blind clinical trial [^da58eed4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Trial design and setting

This double‐blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed and conducted in three hospitals. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Medical Sciences (REC.1400.278). The RCT ID was IRCT20210711051840N. We used a parallel design with two groups, a 1:1 allocation of the ketorolac versus ketamine for pain management.

Study participants

We included consented patients (18 years old or above) with chest trauma (blunt or penetrating) with fractures of at least two ribs or necessitating chest tube insertion who presented to the EDs from March 2021 to April 2022. Patients were excluded if they had a history of allergic reactions to ketamine or ketorolac, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 or less, acute coronary syndrome (based on electrocardiogram findings), intracranial bleeding, systolic blood pressure more than 180 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure more than 100 mm Hg, and active bleeding, considering precautions with NSAIDs and ketamine. Also, patients with a history of using monoamine oxidase inhibitors, psychosis, dementia or active delirium, glaucoma, pregnancy, mental disability, liver failure, and peptic ulcer disease and those who need emergent finger/tube thoracostomy were excluded.

Sample size

According to previous studies and the assumption of mean difference of pain score of 1.5 in the two groups of ketamine and ketorolac, common standard deviation of 2.5 for pain score, an alpha error of 0.05 and the study power of 80%, the sample size of 45 people in each group was obtained.

Allocation, randomization, and blinding

Patients were randomly allocated into two groups according to a computerized random sequence; one group received ketorolac, and in the other group, ketamine was administered for pain management. Block randomization was conducted using blocks of four. The allocations were concealed by opaque envelopes that were sequentially numbered. The colorless medications were prepared in the same volume in 5‐mL syringes diluted with normal saline and were injected by the nurse‐in‐charge of the emergency department (ED); thus, patients and the recruiting physicians were blind to the study medications.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^38c3a344]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD guidance statements—pain in patients with cirrhosis emphasize that multimodal pain management approaches are ideal and include a person-centered holistic, multidisciplinary approach, engaging a combination of expertise from across a number of specialties; pain in patients with DC requires a systematic approach that starts with assessing and treating reversible causes of pain; and localized pain should first be addressed with local, rather than systemic, therapies. Acetaminophen, 500 mg every 6 h, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d, is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of pain in patients with cirrhosis, and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. We recommend avoiding opioids, when possible, for chronic pain. However, when necessary, opioid use should be approached with caution and with careful discussion with patients and caregivers. Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be started in select cases on an as-needed basis and titrated to effect, often in consultation with pain management experts.

Methods

Patients

We screened consecutive patients with closed femur shaft fractures (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association 32) undergoing IMN from April 2021 to October 2022. Eligibility criteria included adult patients aged between 21 and 65 undergoing IMN to treat closed femur shaft fractures. Exclusion criteria encompassed recent opioid use, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory hypersensitivity, renal/cardiac/hepatic impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding history, coagulopathy, substance abuse diagnosis, open fractures, polytrauma, pregnancy, and inability to consent. Participants were excluded from the final analysis if they could not receive the protocol or had incomplete data.

Study Design

This prospective cohort study evaluated a nonopioid pain management protocol against a standard opioid-based regimen in patients undergoing IMN for closed femur shaft fractures. Patients were assigned to one of the two cohorts based on the pain management protocol chosen by the attending surgeon. Cohort assignments reflected clinical practice preferences without randomization, ensuring that the study observed real-world treatment scenarios.

Data collection was conducted prospectively by a staff physician blinded to the treatment protocol assigned. This research assistant was not involved in patient care or data collection to minimize bias. All procedures were conducted at a Level I trauma center, and patients were admitted to the same orthopaedic ward.

Pain Management Protocols

Patients were assigned to an experimental (nonopioid-based) group and a control (opioid-based) group. Before surgery, the experimental group received 30 mg of IV ketorolac. After surgery, the experimental group received 30 mg of IV ketorolac every six hours, 1 g of acetaminophen PO every 6 hours, and 300 mg of gabapentin PO every 12 hours. The control group received morphine (0.1 mg/kg IV) and oxycodone with acetaminophen (2.5/325 mg) PO every 6 hours after surgery, starting at the postanesthesia care unit. Opioid rescue medication was available as needed for both cohorts.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain—nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^dd65b1bb]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health‐related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^3e7dfbcf]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The treatment of nociceptive pain generally involves analgesics or interventions directed at the pain source (e.g. surgery to decompress nerves, intra‐articular injections).Common analgesics, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs (topical and oral), and opioids, are used.Topical NSAIDs treat musculoskeletal injuries with low risk.Oral NSAIDs in patients without portal hypertension, acetaminophen, or both are first‐line treatments for mild to moderate pain, based on individual patient risk factors.Muscle relaxants can be used to relieve acute low back and neck pain.Opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, may be used for acute pain that is severe or unresponsive to initial therapies; however, the recommended usage is for no more than three days given the risks of adverse effects, including complex dependency or even addiction.First‐line medications should be continued during this period.

In light of the potential for chronic pain to be mixed,,as well as for peripheral nociceptive input to lead to central sensitization and nociplastic pain,,the first‐line self‐directed nonpharmacologic, noninterventional therapies recommended for nociplastic pain may also be useful in patients who appear to have primarily nociceptive pain. Beginning with these treatments before considering pharmacologic agents or other interventions also aligns with the stepped method recommended for addressing chronic pain, generally.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^090cdef1]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Naltrexone in OUD—perioperative management and safety notes that patients on naltrexone may not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner, and it is recommended that mild pain be treated with nonopioid analgesics and moderate to severe pain be treated with higher potency NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac) on a short-term basis. Oral naltrexone should be discontinued 72 hours before surgery and extended-release injectable naltrexone should be discontinued 30 days before an anticipated surgery. Naltrexone’s blockade of the mu-opioid receptor can often be overcome, when necessary, with high potency full agonist opioids, and in these instances patients should be closely monitored in an emergency department or hospital setting. After discontinuation of naltrexone therapy an increased susceptibility to overdose may occur, and physicians need to be vigilant and inform the patients of this increased risk of opioid sensitivity after using an opioid antagonist. There is a concern about a potentially higher overdose risk following discontinuation of XR-NTX due to loss of tolerance, and the medication guide for XR-NTX explicitly warns about this “rebound risk” of overdose but does not describe a particular period of risk. This risk may also be present for oral naltrexone, which is cleared from the system after just 24h and may leave patients with low opioid tolerance. Due to known hepatotoxicity in high doses, liver enzymes should be monitored before initiation and cautiously monitored throughout therapy; naltrexone is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure, and its use in patients with active liver disease must be carefully considered. The margin of separation between the apparently safe dose of naltrexone and the dose causing hepatic injury appears to be five-fold or less, VIVITROL does not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses, and these warnings may not apply in low dose treatment with naltrexone specifically for neuropathic pain.

Intervention and pain assessment

Patients who met the inclusion criteria and gave written consent were assessed for eligibility. All patients received 1 g of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen when they first presented to the ED with traumatic chest pain according to our institution policies. For those requiring tube thoracostomy, a chest tube was inserted under cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, and local analgesia using lidocaine according to the surgery service protocol. Afterward, among those enrolled in this study, one group received IV ketamine 0.25 mg/kg, while the other group was medicated by IV ketorolac 30 mg for pain management in the ED. Both medications were injected slowly over 5 min. One of the researchers (ZSJ) asked patients to score their pain from 0 to 10 in her 24/7 shifts in three hospitals. Pain level was assessed using the numeric rating scale (NRS) before and 30 and 60 min after the drug injection with this verbatim: score your pain from “0” representing no pain to “10” representing the worst imaginable pain. According to our health center pain management policy, 0.1 mg/kg of morphine sulfate was administered as the rescue medication. Substance use was asked from patients and identified as the use of substances, including drugs, inhalants, etc.

Adverse events were rated for both medications such as psychedelic effects (emergence phenomena), gastrointestinal effects (nausea/vomiting), hemodynamic effects (changes in blood pressure and heart rate), respiratory complications (increased need for oxygen, desaturation, bag–valve ventilation, extraglottic device insertion, intubation, and mechanical ventilation), bleeding, dyspepsia, chest pain, cough, allergic reaction, and raised creatinine and were documented during patients’ stay in the ED, usually lasting 3–6 h before they were transferred to wards.

CHALLENGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Cirrhosis presents unique challenges in pain management. First, consensus is lacking for the management of pain, and pharmacologic options are limited. There are recommendations to limit the use of acetaminophen (≤2 g per day) and avoid nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/opioids.If opioids are to be considered, expert opinion recommends weak opioids such as tramadol or hydromorphone for nociceptive pain and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or gabapentin for neuropathic pain.Efficacy data, however, are limited.

Second, virtually any pharmacologic intervention can be difficult and dangerous for patients with cirrhosis.For example, NSAIDs are used by 10%–30% of patients with cirrhosis,increasing the risk of ascites, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding.Even short‐term use of NSAIDs can be deleterious, as just five doses of 500 mg of naproxen has been correlated with decreased kidney function, decreased response to furosemide, and inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B 2 production in patients with cirrhosis.Prescription rates for gabapentin have also increased severalfold.Both opioids and gabapentinoids are associated with unique harms in cirrhosis, including worse health‐related quality of life (HRQOL)and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE),a frequent complication of cirrhosis that markedly increases mortality.The mechanisms for the harms of psychoactive medications are multifold. First, cirrhosis pushes toxins from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ammonia) that would be normally detoxified by the liver into the bloodstream. These toxins impact brain and muscle function, leading to depression, sleep disturbance, impaired physical function, and poor HRQOL.These toxins lead to a dominant inhibitory tone in the brain that is exacerbated by drugs like gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Second, because opioids prolong intestinal transit time, a key determinant of toxin translocation from the gut, increased toxin load results. Despite the fact that opioids are not thought to be efficacious in chronic noncancer painand are associated with significant side effects, as many as half of patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioids.Opioid prescription occurs more frequently in cirrhosis than in other chronic diseasesand is associated with a higher risk of opioid‐related toxicity and overdose in patients with liver disease.Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines,compounding the risk of adverse events, including fallsand potential overdose deaths.Thus, it is imperative to select pain management modalities to improve pain control while avoiding serious complications (Figure 1). To do so, we need to better understand and characterize the mechanistic drivers of pain in cirrhosis.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, hospitalists are commonly charged with taking care of patients with HE in the community or academic settings. Hence, they should be well‐equipped with the knowledge and develop a systematic approach to the overall management of these patients in the hospital setting. This is important as patients with decompensated liver disease and HE is very ill at initial presentation to the hospital and merit an expedited workup and management with or without the help of a subspecialist. Otherwise, these patients have the potential to deteriorate quickly leading to adverse outcomes. Systematic and guideline congruent management will largely optimize the clinical outcomes in these patients.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^82105c44]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their 
patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine 
treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they 
develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients 
not to give ketorolac tromethamine tablets to other 
family members and to discard any unused drug.

Remember that the total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine 
tablet  and ketorolac tromethamine IV or IM dosing is not to exceed 5 days in 
adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients.

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating 
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. 
Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that 
accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side 
effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even 
death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients 
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, 
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing 
any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance 
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS: 
Cardiovascular Effects).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and 
rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result 
in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and 
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical 
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, 
dyspepsia, melena and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance 
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS: 
Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side 
effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in 
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur 
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin 
rash and blisters, fever or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and 
should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. 
Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type 
of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain 
or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper 
quadrant tenderness and “flu-like” symptoms). If these occur, patients should be 
instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., 
difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients 
should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be 
avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Hepatic encephalopathy for the hospitalist [^21e2837d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The care of patients with advanced liver disease is often complicated by episodes of acute decline in alertness and cognition, termed hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Hospitalists must be familiar with HE, as it is a common reason for hospitalization in this population and is associated with significantly increased mortality. This narrative review addresses common issues related to diagnosis and classification, precipitants, inpatient management, and transitions of care for patients with HE. The initial presentation can be variable, and HE remains a clinical diagnosis. The spectrum of HE manifestations spans from mild, subclinical cognitive deficits to overt coma. The West Haven scoring system is the most widely used classification system for HE. Various metabolic insults may precipitate HE, and providers must specifically seek to rule out infection and bleeding in cirrhotic patients presenting with altered cognition. This is consistent with the 4-pronged approach of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease practice guidelines. Patients with HE are typically treated primarily with nonabsorbable disaccharide laxatives, often with adjunctive rifaximin. The evidence for these agents is discussed, and available support for other treatment options is presented. Management issues relevant to general hospitalists include those related to acute pain management, decisional capacity, and HE following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. These issues are examined individually. Successfully transitioning patients recovering from HE to outpatient care requires open communication with multiple role players including patients, caregivers, and outpatient providers.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^c7d0e20e]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^a615767a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management—APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration <150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^44a29e5c]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD decompensated cirrhosis—pain management emphasizes that acute pain (≤12 weeks) is more responsive to short-term opioid therapy than chronic pain, and optimal chronic pain management often involves multimodal, nonpharmacological approaches, including behavioral management, physical therapy, and procedural approaches. Behavioral approaches have not been specifically evaluated in patients with cirrhosis, but pain self-management programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical and occupational therapy are safe and efficacious in other populations for the management of chronic pain. Procedural approaches have been largely untested in cirrhosis, but acupuncture is effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain and headache in general populations, and although there are no direct data about safety of acupuncture in patients with cirrhosis, observational studies of drug-related thrombocytopenia indicate that acupuncture is likely safe in patients with platelets >50,000/mL, with a review evaluating potential benefits. Similarly, injections can be used for limited indications, such as knee osteoarthritis, though physical therapy remains first line. Because of impaired hepatic metabolism and the risk of precipitating encephalopathy, lower doses and less systemic therapies are generally preferred for pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis. Local pharmacotherapies are generally first line for localized pain, and lidocaine patches and topical creams for localized neuropathic (e.g., capsaicin) and musculoskeletal pain (e.g., topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are effective and have limited systemic absorption, rendering them likely safe (though untested) in persons with cirrhosis. Acetaminophen (APAP) dosing is described as up to 2 g daily (typically prescribed as 500 mg, every 6 hours, as needed).

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^ae15f672]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy—Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain (...) [^0acf5796]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral NSAIDs Oral NSAIDs inhibit COX enzymes, impairing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. 16 Although systematic reviews have shown that NSAIDs are more effective than acetaminophen for acute pain, 21 guidelines suggest that both can improve pain and that NSAIDs are better for functional improvement. 14 NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination is an effective initial treatment approach for acute pain syndromes. Medication selection should be based on minimizing risks for the specific patient. 3, 14, 17, 22. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a significantly safer GI adverse effect profile but may be cost prohibitive. Relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors inhibit the activity of COX-2 enzymes at low doses but are less selective at higher doses.

Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is well tolerated and is the most widely used medication for pain. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it likely affects the serotonergic system and other pain pathways. Intravenous ketamine, a phencyclidine analogue and dissociative anesthetic agent that is used in subanesthetic doses for acute pain, has some evidence of benefit when used with opioids. 47 Intravenous ketamine has been used as an adjunctive and stand-alone agent for perioperative pain in patients who are opioid tolerant or at high risk of respiratory depression. 48, 49 Intranasal ketamine has been used to treat acute pain in the emergency department, 50, 51 but larger studies are needed before routine use can be recommended. 72, 73 Buprenorphine and methadone can be dosed every eight hours if needed for pain control. 72, 74 Short-acting opioids can be added if required.

For patients taking naltrexone, nonopioid treatment such as ketamine or regional blocks should be attempted before opioids because very high-dose opioids may be required to overcome naltrexone's opioid blockade, especially in patients receiving the long-acting injectable formulation and in patients who decide not to taper because of concerns of relapse.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^064cdd31]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 9: Special Populations: Individuals With Pain

For all patients with pain, it is important that the correct diagnosis be made and that a target suitable for treatment is identified.

If pharmacological treatment is considered, non-narcotic medications such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs should be tried first.

Opioid agonists (methadone or buprenorphine) should be considered for patients with active opioid use disorder who are not under treatment.

Pharmacotherapy in conjunction with psychosocial treatment should be considered for patients with pain who have opioid use disorder.

Patients on methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder will require doses of opioids in addition to their regular daily dose of methadone to manage severe acute pain.

Patients on methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder and who are admitted for surgery may require additional short-acting opioid pain relievers. The dose of pain relievers prescribed may be higher than those required by the typical patient due to tolerance.

Temporarily increasing buprenorphine dosing may be effective for mild acute pain.

For severe acute pain, discontinuing buprenorphine and commencing on a high-potency opioid (such as fentanyl) is advisable. Patients should be monitored closely and additional interventions such as regional anesthesia should also be considered.

The decision to discontinue buprenorphine before an elective surgery should be made in consultation with the attending surgeon and anesthesiologist. If it is decided that buprenorphine should be discontinued before surgery, this should occur 24–36 hours in advance of surgery and reinduction restarted postoperatively when the need for full opioid agonist analgesia has passed.

Patients on naltrexone will not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner. Therefore, it is recommended that mild pain be treated with NSAIDs, and moderate to severe pain be treated with ketorolac on a short-term basis.

Oral naltrexone should be discontinued 72 hours before surgery, and extended-release injectable naltrexone should be discontinued 30 days before an anticipated surgery.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^04f7a7f4]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Opioid selection and safety in cirrhosis—when opioids are required, “prophylactic medications should be considered proactively to prevent constipation and encephalopathy (e.g., lactulose),” and “codeine, morphine, and tramadol should generally be avoided in patients with cirrhosis.” “Tramadol is often inappropriately selected for first-line use in patients with cirrhosis because of the perception that it is not an opioid,” yet it “has variable pharmacokinetics across persons with cirrhosis … and has notably unpredictable side effects, including hypoglycemia.” For transdermal fentanyl, “The patch comes in set doses with the lowest option of a 12-μg/h patch, which may be too high for patients with cirrhosis,” and “cachexia is a relative contraindication to transdermal fentanyl,” while “methadone should only be used in consultation with a specialist.” “First-line opioids for patients with cirrhosis generally include low-dose hydromorphone (e.g., 1 mg p.o. or 0.4 mg i.v.) or oxycodone (e.g., 2.5 mg p.o.) with extended dosing intervals.” Initiation should follow best practices: “Prescribing clinicians should adhere to best practices for risk assessment, setting patient expectations, and monitoring when starting opioids,” “first-line treatment should be a 7-day supply of low-dose, short-acting opioids,” and “Patients require close follow-up,” with risk factors assessed such as “past opioid use disorder” and “concurrent benzodiazepine use” or other prescriptions in “prescription drug monitoring program data.”

### Treatment of pain in cirrhosis: advice to caregivers of those with rock livers [^5e11da64]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

Definitions

Adverse Events are any untoward medical occurrence or effect in a patient participating in the trial, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with trial treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the trial treatment, whether or not it is related to the allocated trial treatment.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are AEs that Result in death; Are life-threatening; Require in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or Result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

All AEs were graded for severity:

0. None: indicates no event or complication.

1. Mild: complication results in only temporary harm and does not require clinical treatment.

2. Moderate: complication requires clinical treatment but does not result in significant prolongation of hospital stay. Does not usually result in permanent harm and where this does occur the harm does not cause functional limitation to the patient.

3. Severe: complication requires clinical treatment and results in significant prolongation of hospital stay, permanent functional limitation.

4. Life-threatening: complication that may lead to death.

5. Fatal: indicates that the patient died as a direct result of the complication/adverse event.

7.2 Potential “expected” AE’s in patients with multi-organ failure 
Abdominal distension – new, clinically significant change in appearance. Considered severe if acute obstruction.
Abdominal pain – new, localised to abdomen and requiring more than just simple analgesia. Considered severe if not controlled with opiates.
Electrolyte disturbance – new change that is clinically significant requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic reaction) – anaphylactic reaction.
Hypoglycaemia – new, clinically significant hypoglycaemia requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Ischaemic bowel – inferred on radiology or diagnosed visually, e.g. surgery or endoscopy.
Nausea requiring treatment with anti-emetics; Vomiting – any episode
Regurgitation/aspiration – any episodes

### Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy [^04a53f78]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge that has been generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited, such as definition, classification, diagnosis and grading of hepatic encephalopathy, which are difficult to apply reproducibly using the current criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggest the need for further studies focussing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death, to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care, is poor and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies current challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas which require further debate and investigation in order to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^a9be14c2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

### A prospective study comparing I.M. ketorolac with I.M. meperidine in the treatment of acute biliary colic [^7afd7e3e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication that is used widely for pain management. Its effects are mediated through the inhibition of prostaglandins, which makes it uniquely different from opioids in relieving pain. We conducted a randomized, prospective, double blind study of patients presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) with a diagnosis of acute biliary colic. Study patients were randomized into one of two treatment groups, meperidine 1.5 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 100 mg or ketorolac 60 mg given intramuscularly (i.m.). The patients rated their pain before and 30 min after medication on a scale of 1 to 10 using a Visual Analog Pain Scale. Overall pain relief was compared between the two groups using a two-sample t test. Thirty patients were enrolled in the study, 16 in the ketorolac group and 14 in the meperidine group. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 71 years and 6 (20%) were male. The average pain score at time 0 was 7.6 for the ketorolac group and 7.3 for the meperidine group. Pain relief at time 30 min was 3.8 in the ketorolac group and 3.9 in the meperidine group, which was not statistically different. The mean global pain score and need for an emergency cholecystectomy were similar in the two groups. Rescue medication for additional analgesia at 30 min was needed in 4 patients in the meperidine group and in 2 patients in the ketorolac group (28.6% versus 12.5%, respectively; NS). In this study of patients with acute biliary colic there was no significant difference in the pain relief achieved by using either ketorolac or meperidine.

Pain management in cirrhosis—adjuvant analgesics are characterized by the following: Gabapentinoids are effective in treating neuropathic pain but are potentially habit forming and associated with somnolence and mental status changes, and for patients with cirrhosis, very low starting doses of gabapentin (e.g., <300 mg/d) are recommended. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can provide good adjuvant pain medication at low doses with a low risk of hepatotoxicity, whereas tricyclic antidepressants’ anticholinergic effects and associated mental status impairments generally preclude their use in patients with cirrhosis. Medical cannabinoids are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, cannabis (marijuana) is not FDA approved for any indication at this time, and significantly more data are needed before recommending cannabinoid/cannabis as an analgesic for patients with DC.

### What is the most appropriate dose of-acetylcysteine after massive acetaminophen overdose? [^081d08a4]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

While the traditional intravenous N -acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing regimen works well for the vast majority of acetaminophen overdoses, there may be cases of massive overdose where additional NAC may be necessary. Recent evidence suggests that patients with acetaminophen concentrations above the "300-line" develop hepatotoxicity at a higher rate than those below the 300-line, suggesting that an increase of dose may be beneficial at this cut-off. Additional clinical data suggest a further increase in doses at the 450-line and 600-lines. I propose a strategy for step-wise increases in NAC dosing in response to high acetaminophen concentrations at the 300-, 450-, and 600-lines after acute massive acetaminophen overdoses.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) consensus recommendations for opioid-minimising pharmacological neonatal pain management [^251f2032]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Non-opioid adjuncts: acetaminophen

Non-opioid adjuncts are frequently used to help minimise the dose of opioids required to achieve adequate pain control. The GDC recommends the use of early postoperative acetaminophen to minimise opioids. Two high-quality studies in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery demonstrated decreased narcotic requirements with equivalent pain scores for neonates following acetaminophen administration.Ochsenreither et al demonstrated that infants who received rectal acetaminophen following open heart surgery required less opioid with equivalent pain scores.In an RCT, infants (0–10 days) who received IV paracetamol had a 49% lower cumulative morphine dose compared with neonates who received a continuous morphine infusion with equivalent pain scores.When administered as a loading dose (20 mg/kg) followed by 10 mg/kg of IV acetaminophen every 6 hours, infants with mild to moderate pain were shown to have a trend of lower pain scores within 30 min.Acetaminophen in appropriate doses is well tolerated in neonates without elevation of liver enzymes or hepatotoxicity; however, it is noted that no studies have specifically assessed the long-term safety of acetaminophen for pain. The GDC strongly recommended the use of acetaminophen given the potential benefits with a low side-effect profile.

Non-opioid adjuncts: NSAIDs

There is limited evidence in the neonatal population to guide the use of NSAIDs. A few small studies have shown ketorolac to be an effective adjunct or primary analgesic in neonates; however, there are also conflicting data that suggest it did not decrease opioid use.Furthermore, there may be safety concerns with the use of NSAIDs in postsurgical neonates. One case series of 57 postsurgical patients who received ketorolac demonstrated that 17.2% had a bleeding event.The majority of patients who bled were less than 14 days old, and the authors cautioned against the use of ketorolac in patients younger than 21 days or less than 37 weeks corrected gestational age (cGA). Others have identified that it may contribute to renal morbidity in neonates.As such, the GDC did not feel there was strong enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of NSAIDs in neonatal surgical patients at this time.

Non-opioid adjuncts: clonidine

There is some limited evidence to suggest that clonidine may reduce the doses of opioid required to achieve adequate sedation and analgesia in ventilated newborns; however, there is inadequate data regarding its use as an analgesic.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^43adf4e2]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Preoperative care—comorbidity considerations note that neurocognitive disorders, such as SUD, will affect analgesic requirements, and ischemic cardiac disease has implications because pain and stimulation increase myocardial oxygen consumption, leading to a subsequent imbalance of oxygen supply-demand. Pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) is a less commonly recognized comorbidity with significant impact on pain management strategies, and an appropriate selection of periprocedural analgesics is critical to minimizing exposure to longer-acting sedative medications, which are associated with increased apneic events and complications in patients with already compromised pulmonary reserve. For renal and hepatic organ system diseases, dose adjustment is needed for many frequently administered pre- and intraoperative analgesics in patients with hepatic (e.g., fentanyl, morphine, sufentanil, acetaminophen) or renal (e.g., morphine, NSAIDs, gabapentin) impairment, and evaluation of coagulation disorders is prudent in any patient considered for regional or neuraxial anesthetics.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^48b69669]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an important complication of decompensated liver disease. Hospital admission for episodes of HE are very common, with these patients being managed by the hospitalists. These admissions are costly and burdensome to the health‐care system. Diagnosis of HE at times is not straightforward, particularly in patients who are altered and unable to provide any history. Precipitants leading to episodes of HE, should be actively sought and effectively tackled along with the overall management. This mandates timely diagnostics, appropriate initiation of pharmacological treatment, and supportive care. Infections are the most important precipitants leading to HE and should be aggressively managed. Lactulose is the front‐line medication for primary treatment of HE episodes and for prevention of subsequent recurrence. However, careful titration in the hospital setting along with the appropriate route of administration should be established and supervised by the hospitalist. Rifaximin has established its role as an add‐on medication, in those cases where lactulose alone is not working. Overall effective management of HE calls for attention to guideline‐directed nutritional requirements, functional assessment, medication reconciliation, patient education/counseling, and proper discharge planning. This will potentially help to reduce readmissions, which are all too common for HE patients. Early specialty consultation may be warranted in certain conditions. Numerous challenges exist to optimal care of hospitalized OHE patients. However, hospitalists if equipped with knowledge about a systematic approach to taking care of these frail patients are in an ideal position to ensure good inpatient and transition of care outcomes.

Therapy for episodes of OHE—In addition to the other elements of the four-pronged approach to treatment of HE, specific drug treatment is part of the management; most drugs have not been tested by rigorous randomized, controlled studies and are utilized based on circumstantial observations, and in the hospital, a nasogastric tube can be used to administer oral therapies in patients who are unable to swallow or have an aspiration risk. Nonabsorbable disaccharides—Lactulose is generally used as initial treatment for OHE, lack of effect of lactulose should prompt a clinical search for unrecognized precipitating factors and competing causes for the brain impairment, in addition, most recent trials on lactulose have been open label in nature, cost considerations alone add to the argument in support of lactulose, and in some centers, lactitol is preferred to lactulose, based on small meta-analyses of even smaller trials.

Regarding medical management for pain in the ICU, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, SCCM 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering nefopam (if feasible) either as an adjunct or replacement for an opioid to reduce opioid use and their safety concerns for pain management in critically ill adult patients.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^689c110b]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy research priorities—research into clinical management should remain in close contact with pathophysiology research, and such collaboration should result in new causal and symptomatic treatment modalities that need and motivate clinical trials. There is a severe and unmet need for controlled clinical trials on treatment effects on all the different forms of HE, and decisive clinical studies are few despite high patient numbers and resource utilization. There are no data on which factors and patients represent the higher costs, creating an insufficient basis for allocating resources and establishing priority policies. Many drugs that were assessed for HE several decades ago were studied following an obsolete standard of care, so any study of treatment for HE should be reassessed or repeated using the current standard of care. It is critical to develop protocols to identify precipitating factors and ACLF.

### Lactulose vs PEG for overt hepatic encephalopathy (...) [^39a41352]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance Hepatic encephalopathy is a common cause of hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis. Pharmacologic treatment for acute HE has remained the same for decades. Objective To compare polyethylene glycol 3350–electrolyte solution and lactulose treatments in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for HE. We hypothesized that rapid catharsis of the gut using PEG may resolve HE more effectively than lactulose. Interventions Participants were block randomized to receive treatment with PEG, 4-L dose, or standard-of-care lactulose during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was an improvement of 1 or more in HE grade at 24 hours, determined using the hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm, ranging from 0 to 4. Secondary outcomes included time to HE resolution and overall length of stay.

The primary outcome measure was improvement of 1 or more in HESA score at 24 hours. Previous literature indicates that the overall improvement for patients with HE treated with lactulose or lactitol compared with placebo or no intervention is 46% to 100%. 3 Thus, we estimated that a conservative lactulose response rate would be 0.
55. Both PEG and standard-therapy lactulose were considered safe therapies with no definitive related adverse events. Of the reported 8 serious adverse events, none were considered to be definitely or probably related to the study medications. Four events in the lactulose group were definitely not related, while 1 was possibly related. However, ammonia levels did not correlate with better improvement in HESA grades. Possible explanations for this result include the mechanism of action of the 2 study medications23 and the timing of the posttreatment ammonia levels.

Since PEG is a highly effective cathartic, the potential clinical improvement in HE might precede and be more clinically relevant than the actual decrease in ammonia levels, which would parallel our hypothesis. We describe herein a novel approach to the early management of an acute presentation of overt HE. Compared with lactulose treatment, the current standard of care for acute HE in hospitalized patients, a single dose of PEG significantly improved the overall grade of encephalopathy in the first 24 hours, reduced days to HE resolution, and appeared to lead to shorter length of stay.

Overt hepatic encephalopathy specific approach—A four-pronged approach to management of HE is recommended (GRADE II-2, A, 1), comprising initiation of care for patients with altered consciousness, alternative causes of altered mental status should be sought and treated, identification of precipitating factors and their correction, and commencement of empirical HE treatment.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)—key concept statements for altered mentation and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) emphasize that in patients with grade 3 or 4 HE, care of the airway, evaluation of other causes of altered mental status, treatment of potential precipitating factors, and empiric HE therapy should occur simultaneously. Consideration for causes other than HE as the reasons for altered mental status is important, especially in patients who have not recovered after HE therapies are deployed. Careful monitoring for pain, delirium, and avoiding medications that prolong sedation are important in promoting a return to consciousness. Discussion of goals of care should occur with patients before the onset of alteration in mental status and should continue afterward. Patients need to be monitored after they return to consciousness for critical care–related post-traumatic stress. Ventilation in the absence of altered mental status should not be considered brain failure.

### Attempts to limit opioid prescribing in critically ill patients: not so easy, not so fast [^539c6ea8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss why opioids have been considered the long-standing first-line therapy for treating acute, severe nociceptive pain in critically ill patients and discuss considerations for limiting opioid overuse in the intensive care unit setting.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from database inception until December 2018. Additional references were located through a review of the bibliographies of articles and clinical practice guidelines.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Original research articles excluding case reports were included if they concerned nonopioid agents for pain management in critically ill patients. The focus was on studies not included in the most recent pain management guidelines.

Data Synthesis

Ten studies were retrieved. Nonopioid therapies or opioid-sparing therapies have been touted as possible alternatives for critically ill patients, but they have particular adverse effects concerns in critically ill patients, often lack parenteral dosage forms, and frequently require dose adjustment or avoidance in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: There is a well-recognized opioid epidemic that has been the subject of much discussion. Attempts to control the epidemic have focused on limiting opioid prescribing and using nonopioid alternatives, but there are special considerations when treating severe pain in critically ill patients that often preclude nonopioid analgesics.

Conclusions

There continues to be an unmet need for medications that are as effective as opioids for severe nociceptive pain in critically ill patients but without the adverse effect and abuse concerns. Until such medications are available, clinicians need to optimize prescribing of opioid and nonopioid analgesics.
