## Question

438*. What remainder does $46^{925}$ give when divided by $21?$

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what remainder 46^925 gives when divided by 21. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about reducing the base modulo 21. Then, I should verify whether 21 is prime and, if not, factor it to apply Euler's theorem or the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Next, I will compute the exponent modulo φ of the modulus or the Carmichael function to simplify the power. Finally, I will calculate the reduced power modulo each factor and combine the results to get the remainder modulo 21.

> Let me first reduce the base modulo 21, because 46 ≡ 4 (mod 21), so 46^925 ≡ 4^925 (mod 21). Wait, let me verify that arithmetic: 21 × 2 = 42, and 46 − 42 = 4, so yes, 46 ≡ 4 (mod 21) [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the modulus. 21 is not prime, so I need to factor it. 21 = 3 × 7, and since 3 and 7 are distinct primes, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by computing 4^925 mod 3 and 4^925 mod 7 separately and then combining the results. Hold on, I should verify that 3 and 7 are indeed coprime, which they are, so CRT applies [^notfound].

> For modulo 3, I will now examine 4^925 mod 3. Since 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3), it follows that 4^925 ≡ 1^925 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I should apply Euler's theorem here, but that's unnecessary because the base is already congruent to 1 modulo 3, so the power is trivially 1 mod 3 [^notfound].

> For modulo 7, I need to check whether I can use Euler's theorem. φ(7) = 6, and since gcd(4, 7) = 1, I can reduce the exponent modulo 6. So 4^925 ≡ 4^(925 mod 6) (mod 7). Let me compute 925 mod 6: 925 ÷ 6 = 154 with remainder 1, so 925 ≡ 1 (mod 6). Therefore, 4^925 ≡ 4^1 ≡ 4 (mod 7). I should double-check that division: 6 × 154 = 924, and 925 − 924 = 1, so yes, the exponent reduces to 1 [^notfound].

> Now I have the system x ≡ 1 (mod 3) and x ≡ 4 (mod 7). I need to solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me think about a constructive approach: I can write x = 7k + 4 and substitute into the first congruence to get 7k + 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3), which simplifies to k + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so k ≡ 0 (mod 3). Thus k = 3m for some integer m, and x = 7(3m) + 4 = 21m + 4. Therefore, x ≡ 4 (mod 21). Hold on, I should verify this result by plugging back in: 4 mod 3 is 1, and 4 mod 7 is 4, which matches both congruences, so the solution is correct [^notfound].

> Final answer: 46^925 ≡ 4 (mod 21). I should confirm there are no calculation errors along the way. The base reduction, exponent reduction via φ(7), and CRT combination all check out, so the remainder is 4 [^notfound].

The remainder when (46^{925}) is divided by 21 is **4**. This is found by reducing the base to (46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{21}), then using Euler's theorem to simplify the exponent: since (\\phi(21) = 12), we have (4^{925} \\equiv 4^{925 \\bmod 12} \\equiv 4^1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{21}).

---

## Step 1: Reduce the base modulo 21

First, reduce the base (46) modulo (21):

[
46 \\div 21 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 4 \\implies 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{21}
]

Thus, (46^{925} \\equiv 4^{925} \\pmod{21}).

---

## Step 2: Apply Euler's theorem

Euler's theorem states that if (a) and (n) are coprime, then (a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}), where (\\phi(n)) is Euler's totient function. Here, (a = 4) and (n = 21); since (\\gcd(4, 21) = 1), Euler's theorem applies.

Compute (\\phi(21)):

[
21 = 3 \\times 7 \\implies \\phi(21) = \\phi(3) \\times \\phi(7) = (3–1) \\times (7–1) = 2 \\times 6 = 12
]

By Euler's theorem, (4^{12} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}).

---

## Step 3: Reduce the exponent modulo (\\phi(21))

Next, reduce the exponent (925) modulo (12):

[
925 \\div 12 = 77 \\text{ remainder } 1 \\implies 925 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}
]

Thus, (4^{925} \\equiv 4^1 \\pmod{21}).

---

## Step 4: Compute the final remainder

Finally, compute (4^1 \\pmod{21}):

[
4^1 = 4 \\implies 4^{925} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{21}
]

Therefore, the remainder when (46^{925}) is divided by (21) is **4**.

---

## Verification using the Chinese remainder theorem

To verify, we can use the Chinese remainder theorem by computing (4^{925} \\pmod{3}) and (4^{925} \\pmod{7}) separately, then combining the results.

- **Modulo 3**: (4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\implies 4^{925} \\equiv 1^{925} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3})
- **Modulo 7**: (4^1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}), and since (925 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}) (because (\\phi(7) = 6)), (4^{925} \\equiv 4^1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7})

Now, solve the system:

[
x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\
x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}
]

By inspection, (x = 4) satisfies both congruences, confirming the result.

The remainder when (46^{925}) is divided by 21 is **4**.

Bin analysis

The 1625 BPSs that accumulated in the MutL − strain were collected into 46 bins, each bin approximately 100 kb in size, starting at the origin of replication (see). The mean number of BPSs per bin was 35.3 with a variance of 95.2. The number of bins was chosen to be 46 because that number: (1) is close to the square-root of the sample size, a common "rule of thumb" for choosing the number of intervals for a histogram; (2) describes the data clearly (see Figure 5); and, (3) divides into the total number of nucleotides in the genome with an acceptably small remainder. However the mutation-density pattern was stable against changes in bin-size from about 50 kb (91 bins), which gave a mean number of BPSs per bin of 17.9 with a variance of 35.7, to about 220 kb (21 bins), which gave a mean number of BPS per bin of 77.4 with a variance of 307 (see Figure 5). The pattern was also unaffected by a 50% displacement of the bin starting point and was preserved when the binning started at the traditional zero point of the E. coli chromosome instead of at the origin of replication (see).

Wavelet transformation

Fourth-order Daubechies wavelet transforms were performed on the binned mutational data using the built-in program in Wolfram Mathematica 8.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'," these three approaches "produced similar results".

This study evaluates the remaining effect of influenza vaccines received in the 5 prior seasons. During 7 influenza seasons, 8933 patients were enrolled and 47% were confirmed for influenza. Compared with unvaccinated individuals in the current and 5 prior seasons, vaccination was protective when the last dose had been received in the current season (40% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 32%-47%]), and 1 (42% [95% CI, 27%-54%]), 2–3 (35% [95% CI, 16%-49%]), or 4–5 seasons (31% [95% CI, 4%-51%]) prior. This effect lasted for fewer seasons in the elderly and in patients with chronic conditions. On average, several recent prior doses were as protective as current-season vaccination.

Structure of economic value statements in clinical guidelines — In the interest of consistency and comparability across guidelines, we suggest that economic value statements report 3 components: 1) Class of Recommendation; 2) Level of Certainty; and 3) Recommendation, and the economic value statement should ideally be placed immediately following the clinical recommendation for the intervention of interest.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Contribution to red marrow absorbed dose from total body activity: a correction to the MIRD method [^eb2dcbf6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The contribution to red marrow absorbed dose from beta-emitting radionuclides distributed uniformly in the total body can be overestimated using either MIRD 11 or MIRDOSE3. The S value assigned to the red marrow target region from activity distributed in the remainder of the body is of particular concern. The assumption that the specific absorbed fraction for total body irradiating red marrow and other skeletal tissues is the inverse of the total-body mass can result in an inappropriate remainder-of-body contribution to marrow dose. We evaluated differences in the calculation of marrow dose using MIRD 11 and MIRDOSE3 formulations and developed methods to correct the results from either to remove inappropriate contributions. When bone takes up significantly less activity than is predicted from an apportionment of remainder-tissue activity based on mass, the standard remainder-of-body correction may substantially overestimate the electron component of the S value from remainder tissues to red marrow using either MIRD 11 or MIRDOSE3. If bone takes up activity, this contribution is negligible using MIRD 11 S values but remains with MIRDOSE3 S values. This overestimate can be significant, particularly when the residence time of activity in the remainder of the body is much higher than in the red marrow and a different correction is needed. As the ratio of the remainder of body to marrow residence time is lowered, the overestimate becomes less significant.

Conclusion

In this article, we show the magnitude of this overestimate (which is most important for nuclides with large "nonpenetrating" emission components and for pharmaceuticals that have a large ratio of remainder of body to marrow residence times), show the appropriate corrections to be made in each case, and propose a new method for calculating marrow dose contributions that will avoid this complication in future applications. Because all models give approximate doses for real patients, with uncertainties within those involved in these corrections, we do not suggest that changes be made to existing marrow dose estimates. We suggest only that future calculations be as accurate as possible.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Risk thresholds for alcohol consumption: combined analysis of individual-participant data for 599 912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies [^3e241c5c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

In comparison to those who reported drinking > 0– ≤ 100 g (mean usual 56 g) alcohol per week, those who reported drinking > 100– ≤ 200 g (mean usual 123 g) per week, > 200– ≤ 350 g (mean usual 208 g) per week or > 350 g (mean usual 367 g) per week had shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 4–5 years respectively (figure 4). Similarly, men who reported consuming above the UK upper limit of 112 g per week had a shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of 1·6 years (95% CI 1·3–1·8), and men who reported drinking above the US upper limit of 196 g per week had a shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of 2·7 years (2·4–3·1) compared with men who reported drinking below these respective upper limits. Thus, men who reported drinking less than 100 g alcohol per week had about a 1–2 years longer life expectancy at age 40 years than those who reported drinking 196 g per week (appendix p 47). Women who reported drinking above either the UK threshold (112 g per week) or US threshold (98 g per week) had about 1·3 (1·1–1·5) years shorter life expectancy at age 40 years compared with women who reported drinking below these thresholds (appendix p 47). About 20% of the alcohol-related survival difference for men (and slightly less for women) was attributed to excess death from cardiovascular disease (appendix p 47). Similar findings to those for the US population were observed when modelling was based on EU mortality rates (data not shown).

Figure 4
Estimated future years of life lost by extent of reported baseline alcohol consumption compared with those who reported consuming > 0– ≤ 100 g per week

The estimates of cumulative survival from 40 years of age onwards in the alcohol-drinking groups were calculated by applying hazard ratios (specific to age at risk) for all-cause mortality associated with categorised baseline alcohol consumption to US death rates at the age of 40 years or older. Mean usual levels of alcohol consumption within each baseline alcohol consumption category were 56, 123, 208 and 367 g per week, respectively, for the groups > 0– ≤ 100 g per week, > 100– ≤ 200 g per week, > 200– ≤ 350 g per week, and > 350 g per week.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^4ed6d1c1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — chromosomal etiologies and counseling indicate that in ~96% of children the condition is sporadic due to nonfamilial trisomy 21 with a free extra chromosome 21, whereas in ~3% to 4% the extra chromosomal material is from an unbalanced translocation (usually involving chromosome 14 or 21), with approximately three-quarters de novo and the remainder inherited; if a child has a translocation, the parents should be offered a karyotype to determine whether it is familial or de novo; in the remaining 1% to 2% mosaicism is present; recurrence risk varies widely from 1% in most families to 100% in some circumstances; formal counseling by a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor is recommended for all families.

### The quality of home-based primary care delivered by nurse practitioners: a national Medicare claims analysis [^ab59c810]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

This Figure shows the distribution of home‐based primary care (HBPC) visits per provider. Each HBPC visit is assigned to the performing provider type — either a nurse practitioner (NP) or physician (MD). Assigned visits are summed at the provider level to determine the total visits performed in 2018. For the Figure, visit counts are broken out into buckets from 1 to 500+ visits along the x ‐axis. The y‐axis captures the percent of providers in each visit total group.

To understand the quality of care, we narrowed our focus to patients who received at least four HBPC visits per year. Among these 574,567 beneficiaries, 27% saw both NPs and MDs and the remainder were evenly divided between seeing only NPs (37%) or only MDs (37%). In this subsample of HBPC patients with at least four visits, about half are 85 years or older. They are predominantly female, White, and eligible for Medicare based on age. Approximately one third have ever been dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. As shown in Table 2, there is little difference in patient characteristic between the NP and MD groups. Table 3 presents the quality measures by clinician type with a comparison to the general Medicare population in fee‐for‐service (FFS). Overall, 21% of those receiving HBPC receive preventive care compared with 32% of typical FFS beneficiaries. Similarly, HBPC users receive fewer flu shots (46% vs. 55% for FFS) and are more likely to experience falls that require medical attention (16% vs. 5% for FFS). The HBPC group has more acute stays (43% vs. 17% for FFS), but also has higher rates of advanced directives than traditional FFS patients (14% vs. 4% for FFS).

Cost-effectiveness evaluation and economic modeling — methods incorporate systematic review, checklist appraisal, and model development: "Studies of cost-effectiveness are also assessed against a checklist" and "A systematic review is conducted to search for studies in all areas covered by the guideline". If the literature is "incomplete or inconclusive", priority areas for further modeling are chosen by considering factors "including the number of patients affected, the potential effect on patient outcomes and costs, and the extent to which a new economic analysis may reduce uncertainty about cost-effectiveness". "All economic models are constructed by the health economist in collaboration with the guideline development group", results are summarized in the full guideline with model inputs, and detailed methods "will be available at www.ncgc.ac.uk".

(B) Histogram displaying the distribution of total sleep time the night before the session, measured by actigraphy with a cutoff at 6, 7, and 8 h leading to four categories of sleep: (i) < 6 h (with minimum 4.1 h), (ii) 6–7 h, (iii) 7–8 h, (iv) > 8 h (with maximum 11.45 h). The study utilized this literature driven categorization to examine the effects of sleep time. (C) Distributions of behavioral performances across sleep categories for psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) reaction time, visual working memory (VWM) accuracy, and modular math task (MOD) accuracy. We did not observe a direct effect of naturalistic sleep variations or low sleep on task performance. The red point depicts the median value.

2.2 Behavioral Tasks

2.2.1 Psychomotor Vigilance Task

PVT is a classic task to assess vigilance where participants were asked to respond to the appearance of a stimulus as fast as they can (Loh et al.). On average, the participants completed 80 trials, and the performance was assessed by calculating the average response time across trials.

2.2.2 Visual Working Memory Task

In order to examine VWM performance, participants completed a standard VWM task (Luck and Vogel). Participants were presented with squares of different colors for 150 milliseconds. After a delay period of 1180 milliseconds, participants were asked to recall whether the new presentation of colored squares was the same or different relative to the previously presented stimuli. Participants completed a total of 144 trials over the course of three blocks of 48 trials. The task took approximately 5 min to complete. VWM performance was assessed by calculating the accuracy of total correct responses divided by the total number of trials.

2.2.3 Modular Math Task

For MOD, participants were presented with a modular arithmetic expression with a remainder after dividing two integers and were asked if the expression was correct (Mattarella‐Micke et al.). Each participant completed a total of 40 trials where difficulty levels were randomized. The task took approximately 2 min to complete. Performance was assessed by calculating the accuracy of total correct responses divided by the total number of trials.

Serum Bicarbonate

In the 1-year controlled trials of QSYMIA in adults, the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate below the normal range (levels of less than 21 mEq/L at 2 consecutive visits or at the final visit) was 6.4% for QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg and 12.8% for QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg, compared to 2.1% for placebo. The incidence of persistent, markedly low serum bicarbonate values (levels of less than 17 mEq/L on 2 consecutive visits or at the final visit) was 0.2% for QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 0.7% for QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg dose, compared to 0.1% for placebo. In a pediatric clinical trial, 60 to 70% QSYMIA-treated patients had a persistent bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 21 mEq/L) compared to 43% of placebo-treated patients.

Serum Potassium

In the 1-year controlled trials of QSYMIA in adults, the incidence of persistent low serum potassium values (less than 3.5 mEq/L at two consecutive visits or at the final visit) during the trial was 3.6% for QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 4.9% for QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg, compared to 1.1% for placebo. Of the subjects who experienced persistent low serum potassium, 88% were receiving treatment with a non-potassium sparing diuretic.

The incidence of markedly low serum potassium (less than 3 mEq/L, and a reduction from pre-treatment of greater than 0.5 mEq/L) at any time during the trial was 0.2% for QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 0.7% for QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg dose, compared to 0.0% for placebo. Persistent markedly low serum potassium (less than 3 mEq/L, and a reduction from pre-treatment of greater than 0.5 mEq/L at two consecutive visits or at the final visit) occurred in 0.2% receiving QSYMIA 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 0.1% receiving QSYMIA 15 mg/92 mg dose, compared to 0.0% receiving placebo.

Low serum potassium levels (< 3.5 mEq/L) were not observed in a 56-week clinical trial of pediatric patients with obesity.

### Oversimplifying quantum factoring [^9011a539]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Shor's quantum factoring algorithm exponentially outperforms known classical methods. Previous experimental implementations have used simplifications dependent on knowing the factors in advance. However, as we show here, all composite numbers admit simplification of the algorithm to a circuit equivalent to flipping coins. The difficulty of a particular experiment therefore depends on the level of simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. Valid implementations should not make use of the answer sought.

Risk estimation tables — application and race/ethnicity considerations: For combinations of risk factors, if a patient's levels are more adverse than a table cell that shows 8%, then the estimated 10-year risk would be ≥ 8%. To avoid instability at extremes, the risk probabilities are truncated at 1% and 30%, and proportions are presented for the US adult population 40 to 79 years of age. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, estimated risk is generally lower in Hispanic-American and Asian-American populations and higher in American-Indian populations; in the interim, providers may consider using the equations for non-Hispanic whites for these patients, noting that the estimated risks may be overestimates, especially for Hispanic and Asian Americans.

Our analytic sample included 9565 unique reproductive-aged participants (weighted = 5 443 192 individuals), who contributed 18 603 paired longitudinal observations (mean [SD], 1.94 [0.79] paired observations per participant) (Figure 1). Almost one-half of the sample (3256 participants [weighted percentage, 48%]) was younger than 30 years at baseline, and 4066 (weighted percentage, 51%) were nulliparous (Table 1). Most participants (5952 participants [weighted percentage, 59%]) reported living with a partner. Among participants, 8349 (weighted percentage, 84%) had at least some college education, 8571 (weighted percentage, 92%) had health insurance, and 7341 (weighted percentage, 74%) were employed. Approximately one-third of participants (3035 participants [weighted percentage, 34%]) reported religion was not important or that they were not religious. Among participants, 259 (weighted percentage, 4%) were Asian, non-Hispanic; 925 (weighted percentage, 14%) were Black, non-Hispanic; 838 (weighted percentage, 12%) were Hispanic; 7162 (weighted percentage, 66%) were White, non-Hispanic; and 369 (weighted percentage, 5%) were multiracial or another race or ethnicity. Most participants (8959 [weighted percentage, 94%]) reported they were in excellent, very good, or good health.

### Excess deaths in the United States during the first year of COVID-19 [^b9a073b5]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Accurately determining the number of excess deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is hard. The most important challenge is determining the counterfactual count of baseline deaths that would have occurred in its absence. Flexible estimation methods were used here to provide this baseline number and plausibility of the resulting estimates was evaluated by examining how changes between baseline and actual prior year deaths compared to historical year-over-year changes during the previous decade. Similar comparisons were used to examine the reasonableness of excess death estimates obtained in prior research. Total, group-specific and cause-specific excess deaths in the U.S. from March 2020 through February 2021 were calculated using publicly available data covering all deaths from March 2009 through December 2020 and provisional data for January 2021 and February 2021. The estimates indicate that there were 649,411 (95% CI: 600,133 to 698,689) excess deaths in the U.S. from 3/20–2/21, a 23% (95% CI: 21%-25%) increase over baseline, with 82.9% (95% CI: 77.0% - 89.7%) of these attributed directly to COVID-19. There were substantial differences across population groups and causes in the ratio of actual-to-baseline deaths, and in the contribution of COVID-19 to excess mortality. Prior research has probably often underestimated baseline mortality and so overstated both excess deaths and the percentage of them attributed to non-COVID-19 causes.

### Smartphone apps for calculating insulin dose: a systematic assessment [^9cd12192]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The formula used to suggest an insulin dose was listed in a third (n = 14/46) of apps and obtained on request for a further seven. Just under half (46%, n = 21/46) of developers did not respond to requests for information, contact details were not found for two, and two refused on grounds of commercial confidence. Formulae were broadly consistent across apps. Meal boluses were generated by dividing carbohydrate intake by a user-supplied, personal carbohydrate factor; the number of grams of carbohydrate required to offset the reduction in blood glucose caused by one unit of rapid-acting insulin. Correction boluses were derived similarly, by dividing the difference between current and target blood glucose values by an insulin sensitivity factor; the expected reduction in blood glucose in response to 1 unit of insulin for an individual. Some apps used the inverse form of carbohydrate (n = 9) and insulin sensitivity (n = 2) factors, performing a multiplication operation to calculate meal and correction boluses instead. Postprandial adjustments of correction boluses were supported in a fifth (22%, n = 10/46) of apps that either attempted to model residual insulin activity (n = 5) or supported post-meal custom factors (n = 5). One app provided a warning that two-hour postprandial corrections should be adjusted to reflect the pharmacokinetics of a recent mealtime dose. Most (76%, n = 35/46), however, relied on the user to know that an adjustment would be required for insulin-on-board to avoid a risk of overdose.

### Adjustment for energy intake in nutritional research: a causal inference perspective [^3c2926dd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The all-components model (model 5)

With no confounding, the all-components model returns unbiased estimates of the total causal effect (= 5.0 mg/dL/100 kcal; 95% SI: 4.0, 6.1 mg/dL/100 kcal) and average relative causal effect (= 2.0 mg/dL/100 kcal; 95% SI: 0.9, 3.1 mg/dL/100 kcal). Because this model involves adjusting for all remaining component sources of energy separately, in the presence of confounding by common causes of diet it also returns unbiased estimates of the total causal effect (= 5.0 mg/dL/100 kcal; 95% SI: 4.0, 6.0 mg/dL/100 kcal) and average relative causal effect (= 2.0 mg/dL/100 kcal; 95% SI: 0.9, 3.1 mg/dL/100 kcal).

### APSA new technology committee: innovative therapy white paper-01 / 2014 [^1ffa49f4]. APSA (2016). Medium credibility.

Innovative therapy and the FDA — device approval and classification: The FDA's responsibility to protect public health includes its regulation of medical devices, and the FDA classifies medical devices according to risk with only highest risk devices requiring FDA approval prior to marketing. Prior to approval, the applicant must provide the FDA with "reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness". Moderate risk devices may be cleared based on an FDA determination that they are "substantially equivalent" to an already legally marketed device, while low risk devices are exempted from premarket review when they are equivalent in use and technology to existing approved products. There is little incentive to develop devices for specific use in children due to their small market share, and with few exceptions the responsibility and cost of device evaluation prior to FDA approval lies with individual innovators/investors, which remains a major obstacle to surgical device development for children.
