## Question

Cellulitis in a 3 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and manage cellulitis in a 3-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis and ruling out mimics. Then, I should assess anatomic location and severity, including whether the infection is purulent or involves the periorbital/orbital area. Next, I need to consider likely pathogens and MRSA risk, as well as whether any diagnostic tests are warranted. After that, I will decide on outpatient versus inpatient management, choose initial empiric antibiotics and dosing, set a treatment duration, and outline follow-up and criteria for escalation. Finally, I should address special situations like facial/periorbital disease, water exposure pathogens, supportive care, prevention, and options for ambulatory parenteral therapy with pediatric considerations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. In a 3-year-old, cellulitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, and there is no single gold standard diagnostic test, so careful history and examination are paramount [^1119mx9Q] [^112hv8YA]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because misdiagnosis is common and reported rates of pseudocellulitis on second assessment average about 41%, so I should actively consider mimics and re-evaluate early if the course is atypical or unresponsive [^111Gmbbk]. I need to ensure I assess for abscess clinically and, if uncertain, use point-of-care ultrasound because differentiating cellulitis from abscess changes management in a meaningful proportion of pediatric cases [^114vUVFq] [^1122xnD2].

> Next, I should review anatomic location and severity. I will classify as nonpurulent versus purulent because the presence of purulence or drainable abscess shifts empiric coverage and often requires drainage, and I must identify high-risk sites such as periorbital/orbital involvement, which mandate urgent imaging and specialty-directed therapy to prevent complications like subperiosteal abscess [^112iZpuV] [^113KXkHu] [^1159k8Qq]. I should double-check that routine labs and cultures are not indicated in uncomplicated cellulitis, reserving targeted testing for severe disease, immunocompromise, unusual exposures, or diagnostic uncertainty, consistent with guideline recommendations [^112Y49h4] [^112iZpuV].

> I will now examine likely pathogens for a 3-year-old. Let me think about the typical microbiology: beta-hemolytic streptococci, particularly group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus predominate beyond infancy, whereas group B Streptococcus is primarily a concern in infants under 3 months, making GBS unlikely here based on age alone [^1119mx9Q] [^11689GoD] [^113ZeEw7]. I should confirm MRSA risk factors and clinical phenotype, because empiric MRSA-active therapy is recommended for purulent cellulitis and can be added for nonpurulent disease failing initial beta-lactam therapy or when local epidemiology suggests high prevalence, pending cultures if obtained [^114zdKRg] [^114ZhUEW] [^1118k8ze].

> Wait, let me verify the role of diagnostics before I order anything. I should avoid routine blood cultures, swabs, or aspirates in typical cellulitis, as yield is low and does not guide care, and I will reserve needle aspiration for exceptional circumstances in which pathogen identification will change management, acknowledging the low positivity rates in pediatrics [^112Y49h4] [^111CZ8WV]. If I remain uncertain about an occult abscess, I should use ultrasound at the bedside to guide the need for incision and drainage and to reduce unnecessary antibiotics or procedures in children [^114vUVFq] [^1122xnD2].

> I need to determine the appropriate setting of care. Hold on, I should verify indications for hospitalization: systemic toxicity or SIRS, immunocompromise, suspected deep or necrotizing infection, failure of outpatient therapy, inability to tolerate or absorb oral agents, poor adherence or unreliable follow-up, and periorbital/orbital infection are all accepted reasons to admit per IDSA and AAFP guidance [^112iZpuV] [^115UecZb]. Conversely, if the child is hemodynamically stable without SIRS, can take oral medications, has reliable caregivers, and assured follow-up within 24–48 hours, outpatient care is appropriate, especially with clear return precautions [^111ek3cL].

> Now I should select antibiotics for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis likely due to streptococci. An oral beta-lactam active against streptococci is first-line, and cephalexin is a common choice supported by pediatric emergency department data showing good outcomes in mild to moderate disease [^114LP8SG] [^1125vnm1] [^112AAE7s]. I initially stated "cephalexin 25–50 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours", but wait, let me verify dosing because that sounds too high per dose for routine outpatient care; I should correct this to standard pediatric dosing of 25–50 mg/kg per day divided every 6–8 hours, and in many centers a pragmatic regimen is 12.5 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours to target 50 mg/kg per day, with a usual maximum daily dose up to 2–4 g depending on local guidance, which aligns with the principle of streptococcal coverage endorsed by IDSA, AAFP, and dermatology reviews [^116aZEV3] [^115UecZb] [^113EYPpq]. If beta-lactam allergy or intolerance is present and MRSA risk is low, I should consider clindamycin as monotherapy if local clindamycin resistance is low, while carefully monitoring for adverse effects [^1118k8ze].

> For purulent disease or when MRSA risk is high, I need to ensure MRSA coverage up front. Oral clindamycin 10–13 mg/kg per dose every 6–8 hours, totaling approximately 40 mg/kg per day, is recommended in pediatric patients when local resistance allows, and an alternative is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole dosed by the TMP component at 8–12 mg/kg per day divided twice daily, with the caveat that TMP-SMX has limited streptococcal activity and may require combination with a beta-lactam if streptococci are suspected [^1118k8ze] [^114zdKRg]. If IV therapy is needed due to severity or inability to take PO, I should use vancomycin or IV clindamycin based on local susceptibility, with vancomycin favored for severe infections or high clindamycin resistance, and consider a beta-lactam like cefazolin for nonpurulent cellulitis if MRSA risk is low, escalating if there is no response [^111hF6M3] [^114LP8SG].

> I should confirm treatment duration next. IDSA guidance supports 5–10 days individualized to response, with the 2014 SSTI guideline allowing 7–14 days for many bacterial SSTIs, while the American College of Physicians advises that 5–6 days suffices for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis when close follow-up is assured, so I will start with 5–6 days and extend only if the clinical trajectory lags [^114Z8V8r] [^114ge6ZK] [^111gsSaf]. But wait, what if there is perceived nonresponse on day 1 or 2? Early nonresponse often triggers premature escalation despite appropriate initial therapy, so I should reassess diagnosis and focus on supportive care and source control, reserving antibiotic broadening for clear clinical deterioration or new findings such as abscess or systemic toxicity [^115ZLcDr] [^115fP7Gu] [^117Pd3mv].

> Special sites require special handling. For facial, periorbital, or orbital cellulitis, I need to check urgently for orbital involvement with imaging when red flags are present and initiate IV therapy with ENT/ophthalmology input because subperiosteal abscess may require drainage and delayed therapy risks serious complications [^113KXkHu] [^1159k8Qq]. Hold on, I should verify stewardship tools here as well; a negative nasal MRSA PCR can support narrowing anti-MRSA therapy in selected orbital cellulitis cohorts without increasing readmissions, though data are limited and institutional protocols should guide use [^115DwEsC].

> I need to consider exposure-specific pathogens. If there is saltwater or seafood exposure raising concern for Vibrio vulnificus, the pediatric regimen is nuanced; earlier pediatric-focused CDC guidance suggests TMP-SMX plus an aminoglycoside and to avoid doxycycline or fluoroquinolones in young children, but wait, I should verify against the broader CDC clinical overview which recommends doxycycline plus a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftazidime, or a fluoroquinolone as an alternative, even in children given the severity and high mortality risk of invasive vibriosis, so therapy should align with current local policy and expert input in serious cases [^113iffKH] [^1171ENWw].

> Supportive care can materially improve outcomes. I should elevate the affected limb to reduce edema, outline erythema margins to track progression objectively, and use warm compresses for comfort, which also helps me verify improvement at follow-up and can prevent premature escalation [^117WMmEy]. I need to ensure I examine and treat predisposing portals of entry such as interdigital toe maceration or tinea and address chronic edema or eczema to reduce recurrence risk [^115fTU2J] [^111Mrdn1].

> Prevention and decolonization matter for recurrences. I should counsel caregivers on hygiene and wound care, including keeping draining lesions covered, hand hygiene, and not sharing personal items, and consider decolonization with nasal mupirocin and topical antiseptics for recurrent staphylococcal SSTIs in the household, treating symptomatic contacts when appropriate [^1114UPEg] [^111J8tTJ] [^112bNNbj]. If a child experiences frequent streptococcal cellulitis recurrences despite optimizing predisposing factors, I should confirm candidacy for prophylactic antibiotics such as oral penicillin or erythromycin, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin, tailored to frequency and tolerance [^115ssoEa].

> Follow-up and monitoring must be explicit. I should arrange reassessment within 24–48 hours to verify clinical improvement, reinforce return precautions, and adjust therapy based on evolution, with urgent escalation for spreading erythema despite therapy, increasing pain or swelling, new fever or systemic signs, bullae, crepitus, or anesthesia suggesting necrotizing infection [^111ek3cL] [^112iZpuV]. Let me reconsider the tendency to escalate too soon; if the child is stable and margins are not expanding and pain is improving, stability within the first 24 hours can be sufficient to maintain the plan, as expert consensus suggests that early transition and de-escalation are appropriate when other improvement criteria are met [^117MPATh].

> For children who merit parenteral therapy but are otherwise stable, I should confirm whether outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy is feasible. Evidence from randomized and observational pediatric studies supports once-daily ceftriaxone at home as noninferior to inpatient flucloxacillin for moderate to severe uncomplicated cellulitis, with favorable cost-effectiveness and similar safety when appropriate selection and daily review are in place, and ambulatory IV therapy is also effective in selected preseptal cellulitis [^113MYgPs] [^1169Pc2Y] [^117KqU2Z]. I need to ensure reliable daily reassessment and rapid access to escalation if worsening occurs in these pathways [^113MYgPs].

> Putting it all together for a 3-year-old with uncomplicated, nonpurulent cellulitis, I should confirm the clinical diagnosis and exclude mimics, start an oral beta-lactam such as cephalexin at a corrected pediatric dose of roughly 25–50 mg/kg per day divided every 6–8 hours with close follow-up at 24–48 hours, and aim for 5–6 total days if improving, extending only as needed, while escalating to MRSA-active therapy or obtaining imaging if purulent features emerge or the child worsens despite therapy [^1119mx9Q] [^116aZEV3] [^111gsSaf] [^114zdKRg]. If periorbital/orbital infection, systemic toxicity, inability to take oral medication, or unreliable follow-up is present, I should hospitalize for IV therapy and urgent specialty input, with vancomycin or clindamycin plus adjuncts as indicated by the clinical scenario [^112iZpuV] [^111hF6M3] [^113KXkHu].

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old is a clinical diagnosis [^112Y49h4] of acute bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, most often due to **β-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus** [^1119mx9Q]. Management is guided by severity: **oral cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate** for mild cases [^112AAE7s], and **IV cefazolin or clindamycin** for severe or MRSA-suspected cases [^1118k8ze] [^116aZEV3]. Hospitalize if there are **systemic signs, rapid progression, immunocompromise, or failure of outpatient therapy** [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL] [^115UecZb]. Most children improve within 48–72 hours; monitor for complications such as abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, or bacteremia [^1119mx9Q] [^112cLfcS], and address predisposing factors to reduce recurrence [^115fTU2J] [^117Sz9yf].

---

## Clinical presentation

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Erythema**: Localized redness of the skin, often with ill-defined borders [^1119mx9Q].

- **Edema**: Swelling of the affected area.

- **Warmth**: Increased temperature of the involved skin.

- **Tenderness**: Pain or discomfort upon palpation.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, irritability, and occasionally lymphadenopathy [^116aZEV3].

Common sites of cellulitis in this age group include the **lower extremities, face, and periorbital region** [^112hv8YA].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The **most common causative organisms** in pediatric cellulitis are β-hemolytic streptococci — particularly group A streptococcus (GAS) — and Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [^1119mx9Q]. Risk factors include skin trauma (minor cuts, abrasions, insect or animal bites), pre-existing skin conditions (eczema, impetigo, varicella), immunocompromised states due to chronic illnesses or immunosuppressive therapy, and poor hygiene or inadequate skin care [^117Sz9yf] [^111Mrdn1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Cellulitis is primarily a **clinical diagnosis** based on history and physical examination, with testing reserved for severe disease or suspected systemic involvement [^112Y49h4]. Laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, ESR) may aid assessment in severe cases, and blood cultures are recommended in severe presentations, immunocompromised patients, or when bacteremia is suspected [^112Y49h4]. Ultrasound or MRI is indicated if abscess formation, deep tissue involvement, or osteomyelitis is suspected [^111JTWYe] [^112cLfcS].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can **mimic cellulitis** in pediatric patients, including [^114kM2k4]:

- **Erysipelas**: Superficial bacterial infection with well-defined borders.

- **Abscess**: Localized collection of pus.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis**: Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection.

- **Allergic reactions**: Angioedema or urticaria.

- **Deep vein thrombosis**: Rare in children but should be considered [^113JQWLj].

---

## Management and treatment

Management of cellulitis in a 3-year-old **depends on severity** and on the presence of systemic symptoms [^116aZEV3]:

### Mild cases (no systemic symptoms)

- **Oral antibiotics**: Cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate are first-line agents [^116aZEV3].

- **MRSA coverage**: Clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) if MRSA is suspected [^114zdKRg].

- **Supportive care**: Elevation of the affected limb, analgesics, and antipyretics [^117WMmEy].

---

### Moderate to severe cases (systemic symptoms or rapid progression)

- **Intravenous antibiotics**: Cefazolin or clindamycin are recommended initial empiric therapy [^1118k8ze] [^116aZEV3].

- **MRSA coverage**: Vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA is suspected or confirmed [^111hF6M3] [^1116N4gR].

- **Hospitalization**: Indicated for severe infections [^111ek3cL], immunocompromised patients, or failure of outpatient therapy [^112iZpuV] [^115UecZb].

---

## Complications

Potential **complications** of cellulitis in pediatric patients include abscess formation requiring drainage, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis; recurrence is also possible [^1119mx9Q] [^112cLfcS].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Cellulitis in a 3-year-old is a common bacterial skin infection. Prompt clinical diagnosis and **appropriate antibiotic therapy** are essential, and the prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most children improving within 48–72 hours of treatment initiation. Recurrence is common, particularly in children with underlying skin conditions or immunocompromised states, and preventive measures — including proper skin care, hygiene, and management of underlying conditions — are essential to reduce recurrence risk [^115fTU2J] [^1119mx9Q].

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering clindamycin IV at 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (to achieve a total of 40 mg/kg/day). Additionally, transitioning to oral therapy is recommended if the strain is susceptible, as another option in stable patients without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection, provided the clindamycin resistance rate is low (< 10%).

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: It is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^112AAE7s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

The study aimed to (1) determine antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center; and (2) determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment.

- **Design**: A descriptive case-control study.

- **Setting**: A tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center.

- **Methods**: Medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1–16 years) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001 - December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory and microbiology results, and management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotics, treatment failures, and time spent in the ED.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main results**: Two hundred sixty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105). Treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). The cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. More time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) were observed in the intravenous group compared to the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

### Odontogenic infection causing orbital cellulitis in a pediatric patient [^1159k8Qq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Odontogenic abscesses can progress into orbital cellulitis, which may lead to serious intracranial and orbital complications. Full clinical complications from odontogenic orbital cellulitis in pediatric patients are rarely encountered in hospital emergency departments. Thus, odontogenic orbital cellulitis remains a medical rarity and challenge. This study describes a case of periorbital and orbital cellulitis resulting from an odontogenic origin in a 6-year-old patient. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotic administration combined with surgical drainage.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^117Pd3mv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was first to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. Second, we wanted to examine early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By limiting the study to cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study of early response in relation to baseline factors could be performed largely without the influence of confounders such as the need for surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for the assessment of early response and how initial response can be used in guiding continued treatment and predicting outcome.

### Point-of-care ultrasound on management of cellulitis versus local angioedema in the pediatric emergency department [^1122xnD2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether ultrasound can differentiate between cellulitis and angioedema from insect bites in pediatric patients, a prospective, pre-post study was conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department. Patients younger than 21 years with soft tissue swelling from insect bites, without abscesses, were enrolled. The treating physician's pretest opinions regarding the diagnosis and need for antibiotics were determined. Ultrasound of the affected areas was performed, and its effects on management were recorded. Further imaging, medications, and disposition were at the discretion of the enrolling physician. Phone call follow-ups were made within a week of presentation.

Among 103 patients enrolled with soft tissue swelling secondary to insect bites, ultrasound changed the management in 27 (26%) patients (95% confidence interval, 18–35%). Of the patients who were indeterminate or believed to require antibiotics, ultrasound changed management in 6 (23%) of 26 patients (95% CI, 6%-40%). In those patients who were believed not to require antibiotics, ultrasound changed management in 12 (16%) of 77 patients (95% CI, 7%-24%). Patients with a diagnosis of local angioedema achieved symptom resolution 1.4 days sooner than patients diagnosed with cellulitis (mean, -1.389; 95% CI, -2.087 to -0.690; P < 0.001). No patient who was initially diagnosed with local angioedema received antibiotics upon patient follow-up.

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^114kM2k4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. However, mimics of cellulitis presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

- **Objective**: This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, mimics of cellulitis, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

- **Discussion**: The emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in an analogous manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

- **Conclusion**: Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician discern the condition appropriately.

### Management of children with uncomplicated cellulitis in emergency and hospital settings [^117MPATh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to establish consensus recommendations on features used to determine the route of antibiotic administration and disposition for children with uncomplicated cellulitis. Modified Delphi methodology was performed with two rounds of confidential surveys of emergency medicine and hospital medicine (HM) providers at Lurie Children's Hospital to assess cellulitis management in children (ages 6 months-18 years) without signs of sepsis or abscess formation. Using a 9-point Likert scale, emergency medicine providers ranked features by perceived level of importance when deciding on the initial antibiotic route. HM providers ranked features on importance when transitioning to oral antibiotics. Responses were grouped as not important (1–3), neutral (4–6), and important (7–9) and re-evaluated in the second round to reach consensus, defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

Emergency medicine providers (n = 17) reached consensus on 15 of 16 features (93.8%), 10 deemed important. Participants reached the greatest consensus (100%) on fevers/chills, lymphangitis, and functional impairment as considerations for initiating intravenous antibiotics. HM providers (n = 15) reached consensus on 9 of 11 factors (81.8%), with seven considered important when deciding on readiness for oral antibiotics. Providers indicated that the stability, rather than reduction, of erythematous margins is sufficient to consider transition and de-escalation of therapy at less than 24 hours if all other clinical improvement criteria are met.

This study achieved consensus on important aspects of managing uncomplicated cellulitis in the pediatric population, helping inform decisions on antibiotic administration and care transitions.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring following a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, due to an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^1169Pc2Y]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy after hospital admission is increasingly popular, but its use to avoid admission to the hospital altogether by treating patients wholly as outpatients remains uncommon in children. One reason for the low use of treatment at home is the scarcity of evidence of its cost-effectiveness. In this planned follow-up analysis of the Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of an admission avoidance pathway in which children were treated at home, compared with standard hospital care for the intravenous treatment of moderate or severe cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone versus hospital treatment with intravenous flucloxacillin in children aged 6 months to 18 years who had presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, with moderate or severe uncomplicated cellulitis. We included costs from two sources: institutional costs at a patient level and expenses incurred by families. We measured effectiveness with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from the Child Health Utility 9D questionnaire, and a clinical outcome of treatment failure, which was the primary outcome of the CHOICE trial. We planned to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the difference between groups in total cost divided by the difference between groups in effectiveness. The CHOICE trial is registered at ClinicalT.

### Ambulatory intravenous antibiotic therapy for children with preseptal cellulitis [^117KqU2Z]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the use of outpatient ambulatory care versus admission for intravenous antibiotics in the management of preseptal cellulitis. This is a retrospective consecutive cohort study of children younger than 16 years presenting to an Inner London Paediatric Emergency Department with signs and symptoms of preseptal cellulitis.

A total of 94 cases were identified during a 17-month period. Of them, 30 children were prescribed oral antibiotics. One child did not receive treatment. Of the 63 children prescribed with intravenous antibiotics, 42 were managed on an ambulatory basis and 21 were admitted. There was no significant difference in the duration of treatment in days between those on ambulatory management and those admitted (2.79 ± 0.8 vs 2.76 ± 1.9, P = 0.94) or in the rate of complications. The net cost saving was $205,924 (£131,065; €147,578) overall, equal to $4900 (£3120; €3513) per patient.

Ambulatory intravenous antibiotics with daily review are a safe and cost-effective alternative to inpatient admission in simple preseptal cellulitis for children in our population who require parenteral antibiotics.

### Burden, risk factors, and infectious complications of cellulitis and erysipelas in US adults and children in the emergency department setting [^116Ncg2p]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Little is known about the use and burden of emergency department (ED) visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence, risk factors, complications, and cost of emergency care for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study of the 2006 to 2016 National Emergency Department Sample, including a 20% sample of US ED visits (N = 320,080,467).

- **Results**: The mean annual incidence of ED visits with a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas was 2.42 to 3.55 per million adult and 1.14 to 2.09 per million pediatric ED visits. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas decreased significantly from 2006 to 2015 (Rao-Scott chi-square, P < .0001). ED visits with versus without a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with public or no insurance, lower household income quartiles, and were more likely to occur during weekends and summer months. The mean cost of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas more than doubled in adults (from $720 to $1680) and tripled in children (from $939 to $2,823) from 2006 to 2016. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with multiple risk factors and increased infectious complications.

- **Limitations**: No data on cellulitis and erysipelas treatment or recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: There is a substantial and increasing burden of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States. Many ED visits occurred for uncomplicated cellulitis/erysipelas, in part because of health care disparities.

### Narrative review: Diseases that masquerade as infectious cellulitis [^113JQWLj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

For cellulitis that does not respond to conventional antimicrobial treatment, clinicians should consider several noninfectious disorders that might masquerade as infectious cellulitis.

- **Common masqueraders**: Diseases that commonly masquerade as this condition include thrombophlebitis, contact dermatitis, insect stings, drug reactions, eosinophilic cellulitis (the Wells syndrome), gouty arthritis, carcinoma erysipelatoides, familial Mediterranean fever, and foreign-body reactions.

- **Uncommon masqueraders**: Diseases that uncommonly masquerade as infectious cellulitis include urticaria, lymphedema, lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, leukemia, Paget disease, and panniculitis.

Clinicians should conduct an initial diagnostic work-up directed by the findings from a detailed history and complete physical examination. In many cases, a skin biopsy is the only tool that helps identify the correct diagnosis. Special tests may also be needed.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, specifically in terms of antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a β-lactam antibiotic, such as cefazolin, in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. If there is no clinical response, it is advised to modify the treatment to MRSA-active therapy. The recommended duration of treatment is 7–14 days, individualized based on the patient's clinical response.

### What is the utility of point-of-care ultrasound for diagnosis of soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis [^114vUVFq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including cellulitis and abscess, are common conditions managed in the emergency department. Differentiating these based solely on history and physical examination can be challenging. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been proposed as a tool to distinguish abscess from cellulitis.

- **Clinical question**: What is the utility of POCUS for diagnosing soft tissue abscess vs. cellulitis?

- **Evidence review**: Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of POCUS for diagnosing abscess. These studies provide estimates of the potential utility of POCUS in differentiating abscess and cellulitis.

- **Conclusion**: Based upon the available literature, POCUS can reliably differentiate abscess and cellulitis and assist with the management of SSTIs.

### Who can have parenteral antibiotics at home? A prospective observational study in children with moderate/severe cellulitis [^1164f7aQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The benefits of treating children at home or in an ambulatory setting have been well documented. We aimed to describe the characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of children with moderate/severe cellulitis treated at home with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone via direct referral from the Emergency Department to a hospital-in-the-home (HITH) program.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 3 months to 18 years with moderate/severe cellulitis referred from a tertiary pediatric Emergency Department to HITH from September 2012 to January 2014 were prospectively identified. Data collection included demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes. To ensure home treatment did not result in inferior outcomes, these patients were retrospectively compared with patients who were hospitalized for IV flucloxacillin, the standard-of-care over the same period. The primary outcome was home treatment failure necessitating hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic changes, complications, length of stay, and cost.

- **Results**: Forty-one (28%) patients were treated on HITH and 103 (72%) were hospitalized. Compared with hospitalized patients, HITH patients were older (P < 0.01) and less likely to have periorbital cellulitis (P = 0.01) or fever (P = 0.04). There were no treatment failures under HITH care. The rate of antibiotic changes was similar in both groups (5% vs. 7%, P = 0.67), as was IV antibiotic duration (2.3 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.23).

- **Conclusion**: Older children with moderate/severe limb cellulitis without systemic symptoms can be treated at home.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, and more specifically with respect to the management of recurrent cellulitis, known as reCellulitis (hygiene practices), the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend offering preventive educational messages on personal hygiene and appropriate wound care in all patients with SSTIs. Counsel regarding the following:

- **Keep draining wounds covered**: Use clean, dry bandages.
- **Maintain good personal hygiene**: Engage in regular bathing and clean hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, particularly after touching infected skin or an item that has directly contacted a draining wound.
- **Avoid reusing or sharing personal items**: Do not reuse or share personal items, such as disposable razors, linens, and towels, that have contacted infected skin.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis, resulting in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically relevant.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review using Ovid and Embase databases in May 2018. Our aim was to describe diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Eight observational studies were included.

- **Biochemical markers**: Five studies examined biochemical markers.

- **Imaging and decision models**: Two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

- **What's already known about this topic**: Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113HJYLn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate the methodological quality, all studies were assessed by two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) using signalling questions in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.‐T.). If the information was not clearly provided in the study, the reviewers assessed the signalling question as 'unclear'.

For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signalling questions were answered 'yes'; 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signalling question was 'no'; or 'unclear' in all other cases.

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization. It is encountered by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. Despite its prevalence, cellulitis can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination, but lacks a gold standard for diagnosis.

The clinical presentation typically includes acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain. However, diagnosing cellulitis can be complicated by numerous infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens.

Most non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Appropriate targeted coverage with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is usually sufficient. Although there are rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Needle aspiration for the etiologic diagnosis of children with cellulitis in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111CZ8WV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem in children, but determining the causative agent is difficult. One tool used to identify the etiology is needle aspiration. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of needle aspiration in pediatric patients with cellulitis in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

- **Methods**: This was a prospective descriptive study conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital. A convenience sample of healthy children, 0 to 18 years old, with cellulitis were enrolled, and a standard cellulitis aspiration technique was performed.

- **Results**: Twenty patients were enrolled and had cultures obtained. The etiologic agent was determined in 15% (3/20) of patients; the positive cultures were all MRSA.

- **Conclusions**: Although needle aspiration of cellulitis was of low yield, the only pathogens isolated in this study were CA-MRSA. Empiric antibiotics for cellulitis should include coverage for MRSA. In circumstances in which bacterial etiology and antibiotic susceptibility knowledge would be critical, needle aspiration should be considered.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis play an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

- **Objective**: We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

- **Discussion**: Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision-making to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

- **Conclusions**: Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis, need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113JzGUY]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This is the first systematic review that aimed to identify diagnostic criteria or tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The key strength of this review is the comprehensive search strategy used, which was supported by an experienced information specialist. The focus of this review was on lower-limb cellulitis; therefore, if the site of cellulitis was not specified or a study did not present the results of lower-limb cellulitis separately, the study was excluded.

The limitations of this review stem from the number and quality of the studies included. Data could not be pooled because the index tests were not comparable. Additionally, 28 papers were excluded as the site of cellulitis was not specified or the results for lower-limb cellulitis were not separated. These papers did include diagnostic criteria or tools that need to be further evaluated. Owing to time constraints, only the first 100 results on Google Scholar were included.

In conclusion, this systematic review has identified an important research gap in the diagnosis of lower-limb cellulitis. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the validity of any diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. As such, their utility for clinical practice or research remains unclear. Future studies should employ prospective designs using diagnosis by board-certified specialists with cellulitis expertise as the reference diagnostic standard and should be validated in both primary and secondary care settings.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, specifically the management of recurrent cellulitis, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended. The IDSA 2014 guidelines suggest considering the administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin taken twice a day for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, for patients experiencing 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and abscess are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

Cellulitis in an infant younger than 3 months is most commonly caused by group B streptococci (GBS). A baby with cellulitis in this age group should have a full septic workup, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, as GBS cellulitis may be associated with bacteremia. We discuss a 6-week-old baby with cellulitis and meningitis to illustrate the potential complexity of this infectious disease process. We also present a concise review of GBS cellulitis and meningitis with initially normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure, defined as failed initial antibiotic therapy requiring a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years, and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and…

### Management of skin and soft-tissue infections before and after clinical pathway implementation [^112REywX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We evaluated if the introduction of a clinical pathway for skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) would reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-directed therapy for simple cellulitis and antibiotic use for simple abscess after drainage. We compared the treatment of SSTI during a 3-month pre-pathway and an 11-month post-pathway period. We included patients aged 57 days to 18 years old discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cellulitis or abscess.

- **Balancing measures**: Included 72-hour revisit rate and ED length of stay (LOS). A total of 291 patients pre-pathway and 781 patients post-pathway were included. The proportion of patients with simple cellulitis prescribed MRSA-directed therapy decreased from 81% to 54% post-pathway. The proportion of patients with a drained abscess prescribed systemic antibiotics decreased from 88% to 75%. There was no increase in 72-hour revisit rates (3.8% vs 3.2%, P = 0.64) or ED LOS (2.8 vs 2.7 hours, P = 0.05).

### Variation in care and clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis [^111onPsh]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To describe variation in the care of children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis and to determine associations with length of stay (LOS), emergency department (ED) revisits, and hospital readmissions, the study utilized the Pediatric Health Information System. A multicenter, retrospective analysis was conducted involving children aged 2 months to 18 years, focusing on those with a primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnosis code for orbital cellulitis from 2007 to 2014. Hospital-level variations in the use of diagnostic tests, corticosteroids, and antibiotics were assessed both individually and in aggregate for association with outcomes (LOS, ED revisits, readmissions), after adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors.

A total of 1828 children met the inclusion criteria. The most frequently performed diagnostic tests were complete blood cell counts (median [interquartile range]: 81.8% [66.7–89.6]), C-reactive protein levels (57.1% [22.2–84.0]), blood cultures (57.9% [48.9–63.6]), and computed tomography imaging (74.7% [66.7–81.0]), with significant variations observed across hospitals (all P < .001). Corticosteroids were used in 29.2% of children (interquartile range: 18.4–37.5), and there was significant variation in antibiotic exposure across hospitals (P < .001). Increased total diagnostic test usage was associated with increased LOS (P = 0.044), but not with 30-day ED revisits (P = 0.176) or readmissions (P = 0.403).

Children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis experience wide variations in clinical practices and outcomes, highlighting the need for standardized care protocols.

### Association between corticosteroids and outcomes in children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis [^112X68Tp]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To examine the association between systemic corticosteroid use and outcomes for children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis at US children's hospitals, a multicenter observational study using administrative data from the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2007 to 2019 was conducted. Children between the ages of 2 months and 18 years with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification discharge diagnostic codes of orbital cellulitis were included. The primary exposure was the receipt of systemic corticosteroids on the day of hospital admission.

- **Primary outcome**: Hospital length of stay.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Surgical intervention, ICU admissions, revisits, and healthcare costs.

Generalized logit models with inverse probability weighting logistic regression were used to adjust for demographic factors and assess differences in clinical outcomes reported.

Of the 5832 patients hospitalized with orbital cellulitis, 330 (5.7%) were in the corticosteroid group and 5502 (94.3%) were in the non-corticosteroid group. Patients in the corticosteroid group were older, had more severe illness, and received broad-spectrum antibiotics. In adjusted analyses, corticosteroid exposure was not associated with differences in length of hospital stay, need for surgical intervention, ICU admissions, emergency department revisits, 30-day hospital readmissions, or hospital costs.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^1171ENWw]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

For cellulitis, particularly in patients with Vibrio vulnificus infections, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend administering doxycycline either orally or intravenously at a dosage of 100 mg twice daily for 7–14 days. Additionally, a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime at 1–2 g intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours, is advised as first-line therapy in these cases. It is important to acknowledge that a single-agent regimen using a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or gatifloxacin, has demonstrated at least equivalent effectiveness to the regimen combining doxycycline with a cephalosporin in animal studies.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several non-pharmacological factors were associated with a lack of early response. Such early non-response was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but was strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. It is typically diagnosed clinically and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging is often not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common; predisposing conditions should be assessed and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Do patients with cellulitis need to be hospitalized? A systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality rates of inpatients with cellulitis [^114RuFHK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the United States, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "other cellulitis and abscess" accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances; however, there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are currently recommended for outpatient management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I² statistic.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7–1.8). For studies from the United States, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0.3–0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one-third of deaths appeared to be due to infection.

- **Discussion**: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial health care spending.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day post-discharge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status, and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended antibiotic adjustments based on their assessment.

### Preseptal and orbital cellulitis: Analysis of clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of 123 pediatric cases from Turkey [^113KXkHu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics and imaging methods of patients diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis in the pediatric age group.

- **Methods**: The study was designed retrospectively, and the medical records of all patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis were reviewed. The findings of the preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis groups were compared, and the risk factors for the development of orbital involvement were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 123 patients were included, with 90.2% having preseptal cellulitis and 9.8% having orbital cellulitis. The male gender ratio was 60.2%, and the mean age was 72 ± 43 months. All patients had eyelid swelling and redness, while 20.3% had fever. Ocular involvement was observed in 51.2% of the right eyes and 4.9% in both eyes. Rhinosinusitis was the most common predisposing factor (56.1%). Radiologic imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) was performed in 83.7% of the patients. Subperiosteal abscess was detected in 7 cases (5.6%), of which three cases were managed surgically, and four were treated medically. The levels of C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients with orbital involvement (P = 0.033), but there was no difference between the presence of fever, leukocyte, and platelet values.

- **Conclusions**: Rhinosinusitis was the most common predisposing factor in the development of preseptal and orbital cellulitis. Orbital involvement was present in 9.8% of the patients. High C-reactive protein levels were associated with orbital involvement.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^117Dqssm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting over 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates.

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S. aureus and enterococci strains. Guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSI were published before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI.

### Randomized, controlled trial of antibiotics in the management of community-acquired skin abscesses in the pediatric patient [^1126Woy3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Emergency department visits for skin and soft tissue infections are increasing with the discovery of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Whether abscesses treated surgically also require antibiotics is controversial. There are no published pediatric randomized controlled trials evaluating the need for antibiotics in skin abscess management. This study determines the benefits of antibiotics in surgically managed pediatric skin abscesses.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Pediatric patients were randomized to receive 10 days of either placebo or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after incision and draining. Follow-up consisted of a visit or call at 10 to 14 days and a call at 90 days. The primary outcome was treatment failure at the 10-day follow-up, and the secondary outcome was new lesion development at the 10- and 90-day follow-ups. Noninferiority of placebo relative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for primary and secondary outcomes was assessed.

- **Results**: One hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled, with 12 lost to follow-up. The failure rates were 5.3% (n = 4/76) and 4.1% (n = 3/73) in the placebo and antibiotic groups, respectively, yielding a difference of 1.2%, with a 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (-infinity to 6.8%). Noninferiority was established with an equivalence threshold of 7%. New lesions occurred at the 10-day follow-up: 19 on placebo (26.4%) and 9 on antibiotics (12.9%), yielding a difference of 13.5%, with a 95% 1-sided CI (-infinity to 24.3%). At the 3-month follow-up, 15 of 52 (28.8%) in the placebo group and 13 in the antibiotic group were further evaluated.

### Distinguishing clinical features for pseudocellulitis in pediatric inpatients: A retrospective study [^115V4wPz]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical features of 588 pediatric inpatients admitted with a diagnosis of cellulitis were reviewed, focusing on the diagnostic accuracy of true cellulitis (95.1%) versus pseudocellulitis (4.9%) and the utilization of specialist consultations (28.1% infectious disease, 6.1% dermatology). Laboratory abnormalities were unable to distinguish cellulitis from pseudocellulitis, supporting previous studies that routine laboratory evaluation may be unnecessary for this diagnosis. Higher rates of pseudocellulitis were identified in cases involving specialist consultation by both dermatology (44.8% pseudocellulitis, 4.1% true cellulitis, p < 0.001) and infectious disease (48.3% pseudocellulitis, 27.0% true cellulitis, p = .01). Thus, consultation may improve the diagnostic accuracy of suspected cellulitis among pediatric inpatients.

### Gender differences in the management of pediatric orbital cellulitis [^113RR4V2]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate gender differences in the disease severity and management of orbital infections in children hospitalized for treatment.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of all children aged 0 to 18 years who had a confirmed diagnosis of preseptal or postseptal cellulitis and were hospitalized over a 15-year period.

- **Results**: The sample consisted of 124 children, 52.4% male, with a mean age of 7.1 years (SD = 4.88, range = 4.9–18) and a relatively equal distribution between preseptal (52.4%) and postseptal (47.6%) cellulitis. Although males and females did not differ in rates of preseptal and postseptal cellulitis and Lund-Mackay scores (p > 0.05 for all), males were more likely to undergo surgical management (21.5% vs 8.5%; p = 0.049).

- **Conclusion**: Additional research is needed to understand why the management of cellulitis differs between male and female pediatric patients and how it may affect treatment outcomes.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115ZLcDr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment escalation was observed in 34% (69/205) of cases, mostly within 2 days of treatment initiation. Among cases with such early escalation, 90% (37/41) had nonresponse at day 1. Most cases with nonresponse at day 1 and treatment escalation within day 2 had a response within day 3, but not as often as those without escalation (73% [24/33] vs. 91% [75/82]; p = 0.009). Treatment escalation within day 2 was rarely associated with inappropriate initial therapy (2/40 [5%]) and was common both in cases with confirmed or probable BHS etiology (32/173 [19%]) and other cases (8/39 [27%]). Long duration of therapy was strongly associated with nonresponse at day 3, but not with nonresponse at day 1. Surgical treatment escalation was clearly more common in cases with nonresponse at day 3.

Nonresponse at day 1 and day 3 was not significantly associated with clinical failure, but nonresponse at day 3 was predictive of a complicated, resource-demanding course. Sensitivity analysis with replacement of missing response data gave similar results.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and healthcare cost.

- **Objective**: To determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment duration in patients with cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up duration. Patients were randomized to the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. A medical chart review of demographic information and hospital courses was performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1,300 patients were screened, 1,125 were excluded, and 175 were included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Results showed that of 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men. The mean age was 58.8 years. Length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment (< 4 days: 8.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^113MYgPs]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 hours) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 hours of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure in the in…

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, due to an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Misdiagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Gmbbk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis with several mimics and no gold standard diagnostic criteria, making misdiagnosis common. This review aims to quantify the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings based on a second clinical assessment and to describe the proportion and types of alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Electronic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL) using MeSH and other subject terms identified 887 randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, and cohort studies. Included articles assessed the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in primary or unscheduled care settings through a second clinical assessment up to 14 days post initial diagnosis of uncomplicated cellulitis. Studies on infants and patients with (peri-)orbital, purulent, and severe or complex cellulitis were excluded. Screening and data extraction were conducted independently in pairs. The risk of bias was assessed using a modified risk of bias tool from Hoy et al. Meta-analyses were undertaken where ≥ 3 studies reported the same outcome.

- **Results**: Nine studies conducted in the United States, UK, and Canada, including a total of 1,600 participants, were eligible for inclusion. Six studies were conducted in the inpatient setting; three were in outpatient clinics. All nine included studies provided estimates of the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis, with a range from 19% to 83%. The mean proportion misdiagnosed was 41% (95% CI 28% to 56% for random effects model). Heterogeneity between studies was very high both statistically (I² 96%, p-value for het).

### Ultrasound soft-tissue applications in the pediatric emergency department: To drain or not to drain [^111JTWYe]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Soft tissue infections frequently prompt visits to the pediatric emergency department. The incidence of these infections has increased markedly in recent years. The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with increasing morbidity, mortality, and frequency of abscess formation. Bedside ultrasound may significantly impact the management of patients who present to the pediatric emergency department with soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscess, peritonsillar abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis. Ultrasound is an efficient, noninvasive diagnostic tool that can augment the physician's clinical examination. It has been shown to be superior to clinical judgment alone in determining the presence or absence of occult abscess formation, ensuring appropriate management and limiting unnecessary invasive procedures.
