## Question

How should thrombocytosis be evaluated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how thrombocytosis should be evaluated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true thrombocytosis and excluding spurious counts. Then, I should review history and examination for secondary causes and order targeted labs. Next, I will consider when to pivot to clonal work-up with molecular testing and bone marrow biopsy. After that, I need to apply WHO 2016 diagnostic criteria to classify ET versus alternatives. Then, I must risk stratify and align therapy with ELN/ESMO/BSH guidance, including special situations like extreme thrombocytosis, surgery, pregnancy, pediatrics, and hyposplenism. Finally, I will set follow-up and monitoring checkpoints and reconcile any areas of controversy while double-checking references.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality is real and persistent: I should repeat the CBC on a fresh sample and examine a peripheral smear to exclude pseudothrombocytosis from platelet clumping, giant platelets, or artifacts, and to look for morphological clues to reactive states or hyposplenism such as Howell‑Jolly bodies or target cells, because correcting spurious causes prevents unnecessary work‑up [^113YM4KW] [^1166mbw3].

> Wait, let me verify the likely etiologies before I jump to molecular testing: on history and exam I need to screen for infection or inflammation, iron deficiency and bleeding, recent surgery or trauma, active or occult malignancy, medications that drive thrombopoiesis, cardiovascular risk factors, and splenic status, because secondary thrombocytosis is far more common than clonal disease and these clues should steer the initial labs and management [^114jAcbW] [^115QVg4z].

> Next, I should review initial laboratory work to chase secondary causes: CRP/ESR and directed cultures or imaging if infection is plausible, iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation to detect iron deficiency, hemolysis labs when indicated, and age‑appropriate cancer screening as needed, because iron deficiency alone accounts for thrombocytosis in about one‑third of IDA patients and treatment typically normalizes the platelet count while reducing a two‑fold higher thrombotic risk seen when thrombocytosis accompanies IDA [^116dgroe] [^111TrMCf].

> Hold on, I should verify persistence after addressing secondaries before labeling a myeloproliferative process: if thrombocytosis persists without a reactive trigger, I will order peripheral blood molecular testing for JAK2 V617F, CALR, and MPL driver mutations and BCR‑ABL1 to exclude CML, and I will plan a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy with morphology, cytogenetics, and a myeloid NGS panel, because marrow histology is essential to distinguish ET from prefibrotic myelofibrosis and other myeloid neoplasms per WHO and ELN guidance [^113xeTPA] [^111fXYLx] [^1131VoXA] [^111gvjfr].

> I will now examine classification rigorously: applying WHO 2016 criteria, ET requires platelets ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L, characteristic megakaryocytic proliferation without significant fibrosis, exclusion of CML, PV, PMF, MDS and other myeloid neoplasms, and presence of JAK2/CALR/MPL mutation, with an alternative pathway of the first three major criteria plus a clonal marker or absence of reactive thrombocytosis, which I should confirm against marrow and molecular findings to avoid misclassification [^113xeTPA] [^117FrQx7].

> But wait, what if morphology suggests pre‑PMF rather than ET: I need to consider prefibrotic PMF when there is atypical megakaryocyte morphology or higher-grade fibrosis, because pre‑PMF carries worse survival and bleeding risk than WHO‑defined ET and mislabeling leads to inappropriate therapy, so I should double‑check the marrow with an experienced hematopathologist if discordant clinical features arise [^116mzBB3] [^1131VoXA].

> Next, I should review thrombotic risk stratification once ET is confirmed: traditionally BSH 2010 stratifies high risk by age > 60 years, prior thrombosis or hemorrhage, or extreme platelet count ≥ 1,500 × 10⁹/L, intermediate risk by age 40–60 without high-risk features, and low risk by age < 40 without high-risk features, but I need to ensure I also account for cardiovascular risk factors and JAK2 V617F status as independent predictors of thrombosis per ELN and contemporary data, while recognizing evolving debate about the risk conferred by platelet count alone [^1168VZtk] [^112pWUCB] [^116mzBB3].

> Let me consider reactive thrombocytosis management before jumping to cytoreduction: I should treat the underlying cause such as iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, or cancer, avoid platelet-lowering drugs in routine secondary thrombocytosis, and reserve aspirin only for clear standard cardiovascular indications or specific scenarios, then recheck CBC in 2–4 weeks to document resolution with causative therapy [^113YM4KW] [^116dgroe].

> I need to check low‑risk ET therapy: the default is low‑dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily unless bleeding risk or acquired von Willebrand syndrome is present, with observation and periodic CBCs, and I should confirm that aspirin is appropriate in the context of driver mutation status and microvascular symptoms, while withholding it if there is laboratory evidence of AVWS [^115F7e3q] [^115hzTXE].

> For high‑risk ET, I should confirm the cytoreductive plan: hydroxyurea remains first‑line to reduce vascular events, with interferon‑alpha preferred in younger patients or during childbearing, and anagrelide considered in intolerance or resistance, aiming for a pragmatic platelet target of < 600 × 10⁹/L per ESMO and historical randomized data rather than < 450 × 10⁹/L which I almost wrote earlier; wait, I should double‑check the procedural context too, because preoperative bleeding‑risk procedures may justify a stricter temporary goal such as < 400 × 10⁹/L per BSH 2010, and I note I initially cited BSH 2010 as ref 4f211b4, hold on, I should verify the correct identifier is 4f211b4c [^115hzTXE] [^115F7e3q] [^1163Hv7N] [^1132K9ET].

> Hmm, wait a minute, extreme thrombocytosis complicates the aspirin decision: for platelets ≥ 1,500 × 10⁹/L I should screen for acquired von Willebrand syndrome with ristocetin cofactor activity and vWF antigen, avoid aspirin if AVWS is present, and consider prompt cytoreduction or even plateletpheresis if there is active bleeding or urgent surgery, while acknowledging that contemporary data question using a platelet threshold alone to drive bleeding‑risk decisions [^1176CPXE] [^1125Wcef].

> I will now examine perioperative care: for elective surgery with substantial bleeding risk it is reasonable to optimize the platelet count to < 400 × 10⁹/L when feasible, follow standard antiplatelet and anticoagulation management protocols, and deliver standard VTE prophylaxis tailored to procedural risk, balancing thrombosis and bleeding carefully [^1132K9ET] [^111jAZkU] [^113YM4KW].

> Let me consider pregnancy specifically: interferon‑alpha is the cytoreductive agent of choice due to lack of teratogenicity, hydroxyurea and anagrelide should be avoided, and low‑dose aspirin is generally acceptable unless bleeding risk is high, with individualized maternal–fetal risk assessment [^115F7e3q].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances: most thrombocytosis in children is reactive and infection related, so rigorous exclusion of secondary causes is essential and ET work‑up is reserved for persistent, unexplained cases with supportive molecular findings, recognizing that extreme thrombocytosis is often transient and thrombotic events tend to occur with additional risk factors such as central venous lines [^114uHrPC] [^112MuYup].

> Hold on, I should verify hyposplenism as an overlooked contributor: if splenic dysfunction or prior splenectomy is suspected, I need smear evidence such as Howell‑Jolly bodies or pitted erythrocytes to support the diagnosis, because hyposplenism can produce persistent mild to moderate thrombocytosis without requiring specific platelet‑directed therapy beyond standard asplenia care [^1166mbw3].

> Next, I should review follow‑up: after treating a reactive cause, I will recheck the CBC within 2–4 weeks to document improvement, and for ET I will monitor CBC every 3–6 months, reassess symptoms and spleen size annually, and reserve repeat marrow for suspected progression such as new anemia, leukocytosis, splenomegaly, or blasts, aligning with ELN recommendations to adjust therapy if there is progressive myeloproliferation or uncontrolled symptoms [^113YM4KW] [^111fXYLx] [^111AdWar].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: confirm true thrombocytosis and exclude spurious counts, identify and treat secondary causes with targeted labs, escalate to molecular testing and marrow when persistent or unexplained, apply WHO 2016 criteria to classify ET versus mimics, risk‑stratify with attention to age, thrombotic history, JAK2 status, and cardiovascular factors, manage reactive states by treating the cause and ET with aspirin and cytoreduction per risk, handle extreme counts, surgery, pregnancy, pediatrics, and hyposplenism thoughtfully, and schedule structured follow‑up with clear triggers for therapy modification, which aligns with WHO, ELN, BSH, and ESMO guidance while acknowledging evolving evidence on platelet thresholds [^113xeTPA] [^111fXYLx] [^113YM4KW] [^115F7e3q] [^1163Hv7N].

Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count > 450×10⁹/L and classified as **primary (clonal)**, **secondary (reactive)**, or **hereditary** [^113xeTPA]. The evaluation begins by **confirming the elevated count**, excluding spurious causes, and **identifying reactive triggers** (infection, inflammation, iron deficiency [^116dgroe], malignancy, or asplenia [^114jAcbW]). If thrombocytosis persists without a reactive cause, **test for JAK2, CALR, MPL, and BCR-ABL1 mutations** [^111gvjfr] [^113xeTPA] and **perform a bone marrow biopsy** [^111fXYLx] to distinguish ET from other MPNs. Management targets the **underlying cause**: treat reactive causes, use cytoreduction (hydroxyurea, interferon, or anagrelide) for high-risk ET [^115hzTXE], and monitor low-risk ET [^115F7e3q]. Thrombotic risk is higher in primary thrombocytosis [^1131VoXA] and increases in reactive thrombocytosis when additional risk factors are present [^116dgroe]; bleeding risk rises with extreme counts due to acquired von Willebrand syndrome [^1176CPXE].

---

## Classification of thrombocytosis

Thrombocytosis is classified into **three main categories**:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary (clonal) | Clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes due to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) [^117FrQx7] | - Essential thrombocythemia (ET)- Polycythemia vera (PV)- Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)- Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [^113xeTPA] [^1131VoXA] |
| Secondary (reactive) | Response to underlying conditions or external stimuli | - Infections- Inflammation- Iron deficiency anemia- Malignancy- Asplenia [^114jAcbW] [^111TrMCf] [^116dgroe] |
| Hereditary | Genetic mutations causing increased platelet production | - THPO mutations- MPL mutations- JAK2 mutations [^1141UaUZ] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Confirm elevated platelet count**: Repeat CBC to exclude spurious thrombocytosis (e.g. platelet clumping).
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assess platelet morphology and exclude pseudothrombocytosis [^116VewyB].
- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP, ESR to identify reactive causes.
- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation to assess iron deficiency [^116dgroe].
- **Liver and renal function tests**: Evaluate organ dysfunction.
- **Autoimmune screening**: ANA, rheumatoid factor if autoimmune disease suspected.

---

### Molecular and genetic testing

- **JAK2 V617F mutation**: Present in ~55% of ET cases [^1131VoXA].
- **CALR and MPL mutations**: Present in ~25% and ~3% of ET cases, respectively [^1147Xx49].
- **BCR-ABL1 fusion gene**: To exclude CML [^113xeTPA].
- **Next-generation sequencing (NGS)**: For triple-negative cases or suspected hereditary thrombocytosis [^115Q1D8C] [^1141UaUZ].

---

### Bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is **indicated** for persistent thrombocytosis without a reactive cause or when an MPN is suspected [^111fXYLx]. In ET, the bone marrow shows increased mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei and no significant fibrosis [^113xeTPA].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

### Thrombotic risk

Thrombotic risk is high in **primary thrombocytosis**, including arterial and venous events [^1131VoXA]. In secondary thrombocytosis, baseline risk is lower but rises with additional factors such as iron deficiency or inflammation [^116dgroe].

---

### Bleeding risk

Bleeding risk rises with **extreme thrombocytosis**; platelet counts > 1,000×10⁹/L can cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome with bleeding complications, reflecting the hemostatic impact of this disorder at very high platelet counts [^1176CPXE].

---

### Prognostic implications

Prognostic implications differ by **etiology**. Primary thrombocytosis carries a risk of progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia, whereas outcomes in secondary thrombocytosis depend on the underlying condition [^1131VoXA].

---

## Management strategies

### Primary thrombocytosis (ET)

- **Risk stratification**: Based on age, thrombotic history, and cardiovascular risk factors [^115hzTXE] [^112pWUCB].
- **Low-risk patients**: Aspirin therapy if no contraindications [^111LPFSa] [^1131VoXA].
- **High-risk patients**: Cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, anagrelide) [^115hzTXE] [^115F7e3q].

---

### Secondary thrombocytosis

Management centers on treating the **underlying cause** — such as infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, or malignancy. Antiplatelet therapy may be considered when additional thrombotic risk factors are present.

---

### Hereditary thrombocytosis

Hereditary thrombocytosis warrants **genetic counseling** and family screening. Management is individualized based on thrombotic risk and clinical presentation [^1141UaUZ] [^115oeen5].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up and monitoring include **regular platelet counts** to track therapeutic response and disease progression. Ongoing clinical assessment should evaluate thrombotic and bleeding complications, with therapy adjusted according to platelet counts and clinical status [^1131VoXA].

---

Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count > 450×10⁹/L and is classified as primary, secondary, or hereditary [^113xeTPA]. Evaluation entails confirming the count, excluding spurious causes, and identifying reactive triggers. Persistent thrombocytosis without a reactive cause warrants molecular testing and bone marrow biopsy [^111fXYLx]. Management targets the **underlying cause**, with cytoreduction for high-risk ET and monitoring for complications [^115hzTXE].

## References

### Isolated congenital asplenia: An overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^114jAcbW]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a frequent cause for referral to a hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological perspective, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on true hematological diseases), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious. As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, common clinical practice widely accepts searching first for causes of secondary thrombocytosis.

Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on present and past illnesses and recent surgical interventions (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). Furthermore, a comprehensive and updated list of medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted, as thrombocytosis can be caused by the administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin-mimicking drugs.

### The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^113xeTPA]. Blood (2016). High credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for essential thrombocythemia is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with this specific myeloproliferative disorder. The primary utility of the criteria lies in its ability to differentiate essential thrombocythemia from other similar conditions, thereby guiding appropriate treatment strategies.

The criteria consist of four major components and one minor component. The major components include a platelet count of 450×10⁹/L or higher, a bone marrow biopsy showing proliferation mainly of the megakaryocyte lineage with increased numbers of enlarged, mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei, the absence of WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), myelodysplastic syndromes, or other myeloid neoplasms, and the presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. The minor component is the presence of a clonal marker or absence of evidence for reactive thrombocytosis.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all four major components are present or if the first three major components and the minor component are present. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia are not fulfilled according to the WHO guidelines.

The assessment tool evaluates if the diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) are fulfilled based on the World Health Organization's criteria. The input consists of selecting from prescribed options.

### Essential thrombocythemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^1131VoXA]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal thrombocytosis. The clinical course is often indolent but might be interrupted by thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, microcirculatory symptoms (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, and acral paresthesias), and, less frequently, by disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia.

- **Diagnosis**: In addition to thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L), formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, including prefibrotic MF, polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow morphology typically shows an increased number of mature-appearing megakaryocytes distributed in loose clusters.

- **Genetics**: Approximately 80% of patients express myeloproliferative neoplasm driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL) in a mutually exclusive manner. Additionally, about 50% harbor other mutations, with the most frequent being TET2 (9%-11%), ASXL1 (7%-20%), DNMT3A (7%), and SF3B1 (5%). Abnormal karyotype is commonly seen in younger patients. The triple A survival risk model, based on age, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count, effectively delineates high-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and low-risk disease with corresponding median survivals of 8, 14, and 21 years.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically concerning bone marrow biopsy, the 2018 ELN guidelines recommend performing a bone marrow biopsy in all patients with suspected Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. An exception is made for patients with polycythemia vera, where male patients have hemoglobin levels greater than 18.5 g/dL, and female patients have levels greater than 16.5 g/dL.

### Iron deficiency generates secondary thrombocytosis and platelet activation in IBD: The randomized, controlled thromboVIT trial [^111TrMCf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary thrombocytosis is a common clinical feature. In patients with cancer, it is a risk factor for venous thromboembolic events. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), thrombocytosis is considered a marker of active disease and may contribute to the increased thromboembolic risk in this population. Observed effects of iron therapy on the normalization of platelet counts led us to hypothesize that iron itself may regulate megakaryopoiesis. Here, we aim to test the effect of iron replacement on platelet count and activity in IBD-associated thrombocytosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD and secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L). Changes in platelet counts, hemoglobin, iron parameters, disease activity, megakaryopoietic growth factors, erythropoietin, and platelet activity were assessed. Patients received placebo or up to 1500 mg iron as FCM. Endpoints were evaluated at week six.

- **Results**: A total of 26 patients were included in the study, with 15 patients available for per protocol analysis. A drop in platelets > 25% (primary endpoint) was observed in 4 of 8 patients (50%, iron group) and 1 of 7 patients (14%, placebo group; P = 0.143). Mean platelet counts dropped on FCM but not on placebo (536 G/L to 411 G/L versus 580 G/L to 559 G/L; P = 0.002). Disease activity and megakaryopoietic growth factors remained unchanged, while hemoglobin and iron parameters increased on FCM. The normalization of platelet counts was associated with a decrease in…

### Essential thrombocythemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^1176CPXE]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Risk-adapted therapy: "high-risk" disease

Decades ago, "high-risk" disease in essential thrombocythemia (ET) was defined by the presence of one of three clinical parameters: history of thrombosis, advanced age, and long duration of thrombocytosis. In a randomized study using hydroxyurea for high-risk disease, patients with a platelet count greater than 1500 × 10⁹/L were excluded because it was believed that such patients required treatment due to increased bleeding diathesis. Over the years, it has become evident that extreme thrombocytosis in ET did not, by itself, increase thrombosis risk and might actually be associated with a reduced risk of arterial thrombosis. The bleeding diathesis associated with extreme thrombocytosis has been linked to acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS), which might occur both in the presence and absence of extreme thrombocytosis, and is effectively screened and managed. Therefore, platelet count per se should no longer be used for risk stratification in ET.

Regardless, management of "traditionally high-risk" ET has been primarily guided by results of a randomized study of hydroxyurea versus no cytoreductive treatment in high-risk patients, with the goal of keeping the platelet count below 600 × 10⁹/L; the study showed a statistically significant benefit for hydroxyurea therapy (thrombosis rate of 3.6% vs 24%). Since then, unsuccessful attempts have been made to improve upon hydroxyurea treatment in ET. Accordingly, hydroxyurea, combined with once-daily aspirin therapy, remains the standard of care for contemporarily classified "high-risk" patients.

### The rate of progression to polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia in patients with erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis [^1139KvGL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical relevance of mild erythrocytosis, defined as a hematocrit greater than 0.48 in women or greater than 0.51 in men, or thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count greater than 400 × 10⁹ cells/L, in asymptomatic individuals is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To estimate the frequency of polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia in individuals with erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis within a general population.

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: Vicenza, Italy.

- **Participants**: The study involved 10,000 community residents aged 18 to 65 years, who were enrolled in the Vicenza Thrombophilia and Atherosclerosis project.

- **Measurements**: Baseline and follow-up platelet counts and hematocrits were measured for all participants. Those with abnormal baseline results underwent further testing, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, peripheral arterial saturation, serum erythropoietin level, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and occult fecal blood testing. Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia diagnoses were based on the Polycythemia Study Group criteria.

- **Results**: At the baseline examination, 1 person was found to have polycythemia vera, 1 had essential thrombocythemia, 88 had erythrocytosis, and 99 had thrombocytosis. A second examination confirmed erythrocytosis in 40% (95% CI, 29% to 51%) and thrombocytosis in 8% (CI, 4% to 15%) of those with abnormal baseline results. Further evaluation of individuals with confirmed abnormalities revealed 11 with idiopathic erythrocytosis, 2 with polycythemia vera (3/10,000 [CI, 0.6 to 8.7/10,000]), and 3 with essential thrombocythemia.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^116mzBB3]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system has recently strengthened the diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) by lowering the threshold platelet count. This underscores its morphological distinction from early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis (MF) and incorporates molecular markers of clonality. The International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) examined the clinical relevance of this process in 1,104 cases of locally diagnosed 'ET' and showed worse overall, leukemia-free, and fibrosis-free survival, along with a higher risk of bleeding in early/prefibrotic MF (n = 180) compared to WHO-defined ET (n = 891). The risk of thrombosis was similar between the two entities and, in WHO-defined ET, was predicted by thrombosis history, older age, cardiovascular risk factors, and JAK2 V617F.

A prognostic model based on these risk factors identified patient groups in ET with residual risk of thrombosis, despite treatment with conventional therapy. The main objectives of the Perspective are to underscore the prognostic importance of morphological confirmation in the diagnosis of ET and provide management recommendations, in both WHO-defined ET and early/prefibrotic MF, based on observations from the aforementioned IWG-MRT and other studies. In so doing, we are fully cognizant and sympathetic of the fact that some of our recommendations need to be tested in prospective controlled studies.

### Outcomes of patients with preoperative thrombocytosis after hip fracture surgery [^112f6sq6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

As the population ages and the incidence of hip fractures increases, it is prudent to understand preoperative markers that predispose patients to adverse postoperative events. The incidence of thrombocytosis in this surgical hip fracture population was 1.2%, which is within the 0.4 to 1.7% range of rates in arthroplasty patients. This study found that preoperative thrombocytosis was associated with increased rates of 30-day mortality, unplanned revision surgery, readmission, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and infections after hip fracture surgery.

While the etiology of thrombocytosis was unknown, reactive thrombocytosis is the leading cause of thrombocytosis in the general medical population and usually occurs as a result of an acute phase response to infection or tissue damage. Prior studies found that infected patients may present with thrombocytosis even in the absence of other more obvious signs of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count or fever. In agreement with the literature in other patient populations, our findings suggest that thrombocytosis may be a clinical indicator of postoperative infection risk in hip fracture patients. After excluding all patients with preoperative infections and controlling for patient characteristics and comorbidities, including white blood cell count, preoperative thrombocytosis was associated with increased odds of having any postoperative infection (OR 1.42 [95% CI 1.13 to 1.79], P = 0.003).

### Guideline for investigation and management of adults and children presenting with a thrombocytosis [^113YM4KW]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for essential thrombocythemia, particularly concerning patients undergoing surgery, BSH 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining an individual risk assessment (including disease-specific, patient-specific, and procedure-specific risks) for VTE in patients undergoing surgery. The guidelines also suggest offering appropriate graded elastic compression stockings and pharmacotherapy.

### Characterization of the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency anemia [^116dgroe]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). High credibility.

The association of thrombocytosis with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is well-recognized, but data describing the rate, predictors, and risk of thrombotic complications associated with IDA-related thrombocytosis are limited. We queried an institutional patient data repository containing comprehensive chart data for over 6 million patients to identify IDA patients with and without thrombocytosis and thrombotic events over a 40-year period (1979 to 2019). Demographics, hematological parameters, thrombosis history, and other medical history were collected.

Fidelity of query data was assessed via detailed manual chart review of 700 patients, including confirmation of ferritin and hematologic parameters in addition to the temporal and clinical association of thrombocytosis. Our queries identified 36,327 cases of IDA, of which 15,022 had thrombocytosis. Following assessment for data integrity, we observed a thrombocytosis rate of 32.6% in patients with IDA. The rate of thrombosis was calculated to be 7.8% in patients with IDA and 15.8% in patients with both IDA and thrombocytosis.

- **Platelet mass index**: At the time of peak thrombocytosis, it was significantly higher than at baseline and was strongly negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels. A multivariable model demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between decreasing hemoglobin and increasing platelet count at peak thrombocytosis.

In conclusion, we observed reactive thrombocytosis in one-third of IDA patients, and a 2-fold thrombosis risk in patients with both IDA and thrombocytosis compared to patients with IDA alone.

### Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^1163Hv7N]. Annals of Oncology (2015). High credibility.

The ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend reducing the dose of hydroxyurea by adjusting therapeutic targets, such as raising the platelet count target to 600×10⁹/L, or switching therapy, usually to interferon or anagrelide, in patients with resistance or modest intolerance to hydroxyurea. It is advisable to consider administering busulfan, preferably in older patients. Additionally, it is important to recognize that when hydroxyurea is used with, or succeeded by, other agents, including busulfan, it significantly increases the long-term risk of leukemia.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^116zsuqa]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

The main objectives of this perspective are to underscore the prognostic relevance of distinguishing WHO-defined essential thrombocythemia (ET) from early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis (MF) and to increase awareness regarding the relatively high risk of residual thrombosis in certain groups of patients with WHO-defined ET. We believe that these issues constitute actionable challenges and need to be ultimately evaluated in prospective controlled studies. Our recommendations outlined in Figure 1 are neither binding nor absolute; they are simply there to assist those who seek our opinion.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^112BCHrC]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true essential thrombocythemia (ET) in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. One must carefully examine the complete blood count, as anemia or leukocytosis suggests early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis (MF); peripheral blood smear, where increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF; serum lactate dehydrogenase, where increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF; and JAK2 V617F allele burden, since the diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of more than 25% allele burden.

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF due to the increased baseline risk of bleeding. We generally recommend avoiding prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially if there is a history of bleeding. This differs from our treatment approach in World Health Organization (WHO)-defined ET, where we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy unless clear contraindications exist, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^11318giR]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

- **Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis**: Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis in a recent large clinical database study of over six million patients, supported by extensive chart review to exclude alternative confounding causes of thrombocytosis and confirm thrombotic events.

The development of a high-quality animal model supporting the longstanding observation that iron deficiency-mediated thrombocytosis leads to a significantly higher risk of thrombosis is an important advance. Without stratifying for iron deficiency or its successful abatement by intravenous iron, there was a marked increase in thromboses among erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-treated patients with cancer, chemotherapy-induced anemia, and anemia associated with both non-dialysis and dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This led to the near proscription of a treatment that demonstrably improves energy, activity, and quality of life in those with debilitating chronic illness. Despite numerous prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies failing to show harm from using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, especially in cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia, extreme caution remains prevalent.

A growing body of inferential evidence now supports intravenous iron as the preferred route of administration in most of the described conditions. This new animal model suggests that intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the risk of thrombosis.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk-stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### The impact of pretreatment thrombocytosis and persistent thrombocytosis after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer [^111Do6cs]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the impact of both pretreatment thrombocytosis and platelet count reduction post-adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, a retrospective review was conducted.

Records of 179 women who underwent cytoreductive surgery for FIGO stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer and received six cycles of platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy between July 1998 and March 2009 were analyzed. The platelet ratio was defined as the preoperative platelet count divided by the platelet count after chemotherapy. The prognostic significance of thrombocytosis and platelet ratio, along with various clinicopathological factors, was evaluated using multivariate analysis.

Sixty-two of 179 patients (34.6%) had thrombocytosis at primary diagnosis. Patients with preoperative thrombocytosis exhibited greater elevations of CA-125 (p < 0.0001) and a greater volume of ascites (p = 0.007). On multivariate analysis, thrombocytosis and CA-125 elevation remained significant indicators of poor prognosis in patients with stage III or IV disease. In patients with normal CA-125 after chemotherapy, a high platelet ratio was an independent risk factor for reduced survival (p = 0.05).

Preoperative thrombocytosis and a high platelet ratio appear to be poor prognostic factors of survival in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who were treated with cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.

### Outcomes of patients with preoperative thrombocytosis after hip fracture surgery [^117V5Cy9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis in the critically ill or in the setting of tissue damage after injury has been reported to put patients at increased risk of thromboembolic events. Similarly, hip fracture patients with preoperative thrombocytosis in this study had increased odds of VTE compared with patients with normal platelet counts (OR 1.88 [95% CI 1.31 to 2.71], P < 0.05).

Taking these findings together, it seems likely that both thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis have negative postoperative consequences, with the former being predisposed to bleeding events and the latter to VTE events and infection. In addition, because previous studies have grouped normal platelet counts with thrombocytosis, it is possible that the effect of low preoperative platelet counts on early mortality may be even more pronounced. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine adverse postoperative events associated with elevated preoperative platelet counts in orthopaedic trauma surgery. Based on these findings, we encourage physicians to be cognizant of the risks associated with these conditions.

### Essential thrombocythemia: Challenges in clinical practice and future prospects [^115GFHZe]. Blood (2023). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) was first described in 1934, and subsequently, progress has been made in better understanding the molecular pathogenesis and which patients may have the greatest risk of progression or vascular events. However, it has been more than a decade since a new therapy has been approved for ET. We are beginning to understand more comprehensively both the heterogeneity of this disease, which is largely driven by driver mutation status, as well as the effect of disease-related symptoms, such as fatigue, on patients. In this review, we provide a practical overview of diagnosis and management of ET with a focus on challenging patient scenarios and some consideration of what comprehensive care might entail. Finally, we also discuss newer therapies and how these might be assessed.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with an elevated blood count who do not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis should be considered as possible explanations. Young patients and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should particularly raise this possibility.

Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in genes within the oxygen-sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been associated with mutations in the THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. For individuals with suspected hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific steps to rule out more common acquired clonal disorders and, if necessary, other secondary causes. This may involve the measurement of specific cytokines and searching for particular molecular lesions that contribute to these hereditary disorders.

Despite thorough investigation, there remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis: The secrets of tumor self-promotion [^113EJMdb]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis is associated with many solid tumors and often correlates with reduced survival. Recent studies suggest that a pathogenic feedback loop may be operative between platelets and tumor cells, with reciprocal interactions between tumor growth/metastasis and thrombocytosis/platelet activation. Specific molecular pathways have been identified in which tumors can stimulate platelet production and activation; activated platelets can, in turn, promote tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, these findings provide exciting new potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Patterns of thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia in hospitalized neonates [^112JoFbW]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to identify changes in platelet (PLT) counts over time and to evaluate the patterns of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis in hospitalized infants from 23.8 weeks to term gestation. Neonates were divided into four gestational age groups, and their PLT counts were retrospectively compared for prevalence of thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, and associated conditions. Postconceptional age, postnatal age, and sepsis, among other factors, affected PLT counts. When counts from noninfected appropriately grown infants were evaluated, the risks of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis were highest in the most preterm infants, and these risks changed with corrected gestational age. PLT counts increased weekly over the first four weeks of life for all but the most preterm infants.

These data characterize the incidence of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis across a wide range of gestational ages and show that, even in noninfected neonates, these conditions are common, and risk decreases with increasing maturity. The age-related changes in PLT patterns may reflect maturation of platelet regulation.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^116TddQZ]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

Further corroborating evidence pointing to iron-restricted erythropoiesis resulting in reactive thrombocytosis and thrombosis was derived from a recently published study describing the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Utilizing queries of an institutional database containing clinical information on more than six million patients over a 40-year time period (1979–2019), supported by extensive manual chart reviews, thrombocytosis was observed in 32.6% of patients with iron-deficiency anemia, in whom 15.8% developed thrombotic complications. In contrast, thromboses occurred in 7.8% of those with iron deficiency but without thrombocytosis.

The etiological explanation for why iron-restricted erythropoiesis increases hypercoagulability has remained somewhat obscure. In this issue of Haematologica, Jimenez and colleagues describe an animal model of iron deficiency using Sprague-Dawley rats, which could offer unique opportunities to explore multiple pathophysiological mechanisms for thrombocytosis and venous thrombogenesis. Furthermore, using sensitive histological and sophisticated high-frequency ultrasound techniques, the investigators were able to track the development and progression of thrombus formation. They were then able to correlate those changes with the generation of ex vivo biomarkers of platelet activation and indicators of global hemostasis. The potential use of this rat model could detect important targets that could be exploited therapeutically to mitigate the association of iron deficiency with hypercoagulability.

### Clinical significance of postoperative thrombocytosis after VATS lobectomy for NSCLC [^1139omGC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a clinical condition generally associated with a poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Thrombocytosis may be present after lung cancer resection, but its clinical significance remains unclear. This study evaluated whether postoperative thrombocytosis was a negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer.

- **Methods**: It was a retrospective monocentric study including consecutive patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer from January 2020 to January 2023. The outcome of patients with postoperative thrombocytosis (defined as a platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L at 24 hours after surgery and confirmed at postoperative day 7) was compared with a control group. Postoperative morbidity, mortality, and survival were compared between the two groups to determine if thrombocytosis negatively affected outcomes.

- **Results**: Our study population included 183 patients; of these, 22 (12%) presented with postoperative thrombocytosis: 9 (5%) had mild thrombocytosis (451–700 × 10⁹/L), 10 (5%) had moderate thrombocytosis (701–900 × 10⁹/L), and 3 (2%) had severe thrombocytosis (901–1000 × 10⁹/L). No significant differences were found regarding postoperative morbidity (p = 0.92), mortality (p = 0.53), overall survival (p = 0.45), and disease-free survival (p = 0.60) between the two study groups. Thrombocytosis was associated with a higher rate of atelectasis (36% vs. 6%, p < 0.001) and residual pleural effusion (31% vs. 8%, p = 0.0008). The thrombocytosis group was administered low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for 10 days.

### Thrombosis with erythropoietic stimulating agents-does iron-deficient erythropoiesis play a role [^117Npo84]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is common in iron deficiency and resolves following iron repletion. Increased platelet number, whether from iron deficiency or from other causes, may increase the risk of thrombovascular events. One mechanism thought to mediate iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis is increased erythropoietin production. Similarly, erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) have long been known to increase platelet number and frequently lead to functional or absolute iron deficiency. This state of relative or absolute iron deficiency may be the mechanism whereby ESA increase the platelet count. If correct, co-administration of iron should prevent or diminish ESA-driven thrombocytosis.

Data from the DRIVE trial in hemodialysis patients do, in fact, suggest that this is the case. Platelet counts in patients receiving IV iron decreased, while they remained unchanged in patients not given iron (mean change -29,000/microl vs. -0/microl; p = 0.017). Other supporting data have been observed in IV iron trials in oncology patients. The harm from higher hemoglobin targets and higher ESA doses may be mediated in part through induction of iron deficiency and thrombocytosis. The major anemia trials of ESAs have not reported platelet data, but should examine the relationship of platelet count, iron deficiency, IV iron administration, and cardiovascular events in greater detail.

### Histological and genetic characterization and follow-up of 130 patients with chronic triple-negative thrombocytosis [^115Q1D8C]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

In order to assess whether NGS data could better discriminate thrombocytosis patients with a higher risk of complications, we reclassified patients with an acquired pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the "MPN" group, irrespective of their histology. Similarly, patients with germline variants in JAK2 or MPL were reclassified as having constitutional thrombocythemia. Overall, by applying these criteria in the "non-MPN" group, NGS was not informative for 39 patients, allowed confirmation of non-MPN in four (constitutional thrombocythemia), and prompted reclassification into the "MPN" group in nine patients. In the MPN group, NGS was not informative for 44 patients, allowed confirmation (acquired pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) in 17, and prompted reclassification into constitutional thrombocythemia in eight patients. For the 11 patients for whom bone marrow biopsy was not able to provide a classification, NGS did not give additional information in nine, but detected an acquired mutation in two patients: DNMT3A D835M (variant allele frequency, 2%) and CBL L380P (variant allele frequency, 3%), allowing a reclassification to MPN.

It is worth noting that mutations with such a low allele burden could be considered as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and the clinical interpretation of these cases remains challenging.

In order to determine whether the NGS-based or histology-based classifications allow for a better prognostic discrimination, clinical characteristics and evolution were assessed in the groups defined by histological findings or NGS findings.

### How I treat essential thrombocythemia [^111LPFSa]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an indolent myeloproliferative neoplasm that may be complicated by vascular events, including both thrombosis and bleeding. This disorder may also transform into more aggressive myeloid neoplasms, particularly into myelofibrosis. The identification of somatic mutations of JAK2, CALR, or MPL, found in about 90% of patients, has considerably improved the diagnostic approach to this disorder. Genomic profiling also holds the potential to improve prognostication and, more generally, clinical decision-making because the different driver mutations are associated with distinct clinical features.

Prevention of vascular events has been, so far, the main objective of therapy and continues to be extremely important in the management of patients with ET. Low-dose aspirin and cytoreductive drugs can be administered for this purpose, with cytoreductive treatment being primarily given to patients at high risk of vascular complications. Currently used cytoreductive drugs include hydroxyurea, mainly used in older patients, and interferon α, primarily given to younger patients. There is a need for disease-modifying drugs that can eradicate clonal hematopoiesis and/or prevent progression to more aggressive myeloid neoplasms, especially in younger patients. In this article, we use a case-based discussion format to illustrate our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of ET.

### Clinical significance of postoperative thrombocytosis after VATS lobectomy for NSCLC [^113AYmmi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

### Risk of bleeding in patients with essential thrombocythemia and extreme thrombocytosis [^114dnMw4]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

The risk of bleeding in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and extreme thrombocytosis (ExT) is unclear. Consequently, there are no treatment guidelines regarding the management of bleeding risk in these patients. Important considerations include:

- **When to start cytoreduction**: The appropriate timing for initiating cytoreductive therapy is not well-defined, complicating treatment decisions for patients at risk.
- **When to stop aspirin**: Guidelines for discontinuing aspirin to minimize bleeding risk are currently lacking.
- **How to incorporate AVWS testing**: The role of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) testing in managing these patients requires clarification.

Risk factors associated with bleeding in ExT patients are also unknown. This uncertainty complicates treatment strategies and makes it difficult to identify subpopulations of ExT patients who might benefit from cytoreductive therapy.

Thus, our primary aim was to characterize the risk of bleeding in patients with ET and ExT. We further sought to analyze risk factors that contribute to bleeding, and to investigate thrombosis, progression, and survival outcomes in this patient population.

### Thrombocytosis: Perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^1137Z7TF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is an uncommon yet important laboratory abnormality with significant considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The etiology of thrombocytosis can be categorized by those related to reactive processes; acquired platelet disorders (i.e. myeloproliferative neoplasms, hematologic malignancies); or inherited platelet disorders (i.e. hereditary thrombocythemia). A foundational understanding of the normal physiologic function of platelets and the abnormalities associated with each of these disorders is critical when considering implications and optimization to prevent perioperative complications.

This review systematically outlines the platelet disorders that cause thrombocytosis, with an emphasis on how the disorder affects normal physiologic processes. It summarizes the literature related to the disorder and describes the implications and recommendations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Thrombocytosis and thrombosis [^114YVDNR]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to discuss diagnostic approaches to, and classification of, patients presenting with thrombocytosis in light of novel information derived from the discovery of specific molecular abnormalities in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), which represent the most common cause of primary thrombocytosis. The JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L/K mutations have been found in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, and less frequently in other myeloproliferative disorders complicated by thrombocytosis. However, neither mutation is disease-specific nor universally present in patients with elevated platelet counts due to a CMPD; therefore, distinguishing between reactive and primary forms of thrombocytosis, as well as among the different clinical entities that constitute the CMPD, still requires a multifaceted diagnostic approach that includes, as a key step, the accurate evaluation of bone marrow histology.

The role of elevated platelet counts in thrombosis, which represent the predominant complication of CMPD, significantly affects prognosis and quality of life, and paradoxically, plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic manifestations. Established and novel potential risk factors for thrombosis, including the clinical relevance of the JAK2V617F mutation, and management strategies for thrombocytosis are also briefly discussed.

### How we diagnose and treat essential thrombocythaemia [^115xfPuR]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The approach to the diagnosis and management of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is steadily changing, influenced by advances in molecular biology, data from clinical trials, and retrospective analyses of patient cohorts. In the past decade, options for clinical management have largely remained unchanged, but there is an evolution in whom we treat and with what target in mind.

A further area of change is the recognition of symptoms that may be associated with ET, as well as other myeloproliferative neoplasms. Potential options for their management are becoming available. Judicious and careful diagnosis is increasingly fundamental to successful management, followed by cytoreductive therapy in a subset of patients. In this review, we demonstrate our management strategies for ET using a case-based format.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2015 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification and management [^1147Xx49]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms, characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other features of these diseases include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risks of leukemic or fibrotic transformation.

- **Diagnosis**: PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation. The absence of this mutation, combined with a normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. Differential diagnosis in ET includes reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations occur in approximately 55%, 25%, and 3% of ET patients, respectively. These molecular markers are also present in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, which must be morphologically distinguished from ET.

- **Survival and leukemic/fibrotic transformation**: Median survival is approximately 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET, with corresponding values for younger patients being 24 and 33 years. Life expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. JAK2/CALR mutational status does not affect survival in ET. Risk factors for survival in ET and PV include advanced age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rates at 20 years are estimated at < 10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic transformation rates are slightly higher.

- **Thrombosis risk stratification**: Risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of rethrombosis, with high risk defined by certain parameters.

### Significance of thrombocytosis for determining prognosis in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma [^113pUoHb]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate the significance of thrombocytosis for determining survival in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who underwent radical nephrectomy with curative intent, a study was conducted.

The study population comprised 151 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy with a diagnosis of localized RCC. The inclusion criteria included at least one preoperative platelet count and a tissue diagnosis of RCC. Thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count greater than 400,000/mm³. The patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed, and the relationship between preoperative platelet counts and survival was evaluated according to histologic variants.

- **Results**: The mean follow-up was 37.1 ± 24.1 months (median 34, range 3 to 91). Out of 151 patients, 21 had a preoperative platelet count greater than 400,000/mm³. The thrombocytosis rate was significantly greater in those with advanced T stage (P = 0.045). Lymph node positivity also correlated with thrombocytosis (P = 0.028). However, no statistically significant correlation was found between grade, histologic subtypes, and thrombocytosis (P = 0.053 and P = 0.354, respectively). Ten (47.6%) of 21 patients with thrombocytosis and 21 (16.2%) of the remaining 130 patients died of disease progression (P = 0.002). The Kaplan-Meier cause-specific survival curves showed that patients with thrombocytosis had a mean survival of 45.2 months compared to 76.6 months in patients without thrombocytosis (P = 0.0002).

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative thrombocytosis is a significant predictor for determining prognosis in patients with localized RCC.

### New advances in the pathogenesis and therapy of essential thrombocythemia [^112P3XKV]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a hematopoietic disorder that manifests clinically as thrombocytosis, and patients with ET are at increased risk for developing thrombosis, myelofibrosis, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Although ET was recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome more than six decades ago and was classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) by William Dameshek in 1951, the molecular pathogenesis of ET remained unknown until 2005, when activating mutations in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) were identified in a significant proportion of patients with ET, polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In addition, subsequent studies have identified gain-of-function mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) in a subset of patients with JAK2V617F-negative ET, suggesting that JAK2 activation by distinct mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis of ET. Despite these important observations, significant questions remain regarding the role of JAK2/MPL mutations in ET pathogenesis, the etiology of JAK2/MPL negative ET, the factors that distinguish ET from other MPNs with the JAK2V617F mutation, and the role of JAK2-targeted therapies for the treatment of these MPNs.

### Reevaluating thrombocytosis as a risk factor in free flap surgery: Does timing matter [^114WErkU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 400,000, has been implicated as a risk factor in free flap failure. Despite proposed mechanisms of pedicle thrombosis, recent studies have suggested that thrombocytosis has no effect on free tissue transfer viability. Risk factors that may compromise successful free tissue transfer should be understood and elucidated, with particular attention to thrombocytosis and its conflicting evidence in the literature. We hypothesize that thrombocytosis has no bearing on free flap success or the rates of pedicle thrombosis.

- **Methods**: Our institution performed a retrospective chart review on all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction over the past 6 years. Patient demographics, medical history, type and location of free tissue transfer, preoperative platelets, postoperative platelets, and flap outcomes and complications (wound dehiscence, infection, hematoma, seroma, and need for blood transfusion) were recorded. Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U tests, χ2 test, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine P values to compare flap outcomes in patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400,000) and those with platelet counts less than 400,000.

- **Results**: In our 502-patient cohort, 71 were found to have a platelet count > 400,000 (35 preoperatively and 36 postoperatively) and 431 patients had platelet counts < 400,000. There were 42 reconstructive failures (flap success rate of 91.6%) and 111 returns to the operating room (OR). For patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 24 flaps returned to the OR (44.4%).

### Thrombocytosis in liver transplant recipients: Prevalence, natural history, and impact [^117VCmNC]. Liver Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence, natural history, and implications of reactive thrombocytosis after liver transplantation (LT) are unknown. Prospectively collected data from July 2000 to February 2006 were analyzed. Post-LT thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count of > 450 × 10³/μL lasting for more than 7 days and starting within 8 weeks of transplantation. In patients who survived more than 8 weeks, graft and patient outcomes were compared with liver transplant recipients who survived over 8 weeks and did not develop thrombocytosis.

Post-LT thrombocytosis was observed in 92 (14.7%) of 627 patients. The median onset was on day 13 (range, days 1–44), and the peak platelet count was seen on day 17 (range, days 3–110). The median duration of thrombocytosis was 25 days (range, 7–1,253 days), with a median peak platelet count of 625 x 10³/μL (range, 472–1,381 x 10³/μL).

- **Prevalence of seronegative fulminant hepatic failure**: This condition was the indication for transplantation in 18% of patients with post-LT thrombocytosis compared with 3% of controls (P < 0.001). There was a lower proportion of patients transplanted for hepatitis C-related cirrhosis in the thrombocytosis group (10% vs. 18%; P = 0.04).

- **Occurrence of hepatic arterial thrombosis**: The occurrence was similar in the two groups (5% vs. 4%; P = NS). None of the four patients with a platelet count higher than 1,000 × 10³/μL developed thrombotic complications.

Post-LT thrombocytosis is more often associated with seronegative fulminant hepatic failure, and there is a negative association with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. Post-LT thrombocytosis does not increase the risk of hepatic artery complications.

### Thrombocytosis after trauma: Incidence, aetiology, and clinical significance [^114JfLcy]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess the occurrence, aetiology, and clinical significance of a platelet count greater than 600 × 10³/mm³ in trauma patients.

- **Methods**: All trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during a 13-month period were prospectively studied. Platelet counts were performed daily. We recorded the patient's age, sex, nature of trauma, severity of illness scores, episodes of infections in the ICU, acute lung injury, bleeding, and thromboembolic events. Patients with thrombocytosis were also followed during their hospital stay and 1 month after hospital discharge.

- **Results**: A total of 176 patients were included. Thrombocytosis developed in 36 patients (20.4%) at a mean (SD) time of 14.0 (4.0) days, and the platelet count normalized 35.0 (13.0) days after admission to the ICU. All patients with thrombocytosis had one or more possible predisposing conditions before the occurrence of thrombocytosis: nosocomial infection occurred in 30 patients (83%), acute lung injury in 17 (47%), bleeding in 27 (75%), and administration of catecholamines in 24 (67%). Three venous thromboembolic complications occurred in the ICU (1.7%) and one during follow-up. Only one patient presented thrombocytosis at the time of diagnosis. Despite the fact that patients with thrombocytosis had a greater severity of illness, the ICU mortality was comparable among patients with and without thrombocytosis (8 vs. 14%, P = 0.34).

- **Conclusions**: Reactive thrombocytosis is a common finding after severe trauma and was found to be associated with a better survival than predicted.

### Evaluating the prognostic significance of preoperative thrombocytosis in epithelial ovarian cancer [^113h55Fm]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Preoperative thrombocytosis has been implicated as a negative prognostic marker for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We assessed whether thrombocytosis is an independent risk factor for EOC recurrence and death. Perioperative patient characteristics and process-of-care variables, defined by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), were retrospectively abstracted from 587 women who underwent EOC staging between January 2, 2003, and December 29, 2008. Thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methods. Associations were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards regression and hazard ratios (HR).

The incidence of preoperative thrombocytosis was 22.3%. DFS was 70.8% and 36.0% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. OS was 83.3% and 54.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Ascites, lower hemoglobin, advanced disease, and receipt of perioperative packed red blood cell transfusion were independently associated with thrombocytosis. Conversely, older age and the presence of coronary artery disease were associated with a lower likelihood of thrombocytosis. Overall, thrombocytosis was an independent predictor of increased risk of recurrence. Among early-stage (I/II) cases, there was a 5-fold increase in the risk of death and nearly 8-fold risk of disease recurrence independently associated with thrombocytosis.

Preoperative thrombocytosis portends worse DFS in EOC. In early-stage disease, thrombocytosis is a potent predictor of worse DFS and OS, warranting further assessment of the impact of circulating platelet levels.

### Pediatric extreme thrombocytosis: Etiology, management, and outcomes [^112MuYup]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT) is defined as a platelet count > 1000×10⁹/L. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric patients with EXT, focusing on thrombotic complications.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective study at a large tertiary center, examining cases of pediatric EXT identified from electronic medical records over a 5-year period. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were reviewed. Additionally, the underlying etiology was documented for each case, and follow-up information was analyzed, including platelet count trends and thrombotic events within three months post-EXT.

- **Results**: Among 204 patients with EXT, 98% were secondary thrombocytosis, predominantly attributed to infections and inflammatory conditions. EXT prevailed among infants (median age 1.3 years), with 67% aged 3 years or younger. Thrombotic events occurred in 10 cases (4.9%), primarily related to central venous lines or other risk factors rather than elevated platelet counts alone. Aspirin prophylaxis was uncommon, administered in 14% of patients, mainly in those with existing comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: Secondary EXT in pediatric patients is commonly associated with infections and persists for up to 2 months in many cases. While EXT alone may not significantly increase thrombotic risk, it may contribute to risk in patients with additional predisposing factors, such as central venous lines. Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify thrombotic risk in children with EXT.

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018 [^113Y9q7r]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed; (2) test methods need to be improved; or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

### Essential thrombocythemia: A review of diagnostic and pathologic features [^1164HjFn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) characterized predominantly by thrombocytosis and abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation. The diagnostic criteria require a combination of clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic data, with the diagnosis relying largely on the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytosis.

- **Objective**: The aim is to describe the historical, clinical, and laboratory features of ET in order to understand, clarify, and more accurately diagnose this entity.

- **Data sources**: The review encompasses contemporary and historical literature on ET and other causes of thrombocytosis.

- **Conclusions**: ET is a relatively indolent and often asymptomatic CMPD characterized primarily by a sustained elevation in platelets ≥ 600 × 10³/μL (≥ 600 × 10⁹/L), proliferating enlarged and hyperlobated megakaryocytes, and minimal to absent bone marrow fibrosis. Over the last 30 years, significant changes and revisions to the diagnostic requirements and criteria for ET have occurred. Recently, a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been identified in a significant number of cases of ET and other CMPDs. In up to 57% of ET cases, a mutation in the JAK2 gene can be detected. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation and features of another CMPD, the diagnosis of ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of thrombocytosis have been excluded.

### Genetic origins and clinical phenotype of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^114yaJm9]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis are characterized by myeloid lineage hyperproliferation, either single or multi-lineage in origin. The single lineage disorders exhibit Mendelian inheritance with polyclonal hematopoiesis and often arise from a single genetic defect. In contrast, the multi-lineage disorders exhibit complex patterns of inheritance with multi-genetic origins and clonal hematopoiesis. They have the potential to acquire JAK2 somatic mutations, but this is not the primary event. Identification of the disease-causing genes will enable better classification of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis and will provide insight into the mechanisms regulating myeloid cell proliferation.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for essential thrombocythemia, particularly in relation to the risk of thrombosis, the BSH 2010 guidelines recommend stratifying patients based on their risk of thrombotic complications as follows:

- **High risk**: Age > 60 years, or history of ET-related thrombotic or hemorrhagic event, or platelet count of > 1,500×10⁹/L
- **Intermediate risk**: Age 40–60 years with no high-risk features
- **Low risk**: Age < 40 years with no high-risk features

### Reactive thrombocytosis without endothelial damage does not affect the microvascular anastomotic patency [^115yU1SV]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

There is still controversy about the correlation between thrombocytosis and thrombosis complications. Using a rodent splenectomy-induced thrombocytosis model and a thrombogenic endothelial damage model (inverted suture resulting in an intraluminal thrombogenic adventitia of the divided femoral artery), the authors investigated whether reactive thrombocytosis, with or without endothelial damage, contributes to the patency of microvascular anastomosis.

Four experimental groups were evaluated in this study:

1. Sham operation without thrombogenic anastomosis after femoral artery division
2. Sham operation with thrombogenic anastomosis
3. Thrombocytosis alone without thrombogenic anastomosis
4. Thrombocytosis with thrombogenic anastomosis (each subgroup n = 10, total N = 40)

Vascular patency was assessed immediately post-operation and on the seventh day postoperatively. Platelet counts and platelet activation (CD62P) were studied in correlation to microvascular patency.

In rats without thrombogenic anastomosis, there were no significant differences in CD62P expression on platelets (p = 0.09), the patency rates (p = 0.561), or perfusion units (p = 0.746) before and after arterial reanastomosis between rats with and without thrombocytosis. However, the thrombogenic anastomosis of the femoral artery in thrombocytosis and control groups showed significantly increased CD62P expression (p < 0.05), decreased perfusion units (p < 0.05), and patency rate (p < 0.001), compared with rats without thrombogenic anastomosis of the femoral artery in both groups.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^111ZDgo5]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger. These concerns are fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but, more importantly, on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: What is the evidence for treatment [^1138BuPS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage.

The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial, and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking.

In this review, we discuss treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events, and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: An overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

After exclusion of all causes of reactive thrombocytosis, a new platelet count should be repeated to confirm the persistence of unexplained thrombocytosis. Thus, investigations to search for hematological disorders should be performed. Molecular markers for the most common myeloid neoplasms associated with thrombocytosis can be searched on peripheral blood: BCR-ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Subsequently, according to the clinical suspicion, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, together with cytogenetic and other molecular analysis (including a myeloid next-generation sequencing panel), should be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy is particularly useful to exclude triple-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Hyposplenism, defined as an abnormally low rate of activity of the spleen, is one of the most overlooked causes of thrombocytosis. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hyposplenism is suggested by typical morphological abnormalities of circulating red blood cells, including acanthocytes, spiculated spherocytes, stomatocytes, target cells, pitted erythrocytes, and Howell-Jolly bodies. Pitted red cells are erythrocytes whose membrane appears to contain the so-called "pits". It has been shown by electron microscopy that these "pits" are large vacuoles attached to or beneath the plasma membrane. Within these vacuoles, there is waste material (e.g. ferritin, hemoglobin, and residual material of mitochondria and membranes) that confers a low optical density.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to pediatric and adult hematology practices. The differential diagnosis covers a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases are acquired, especially in adult patients, but many can be inherited, and some may affect other organ systems. The first step — defining whether symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up — can be as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low?

Once the decision to pursue additional studies has been made, the increasing number of available laboratory tests can complicate the diagnostic process. In this article, we outline a general approach for evaluating patients suspected of having an inherited platelet disorder. Two clinical vignettes introduce our diagnostic approach to such disorders. We describe the rationale for the various clinically available tests, their limitations, and the challenges frequently encountered in interpreting results. Additionally, we aim to provide guidance on the expected phenotype concerning the severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia based on the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to offer practicing hematologists a practical framework applicable to their daily practice.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of familial thrombocythaemia [^115oeen5]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Familial thrombocytosis can be divided into two broad categories. The first includes inherited syndromes that affect only the megakaryocytic lineage, with Mendelian inheritance, high penetrance, and polyclonal haematopoiesis. The second category includes inherited predisposition to true Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and is characterized by low penetrance, clonal haematopoiesis, and the presence of somatic mutations, such as JAK2 V617F. It must be underlined that these two categories represent two well-separated entities, with different patterns of proliferation and different transmission modalities. This review will focus on the molecular pathogenesis of hereditary thrombocytosis, underlining those clinical pictures that are specifically associated with mutations in the genes of thrombopoietin or its receptor. Moreover, we propose an approach for the diagnosis and therapy of these syndromes.
