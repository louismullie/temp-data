## Question

Dopa uptake in parkinson

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dopamine uptake in Parkinson's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "dopa uptake" actually represents in vivo and which tracers measure it. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction in PD and how early it appears. Next, I will examine imaging patterns and asymmetry, followed by compensatory mechanisms that can mask or modify uptake. After that, I should review clinical implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response, including the levodopa paradox. Finally, I will consider confounders, limitations, and emerging biomarkers before synthesizing a cautious conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. "Dopa uptake" in this context generally refers to presynaptic dopaminergic integrity measured by radiotracers such as 18F-DOPA PET, which reflects aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) activity and dopamine synthesis/storage capacity, and by dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT/PET, which reflects DAT density and reuptake capacity. These are related but complementary measures of presynaptic function rather than direct dopamine levels per se [^c1134718] [^a6d1716c].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. In PD, degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to reduced striatal dopamine content and impaired release, with evidence that synaptic dysfunction and release deficits can precede frank neuronal loss, which helps explain why symptoms can emerge when a substantial fraction of terminals remain. This early synaptopathy is a key concept I should keep in mind as I interpret imaging data [^420d3361] [^d6770691].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I should verify how early imaging abnormalities appear. Multiple lines of evidence show reduced presynaptic dopaminergic function in asymptomatic carriers of PD mutations, in prodromal cohorts with hyposmia or RBD, and in some monozygotic twins discordant for PD, indicating that dopaminergic deficits can be detected years before motor onset, though the predictive value varies by population and tracer [^99425ab8] [^6406f47c].

> Next, I should review the imaging patterns. In early PD, DAT binding and 18F-DOPA uptake are typically reduced most in the posterior putamen, with relative sparing of the anterior putamen and caudate early on, and the deficit is usually asymmetric, contralateral to the more affected side. This asymmetric posterior-putaminal predominance is a consistent signature across cohorts and helps distinguish PD from many non-degenerative tremor disorders [^c1134718] [^80a29906] [^a6d1716c].

> Wait, let me verify compensatory mechanisms because they can confound interpretation. In early PD, surviving terminals can upregulate AADC activity and dopamine synthesis, partially offsetting terminal loss, which can make 18F-DOPA uptake appear relatively preserved compared with DAT binding. This helps explain why DAT ligands often show larger deficits than 18F-DOPA in early disease and why symptoms can be delayed despite ongoing degeneration [^c1134718] [^1a387af0].

> I should confirm the clinical implications for diagnosis. In clinically uncertain parkinsonism, abnormal DAT-SPECT or reduced 18F-DOPA uptake supports presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration and increases diagnostic confidence, whereas a normal scan argues against neurodegenerative parkinsonism. However, DAT imaging cannot reliably distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism, so results must be integrated with clinical features and, when needed, other modalities such as MRI or FDG-PET [^a6d1716c] [^4687f517] [^8e6257cc].

> But wait, what about prognosis and progression tracking. Lower baseline striatal DAT binding correlates with faster motor progression and higher risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and psychosis over time, and longitudinal declines in DAT signal, particularly in the less affected putamen, track with worsening motor scores. This supports a role for DAT imaging as a progression biomarker, albeit with modest effect sizes and methodological caveats [^2ca3968d] [^ca4c57c8] [^fa3626ef].

> I will now examine the levodopa paradox, because I need to ensure I don't overstate imaging as a progression measure. Clinically, levodopa improves motor scores, yet some imaging studies show greater declines in DAT binding with levodopa compared with placebo, likely reflecting pharmacologic effects on DAT expression or trafficking rather than accelerated neurodegeneration. This discordance underscores why imaging outcomes must be interpreted alongside clinical endpoints and why washout or stable-treatment designs are preferred when feasible [^bfcf9802] [^c852b81b].

> Let me consider confounders and limitations so I don't misapply the data. Medications can alter DAT imaging, with dopamine agonists and levodopa potentially downregulating DAT, and antidepressants or stimulants can interfere with interpretation. Age, gender, and scanner variability also affect binding, and SWEDD cases remind us that a minority of clinically suspected PD patients have normal DAT scans, necessitating longitudinal clinical follow-up and, when appropriate, alternative imaging or ancillary tests [^6ca059b0] [^1f46131f] [^d4a814d3].

> Next, I should review emerging biomarkers and modifiers. Exercise interventions have been associated with increased DAT availability and neuromelanin signals in the substantia nigra over 6 months, suggesting neuromodulatory effects, though causality and durability require larger randomized trials. Meanwhile, alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays and multimodal MRI are promising but not yet ready for routine diagnostic use, so they should complement rather than replace established imaging in current practice [^2ce94052] [^1132f08a] [^b1431aa6].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical takeaways. For clinicians, reduced dopa uptake or DAT binding in the posterior putamen, especially when asymmetric, supports presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration and helps exclude essential tremor or drug-induced parkinsonism, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when uncertain, repeated or paired with other modalities. For researchers, DAT and 18F-DOPA imaging remain valuable for stratification and monitoring, but designs should account for compensatory upregulation, medication effects, and the nonlinear trajectory of dopaminergic loss [^a6d1716c] [^4687f517] [^1a387af0].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. In PD, "dopa uptake" as measured by 18F-DOPA PET and DAT imaging reveals early, asymmetric presynaptic dysfunction in the posterior putamen that often precedes motor onset, with compensatory increases in dopamine synthesis partially masking terminal loss early on. These imaging findings inform diagnosis in uncertain cases, correlate with prognosis, and are useful for progression monitoring, but they must be interpreted alongside clinical assessments and potential confounders to avoid misattribution of pharmacologic effects to disease progression [^c1134718] [^420d3361] [^ca4c57c8].

Dopamine uptake is **reduced in Parkinson's disease** due to loss of dopamine transporter (DAT) sites on degenerating nigrostriatal terminals, causing impaired dopamine clearance and altered synaptic signaling [^544a6fed]. This deficit is **detectable early**, often before motor symptoms, and correlates with disease severity and progression [^c1134718] [^2ca3968d]. DAT imaging (DaTscan) is a validated tool to confirm presynaptic dopaminergic loss, aiding diagnosis and monitoring, but it cannot distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism [^a6d1716c] [^4687f517]. Compensatory upregulation of dopamine synthesis and release can partially offset uptake loss early on, masking symptoms until a critical threshold is reached [^c1134718] [^d6770691].

---

## Mechanisms of dopamine uptake impairment

- **Loss of dopamine transporter (DAT) sites**: Degeneration of nigrostriatal terminals reduces DAT density, impairing dopamine reuptake and prolonging synaptic dopamine residence [^544a6fed].

- **Compensatory mechanisms**: Surviving neurons upregulate dopamine synthesis and release, partially compensating for reduced uptake and delaying symptom onset [^c1134718] [^d6770691].

- **Synaptic dysfunction**: Early synaptic impairment, including reduced release probability and altered vesicular dynamics, contributes to impaired dopamine signaling even before significant neuronal loss [^420d3361] [^c0fa48ac].

---

## Clinical implications of impaired dopamine uptake

- **Motor symptoms**: Reduced uptake leads to prolonged synaptic dopamine and altered basal ganglia signaling, contributing to bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor [^d013e4fc].

- **Non-motor symptoms**: Impaired dopamine uptake also affects mood, cognition, and autonomic function, reflecting widespread dopaminergic involvement [^d013e4fc].

- **Disease progression**: The severity of dopamine uptake impairment correlates with clinical progression and disability, supporting its use as a biomarker [^2ca3968d] [^fa3626ef].

## Diagnostic tools for assessing dopamine uptake

| **Imaging modality** | **Tracer** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SPECT | [123I]FP-CIT (DaTscan) | - Confirms presynaptic dopaminergic loss <br/> - Differentiates PD from essential tremor and drug-induced parkinsonism [^a6d1716c] [^4687f517] | - Cannot distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism <br/> - False positives/negatives possible [^a8c89ff5] |
| PET | 18F-DOPA | - Assesses dopamine synthesis capacity <br/> - Detects early compensatory upregulation [^c1134718] | - Limited availability <br/> - Expensive |
| PET | DAT ligands (e.g. 18F-FE-PE2I) | - Quantifies DAT density <br/> - Sensitive to early changes [^6d7ad431] | - Limited availability <br/> - Radiation exposure |

---

## Therapeutic strategies targeting dopamine uptake

- **Levodopa therapy**: Replenishes dopamine and improves symptoms but does not restore DAT function or halt progression [^bfcf9802].

- **Dopamine agonists**: Mimic dopamine and reduce motor fluctuations but may not directly modulate uptake [^f5967774].

- **Exercise**: Emerging evidence suggests exercise may upregulate DAT and improve dopaminergic function, though mechanisms remain under study [^2ce94052] [^22dad242].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Variability**: Individual differences in DAT expression, compensatory mechanisms, and comorbidities complicate interpretation [^2aa23a74].

- **Medication effects**: Dopaminergic drugs can alter DAT imaging results, requiring careful washout and interpretation [^6ca059b0].

- **Progression tracking**: Nonlinear decline and compensatory changes limit the utility of uptake measures for longitudinal monitoring [^1a387af0] [^efa560fe].

---

Impaired dopamine uptake is a **core feature of PD**, reflecting nigrostriatal terminal loss and contributing to motor and non-motor symptoms. DAT imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool, but compensatory mechanisms and individual variability limit its use for progression tracking. Therapies that restore uptake or enhance compensatory mechanisms are promising but require further research.

### Dynamic control of the dopamine transporter in neurotransmission and homeostasis [^fba44276]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

The dopamine transporter (DAT) transports extracellular dopamine into the intracellular space contributing to the regulation of dopamine neurotransmission. A reduction of DAT density is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) by neuroimaging; dopamine turnover is dopamine turnover is elevated in early symptomatic PD and in presymptomatic individuals with monogenic mutations causal for parkinsonism. As an integral plasma membrane protein, DAT surface expression is dynamically regulated through endocytic trafficking, enabling flexible control of dopamine signaling in time and space, which in turn critically modulates movement, motivation and learning behavior. Yet the cellular machinery and functional implications of DAT trafficking remain enigmatic. In this review we summarize mechanisms governing DAT trafficking under normal physiological conditions and discuss how PD-linked mutations may disturb DAT homeostasis. We highlight the complexity of DAT trafficking and reveal DAT dysregulation as a common theme in genetic models of parkinsonism.

### Role of dopamine transporter imaging in investigation of parkinsonian syndromes in routine clinical practice [^06fd337e]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

We discuss the potential role of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a biological marker for differentiating among parkinsonian disorders in routine clinical practice, and the implication for disease progression assessment is considered. Although clinical criteria enable accurate and reliable diagnosis of fully developed Parkinson's disease, there are several areas of diagnostic uncertainty relating to atypical parkinsonian disorders, isolated tremor symptoms not fulfilling essential tremor criteria, as well as drug-induced and psychogenetic parkinsonism. DAT-SPECT facilitates differential diagnosis of the different parkinsonian syndromes that cannot be reliably separated on clinical grounds and it can thus provide valuable diagnostic information in early disease.

### Role of dopamine transporter imaging in routine clinical practice [^4bacf8a9]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Functional imaging of the dopamine transporter (DAT) defines integrity of the dopaminergic system and has its main clinical application in patients with mild, incomplete, or uncertain parkinsonism. Imaging with specific single positron emission computerised tomography ligands for DAT (FP-CIT, beta-CIT, IPT, TRODAT) provides a marker for presynaptic neuronal degeneration. Striatal uptake correlates with disease severity, in particular bradykinesia and rigidity, and monitoring of progression assists in clinical trials of potential neuroprotective drugs. DAT imaging is abnormal in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy and does not distinguish between these disorders. Dopamine loss is seen even in the earliest clinical presentations of true parkinsonism; a normal scan suggests an alternative diagnosis such as essential tremor, vascular parkinsonism (unless there is focal basal ganglia infarction), drug-induced parkinsonism, or psychogenic parkinsonism. Congruence between working clinical diagnosis and DAT imaging increases over time in favour of baseline DAT imaging results. Additional applications are characterising dementia with parkinsonian features (abnormal results in dementia with Lewy bodies, normal in Alzheimer's disease); and differentiating juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (abnormal DAT) from dopa-responsive dystonia (normal DAT).

### Neuroimaging methods applied in Parkinson's disease [^18cc7111]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Radiotracer methods provide regional in vivo quantified information about specific biochemical activities in brain tissue. The understanding of the principles governing radiotracer uptake into brain tissue determines the potential value of these tracers in assessing pathophysiology of brain diseases. Too often a reductionist view of images is taken to directly point to clinical features or even diagnoses of brain diseases. Parkinson's disease like many other neurodegenerative brain diseases is a multisystem disorder of considerable biological and clinical complexity while the information given by regional cerebral tracer uptake points to a momentary biochemical local tissue feature. Examples applying to the well-known dopaminergic tracers are given.

### Role of DAT-SPECT in the diagnostic work up of parkinsonism [^e99d73b2]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) can be achieved with high degrees of accuracy in cases with full expression of classical clinical features. However, diagnostic uncertainty remains in early disease with subtle or ambiguous signs. Functional imaging has been suggested to increase the diagnostic yield in parkinsonian syndromes with uncertain clinical classification. Loss of striatal dopamine nerve terminal function, a hallmark of neurodegenerative parkinsonism, is strongly related to decreases of dopamine transporter (DAT) density, which can be measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The use of DAT-SPECT facilitates the differential diagnosis in patients with isolated tremor symptoms not fulfilling PD or essential tremor criteria, drug-induced, psychogenic and vascular parkinsonism as well as dementia when associated with parkinsonism. This review addresses the value of DAT-SPECT in early differential diagnosis, and its potential as a screening tool for subjects at risk of developing PD as well as issues around the assessment of disease progression.

### The role of functional dopamine-transporter SPECT imaging in parkinsonian syndromes, part 2 [^c4162445]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

The functional imaging technique most widely used in European clinics to differentiate a true parkinsonian syndrome from vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced changes, or essential tremor is dopamine-transporter SPECT. This technique commonly reports dopamine-transporter function, with decreasing striatal uptake demonstrating increasingly severe disease. The strength of dopamine-transporter SPECT is that nigrostriatal degeneration is observed in both clinically inconclusive parkinsonism and early, even premotor, disease. In this clinical review (Part 2), we present the dopamine-transporter SPECT findings in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The findings in vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and essential tremor are also described. It is hoped that this technique will be the forerunner of a range of routinely used, process-specific ligands that can identify early degenerative disease and subsequently guide disease-modifying interventions.

### Asymmetric dopamine transporter loss affects cognitive and motor progression in Parkinson's disease [^ec1bfaef]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by hemispheric asymmetric loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, which drives motor symptoms lateralization. Hemispheric asymmetry in PD seems to affect not only motor symptoms but also nonmotor features, such as cognition, pain, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric and autonomic manifestations. However, previous evidence regarding the patterns and progression of clinical PD phenotypes associated with the hemispheric lateralization of neurodegeneration yielded mixed results, particularly for motor and cognitive functions.

Methodological heterogeneity of previous studies perhaps contributed to those inconsistent findings, including different designs (mostly cross‐sectional studies, with the longitudinal studies having only short‐term follow‐up), sample characteristics, and different methods to determine PD lateralization, mainly based on motor symptoms. Indeed, to establish laterality, most studies adopted a subjective method using motor scale scores and patients' reports of their initial side of onset rather than an objective assessment of dopamine denervation, such as the dopamine transporter (DAT) binding single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. In addition, only one previous workincluded the clinical spectrum of patients with PD with a stable asymmetry over time, excluding those who turned out to be symmetric overtime, possibly nonidiopathic PD.

The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) — an observational, international, multicenter study — offers the opportunity to access a large PD cohort with yearly prospective cognitive and motor evaluations and striatal DAT‐SPECT imaging datato improve the understanding of disease mechanisms and evolution.

Hence, in the present study we aimed at exploring for the first time the role of hemispheric asymmetric loss of putaminal DAT‐SPECT uptake — an objective measure of the lateralized motor symptoms severity — on early cognitive and motor manifestations in right‐handed drug‐naïve patients with PD and their progression over 4 years.

We believe our results can expand the current knowledge about the role of hemispheric asymmetry of nigrostriatal degeneration on disease course and possibly provide important clinical implications for treatment plans and intervention strategies.

### The role of functional dopamine-transporter SPECT imaging in parkinsonian syndromes, part 1 [^bfc3d78b]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

As we defeat infectious diseases and cancer, one of the greatest medical challenges facing us in the mid-21st century will be the increasing prevalence of degenerative disease. Those diseases, which affect movement and cognition, can be the most debilitating. Dysfunction of the extrapyramidal system results in increasing motor disability often manifest as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The common pathologic pathway of these diseases, collectively described as parkinsonian syndromes, such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies, is degeneration of the presynaptic dopaminergic pathways in the basal ganglia. Conventional MR imaging is insensitive, especially in early disease, so functional imaging has become the primary method used to differentiate a true parkinsonian syndrome from vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced changes, or essential tremor. Unusually for a modern functional imaging technique, the method most widely used in European clinics depends on SPECT and not PET. This SPECT technique (described in the first of 2 parts) commonly reports dopamine-transporter function, with decreasing striatal uptake demonstrating increasingly severe disease.

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^fcf9c81d]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Contrasting prior studies, our research reinvigorates the potential of DaT imaging as a monitoring biomarker, noting methodological decisions, like static and uniform brain region delineation or random variability in the outcome measure, as current issues rather than intrinsic sensitivity limitations of the biomarker itself. Hence, our model provides a foundation for evaluating interventions targeting the recovery or preservation of dopaminergic neurons and facilitates the categorization of patients based on their unique disease trajectories.

### The role of dopaminergic imaging in patients with symptoms of dopaminergic system neurodegeneration [^de44e174]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with disturbances of dopaminergic functioning can be challenging, especially in the early stages, and may be assisted with biomarkers such as dopamine system imaging. Distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is a major diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is straightforward with classic presentation, but accurate distinction among Parkinsonian variants may be difficult; non-Parkinson's disease conditions are commonly misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and ~20% of patients with Parkinson's disease are not clinically diagnosed despite coming to medical attention. Early and accurate diagnosis is desirable to improve management. Imaging of the dopamine transporter using single-photon emission computed tomography may be of particular utility in this regard. Abnormal imaging indicates underlying nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, supportive of a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism or dementia with Lewy bodies, and identifies patient groups in whom dopaminergic therapy may be beneficial. Normal imaging supports diagnosis of a condition not involving nigrostriatal neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, essential tremor or drug-induced parkinsonism and hence a different therapeutic approach. In patients in whom there was diagnostic uncertainty between degenerative parkinsonism and non-degenerative tremor disorders, baseline imaging with the dopamine transporter ligand [(123)I]ioflupane (DaTscan™) has shown 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity with reference to clinical diagnosis at 3 years, versus 93% and 46%, respectively, for baseline clinical diagnosis. In a Phase III trial of [(123)I]ioflupane in patients with initial clinical diagnosis of probable or possible dementia with Lewy bodies or non-Lewy body dementia, mean specificity for excluding non-Lewy body dementia (predominantly Alzheimer's disease) was 90.4%. Using clinical diagnosis as a reference against which to assess sensitivity and specificity of dopamine transporter imaging is a limitation, but definitive diagnosis via pathological confirmation is generally not feasible. In a series of patients with post-mortem brain examination, imaging using [(123)I]ioflupane has demonstrated higher sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%) for differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies from non-Lewy body dementia than clinical diagnosis (75% and 42%, respectively). Dopaminergic system imaging may be particularly valuable in patients with clinically inconclusive parkinsonism or a clinical diagnosis of possible dementia with Lewy bodies; it is not helpful in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism, although postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be of utility. Other potential uses of dopamine transporter imaging include identification of patients with premotor Parkinson's disease, monitoring disease progression in testing novel therapeutics, and as an inclusion criterion for entry into clinical trials.

Concluding remarks

A variety of signaling pathways have been identified that dynamically regulate dopamine reuptake through DAT plasma membrane trafficking, and many overlap with key molecular mechanisms compromised by PD-linked mutations as illustrated in Fig. 2. Down regulation of DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake and increase in striatal dopamine release are often observed in genetic models of parkinsonism. Why would the neurons employ so many complicated signaling pathways to regulate DAT trafficking? DAT critically maintains dopamine homeostasis to regulate dopamine signaling that is absolutely required for movement initiation and survival. Cytosolic dopamine is also easily oxidized, may lead to the production of free radicals, and drives neuromelanin biosynthesis. Direct administration of dopamine and overexpression of dopamine transporter both lead to neuronal loss. Conversely, dopamine reuptake by DAT is the primary mechanism for the maintenance of dopamine storage, and loss of DAT leads to dopamine depletion. The depolarizing currents generated by dopamine reuptake also directly regulate the excitability of presynaptic boutons. Thus, DAT surface expression must be controlled to allow dopaminergic neurons to optimally function. The complexities of DAT regulation may enable multiple compensatory mechanisms to maintain dopamine signaling despite early dysfunction. Given the role of DAT in the regulation of dopamine release and the long-hypothesized connection between altered dopamine neurotransmission and PD, studies of DAT regulation in physiological and pathological conditions remain a promising avenue to identify early biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PD.

Dopamine transporter trafficking is regulated by various mechanisms, many of which overlap with key molecular mechanisms compromised by PD-linked mutations. α-synuclein and Rit2 interact with DAT and regulate both surface expression and dopamine uptake kinetics. LRRK2 may regulate DAT trafficking either through axonal transport and/or endocytic trafficking. Parkin is proposed to ubiquitinate improperly folded DAT and increase its turnover rate. VPS35 is responsible for recruiting internalized DAT to a recycling fate. This figure is created with BioRender.com.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^d6770691]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

As discussed, DA release defects are routinely observed before motor symptom onset. How much of a deficit is required to produce motor symptoms, and perhaps more importantly, what other factors are modulating striatal DA content levels to either prevent, or contribute to, symptom onset? Reduced DA release does not always directly correspond to reduced striatal DA content at a given time point, and extracellular levels can be modulated by other factors such as DA reuptake. The absolute DA content threshold required for symptom onset is probably modulated by network and compensatory mechanisms such as upregulation of postsynaptic DA receptor numbers, which has been reported in humans with early Parkinson's disease. Importantly, the studies exploring DA release defects in Parkinson's disease support that it is prolonged dysfunction that is the key to motor symptom onset. On a molecular level, this is probably due to the progression of several aspects of cellular dysfunction coinciding with loss of systemic compensation, however, further studies are still required to fully understand this.

Indeed, neuronal death may be a critical switch, tipping the system beyond the ability to compensate for a system-wide deficit of striatal DA content, leading to the onset of motor symptoms. The mechanism by which neurons die in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Synaptic dysfunction, or rather a side effect of it, might contribute to cell death through toxic cytosolic DA or α-synuclein accumulation. On the other hand, this death may be caused by programmed cell death following prolonged cellular dysfunction. Whether or not neuronal death is the mechanism by which reduced DA release passes the threshold, ultimately it is the loss of DA content itself, rather than the death of neurons, which is required for the onset of motor symptoms.

It is therefore plausible that dopamine and its metabolites serve a central role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and these observations support testing of dopamine reduction therapy in the clinic. Three factors undermine the current model of disease: first, dopamine levels in the cytosol are elevated in Parkinson's disease, meaning it could be a factor, second, dopamine-related toxicity explains much of the understanding of disease, suggesting at least an association of the molecule with disease progression and third, multiple laboratory models show that dopamine reduction therapy can reverse pathology, supporting a causative role of dopamine and its metabolites in Parkinson's disease. While possible to reduce cytosolic dopamine by targeting the vesicles or vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), the dopamine-excess toxicity model of disease can be tested immediately through study of dopamine reduction therapy in the clinic using an FDA-approved, and therefore, repurposed drug to inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase.

### The role of DAT-SPECT in movement disorders [^063f233b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is a sensitive method to detect presynaptic dopamine neuronal dysfunction, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative parkinsonism. DAT imaging can therefore assist the differentiation between conditions with and without presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. Diagnosis of Parkinson disease or tremor disorders can be achieved with high degrees of accuracy in cases with full expression of classical clinical features; however, diagnosis can be difficult, since there is a substantial clinical overlap especially in monosymptomatic tremor (dystonic tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson tremor). The use of DAT-SPECT can prove or excludes with high sensitivity nigrostriatal dysfunction in those cases and facilitates early and accurate diagnosis. Furthermore, a normal DAT-SPECT is helpful in supporting a diagnosis of drug-induced-, psychogenic- and vascular parkinsonism by excluding underlying true nigrostriatal dysfunction. This review addresses the value of DAT-SPECT and its impact on diagnostic accuracy in movement disorders presenting with tremor and/or parkinsonism.

### Levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [^69412b9c]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

For all its imperfections at treating Parkinson's disease (PD), orally-administered levodopa (l-dopa) can be regarded as the "platinum" standard of PD therapeutics for its impact on disability and discomfort and its cost-effectiveness. The past half-century has confirmed that the typical l-dopa-treated patient gains improvement for most Parkinsonian features, presumably by conversion of this amino acid into dopamine in the striatum. However, fundamental questions remain as to its full mechanism of action and how adverse reactions evolve. Various aspects of clinical phenomenology associated with chronic l-dopa use (such as dyskinesias and the long-duration anti-Parkinsonian response) present a continuing challenge for better understanding of its pharmacology. The pharmacokinetics of l-dopa tend to predict some of problems that can emerge during chronic therapy, which can be linked with its irregular uptake and marked dose-by-dose variability in plasma concentrations. Several new pharmaceutical approaches are targeted at the unique physiology of l-dopa uptake and are likely to improve the consistency of its anti-Parkinsonian effect.

### Intense exercise increases dopamine transporter and neuromelanin concentrations in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease [^22dad242]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, this proof-of-concept study provides in vivo evidence that sustained periods of intense exercise can induce brain changes in individuals with mild and early PD. Two different biomarkers for the health of the dopamine system were increased in the SN following six months of exercise demonstrating the neuromodulatory effects of exercise on the dopaminergic system. Moreover, the increases were both significantly different from, and reversals of, the expected natural decline. These same markers did not decline in the striatum as would also have been expected during the natural course of disease progression. Our results not only support the inclusion of high-intensity exercise early in the treatment plans of PD patients, but also suggest a role for exercise as an effective non-invasive neuromodulatory therapy. Future randomized controlled trials will be needed to optimize exercise regimens. Our observations could also have far-reaching implications for neuroprotective effects of exercise in PD, but further work is needed to validate them and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

### Patients with rest-tremor and scans with ipsilateral dopaminergic deficit [^e1d33ac3]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Dopamine transporter imaging is typically abnormal in Parkinson's disease and shows reduced striatal uptake, which is typically greater contralateral to the clinically more affected side. However, tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients may have significantly lower uptake in the striatum ipsilateral to the rest-tremor compared to akinetic-rigid PD patients, implying a possible role of an ipsilateral deficit in the generation of rest-tremor. We report here three patients with rest-tremor and the unexpected finding of an ipsilateral presynaptic dopaminergic deficit with normal uptake contralateral to the rest-tremor in dopamine transporter imaging. We divided them in two groups, with and without a corresponding structural lesion in brain imaging. These data may suggest a role of ipsilateral dopaminergic deficit in the generation of rest-tremor. An explanation of these findings could be damage of crossed dopaminergic fibres from the substantia nigra to thalamus, which can cause motor impairment ipsilateral to dopamine depletion experimentally. This is speculative but there is no doubt that these cases exist and we encourage others to report similar cases, as this may assist in the better understanding of the yet unknown pathophysiology of rest-tremor.

### Do dopamine agonists or levodopa modify Parkinson's disease progression? [^f0de183d]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade, in vivo imaging of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system has been developed as a research tool to monitor progressive dopaminergic neuron loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to assess the effect of medication on imaging outcomes. Recently two similar studies compared the effect of initial treatment with a dopamine agonist (pramipexole (CALM-PD CIT) or ropinirole (REAL-PET)) or levodopa on the progression of PD as measured by [123I]beta-CIT or [18F]Dopa imaging. These two clinical imaging studies targeting dopamine function with different imaging ligands and technology both demonstrate slowing in the rate of loss of [123I]beta-CIT or [18F]Dopa uptake in early PD patients treated with dopamine agonists compared with levodopa. The relative reduction in the per cent loss from baseline of [123I]beta-CIT uptake in the pramipexole versus the levodopa group was 47% at 22 months, 44% at 34 months and 37% at 46 months after initiating treatment. The relative reduction of 18F-dopa uptake in the ropinirole group versus the levodopa group was 35% at 24 months. These results should be very cautiously interpreted with regard to the effect of dopamine agonists or levodopa on clinical disease progression. These data highlight the need to compare imaging outcomes of dopamine neuronal loss with multiple meaningful clinical endpoints of disease progression in placebo controlled, larger and long-term studies.

### Imaging dopaminergic neurotransmission in neurodegenerative disorders [^974cc38c]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging of dopaminergic transmission in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies plays a major role in clinical practice and in clinical research. We here review the role of imaging of the nigrostriatal pathway, as well as of striatal receptors and dopamine release, in common neurodegenerative disorders in clinical practice and research. Imaging of the nigrostriatal pathway has a high diagnostic accuracy to detect nigrostriatal degeneration in disorders characterized by nigrostriatal degeneration, such as PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, and disorders of more clinical importance, namely in patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonism. Imaging of striatal dopamine D 2/3 receptors is not recommended for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders in clinical practice anymore. Regarding research, recently the European Medicines Agency has qualified dopamine transporter imaging as an enrichment biomarker for clinical trials in early PD, which underlines the high diagnostic accuracy of this imaging tool and will be implemented in future trials. Also, imaging of the presynaptic dopaminergic system plays a major role in, for example, examining the extent of nigrostriatal degeneration in preclinical and premotor phases of neurodegenerative disorders and to examine subtypes of PD. Also, imaging of postsynaptic dopamine D 2/3 receptors plays a role in studying, for example, the neuronal substrate of impulse control disorders in PD, as well as in measuring endogenous dopamine release to examine, for example, motor complications in the treatment of PD. Finally, novel MRI sequences as neuromelanin-sensitive MRI are promising new tools to study nigrostriatal degeneration in vivo.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^99425ab8]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence for early synaptic dysfunction and dopamine release defects in patients with Parkinson's disease

Much evidence indicates that nigrostriatal degeneration begins in axons, but is it preceded by DA release defects? Subjects who are at risk for Parkinson's disease, such as non-manifesting carriers of Parkinson's disease-associated mutations, asymptomatic family members or individuals with prodromal symptoms, represent the best opportunity to study preclinical Parkinson's disease and therefore to elucidate systems of early dysfunction. Brain imaging studies in humans in vivo suggest presynaptic defects precede symptom onset in Parkinson's disease. PET imaging of asymptomatic family members revealed presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction, with reduced 18 F-DOPA uptake, a measure of presynaptic dopaminergic integrity or DA handling, in individuals who later went on to develop Parkinson's disease. 18 F-DOPA uptake was also significantly reduced in non-manifesting twins that were discordant for Parkinson's disease. Of these twin pairs, several asymptomatic monozygotic cotwins with abnormal baseline scans later went on to develop clinical Parkinson's disease. Similar findings were observed in familial Parkinson's disease-associated asymptomatic mutation carriers. Two studies demonstrated that 18 F-DOPA uptake was reduced in asymptomatic carriers with a single parkin (PRKN) mutation allele when compared to a control cohort. A 5-year follow-up study suggested that although subclinical reductions of striatal 18 F-DOPA uptake are frequent in single parkin mutation carriers, the rate of disease progression appeared very slow, although confirmation with a larger and longer-term longitudinal follow-up study, would be required. Asymptomatic individuals heterozygous for PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) mutations also demonstrated a significant reduction in 18 F-DOPA uptake when compared to a control cohort. Studies demonstrate that in asymptomatic Y1699C and R1441C leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation carriers, 18 F-DOPA uptake was normal, despite evidence for impaired DA function with abnormal DAT binding. A longitudinal study that followed asymptomatic LRRK2 G2019S carriers who went on to convert to Parkinson's disease by the time of a 4-year re-evaluation revealed a lower striatal DAT binding at baseline than nonconverters. Brain imaging of patients with prodromal Parkinson's disease, including hyposmic and REM sleep behaviour disorder cohorts, has also revealed dopaminergic dysfunction. Combined, these studies suggest there is probably presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease-affected individuals that precedes Parkinson's disease onset.

### Nigrostriatal dopamine terminal imaging with dopamine transporter SPECT: an update [^faf2676c]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This article gives an update on nigrostriatal dopamine terminal imaging, with emphasis on SPECT performed with the presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand (123)I-FP-CIT. The paper covers the rational use of this technique in the diagnostic work-up of patients with known or suspected parkinsonian syndromes. In detail, it addresses the impact of the method for the proof or exclusion of neurodegenerative parkinsonism, for its early and preclinical diagnosis, and for the evaluation of disease progression. The importance of normal DAT binding for differentiating symptomatic parkinsonism and relevant tremor syndromes from neurodegeneration is highlighted. Particularly emphasized is the role of DAT SPECT for diagnosing Lewy body dementia and its separation from Alzheimer dementia. Finally, some remarks deal with the economic aspects of the use of these imaging techniques in the clinical setting.

### Dopamine transporter: basic science and human variation of a key molecule for dopaminergic function, locomotion, and parkinsonism [^2aa23a74]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

We review the basic science of the dopamine transporter (DAT), a key neurotransmitter for locomotor control and reward systems, including those lost or deranged in Parkinson's disease (PD). Physiology, pharmaceutical features, expression, cDNA, protein structure/function relationships, and phosphorylation and regulation are discussed. The localization of DAT provides the best marker for the integrity of just the pre-synaptic dopaminergic systems that are most affected in PD. Its function is key for the actions of several toxins that provide some of the best current models for idiopathic parkinsonism, and its variation can clearly alter movement. The wealth of information about this interesting molecule that has been developed over the last 12 years has led to increased interest in DAT among workers interested in both normal and abnormal movement.

### Acquired dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis reproduces features of Parkinson's disease [^127353a4]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Postmortem analyses of brains from Parkinson's patients show a loss of neuromelanin containing neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra and a progressive loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Within remaining neurons, there is evidence of neuronal dysfunction in the form of protein inclusions called Lewy bodies — a primary component of which is aggregated α-synuclein. Parkinson's disease cases resulting solely from genetic factors are rare, and the majority of cases are believed to be the result of complex interactions between predisposition genes, a lifetime accumulation of environmental exposures, and deficits due to normal aging processes –. While multiple neuronal populations are affected in Parkinson's disease, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons appear to have increased vulnerability to degeneration and the loss of these neurons results in the cardinal motor symptoms that lead to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. It is hypothesized that dopamine, the neurotransmitter these neurons use to regulate motor output, contributes to the vulnerability to degeneration; this is thought to be due to dopamine's potential to act as an endogenous neurotoxin through two processes that generate reactive metabolites and reactive oxygen species: oxidation and enzymatic catabolism.

Dopamine oxidation occurs either by autooxidation or enzymatic oxidation and generates the highly reactive and electrophilic dopamine quinone, producing either H 2 O 2 or superoxide as a byproduct. The dopamine quinone will bind to free and protein-bound nucleophilic cysteine, as well as highly nucleophilic selenocysteine found in selenoproteins, such as the mitochondrially-localized antioxidant selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4). The dopamine quinone has been shown to impair several neuronal processes with mitochondrial dysfunction being a common downstream consequence –. If dopamine does not undergo oxidation, it is susceptible to enzymatic catabolism, which generates the metabolite DOPAL while producing H 2 O 2 as a byproduct. Similarly to the dopamine quinone, upon accumulating in the cytosol, DOPAL will react with proteins and generate additional reactive oxygen species as a byproduct. To minimize the accumulation of cytosolic dopamine to preserve neuronal health, there exist physical interactions between dopamine synthesis, packaging, and reuptake machinery. Following synthesis in the cytosol or presynaptic terminal reuptake, dopamine is rapidly sequestered into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) thereby isolating and stabilizing dopamine. However, there is significant evidence of VMAT2 deficiency in Parkinson's disease, which implicates dysregulation of dopamine handling in the development and/or progression of the disease –.

### Role of DaTSCAN and clinical diagnosis in parkinson disease [^7320bdf5]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the role of DaTSCAN in the diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD).

Methods

Using the sensitivity and specificity values obtained in the 2 studies that recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve the use of DaTSCAN for the diagnosis of PD, calculations were carried out to estimate the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis taking DaTSCAN findings as the standard of truth.

Results

In early PD, a clinical diagnosis of "possible" or "probable" PD has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 67%. The specificity increases to 94% once the clinical diagnosis becomes established. The overall accuracy of the clinical diagnosis is 84% in early PD and 98% at later stages. The clinical diagnostic accuracy is mathematically identical to the diagnostic accuracy of DaTSCAN imaging.

Conclusions

In the absence of neuropathologic validation, the overall accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of PD is very high and mathematically identical to the accuracy of DaTSCAN imaging, which calls into question the use of radiotracer neuroimaging as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.

### Intense exercise increases dopamine transporter and neuromelanin concentrations in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease [^ce2067ad]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). A growing literature has demonstrated the benefits of exercise programs for controlling motor symptoms of PD –. The reported benefits vary according to the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise. Moderate-to-high-intensity exercise multiple times per week for prolonged periods (e.g. 6 months) has been shown to ameliorate the motor severity of PD in clinical trials –.

Rodent models of PD have shown that exercise-induced improvements in motor performance were accompanied by neuroprotective effects on the dopaminergic neurons in the SN –. These neuroprotective effects of exercise are thought to be mediated through neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic factors. It has been suggested that the interplay between these factors facilitates rescuing of the dopaminergic neurons and increased signaling capacity of healthy dopaminergic neurons. In humans, indirect clinical evidence suggests that exercise may be neuroprotective. Exercise studies in patients with PD support the mediator role of neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory factors in clinical improvement –. Low pro-inflammatory microglial activation has been proposed as a pathway linking physical activity to brain health based on postmortem examination of older adults without PD but with varying degrees of physical activity. Postmortem nigral volumes and white matter integrity have been found to be positively correlated with physical activity in older adults without PD. A positron emission tomography (PET) study using [11 C]-raclopride in people with PD demonstrated that a single bout of vigorous cycling by habitual exercisers released significantly more dopamine in the caudate nucleus than the same activity performed by those who were sedentary. These findings suggest that the benefits of exercise may be due to neuromodulatory effects, such as the preservation of the dopaminergic reserves and enhanced dopamine transmission. However, these putative effects have not been directly investigated in humans with PD in vivo.

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^fa3626ef]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic investigation aimed to assess the utility of DaT imaging as a monitoring biomarker for disease progression in a large cohort of 719 patients with PD. Each participant underwent up to 5 DaT‐SPECT assessments during a 5‐year follow‐up period. The analysis revealed a significant association between the decline in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and the increase in motor disabilities, measured by the MDS‐UPDRS‐III score, with and without tremor items. This discovery offers novel support for using DaT imaging in clinical settings to monitor individual disease progression, differentiate progression‐based disease subtypes, and assess the efficacy of disease‐modifying therapies. However, it is noteworthy that the identified effect size was relatively small, suggesting potential limitations in the sensitivity of either the regressors (ie, DaT signal) or the outcome variable (ie, MDS‐UPDRS‐III score), as discussed below. Moreover, possible influences of confounding variables, such as medication and cognitive status, will be addressed.

Our investigation into the utility of repetitive DaT imaging as a monitoring biomarker for PD progression highlighted 2 key sensitivity limitations: brain region and laterality. Given the advanced neurodegeneration in the more affected putamen at diagnosis and the later involvement of the caudate nucleus, it is unsurprising that the effect was only evident for the less affected putaminal DaT signal. The critical role of putaminal neurodegeneration in early disease stages and its close association with symptom onset and worsening finds further support in cross‐sectional DaT‐SPECT, and positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Moreover, regarding laterality, it was shown that lateral differences in putaminal dopamine availability correlate with left–right motor impairments, whereas no such association was found for the caudate nucleus. Combining our findings on the association between DaT signal decline and motor symptom progression with previous research, we propose the following clinical milestones. The depletion of the more affected putamen at diagnosis likely marks the transition from a prodromal to a clinical motor stage, whereas degeneration in the less affected putamen reflects early disease progression. The involvement of the more affected caudate nucleus may signify a shift to intermediate stages with cognitive decline, and late‐stage disease could be characterized by degeneration of the less affected caudate (Fig 3).

### Acquired dysregulation of dopamine homeostasis reproduces features of Parkinson's disease [^98710a32]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Analysis from postmortem tissue from Parkinson's disease patients revealed decreased expression of VMAT2, which suggests a deficiency in synaptic vesicle dopaminergic sequestration. Furthermore, VMAT2 isolated from the striatal terminals from postmortem tissue of Parkinson's patients shows an impaired rate of dopamine uptake, suggesting that in addition to a loss of VMAT2, the remaining VMAT2 is less efficient at sequestering dopamine. Accordingly, analysis from postmortem tissue of Parkinson's disease patients demonstrates increased cytosolic dopamine metabolism as evidenced by an increase in the amount of the dopamine metabolites DOPAC, HVA, and DOPAL relative to the amount of dopamine. In addition, VMAT2 mRNA is decreased in circulating platelets from Parkinson's disease patients, which suggests a systemic deficiency in VMAT2 involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Testing the hypothesis that a deficiency in VMAT2 contributes to the development of Parkinson's disease, a genetic mouse model investigated the consequence of systemic VMAT2 deficiency and revealed the replication of motor and nonmotor Parkinson's symptoms as well as age-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Building on fundamental in vivo and in vitro experiments investigating the neurotoxic consequences of cytosolic dopamine, here we present a new in vivo model of acquired dopaminergic dysregulation through viral-mediated interference of VMAT2 expression in adult rats.

### Premotor Parkinson's disease: concepts and definitions [^6406f47c]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) has a prodromal phase during which nonmotor clinical features as well as physiological abnormalities may be present. These premotor markers could be used to screen for PD before motor abnormalities are present. The technology to identify PD before it reaches symptomatic Braak Stage 3 (substantia nigra compacta [SNc] involvement) already exists. The current challenge is to define the appropriate scope of use of predictive testing for PD. Imaging technologies such as dopamine transporter imaging currently offer the highest degree of accuracy for identifying premotor PD, but they are expensive as screening tools, and abnormalities on these studies would only be evident at Braak Stage 3 or higher. Efficiency is greatly enhanced by combining imaging with a prescreening test such as olfactory testing. This 2-step process has the potential to greatly reduce costs while retaining diagnostic accuracy. Alternatively, or in concert with this approach, evaluating high-risk populations (eg, patients with rapid eye movement behavior disorder or LRRK2 mutations) would enrich the sample for cases with underlying PD. Ultimately, the role of preclinical detection of PD will be determined by the ability of emerging therapies to influence clinical outcomes. As such, implementation of large-scale screening strategies awaits the arrival of clearly safe and effective therapies that address the underlying pathogenesis of PD. Future research will establish more definitive biomarkers capable of revealing the presence of disease in advance of SNc involvement with the promise of the potential for introducing disease-modifying therapy even before the development of evidence of dopamine deficiency.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^c0fa48ac]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

DA release dynamics in vivo are thought to be determined by a combination of different DAN firing rates (tonic low frequency pacemaking, sustained increases in firing rate and short intermittent or 'phasic' bursts at high frequencies), as well as by a range of mechanisms operating on DA axons that can locally gate action potential propagation, DA release probability and its dynamics during activity. DA acts through D1- or D2-type receptors on recipient cells that probably include all striatal cells. Following its release, DA is primarily taken back up by DANs via the DA uptake transporter (DAT). It can also be degraded by monoamine oxidase B or catechol- O -methyltransferase.

SNpc DANs have distinctive axonal arbours formed by extensive branching of long unmyelinated axonsthat bear exceptionally large numbers of release sites (> 10⁵). Their propagation of action potentials has been proposed to pose extremely high energetic demands. These factors are suggested to contribute to their preferential vulnerability to degeneration in Parkinson's disease. Early synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease has long been reported as a key feature in both Parkinson's disease models and human patients. Dopaminergic axons are affected early in Parkinson's disease, with synaptic decay preceding neuron death. This concept is not unique to Parkinson's disease; impaired synaptic activity and function, referred to as synaptopathy, is observed in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's, Alzheimer's and motor neuron disease. Although many neurotransmitter pathways are affected in Parkinson's disease, and DA deficits are frequently considered a relatively late but characteristic pathology of the disease, a substantial body of work suggests DA dysfunction is an early cardinal feature.

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^97bf6115]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our disease progression framework extends a recently suggested staging system, which is based on binary (±) states of alpha‐synuclein (S) accumulation and nigrostriatal dopamine degeneration (D). Although this binary framework provides a starting point, it does not account for lateral or regional variations, which are critical for understanding the nuanced dynamics of PD progression. By incorporating laterality and regional DaT signal changes, our framework allows for a more fine‐grained tracking of disease progression, identifying, for instance, the degeneration of the less affected putamen as an early biomarker of disease progression. This refinement enables more individualized and detailed disease monitoring. Considering the novelty of our proposal and the limited availability of data, the framework illustrated in Figure 3 should be regarded as an evolving and adaptable model rather than an established staging system. This adaptability allows it to incorporate future findings, particularly as more data become available on the trajectories of disease subtypes, compensatory mechanisms, and nonlinear progression trajectories.

Fig. 1
MIBG-DAT dual imaging diagnostic algorithm. MIBG abnormality separates multisystem Lewy body disease (MLBD) pathologies, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from other types of parkinsonism. 123 I-Ioflupane measures the integrity of nigrostriatal dopamine projections. Low dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in the caudate, putamen or both, in either brain hemisphere, are consistent with a parkinsonian disorder, independently of its nature. In subjects with appropriate symptoms and signs, the combination of the two imaging modalities allows discriminating four distinct pathologies: (1) non-parkinsonian disorders (upper left quadrant, dual test normality); (2) atypical non-Lewy body parkinsonism (upper right quadrant, normal MIBG, and abnormal DAT); (3) early-stage MLBD or pre-symptomatic parkinsonism (lower left quadrant, abnormal MIBG and normal DAT); (4) MLBD, either DLB or PD (lower right quadrant, abnormal MIBG, and DAT)

### Striatal dopamine in parkinson disease: a meta-analysis of imaging studies [^1a387af0]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of 142 positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated striatal presynaptic dopamine function in Parkinson disease (PD) was performed. Subregional estimates of striatal dopamine metabolism are presented. The aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) defect appears to be consistently smaller than the dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 defects, suggesting upregulation of AADC function in PD. The correlation between disease severity and dopamine loss appears linear, but the majority of longitudinal studies point to a negative exponential progression pattern of dopamine loss in PD.

### Practical overview ofI-ioflupane imaging in parkinsonian syndromes [^80a29906]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Parkinsonian syndromes are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders involving the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and are characterized by a wide spectrum of motor and nonmotor symptoms. These syndromes are quite common and can profoundly impact the lives of patients and their families. In addition to classic Parkinson disease, parkinsonian syndromes include multiple additional disorders known collectively as Parkinson-plus syndromes or atypical parkinsonism. These are characterized by the classic parkinsonian motor symptoms with additional distinguishing clinical features. Dopamine transporter SPECT has been developed as a diagnostic tool to assess the levels of dopamine transporters in the striatum. This imaging assessment, which uses iodine 123 (123 I) ioflupane, can be useful to differentiate parkinsonian syndromes caused by nigrostriatal degeneration from other clinical mimics such as essential tremor or psychogenic tremor. Dopamine transporter imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing parkinsonian syndromes, particularly in patients who do not clearly fulfill the clinical criteria for diagnosis. Diagnostic clarification can allow early treatment in appropriate patients and avoid misdiagnosis. At present, only the qualitative interpretation of dopamine transporter SPECT is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but quantitative interpretation is often used to supplement qualitative interpretation. The authors provide an overview of patient preparation, common imaging findings, and potential pitfalls that radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians should know when performing and interpreting dopamine transporter examinations. Alternatives to 123 I-ioflupane imaging for the evaluation of nigrostriatal degeneration are also briefly discussed. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Longitudinal analysis of multiple neurotransmitter metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid in early Parkinson's disease [^bc9d0187]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of monoamine metabolites may represent biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Objective

The aim of this study was quantification of multiple metabolites in CSF from PD versus healthy control subjects (HCs), including longitudinal analysis.

Methods

Absolute levels of multiple monoamine metabolites in CSF were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry from 161 individuals with early PD and 115 HCs from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative and de novo PD (DeNoPA) studies.

Results

Baseline levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were lower in individuals with PD compared with HCs. HVA levels correlated with Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total scores (P < 0.01). Both HVA/dopamine and DOPAC/dopamine levels correlated with caudate nucleus and raw DOPAC with putamen dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography uptake ratios (P < 0.01). No metabolite changed over 2years in drug-naive individuals, but some changed on starting levodopa treatment.

Conclusions

HVA and DOPAC CSF levels mirrored nigrostriatal pathway damage, confirming the central role of dopaminergic degeneration in early PD. © 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^420d3361]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and yet the early pathophysiological events of the condition and sequences of dysfunction remain unclear. The loss of dopaminergic neurons and reduced levels of striatal dopamine are descriptions used interchangeably as underlying the motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. However, decades of research suggest that dopamine release deficits in Parkinson's disease do not occur only after cell death, but that there is dysfunction or dysregulation of axonal dopamine release before cell loss. Here we review the evidence for dopamine release deficits prior to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, drawn from a large and emerging range of Parkinson's disease models, and the mechanisms by which these release deficits occur. The evidence indicates that impaired dopamine release can result from disruption to a diverse range of Parkinson's disease-associated genetic and molecular disturbances, and can be considered as a potential pathophysiological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.

### Loss of dopamine transporter binding in Parkinson's disease follows a single exponential rather than linear decline [^efa560fe]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Imaging of L-dopa uptake or dopamine transporter binding can monitor the progression of Parkinson's disease. Most follow-up studies have provided data best fitted by a linear decline of their outcome measure. However, in these studies, patients were repeatedly scanned during their first years after a diagnosis had been established.

Methods

We followed 6 patients with early Parkinson's disease for 7.5 y using 123I-labeled N-(3-iodopropene-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl) tropane and SPECT.

Results

Loss of dopamine transporter binding was best fitted using a single exponential approximation. A 63% loss (tau [time constant tau]) was calculated as 5.18 ± 7.62 y in the putamen and 10.62 ± 31.4 y in the caudate nucleus when a 3-parameter fit was used.

Conclusion

These data approximate, for what is to our knowledge the first time, the decline of dopamine transporter binding as expected in biologic systems and may allow for models that correct for exponential decline to be developed and for disease-modifying effects in patients with advanced disease to be determined.

### Dopamine transporter imaging is associated with long-term outcomes in Parkinson's disease [^2ca3968d]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) imaging has been studied as a diagnostic tool for degenerative parkinsonism. Our aim was to measure the prognostic value of imaging for motor and nonmotor outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). We prospectively evaluated a Parkinson's cohort after enrollment in a de novo clinical trial with a battery of motor (UPDRS), cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and behavioral measures. DAT imaging with [(123)I]-CIT and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was performed at baseline and after 22 months. In total, 491 (91%) of the 537 subjects had evidence of DA deficiency on their baseline scan, consistent with PD, and were included in the analyses. The cohort was followed for 5.5 (0.8) years, with a mean duration of diagnosis of 6.3 (1.2). Lower striatal binding at baseline was independently associated with higher risk for clinical milestones and measures of disease severity, including motor-related disability, falling and postural instability, cognitive impairment, psychosis, and clinically important depressive symptoms. Subjects in the bottom quartile for striatal binding, compared to the top quartile, had an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.3 (1.7, 6.7) for cognitive impairment and 12.9 (2.6, 62.4) for psychosis. Change from baseline in imaging after 22 months was also independently associated with motor, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes. DAT imaging with [(123)I]-CIT and SPECT, shortly after the diagnosis of PD, was independently associated with clinically important long-term motor and nonmotor outcomes. These results should be treated as hypothesis generating and require confirmation.

### Optimizing Parkinson's disease diagnosis: the role of a dual nuclear imaging algorithm [^a8c89ff5]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of 123 I-ioflupane SPECT

123-iodine 123 I-ioflupane SPECT imaging (also known by its trade name DaTscan TM) provides a commercially available, objective and quantitative marker of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. Radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians and neurologists can directly visualize the loss of dopamine transporters in the striatum of PD patients, the loss of which increases in severity with disease progression. 123 I-ioflupane SPECT abnormalities can detect dopaminergic deficiency at the threshold of motor pathology, as early as Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) Stage I. Despite its widespread use and recent FDA approval in the US, the diagnostic role of 123 I-ioflupane SPECT is limited by a number of issues, including: (1) the difficulty to differentiate PD from a variety of other parkinsonian syndromes associated with striatal dopamine deficiency; (2) an inferior spatial resolution as compared to other imaging techniques, particularly positron emission tomography (PET); (3) the possibility of false negatives in subjects with clinical evidence of parkinsonism, also known as "scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits" (SWEDD); (4) the possibility that dopaminergic treatment impacts the imaging techniques; (5) how subtle a dopaminergic deficit can be detected, potentially limiting its utility in addressing early-stage transitions from pre-motor PD to symptomatic PD; and (6) its economic cost and safety profile in terms of exposure to radiations.

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^ca4c57c8]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.

Methods

This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).

Results

We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.

Interpretation

Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:120–135

### Early-stage treatment… [^f5967774]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Late-Stage Treatment Late-stage Parkinson's disease includes patients already receiving carbidopa/levodopa treatment who have developed motor complications. After five years of treatment with levodopa, about 40 percent of patients develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. 23 Patients may experience a "wearing-off" effect characterized by a shorter duration of benefit from each levodopa dose, causing parkinsonian symptoms to reemerge. Patients can also experience an "on-off" effect characterized by unpredictable, abrupt fluctuations in motor state from when the medication is effective and symptoms are controlled to when parkinsonian symptoms worsen. These motor complications can be treated by adding a dopamine agonist, MAO-B inhibitor, or catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor. 15, 24–27.

DOPAMINE AGONISTS Systematic reviews have demonstrated that dopamine agonists may significantly reduce "off" time, improving motor impairment and disability and reducing the need for levodopa. 15, 24, 25 However, the reviews have also shown a trend toward increased adverse events with dopamine agonists. COMT INHIBITORS COMT inhibitors decrease the degradation of levodopa and extend its half-life, thus relieving the end-of-dose wearing-off effect and reducing "off" time. A Cochrane review showed that, compared with placebo, adjuvant COMT inhibitors reduced "off" time and levodopa dose and modestly improved motor symptoms and disability in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and motor complications.

MAO-B INHIBITORS An 18-week, randomized double-blind trial evaluated the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline, entacapone, and placebo as adjuncts to levodopa in 687 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations. Rasagiline and entacapone reduced "off" time by about 1. 2 hours a day compared with
0. 4 hours with placebo.

### Definition and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^8e6257cc]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Especially in the early motor stages of the disease, distinguishing PD from atypical and secondary Parkinson syndromes based solely on clinical criteria can be challenging. Therefore, there is a need for additional diagnostic methods to increase diagnostic accuracy. Cranial MRI provides valuable diagnostic assistance in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes, including the exclusion of symptomatic causes and differentiation from other neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes (given the high positive predictive value of corresponding MRI signs for other neurodegenerative Parkinson syndromes). At the onset of symptoms, distinguishing PD) from other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonian features, particularly MSA, PSP, and CBD, presents a clinical challenge. FDG-PET of the brain is an established routine procedure that can capture and diagnostically utilize the impact of the disease on brain metabolism.

Recommendation (new in German guideline, 2023), summary of questions 12–22

Cranial MRI (cMRI) should be conducted early in the disease course to aid in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson syndromes. For evaluating exclusion criteria for PD, cMRI scans with standardized sequences, including T1-weighted and T2-weighted (preferably high-resolution 3D). In addition, iron-sensitive/susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences may be included.

Consensus strength: 97%, strong consensus.

Transcranial brain parenchymal sonography (TCS) performed by a qualified examiner can be useful in differentiating PD from atypical and secondary Parkinsonian syndromes. TCS should assess the substantia nigra, nucleus lentiformis, and the third ventricle.

Consensus strength: 97.4%, strong consensus.

FDG-PET may be considered if clinical signs strongly suggest an atypical Parkinson syndrome and the results will impact clinical decisions, such as diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy.

Consensus strength: 84%, consensus.

FDG-PET may also be used to evaluate the risk of dementia in PD, provided the findings have clinical implications.

Consensus strength: 97%, strong consensus.

Dopamine transporter SPECT (DAT-SPECT) may be performed early in the disease course to detect nigrostriatal deficits in cases where the diagnosis of Parkinson or tremor syndromes is unclear, if the results will influence clinical management.

Consensus strength: 82.8%, consensus.

Cardiac MIBG scintigraphy or SPECT can be considered to distinguish PD from MSA if FDG-PET is not available.

Consensus strength: 100%, strong consensus.

### Neuroimaging in parkinson disease: from research setting to clinical practice [^10829fb8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Over the past three decades, neuroimaging studies-including structural, functional and molecular modalities-have provided invaluable insights into the mechanisms underlying Parkinson disease (PD). Observations from multimodal neuroimaging techniques have indicated changes in brain structure and metabolic activity, and an array of neurochemical changes that affect receptor sites and neurotransmitter systems. Characterization of the neurobiological alterations that lead to phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with PD has considerably aided the in vivo investigation of aetiology and pathophysiology, and the identification of novel targets for pharmacological or surgical treatments, including cell therapy. Although PD is now considered to be very complex, no neuroimaging modalities are specifically recommended for routine use in clinical practice. However, conventional MRI and dopamine transporter imaging are commonly used as adjuvant tools in the differential diagnosis between PD and nondegenerative causes of parkinsonism. First-line neuroimaging tools that could have an impact on patient prognosis and treatment strategies remain elusive. This Review discusses the lessons learnt from decades of neuroimaging research in PD, and the promising new approaches with potential applicability to clinical practice.

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^516536d2]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite supporting the usefulness of DaT imaging as a monitoring biomarker in PD, our observed effect sizes were relatively small. However, it is crucial to interpret these results within the context of our measurement scales. The interaction term between DaT signal and time assesses whether greater dopamine neuron loss correlates with a steeper decline in motor function. Given the marginal annual increase in the MDS‐UPDRS‐III score (~2.4 points)and the much smaller decline in DaT availability, substantially larger effect sizes for the interaction within this biological framework are improbable.

Nonetheless, the large confidence intervals relative to the small effect size suggest additional noteworthy factors, limiting the sensitivity of DaT imaging when used as a monitoring biomarker. First, the extracted DaT availability originates from broad brain regions of interest, potentially overlooking subtle changes that could indicate disease progression. Second, using DaT availability from a predefined static brain region might not be sufficient to capture the dynamic disease progression over time. Particularly during transitional phases, that is, phases where the main site of pathological change may shift from one brain region or hemisphere to another, this might limit the DaT signal's utility as a monitoring biomarker. Moreover, neurodegeneration might be further advanced in some patients than in others. Therefore, the most indicative brain region might not only vary with disease progression but also between patients. Taken together, contrasting prior studies, our research affirms repetitive DaT imaging as a potentially valuable monitoring biomarker of disease progression, noting methodological decisions, like static and uniform brain region delineation, as current issues rather than intrinsic sensitivity limitations of the biomarker itself. In the next section, we will address another overlooked consideration, namely the capability of the MDS‐UPDRS‐III score, to precisely and objectively capture the subtle changes in motor performance in early disease stages.

### Presynaptic mechanisms of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease: a probabilistic model [^3a802bff]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease is often complicated by the occurrence of motor fluctuations, which can be predictable ('wearing-off') or unpredictable ('on-off'). In contrast, untreated dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is usually characterized by predictable diurnal fluctuation. The pathogenesis of motor fluctuations in treated Parkinson's disease and diurnal fluctuation in untreated DRD is poorly understood. We have developed a mathematical model indicating that all these fluctuations in motor function can be explained by presynaptic mechanisms. The model is predicated upon the release of dopamine being subject to probabilistic variations in the quantity of dopamine released by exocytosis of vesicles. Specifically, we propose that the concentration of intravesicular dopamine undergoes dynamic changes according to a log-normal distribution that is associated with different probabilities of release failure. Changes in two parameters, (i) the proportion of vesicles that undergo exocytosis per unit of time and (ii) the proportion of dopamine subject to re-uptake from the synapse, allowed us to model different curves of levodopa response, for the same degree of nigrostriatal damage in Parkinson's disease. The model predicts the following periods of levodopa clinical benefit: 4 h for stable responders, 3 h for wearing-off fluctuators, and 1.5 h for on-off fluctuators. The model also predicts that diurnal fluctuation in untreated DRD should occur some 8 h after getting up in the morning. All these results fit well with clinical observations. Additionally, we calculated the probability of obtaining a second ON period after a single dose of levodopa in Parkinson's disease (the 'yo-yoing' phenomenon). The model shows that the yo-yoing phenomenon depends on how fast the curve crosses the threshold that separates ON and OFF states, which explains why this phenomenon is virtually exclusive to patients with on-off fluctuations. The model supports the idea that presynaptic mechanisms play a key role in both short-duration and long-duration responses encountered in Parkinson's disease. Dyskinesias may also be explained by the same mechanisms.

### Dopamine transporter SPECT: how to remove subjectivity? [^6d6d80f5]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical criteria enable accurate and reliable diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes when cardinal clinical features are fully developed. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) investigating the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) status have been suggested to increase the diagnostic accuracy in uncertain parkinsonian syndromes such as isolated tremor symptoms not fulfilling essential tremor criteria, as well as drug-induced, vascular and psychogenetic parkinsonism. Several approaches for the analysis of the striatal DAT distribution have been tested for their ability to analyze and quantify SPECT images. Visual assessment of DAT binding and semiquantitative analysis using region of interests have been recommended by Nuclear Medicine Associations to be incorporated in the routine work-up of DAT-SPECT. Besides these observer dependent approaches, fully automated image-analysis techniques have been validated in the clinical setting. Their potential as tools to improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with parkinsonian features is reviewed here.

### Clinical implications of early caudate dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^8914ac9a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, we have demonstrated a high frequency of early caudate dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with recently diagnosed PD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that caudate quantification of DAT availability shortly after diagnosis may have an important role in identifying patients at risk of clinical progression to cognitive impairment, depression and gait problems in the near future. In fact, early bilateral 123 I-FP-CIT caudate uptake below −2 SDs of the controls' mean may be a valid indicator of more rapid onset of such symptoms. This approach might allow better prediction of disease course for patients with early PD and could also provide the potential to stratify cases for early targeted disease-modifying therapies.

### Levodopa and the progression of Parkinson's disease [^bfcf9802]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite the known benefit of levodopa in reducing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, concern has been expressed that its use might hasten neurodegeneration. This study assessed the effect of levodopa on the rate of progression of Parkinson's disease.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated 361 patients with early Parkinson's disease who were assigned to receive carbidopa-levodopa at a daily dose of 37.5 and 150 mg, 75 and 300 mg, or 150 and 600 mg, respectively, or a matching placebo for a period of 40 weeks, and then to undergo withdrawal of treatment for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) between baseline and 42 weeks. Neuroimaging studies of 142 subjects were performed at baseline and at week 40 to assess striatal dopamine-transporter density with the use of iodine-123-labeled 2-beta-carboxymethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I]beta-CIT) uptake.

Results

The severity of parkinsonism increased more in the placebo group than in all the groups receiving levodopa: the mean difference between the total score on the UPDRS at baseline and at 42 weeks was 7.8 units in the placebo group, 1.9 units in the group receiving levodopa at a dose of 150 mg daily, 1.9 in those receiving 300 mg daily, and -1.4 in those receiving 600 mg daily (P < 0.001). In contrast, in a substudy of 116 patients the mean percent decline in the [123I]beta-CIT uptake was significantly greater with levodopa than placebo (-6 percent among those receiving levodopa at 150 mg daily, -4 percent in those receiving it at 300 mg daily, and -7.2 percent among those receiving it at 600 mg daily, as compared with -1.4 percent among those receiving placebo; 19 patients with no dopaminergic deficits on the baseline scans were excluded from the analysis) (P = 0.036). The subjects receiving the highest dose of levodopa had significantly more dyskinesia, hypertonia, infection, headache, and nausea than those receiving placebo.

Conclusions

The clinical data suggest that levodopa either slows the progression of Parkinson's disease or has a prolonged effect on the symptoms of the disease. In contrast, the neuroimaging data suggest either that levodopa accelerates the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine nerve terminals or that its pharmacologic effects modify the dopamine transporter. The potential long-term effects of levodopa on Parkinson's disease remain uncertain.

### The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^6a21e2e8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The correct diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important for prognostic and therapeutic reasons and is essential for clinical research. Investigations of the diagnostic accuracy for the disease and other forms of parkinsonism in community-based samples of patients taking antiparkinsonian medication confirmed a diagnosis of parkinsonism in only 74% of patients and clinically probable Parkinson's disease in 53% of patients. Clinicopathological studies based on brain bank material from the UK and Canada have shown that clinicians diagnose the disease incorrectly in about 25% of patients. In these studies, the most common reasons for misdiagnosis were presence of essential tremor, vascular parkinsonism, and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Infrequent diagnostic errors included Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and drug-induced parkinsonism. Increasing knowledge of the heterogeneous clinical presentation of the various parkinsonisms has resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy of the various parkinsonian syndromes in specialised movement-disorder units. Also genetic testing and various other ancillary tests, such as olfactory testing, MRI, and dopamine-transporter single-photon-emission computed-tomography imaging, help with clinical diagnostic decisions.

### Disease-modifying trials in treated Parkinson's disease: "Stable treated" does not equate with biological stability [^c852b81b]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Imaging Evidence

While it is widely accepted that there are long‐lasting changes in the brain following the introduction of levodopa, direct imaging evidence for this notion is rather limited, as once medication is initiated, it is generally not deemed feasible or ethical to withdraw it for longer than 12 hours. In most cases, this washout time is insufficient to differentiate between the pretreatment disease state, plasticity changes resulting from medication effects (superimposed upon the disease), and long‐term changes induced by therapy. To further complicate matters, imaging changes that predict long‐term responses may be present prior to the initiation of therapy. Relevant structural, functional connectivity, and molecular imaging studies are summarized in Table 2. The greatest preponderance of available evidence is based on dopaminergic imaging, but the interpretation is often not straightforward.

TABLE 2
Imaging changes associated with dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease

Further complicating the interpretation of dopaminergic imaging studies is the finding that both sporadic and different inherited forms of PD are associated with alterations in synaptic vesicular function, but these may not be identical. Thus, dopamine turnover is increased in α‐synuclein transgenic miceand in individuals with pathogenic LRRK2 variantsprior to other evidence of neurodegeneration, reflecting their roles in synaptic vesicular dynamics. Not only might one anticipate that measures of dopamine turnover (and hence other measures of dopaminergic integrity) could be impacted by dopaminergic therapy, but these measures and the impact of therapy might differ depending upon the specific etiology of PD. This is particularly relevant in the consideration of trials of DMTs targeting specific pathogenic mechanisms (eg, α‐synuclein, LRRK2, GBA1). Indeed, alterations in dopamine release (and hence susceptibility to dopaminergic therapy) might explain the somewhat counterintuitive observation that dopamine transporter (DAT) binding is increased in non‐manifesting carriers of pathogenic GBA1 variantsand, similarly, individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome without parkinsonism have significantly elevated striatal VMAT2 binding (using 11 C‐dihydrotetrabenazine) relative to controls. In contrast, DAT binding has been reported to be either normalor decreased many years prior to expected clinical disease onset in individuals with LRRK2 variants. Furthermore, a therapy designed to target α‐synuclein could in principle have an impact on vesicular dynamics (and hence on imaging measures of dopamine function) without necessarily impacting disease progression.

### Cav2.3 channels contribute to dopaminergic neuron loss in a model of Parkinson's disease [^ee257bac]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Here, we identify Cav2.3 as mediator of SN dopaminergic neuron loss in an in vivo model of Parkinson's disease. Together with an identified protective role of NCS-1 for these neurons, our data highlight de-regulated Ca 2+ signaling as a culprit in the disease. Cav2.3 and NCS-1 thus emerge as potential targets for neuroprotective therapy.

Voltage-gated Ca 2+ entry is a key determinant of neuronal function. Ca 2+ entry during pacemaking in vulnerable but not in resistant dopaminergic neurons is coupled to Ca 2+ uptake by mitochondria, and to ATP production, particularly under increased metabolic demand. Such homeostasis sustains neuronal activity, dopamine release and thus movement, but it comes at a metabolic cost. Thus, SN dopaminergic neurons, with their activity-related Ca 2+ oscillations, and their large, arborized axonal structures, are energetically living on the edge. Parkinson's disease stressors such as aging, mitochondrial complex-I dysfunction, or mutations in PARK genes likely disrupt this delicate balance and tip them over the edge. Such a scenario might explain the higher vulnerability of SN dopaminergic neurons to degeneration compared to those in the VTA in Parkinson's disease. Thus, understanding the exact sources of activity-related Ca 2+ load and the downstream effectors in dopaminergic neurons is key to understanding how their viability is maintained.

### Longitudinal change of clinical and biological measures in early Parkinson's disease: Parkinson's progression markers initiative cohort [^3595d38e]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Although there is a large armamentarium of effective symptomatic therapies, disease‐modifying interventions are an area of tremendous unmet need. One of the limitations in the development of therapeutics for PD disease modification is the lack of reliable, objective measures of PD progression. In the absence of objective measures, disease modification trials have traditionally recruited PD participants de novo at baseline and use either change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 1 or time to initiation of symptomatic therapy as the primary outcome measures. 2, 3 The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an ongoing observational, international, multicenter cohort study aimed to identify the clinical, serological, genetic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers of PD progression in a large cohort of participants including de novo PD patients and healthy controls. PPMI participants are assessed every 6 months with a spectrum of clinical measures, including the MDS‐UPDRS and an annual collection of biological and imaging data.

In 2001, the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) convened a task force to develop a new version of UPDRS. 4 The MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS) underwent extensive clinimetric development and was endorsed by the MDS as the preferred tool to measure PD disability. 5 There are limited published data on the longitudinal rate of change of the scale in the de novo PD population. Such data are important to understand how the MDS‐UPDRS may perform when used as an outcome measure in interventional clinical trials conducted in patients with early PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) 123‐I Ioflupane (DatScan) single‐photon emission computed tomography imaging is the only commercially approved functional imaging modality to establish presence of presynaptic dopamine deficiency. In clinical practice, DAT imaging is interpreted qualitatively based on the visual interpretation, whereas quantitative analysis is routinely used in the research domain. The scan is increasingly used in clinical trials to exclude patients without evidence of dopamine deficiency who are unlikely to have the pathology that typically causes PD. 6 There are limited data on the sensitivity of DAT binding to longitudinal change, which is an essential question if DAT imaging is to be used as an imaging biomarker in PD clinical trials.

The analyses in this report has 2 main aims: first, to describe the 5‐year change of the MDS‐UPDRS, other clinical outcome measures, and DAT binding; and second to assess the correlation between MDS‐UPDRS and DAT binding in this early PD cohort.

### Neuroimaging in Parkinson's disease [^d0d9887c]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disorder in which the primary features can be related to dopamine deficiency. Changes on structural imaging are limited, but a wealth of abnormalities can be detected using positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect changes in neurochemical pathology or functional connectivity. The changes detected on these studies may reflect the disease process itself and/or compensatory responses to the disease, or they may arise in association with disease- and/or treatment-related complications. This review will focus mainly on neurochemical and metabolic studies and reviews various approaches to the assessment of dopaminergic function as well as the function of other neurotransmitters that may be affected in PD. A number of clinical applications are highlighted, including diagnostic utility, identification of preclinical disease, changes associated with motor and nonmotor complications of PD, and the effects of various therapeutic interventions.

### Study details | NCT02801110 | PET / MR imaging in patients with… [^2aa52245]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of the motor dysfunction in PD is related to gradual loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons compacta to the striatum) leading eventually to depletion of dopamine in the striatum. Striatal fluorine-18 isotopologue for L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine uptake follows a typical spatiotemporal pattern along the course of disease starting with a decreased uptake in the dorso-caudal putamen that progress to the caudate nucleus. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of the modality and to evaluate both visually and quantitatively the association between the dopamine metabolism measured in the striatum by 18F-FDOPA PET with structural and functional MR findings in patients diagnosed with IPD with asymmetrical motor signs. Study Objectives and Purpose:

- To assess the feasibility of 18F FDOPA PET/MR in the setting of IPD.
- To correlate and compare pattern of dynamic and/or static 18F-FDOPA uptake in the striatum with MR findings.
- To compare the different variables between the contra and ipsilateral hemispheric side of predominant motor involvement in patients with asymmetric motor disturbances. Patients are required to fast at least 4 hours prior to arrival to the department. Upon arrival an intravenous catheter will be placed for radiopharmaceutical and gadolinium administration. Patients will receive an intravenous injection of 10 Millicurie of 18F-FDOPA on the PET MR table and scanning will begin immediately. MR findings:

- Abnormal structural findings of the brain.
- DTI measurements in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron tracts.
- Iron overload in the SN.
- Comparison of resting-state brain networks in patients with asymmetrical motor signs with normal maps PET findings:

- Visual assessment and quantitative measurements of static F-DOPA SUVmax and SUVmean) will be performed in the putamen and caudate nucleus bilaterally.
- Measurements of dynamic F-DOPA parameters when available will be measured. Collaborators and Investigators Principal Investigator: David Groshar, MD, Head of nuclear medicine unit in Assuta Medical Centers.

### EFNS / MDS-ES / ENS recommendations for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^f1f9b0cd]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A Task Force was convened by the EFNS/MDS-ES Scientist Panel on Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders to systemically review relevant publications on the diagnosis of PD.

Methods

Following the EFNS instruction for the preparation of neurological diagnostic guidelines, recommendation levels have been generated for diagnostic criteria and investigations.

Results

For the clinical diagnosis, we recommend the use of the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria (Level B). Genetic testing for specific mutations is recommended on an individual basis (Level B), taking into account specific features (i.e. family history and age of onset). We recommend olfactory testing to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders including recessive forms (Level A). Screening for pre-motor PD with olfactory testing requires additional tests due to limited specificity. Drug challenge tests are not recommended for the diagnosis in de novo parkinsonian patients. There is an insufficient evidence to support their role in the differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. We recommend an assessment of cognition and a screening for REM sleep behaviour disorder, psychotic manifestations and severe depression in the initial evaluation of suspected PD cases (Level A). Transcranial sonography is recommended for the differentiation of PD from atypical and secondary parkinsonian disorders (Level A), for the early diagnosis of PD and in the detection of subjects at risk for PD (Level A), although the technique is so far not universally used and requires some expertise. Because specificity of TCS for the development of PD is limited, TCS should be used in conjunction with other screening tests. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging at 1.5 T are recommended as neuroimaging tools that can support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy versus PD on the basis of regional atrophy and signal change as well as diffusivity patterns (Level A). DaTscan SPECT is registered in Europe and the United States for the differential diagnosis between degenerative parkinsonisms and essential tremor (Level A). More specifically, DaTscan is indicated in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure and atypical tremor manifestations such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Studies of [(123) I]MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake may be used to identify patients with PD versus controls and MSA patients (Level A). All other SPECT imaging studies do not fulfil registration standards and cannot be recommended for routine clinical use. At the moment, no conclusion can be drawn as to diagnostic efficacy of autonomic function tests, neurophysiological tests and positron emission tomography imaging in PD.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of PD is still largely based on the correct identification of its clinical features. Selected investigations (genetic, olfactory, and neuroimaging studies) have an ancillary role in confirming the diagnosis, and some of them could be possibly used in the near future to identify subjects in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease.

### Role of dopamine transporter imaging in the diagnosis of atypical tremor disorders [^bb72bbdb]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging detects presynaptic dopamine neuronal dysfunction and thereby assists differentiation of conditions with and without dopamine deficit. In atypical tremor disorders, DAT imaging can differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD), where dopamine deficit is demonstrated on DAT imaging, and essential tremor, where no dopamine deficit is found. DAT imaging may be particularly informative in monosymptomatic rest tremors, benign tremulous Parkinson's syndrome, and in the elderly in whom essential tremor may be accompanied by pseudoparkinsonism.

### EANM practice guideline / SNMMI procedure standard for dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes 1.0 [^a6d1716c]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). High credibility.

Dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes — introduction describes the spectrum of parkinsonian disorders and the role of nuclear medicine imaging for diagnosis, noting that Parkinsonian syndromes are a group of diseases characterized by signs of parkinsonism, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, that Lewy body diseases include subtypes such as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and that the differential diagnosis includes non-neurodegenerative conditions such as essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, and psychogenic parkinsonism; it states that an improvement in diagnostic accuracy is possible using dopaminergic imaging and that this imaging technology may be particularly helpful in patients with incomplete or atypical syndromes, unsatisfying response to therapy, overlapping symptoms, or in early/mildly symptomatic stages, and further explains that nuclear medicine investigations can assess both presynaptic and postsynaptic function, with presynaptic dopaminergic imaging helping to clarify the differential diagnosis between neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes and non-dopamine deficiency etiologies of parkinsonism; key presynaptic processes highlighted include transport of dopamine into vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and that, as a result of neuronal depolarization, these vesicles are emptied into the synaptic cleft.

### GABA uptake transporters support dopamine release in dorsal striatum with maladaptive downregulation in a parkinsonism model [^4a473d44]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Striatal dopamine (DA) is critical for action and learning. Recent data show that DA release is under tonic inhibition by striatal GABA. Ambient striatal GABA tone on striatal projection neurons can be determined by plasma membrane GABA uptake transporters (GATs) located on astrocytes and neurons. However, whether striatal GATs and astrocytes determine DA output are unknown. We reveal that DA release in mouse dorsolateral striatum, but not nucleus accumbens core, is governed by GAT-1 and GAT-3. These GATs are partly localized to astrocytes, and are enriched in dorsolateral striatum compared to accumbens core. In a mouse model of early parkinsonism, GATs are downregulated, tonic GABAergic inhibition of DA release augmented, and nigrostriatal GABA co-release attenuated. These data define previously unappreciated and important roles for GATs and astrocytes in supporting DA release in striatum, and reveal a maladaptive plasticity in early parkinsonism that impairs DA output in vulnerable striatal regions.

### Neurodegenerative movement disorders: the contribution of functional imaging [^7f7cb264]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Functional imaging such as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography provide sensitive tools to assess functional brain abnormalities associated with neurodegenerative disease. This review discusses recent findings in this field, with a focus on the detection and characterization of receptor binding and presynaptic dopamine changes in movement disorders.

Recent Findings

The classical role of positron emission tomography and radioligands such as F-dopa and C-raclopride for investigating abnormalities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic system underlying Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's disease has recently been made more powerful by the application of statistical mapping to localize changes in dopamine storage capacity and receptor binding across the whole brain at a voxel level. C-raclopride positron emission tomography provides an indirect marker of changes in levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. The application of this model in assessing dopamine changes in response to pharmacological, behavioural, motor task and magnetic stimulation in normal individuals and Parkinson's disease patients is reviewed. Recent studies using positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography to discriminate Parkinson's disease from essential tremor and Parkinsonism, the involvement of non-dopaminergic systems in Parkinson's disease and the role of cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are also discussed.

Summary

Functional imaging techniques provide insight into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, and Huntington's disease and the mechanisms of the progression of these diseases. They also play a role in assessing the efficacy of putative neuroprotective and restorative therapy, such as striatal infusions of neurotrophic factors and implants of fetal cells.

### Brain (18) F-DOPA PET and cognition in de novo Parkinson's disease [^394dd578]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of mesocortical dopaminergic pathways in the cognitive function of patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) needs to be further clarified.

Methods

The study groups comprised 15 drug-naive patients with de novo PD and 10 patients with essential tremor (controls) who underwent (18)F-DOPA PET (static acquisition, normalization on mean cerebellar counts) and an extended neuropsychological test battery. Factor analysis with varimax rotation was applied to the neuropsychological test scores, to yield five factors from 16 original scores, which explained 82% of the total variance. Correlations between cognitive factors and (18)F-DOPA uptake were assessed with SPM8, taking age and gender as nuisance variables.

Results

(18)F-DOPA uptake was significantly lower in PD patients than in controls in the bilateral striatum, mainly in the more affected (right) hemisphere, and in a small right temporal region. Significant positive correlations were found only in PD patients between the executive factor and (18)F-DOPA uptake in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, between the verbal fluency factor and (18)F-DOPA uptake in left BA 46 and the bilateral striatum, and between the visuospatial factor and (18)F-DOPA uptake in the left ACC and bilateral striatum. No correlations were found between (18)F-DOPA uptake and either the verbal memory factor or the abstraction-working memory factor.

Conclusion

These data clarify the role of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathways in cognitive function in early PD, highlighting the medial frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, and left BA 46 as the main sites of cortical correlation with executive and language functions.

### Neuroimaging in Parkinson's disease: focus on substantia nigra and nigro-striatal projection [^9944a3e0]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on clinical features; however, unmet need is an imaging signature for Parkinson disease and the early differential diagnosis with atypical parkinsonisms. A summary of the molecular imaging and MRI recent evidences for Parkinson disease diagnosis will be presented in this review.

Recent Findings

The nigro-striatal dysfunction explored by dopamine transporter imaging is not a mandatory diagnostic criterion for Parkinson disease, recent evidence supported its utility as in-vivo proof of degenerative parkinsonisms, and there might be compensatory mechanisms leading to an early overestimation. The visualization of abnormalities in substantia nigra by MRI has been recently described as sensitive and specific tool for Parkinson disease diagnosis, even in preclinical conditions, whereas it is not useful for distinguishing between Parkinson disease and atypical parkinsonisms. The relationship between the nigral anatomical changes, evaluated as structural alterations or neuromelanin signal decrease and the dopaminergic nigro-striatal function needs to be further clarified.

Summary

With the hopeful advent of potential neuroprotective drugs for PD, it is crucial to have imaging measures that are able to detect at risk subjects. Moreover it is desirable to increase the knowledge about which measure better predicts the probability and the time of clinical conversion to PD.

### EFNS / MDS-ES / ENS recommendations for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^9bf8a1eb]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, EFNS/ENS 2013 guidelines recommend to obtain DaTscan in the presence of significant diagnostic uncertainty, such as parkinsonism associated with neuroleptic exposure, and atypical tremor manifestations, such as isolated unilateral postural tremor. Consider obtaining MIBG/SPECT cardiac uptake to identify patients with PD and patients with multiple system atrophy.

### Dopaminergic function and dopamine transporter binding assessed with positron emission tomography in parkinson disease… [^c1134718]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Uptake of 18F-dopa may be up-regulated in early PD, suggesting a compensatory increase of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopaminergic terminals. Positron emission tomography dopamine transporter ligands and 18F-dopa give complementary information on the presynaptic status of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and might be associated to investigate the efficacy of neuroprotective treatments in PD. The binding of both tracers is reduced in parkinsonian patients, but this reduction is significantly greater with 76Br-FE-CBT than with 18F-dopa. Specifically, in the putamen of drug-naive patients with early PD, 18F-dopa uptake is decreased to 63% of control values on average, whereas 76Br-FE-CBT BnP is reduced to 43% of control values. As in the present study, it was reported that the binding of the DAT ligand was significantly lower than the 18F-dopa uptake in the putamen of patients with early PD.

12, 13 Altogether, these results confirm that DAT ligands are more sensitive than 18F-dopa to detect the early stages. Comparatively, 18F-dopa uptake seems to be up-regulated in the surviving dopaminergic terminals of patients with early PD. 12, 13 The striatal 18F-dopa uptake depends on the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway6 and on the activity of the aromatic L. Recently, Lee et al12 found that up-regulation of 18F-dopa uptake was on average 18% of control values compared with DAT ligand binding in untreated patients with early PD and 12% in patients with PD who have reached stage II to III of the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Our patients with advanced PD are between stages III and V on this scale, and the apparent difference between 18F-dopa and 76Br-FE-CBT uptake in the putamen is only 6%.

The present results suggest that the motor abilities of patients with PD depend more on the functional status of putamen dopaminergic terminals, measured using 18F-dopa, than on the density of these terminals, evaluated using a DAT ligand. This result, emphasizing the functional meaning of 18F-dopa uptake, is also in line with the hypothesis that the compensatory increase of dopamine synthesis in the early stages of PD might be responsible for delaying motor symptom onset in these patients.

### International consensus on clinical use of presynaptic dopaminergic positron emission tomography imaging in parkinsonism [^9e0ed77c]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Presynaptic dopaminergic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging serves as an essential tool in diagnosing and differentiating patients with suspected parkinsonism, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases. The PET tracers most commonly used at the present time mainly target dopamine transporters (DAT), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and vesicular monoamine type 2 (VMAT2). However, established standards for the imaging procedure and interpretation of presynaptic dopaminergic PET imaging are still lacking. The goal of this international consensus is to help nuclear medicine practitioners procedurally perform presynaptic dopaminergic PET imaging.

Method

A multidisciplinary task group formed by experts from various countries discussed and approved the consensus for presynaptic dopaminergic PET imaging in parkinsonism, focusing on standardized recommendations, procedures, interpretation, and reporting.

Conclusion

This international consensus and practice guideline will help to promote the standardized use of presynaptic dopaminergic PET imaging in parkinsonism. It will become an international standard for this purpose in clinical practice.

### Clinical and molecular characterisation of hereditary dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome: an observational cohort and experimental study [^dcbed05d]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome is the first identified parkinsonian disorder caused by genetic alterations of the dopamine transporter. We describe a cohort of children with mutations in the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) with the aim to improve clinical and molecular characterisation, reduce diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis, and provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms.

Methods

11 children with a biochemical profile suggestive of dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome were enrolled from seven paediatric neurology centres in the UK, Germany, and the USA from February, 2009, and studied until June, 2010. The syndrome was characterised by detailed clinical phenotyping, biochemical and neuroradiological studies, and SLC6A3 mutation analysis. Mutant constructs of human dopamine transporter were used for in-vitro functional analysis of dopamine uptake and cocaine-analogue binding.

Findings

Children presented in infancy (median age 2.5 months, range 0.5–7) with either hyperkinesia (n = 5), parkinsonism (n = 4), or a mixed hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorder (n = 2). Seven children had been initially misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy. During childhood, patients developed severe parkinsonism-dystonia associated with an eye movement disorder and pyramidal tract features. All children had raised ratios of homovanillic acid to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, of range 5.0–13.2 (normal range 1.3–4.0). Homozygous or compound heterozygous SLC6A3 mutations were detected in all cases. Loss of function in all missense variants was recorded from in-vitro functional studies, and was supported by the findings of single photon emission CT DaTSCAN imaging in one patient, which showed complete loss of dopamine transporter activity in the basal nuclei.

Interpretation

Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome is a newly recognised, autosomal recessive disorder related to impaired dopamine transporter function. Careful characterisation of patients with this disorder should provide novel insights into the complex role of dopamine homoeostasis in human disease, and understanding of the pathophysiology could help to drive drug development.

### PET-MRI biomarkers reveal efficacy of a novel NLRP3 inhibitor in Parkinson's disease models [^e5615b08]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is one of the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorders, with no effective treatments to modify its progression. Microglial-driven neuroinflammation, mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, plays a key role in disease onset and progression. The NLRP3 inflammasome is upregulated in microglia from Parkinson's disease patients and activated by oxidative stress and a-synuclein aggregates, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal death. MCC950, the first described specific NLRP3 inhibitor, has shown promise in Parkinson's disease models but is limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetics and safety, hindering its clinical development. Here, we developed a novel NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, MCC7840 (also known as Inzomelid or Emlenoflast), and utilised clinically relevant PET-MRI imaging biomarkers to assess its therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. MCC7840 inhibited NLRP3 in human and mouse microglia with nanomolar potency, while demonstrating improved systemic exposure, half-life, brain permeability, and bioavailability compared to MCC950. In a murine NLRP3 gain-of-function model of Muckle-Wells syndrome, MCC7840 effectively inhibited mortality and demonstrated superior potency compared to MCC950. Chronic oral administration of MCC7840 protected against neuroinflammation, motor deficits, and dopamine loss in both 6-hydroxydopamine and preformed α-synuclein fibril mouse models of Parkinson's disease. Radiotracer imaging of multiple PET markers in the same mouse revealed that MCC7840 attenuated neuroinflammation ([18F]DPA-714), preserved dopamine uptake ([18F]FDOPA), mitigated dopamine transporter loss ([18F]FBCTT), and reduced blood-brain barrier leakage (gadolinium contrast MRI). Notably, MCC7840 was effective in a slowly progressing 12-month α-synuclein model, even when administered after symptom onset, 4 months post-α-synuclein injection. These findings highlight the utility of PET/MRI as a non-invasive tool to evaluate drug efficacy and support MCC7840, and other brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitors, as promising disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease, warranting future clinical investigation.

### Dopaminergic action beyond its effects on motor function: imaging studies [^d013e4fc]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Along with motor programming, it is now thought that tonic release of dopamine in the striatum acts to focus and filter non-motor activities such as working memory, implicit learning, decision making, and planning. Additionally, thresholds to painful stimuli may well be dopamine dependant. Phasic (burst) release of dopamine in the basal ganglia and frontal areas is thought to play a role in alerting organisms to novel and potentially rewarding stimuli and in mediating contextual learning. Dopamine release also drives a craving for stimuli and facilitates their enjoyment. Functional imaging can help elucidate the role of dopamine in mediating non-motor activities. The integrity of dopamine terminal function can be measured with PET and SPECT in vivo in health and Parkinson's disease (PD) and this can be correlated with performance of executive tasks. In addition, these imaging modalities allow dopamine release in response to stimuli (both rewarding and unrewarding) to be detected, as reflected by changes in D2 receptor availability to radioligands. Finally, the functional effects of dopamine deficiency and its replacement can be monitored by studying patterns of brain activation, as evidenced by regional blood flow changes. In this review, some of the insights that imaging has given us concerning the role of dopamine in non-motor functions is presented.

### GABA uptake transporters support dopamine release in dorsal striatum with maladaptive downregulation in a parkinsonism model [^d8915a0a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, the regulation of striatal GABA-DA interactions via striatal GATs and astrocytes represent loci for governing DA output as well as for maladaptive plasticity in early parkinsonism, which could also provide a novel therapeutic avenue for upregulating DA signalling in PD.

### Impaired dopamine release in Parkinson's disease [^b0fd995a]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Although imaging methods are useful to measure DA dynamics in living human brains, most techniques use indirect measurements of DA levels and none has yet directly measured DA release in early parkinsonism. For example, PET measurements of 11 C-raclopride, which competes with DA to bind to D2 receptors, may indeed report on differences in DA release. However, these measurements fundamentally report on D2 receptor availability, and so may also represent alterations in D2 receptor expression, integrity of postsynaptic projections or loss of DA from degeneration of presynaptic terminals. Likewise, differences in 18 F-DOPA measurements, a marker of presynaptic DA storage capacity, could indicate a change in the number of dopaminergic cells, but may also be influenced by alterations in DA metabolism and handling in intact neurons. Further, most of the studies performed on prodromal, preclinical or genetic carriers involve small sample sizes, are not longitudinal and rather rely upon comparisons to a nominal control cohort. Incomplete penetrance of many Parkinson's disease-associated mutations means that truly preclinical subjects cannot be confirmed without long-term follow-up. Therefore, although DA release may be defective before degeneration in Parkinson's disease patients, limitations in technology have made the study of DA release in humans challenging. Animal and human cell-based models of Parkinson's disease have been useful in closing this gap.

### Intense exercise increases dopamine transporter and neuromelanin concentrations in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease [^1132f08a]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Multimodal neuroimaging enables the visualization and quantification of multiple aspects of the dopaminergic system and its functioning in vivo. Imaging of the dopaminergic system has been used to track disease progression in PD. A recent study using the radioligand 18 F-FE-PE2I (selective for the presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) protein) demonstrated reduced DAT availability in the SN and striatum in subjects with early PD over the course of 2 years, whereas healthy age-matched controls showed no significant changes. Neuromelanin (NM) is a cytosolic neuronal pigment and an autophagic product synthesized via oxidation and polymerization of catecholamines such as dopamine. It accumulates slowly in dopaminergic neurons with ageand loss of NM is a hallmark of PD pathology. NM-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assay NM in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN. A negative correlation between motor symptom severity and NM-MRI measurements in the SN has been demonstrated in PD. In independent PD cohorts, the annual rates of decline in SN volumes were estimated using NM-MRI, suggesting a role for NM as a biomarker for disease progression in the brains of people with PD. Lastly, using iron-sensitive MRI techniques such as Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), increased ferromagnetic depositions in the SN have been demonstrated in people with PD.

In this proof-of-concept study, we imaged the effects of 6 months of high-intensity interval training on the dopaminergic system in patients with PD. Our primary outcome was the change in DAT availability in the SN and striatum, as measured with 18 F-FE-PE2I. Our secondary outcome was the change in NM concentration in the SN. We also used QSM to account for potentially confounding effects of ferromagnetic depositions on NM measurements.

### DaTQUANT: the future of diagnosing parkinson disease [^2281cb70]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurologic condition that affects the dopamine transporters in the substantia nigra of the brain. Currently, more than 10 million people are living with this disease worldwide, with thousands of newly diagnosed and undiagnosed cases added every year. The disease is difficult to differentiate from other similar disorders, as symptoms widely vary and can mimic other conditions. Classic PD symptoms may look similar to essential tremor and other parkinsonian syndromes. The 123 I-ioflupane dopamine transporter (DaT) protocol differentiates PD from essential tremor through in vivo testing with SPECT imaging. The DaT protocol commonly relies on a semiquantitative analysis and visual interpretations of the images, which may produce inaccurate results due to human error. DaTQUANT software (GE Healthcare) was created in 2013 as an adjunct processing tool with advanced quantitative uptake methods and a designated normals database for a more accurate assessment of a patient's case. DaTQUANT has proven to be a vital protocol component for an accurate differentiation of PD from essential tremor. Current use of the software has been rather limited, so a greater push for education and implementation will be key for its success.

### Dopaminergic innervation of the human striatum in Parkinson's disease [^d0163a74]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic input to the caudate nucleus and a band of putaminal tissue abutting the external globus pallidus seems well preserved on immunohistochemical staining for the dopamine transporter. Counting of dopaminergic terminals showed that terminal density in these regions in PD was the same as that in controls, which indicates that input is truly preserved and not a consequence of a compensatory upregulation of metabolism in a reduced pool of surviving terminals. When the branching pattern of dopaminergic axons coursing through the globus pallidus was examined, we found no evidence for increased axonal sprouting in PD that might have contributed to preservation of dopaminergic input to the putamen or caudate nucleus. Although terminal counting indicated that anatomic input was preserved to parts of the striatum, dopamine uptake site density in these regions was reduced significantly. This suggests that the impact of disease in these areas is more profound than was thought previously.

### Nigrostriatal dopamine transporter availability in early Parkinson's disease [^6d7ad431]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The imaging of biomarkers for characterization of dopaminergic impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is useful for diagnosis, patient stratification, and assessment of treatment outcomes. [18 F]FE-PE2I is an improved imaging tool allowing for detailed mapping of the dopamine transporter protein in the nigro-striatal system at the level of cell bodies (substantia nigra), axons, and presynaptic terminals (striatum).

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare the dopamine transporter protein loss in the presynaptic terminals to that in the cell bodies and axons in early PD patients using [18 F](E)-N-(3-iodoprop-2-enyl)-2b-carbofluoroethoxy-3b-(4'-methyl-phenyl) nortropane ([18 F]FE-PE2I) and high-resolution PET.

Methods

A total of 20 early PD patients (15 men/5 women, 62 ± 8 years) and 20 controls (15 men/5 women, 62 ± 7 years) underwent high-resolution [18 F]FE-PE2I PET. Dopamine transporter protein availability was estimated for the different nigro-striatal regions and expressed as nondisplaceable binding potential values.

Results

When compared with controls, the binding potential values in PD patients were reduced by 36% to 70% in presynaptic terminals and by 30% in cell bodies. Dopamine transporter availability along the tracts was not different between the 2 groups (controls 0.5 ± 0.1 vs PD 0.4 ± 0.1).

Conclusions

This is the first study that examines dopamine transporter protein availability in vivo within the entire nigro-striatal pathway. The results suggest that at early stages of symptomatic PD a greater loss is observed at the level of the axonal terminals when compared with cell bodies and axons of dopaminergic neurons. The findings suggest a relative preservation of cell bodies in early PD, which might be relevant for novel disease-modifying strategies. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Changes in dopamine availability in the nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopaminergic systems by gait in Parkinson's disease [^1f72c07a]. Brain (2001). Low credibility.

The basal ganglia play a role in controlling movement during gait. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the striatum and extrastriatal region in association with walking exercise in six normal subjects and seven age-matched unmedicated patients with Parkinson's disease. This was done by comparing DAT radioligand uptake in the dopaminergic projection areas after gait with that under the resting condition using a DAT probe, 11C-labelled 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane ([11C]CFT) and PET. Physiological parameters were stable during and after gait in both groups. The regions of interest method for measuring differences in [11C]CFT uptake level and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) showed that [11C]CFT uptake in the striatum (specifically the putamen) was decreased by gait to a greater extent in normal subjects, whereas a significant reduction in [11C]CFT uptake was not found in the putamen but in the caudate and orbitofrontal cortex in Parkinson's disease patients. These results are the first in vivo evidence that DAT availability is reduced in the nigrostriatal projection area by basic human behaviour, i.e.g.ait. Alterations in this availability in Parkinson's disease suggested that shifted activation in the medial striatum and the mesocortical dopaminergic system might reflect the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait.

### Asymmetric dopamine transporter loss affects cognitive and motor progression in Parkinson's disease [^adc37f01]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Asymmetric hemispheric loss of dopaminergic neurons is one of the characteristic features of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still debated if right or left asymmetry differently affects cognitive and motor progression.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the relevance of dopamine transporter (DAT) asymmetry on cognitive and motor manifestations at onset and at 4‐year progression in drug‐naïve PD.

Methods

From the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative multicenter cohort, we identified 249 right‐handed patients with PD with baseline asymmetry greater than 20% in putamen DAT binding at single‐photon emission computed tomography. A predominant putamen asymmetry was found on the left in 143 patients (PD‐left), and on the right side in 106 patients (PD‐right); we compared them with 196 healthy controls. Patients were followed longitudinally (2‐year and 4‐year visits), examining their clinical, cognitive, and imaging data.

Results

At baseline, the PD‐left group showed worse performance on the Symbol Digit Modality Test, an attention and processing‐speed test, and lower cerebrospinal fluid β‐amyloid levels than the PD‐right group. These differences were maintained at follow‐up, declining over time in both groups. By contrast, the PD‐right group showed greater motor impairment at baseline, which increased over 4 years. Striatal DAT binding decreased over time in both groups, but the PD‐right group showed a steeper decline, particularly during the first 2‐year follow‐up. Putaminal asymmetry assessed at baseline was maintained over time.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that hemispheric asymmetric dopaminergic denervation influences PD cognitive and motor performance as well as progression. Predominant right hemisphere nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss is associated with greater motor severity, whereas more pronounced left hemisphere denervation affects cognitive manifestations at onset and their progression. © 2021 The Authors.

### Intense exercise increases dopamine transporter and neuromelanin concentrations in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease [^2ce94052]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Exercise has been reported to slow the clinical progression of PD. We evaluated the dopaminergic system of patients with mild and early PD before and after a six-month program of intense exercise. Using 18 F-FE-PE2I PET imaging, we measured dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the striatum and substantia nigra. Using NM-MRI, we evaluated the neuromelanin content in the substantia nigra. Exercise reversed the expected decrease in DAT availability into a significant increase in both the substantia nigra and putamen. Exercise also reversed the expected decrease in neuromelanin concentration in the substantia nigra into a significant increase. These findings suggest improved functionality in the remaining dopaminergic neurons after exercise. Further research is needed to validate our findings and to pinpoint the source of any true neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects of exercise in PD in large clinical trials.

dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome is the first identified parkinsonian disorder caused by genetic alterations of the dopamine transporter. We describe a cohort of children with mutations in the gene encoding the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) with the aim to improve clinical and molecular characterisation, reduce diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis, and provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms.

children presented in infancy (median age 2.5 months, range 0.5–7) with either hyperkinesia (n = 5), parkinsonism (n = 4), or a mixed hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorder (n = 2). Seven children had been initially misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy. During childhood, patients developed severe parkinsonism-dystonia associated with an eye movement disorder and pyramidal tract features. All children had raised ratios of homovanillic acid to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, of range 5.0–13.2 (normal range 1.3–4.0). Homozygous or compound heterozygous SLC6A3 mutations were detected in all cases. Loss of function in all missense variants was recorded from in-vitro functional studies, and was supported by the findings of single photon emission CT DaTSCAN imaging in one patient, which showed complete loss of dopamine transporter activity in the basal nuclei.

Interpretation

dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome is a newly recognised, autosomal recessive disorder related to impaired dopamine transporter function. Careful characterisation of patients with this disorder should provide novel insights into the complex role of dopamine homoeostasis in human disease, and understanding of the pathophysiology could help to drive drug development.

### Stability and accuracy of a diagnosis of parkinson disease over 10 years [^b1431aa6]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 30 years, DAT imaging, with SPECT or PET, has been used as a method to enhance diagnostic accuracy for PD. In our cohort, 36.2% of patients underwent DAT imaging, indicating a high usage rate. The results indicate that patients with revised diagnoses underwent DAT imaging more frequently than those with stable PD diagnoses. This suggests 2 possibilities: first, DAT imaging may be prompted by atypical clinical features or progression in patients with altered diagnoses; second, DAT imaging may influence diagnostic decisions, reflecting its utility in differentiating parkinsonian syndromes, especially ET, VP, and DIP from PD. The correlation between the timing of DAT imaging and the date of diagnosis alteration supports the role of DAT imaging in influencing clinical decisions. Although DAT imaging can assist clinicians in making informed decisions and increase their confidence in revising diagnoses, its highly uneven global availability underscores the need for more accessible diagnostic methods. In many cases of our study, clinical follow-up visits and high-dose levodopa tests provided sufficient information regarding the stability of PD diagnosis, often rendering additional DAT imaging unnecessary. DAT scans are not typically necessary for the standard clinical diagnosis of PD unless there are unusual clinical features that warrant further investigation. Ultimately, clinicians must weigh the risks and benefits to determine the best diagnostic method for each patient, recognizing that imaging, follow-up, and pharmacologic trials can be complementary rather than mutually exclusive. We also acknowledge the promising potential of biomarkers in aiding PD diagnosis, such as the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (SAA), although it remains in the developmental stage and has limitations. Although SAA may not ultimately be the ideal biomarker, we believe that a cost-effective, globally accessible diagnostic biomarker could improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in regions with limited access to neurologists and movement disorder specialists.

### Sprouting of dopamine terminals and altered dopamine release and uptake in parkinsonian dyskinaesia [^134bb00c]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Failed storage capacity, leading to pulsatile delivery of dopamine (DA) in the striatum, is used to explain the emergence of 'wearing off' and dyskinaesia in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we show that surviving DA neurons in 6-OHDA lesioned rats sprout to re-innervate the striatum, and maintain terminal density until approximately 60% of neurons are lost. We demonstrate that DA terminal density correlates with baseline striatal DA concentration ([DA]). Electrochemical and synaptosome studies in 6-OHDA lesioned rats and primates suggest that impaired striatal DA re-uptake and increased DA release from medial forebrain bundle fibres contribute to maintaining striatal DA levels. In lesioned rats where terminal density fell by 60% or more, L-DOPA administration increased striatal DA levels markedly. The striatal [DA] produced by L-DOPA directly correlated with the extent of dyskinaesia, suggesting that dyskinaesia was related to high striatal [DA]. While sprouting and decreased dopamine uptake transporter function would be expected to contribute to the marked increase in L-DOPA induced [DA], the increased [DA] was most marked when DAergic fibres were > 60% denervated, suggesting that other release sites, such as serotonergic fibres might be contributing. In conclusion, the extent of dyskinaesia was directly proportional to the extent of DA terminal denervation and levels of extra-synaptic striatal DA. We propose that sprouting of DA terminals and decreased dopamine uptake transporter function prevent the appearance of Parkinsonian symptoms until about 60% loss of nigral neurons, but also contribute to dysregulated striatal DA release that is responsible for the emergence of dyskinaesia and 'wearing off'.

### A systematic review of the potential effects of medications and drugs of abuse on dopamine transporter imaging using [I] I-FP-CIT SPECT in routine practice [^6ca059b0]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is a diagnostic tool to support the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) by determining if there is loss of functional nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The application helps to differentiate between parkinsonian syndromes characterised by dopaminergic degeneration, such as PD, from movement disorders not characterised by dopaminergic degeneration, such as essential tremor. In routine practice, [123 I]I-FP-CIT (or [123 I]ioflupane; marketed as DaTSCAN) is frequently used for DAT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. This radiopharmaceutical is also used to differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease and is one of the recommended biomarkers to aid the diagnosis of DLB in the current 4 th consensus criteria for the diagnosis of DLB. The role of DAT imaging in neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and DLB, in clinical practice and research has been described in detail in a recent review by Wallert et al.

In 2008, we published on the possible effects of medication on the visual interpretation of DAT imaging in routine clinical practice. This publication has been well received, as this review has been cited more than 100 times (118; Web of Science citations in November 2022), and the information is also regularly used in guidelines to address the important clinical question of which medications or drugs of abuse should be considered for withdrawal before acquiring DAT imaging in routine practice to prevent misinterpretation due to the use of these medications. Because this original publication was published almost 15 years ago, we were interested in reviewing the literature published since 2008 to evaluate whether additional information on this topic has become available.

### Asymmetric dopamine transporter loss affects cognitive and motor progression in Parkinson's disease [^9175a471]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymmetric hemispheric loss of dopaminergic neurons is one of the characteristic features of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still debated if right or left asymmetry differently affects cognitive and motor progression.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the relevance of dopamine transporter (DAT) asymmetry on cognitive and motor manifestations at onset and at 4-year progression in drug-naïve PD.

Methods

From the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative multicenter cohort, we identified 249 right-handed patients with PD with baseline asymmetry greater than 20% in putamen DAT binding at single-photon emission computed tomography. A predominant putamen asymmetry was found on the left in 143 patients (PD-left), and on the right side in 106 patients (PD-right); we compared them with 196 healthy controls. Patients were followed longitudinally (2-year and 4-year visits), examining their clinical, cognitive, and imaging data.

Results

At baseline, the PD-left group showed worse performance on the Symbol Digit Modality Test, an attention and processing-speed test, and lower cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid levels than the PD-right group. These differences were maintained at follow-up, declining over time in both groups. By contrast, the PD-right group showed greater motor impairment at baseline, which increased over 4years. Striatal DAT binding decreased over time in both groups, but the PD-right group showed a steeper decline, particularly during the first 2-year follow-up. Putaminal asymmetry assessed at baseline was maintained over time.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that hemispheric asymmetric dopaminergic denervation influences PD cognitive and motor performance as well as progression. Predominant right hemisphere nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss is associated with greater motor severity, whereas more pronounced left hemisphere denervation affects cognitive manifestations at onset and their progression. © 2021 The Authors.

### EANM practice guideline / SNMMI procedure standard for dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes 1.0 [^2e2a200d]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). High credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) versus Alzheimer's disease (AD) — DAT SPECT shows that striatal binding is usually normal or only mildly diminished in AD and is significantly decreased in DLB. Given its high specificity (20% higher with respect to clinical diagnosis), the revised criteria for the diagnosis of DLB further reinforced the role of DAT SPECT considering it as a diagnostic biomarker. Approximately 10% of patients who met pathologic criteria for DLB can show a normal DAT SPECT at the time of the clinical diagnosis, possibly becoming abnormal after 1.5–2 years.

### The role of 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT in the differential diagnosis of parkinson and tremor syndromes: a critical assessment of 125 cases [^1f46131f]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

(123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT is useful in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and tremor syndromes. Recently, there have been reports on normal nigrostriatal uptake of radio ligands in PD patients, referred to as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDDs). Furthermore, a dopaminergic deficit has been described in some cases of different tremor types. We sought to clarify the occurrence of SWEDDs in PD and a possible association of various tremor types with PD. We performed a retrospective case analysis of 125 patients with diagnostically uncertain Parkinsonian or non-Parkinsonian tremor syndromes with clinical assessments and (123)I-FP-CIT-SPECT. A total of 36/40 (90%) patients with the predominant clinical feature of a postural and/or kinetic tremor showed normal DAT SPECT; 73/85 (86%) with predominant clinical symptoms of PD showed abnormal DAT SPECT with lower overall radio ligand uptake and a significant asymmetry contralateral to the clinically more affected side. In all, 4/40 (10%) of non-Parkinsonian tremor patients had abnormal DAT SPECT, but no corresponding asymmetry of radio ligand uptake. Probable essential tremor was considered clinically in follow-up assessments although final diagnosis of these four tremor cases remains inconclusive. A total of 12/85 (14%) clinically suspected PD patients had normal DAT SPECT (SWEDDs). Clinical reassessment identified two patients with dystonic tremor. Five patients with a positive response to levodopa remained unclear. In four cases of suspected PD with normal DAT SPECT, non-neurologic diseases were identified. One case showed a complete and spontaneous remission of symptoms. DAT SPECT offers an objective method to confirm or exclude a dopaminergic deficit in tremor predominant parkinsonism for clinically inconclusive cases. There was no evidence of a decrease in DAT binding in the majority of patients with postural and/or kinetic tremor. The striatal asymmetry index is a further helpful tool for differentiating PD from non-PD tremor syndromes.

### [¹ ² ³ I] FP-CIT SPECT (DaTSCAN) may be a useful tool to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and vascular or drug-induced parkinsonisms: a meta-analysis [^39aff3ba]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from secondary parkinsonian syndromes is crucial since their management and prognosis differ considerably. Functional imaging of the dopaminergic pathway by means of [¹²³I]FP-CIT SPECT (DaTSCAN) might be useful in this regard, but its role is still controversial. The accuracy of DaTSCAN in the differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease and vascular or drug-induced parkinsonism was therefore systematically reviewed.

Methods

MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched for studies aiming to determine accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, positive and negative likelihood ratios) of DaTSCAN in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and vascular or drug-induced parkinsonism.

Results

Five studies were included. Pooled accuracy measures in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and vascular or drug-induced parkinsonism were relatively high, with sensitivity and specificity values above 85% and 80%, respectively.

Conclusions

DaTSCAN might accurately differentiate between early Parkinson's disease and secondary parkinsonian conditions, namely vascular or drug-induced, in patients with clinically unclear parkinsonism. However, all the studies reviewed here show several methodological limits, which prevent definitive conclusions on the role of DaTSCAN being drawn in this context. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and definitely evaluate the utility of DaTSCAN in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and vascular or drug-induced parkinsonism.

### Dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) use in the diagnosis and clinical management of parkinsonism: an 8-year retrospective study [^aaf5b295]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study concludes that DaT imaging is useful for supporting the correct diagnosis and clinical management for patients with clinically indeterminate Parkinsonism. There was a reasonable degree of consistency between clinicians' pre-scan diagnosis and DaT scan results. However, management plans were not always initiated immediately after receiving the scan result, which was likely due to other factors, including disease severity and the disease impact. More research on assessing the effect of DaT scans on patient outcomes, including quality of life and symptom control, should therefore be undertaken.

### Reply: Parkinson's disease in GTP cyclohydrolase 1 mutation carriers [^8d86dec1]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

We believe that one of the outstanding questions is whether patients with DOPA-responsive dystonia eventually develop nigral neurodegeneration, or whether neurodegeneration can be avoided by dopaminergic replacement therapy. Answering this question will help to understand to what extent low dopamine levels play a role in nigral cell death, with obvious therapeutic implications for asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants.

Dopaminergic imaging studies performed in a few cases with classic DOPA-responsive dystonia (mostly genetically not confirmed) have shown no evidence of reduced nigrostriatal innervation. This is consistent with post-mortem analysis of four extra cases showing normal nigral cell count. However, report that six cases with DOPA-responsive dystonia displayed modest but significant reduction in the uptake of 18 F-fluorodopa into both caudates and putamen. Furthermore, report that in DOPA-responsive dystonia cases parkinsonian signs are a relatively common residual motor sign following treatment, possibly suggesting underlying neurodegeneration.

With regards to this, the case report ofis of great interest. They describe a 41-year-old patient carrying a known pathogenic GCH1 variant (p.Y75S) with onset of classic DOPA-responsive dystonia at age 11. He was treated with-DOPA (300 mg/day) from the age of 20 with good and sustained response. At age 41, because of rapid recurrence of dystonia after skipping a-DOPA dose, dopaminergic imaging (123 I-FP-CIT SPECT) was performed and showed severe bilateral and asymmetric reduction of putaminal tracer uptake, a pattern typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, clinical examination, performed after withdrawing-DOPA, revealed purely dystonic features without any obvious sign of parkinsonism.

In agreement with the interpretation of, we believe that this case may indeed represent a case with overlapping DOPA-responsive dystonia and asymptomatic, as yet, nigrostriatal degeneration, possibly arguing against a neuroprotective role of dopamine replacement in GCH1 mutation carriers.

### Molecular and cellular determinants of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease [^84a5e2a9]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

y years, MDS-UPDRS Movement disorders society-Unified Parkinson's Disease rating scale, LEDD L-Dopa equivalent daily dose, t-α-syn total α-synuclein, CSF Cerebrospinal fluid, ng/ml nanograms/milliliter, MEP Motor evoked potential.

Uptake values of DaTSCAN Ⓡ were available for 50 patients. DaTSCAN binds with high affinity to the DAT on the presynaptic nigrostriatal terminals. It is the only agent approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration for detecting dopaminergic neuron terminal loss in the striatum in patients with parkinsonism. In addition to supporting a clinical diagnosis, semiquantitative analysis of the uptake values has been studied as a disease progression biomarker in PD. Lower uptake values seem to be associated with higher motor-related disability and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression. However, the relationship between DAT binding and PD progression remains unclear. Interestingly, in our cohort, patients with LID showed higher putaminal dopaminergic denervation at diagnosis, measured with semiquantitative analysis of DaTSCAN uptake values (Fig. 5A, B). This association also remained significant after adjusting for age, LEDD, and disease duration (p = 0.032) in a logistic regression model. Moreover, in a multiple regression model, DaTSCAN uptake values in both putamen and caudate, along with age of onset, significantly predict the amount of LID, quantified with Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) score, while disease duration and LEDD do not seem to play a role, as shown in supplementary table (R square 0.79, p = 0.021).

### Locus coeruleus integrity and the effect of atomoxetine on response inhibition in Parkinson's disease [^624d920e]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study aimed for noradrenergic modulation of the SSRT. Atomoxetine increases extracellular noradrenaline levels across the brain via its actions at the noradrenaline transporter, in particular increasing levels in the prefrontal cortex by 3-fold. However, atomoxetine may also increase extracellular dopamine levels, particularly in prefrontal cortex. Because of the relative sparsity of dopamine transporters in the prefrontal cortex, a portion of dopamine uptake is mediated by the noradrenaline transporter. In this way, improved response inhibition under atomoxetine in Parkinson's disease might potentially also reflect elevated prefrontal dopamine levels. The respective roles of noradrenergic versus dopaminergic modulation over the SSRT is not fully resolved. Some studies in rodents and humans have implicated a selective link between noradrenergic transmission and action cancellation: increasing dopamine selectively does not affect the SSRT. This work has been taken in concert with studies using agents that non-selectively change both dopamine and noradrenaline and do affect the SSRT. For example, haloperidol and methylphenidate are shown to modulate the SSRT, having both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic effects. One interpretation of this body of work is that the effects of the non-selective drugs are primarily driven by their noradrenergic actions, given that selective dopamine manipulations do not reliably modulate SSRT. However, some studies have found modulation of the SSRT using relatively selective dopamine drugs, and dopamine receptor availability is associated with SSRT performance. The specificity of noradrenergic versus dopaminergic modulation of the SSRT is not fully elucidated. These two closely related neurotransmitters share a common biosynthetic pathway. They can be co-released from the same terminalsand both modulate goal-directed behaviour. Although we propose that the principal effect of atomoxetine on SSRT is mediated via noradrenergic mechanisms, dopaminergic effects may also contribute.

In practical terms, a key question is whether 'noradrenergic' drugs offer a useful strategy to treat inhibitory control deficits. The association we have shown between locus coeruleus integrity and the change in SSRT under atomoxetine suggests a causal association between the noradrenergic system and action cancellation in Parkinson's disease. Our post hoc supplementary analyses with brain volume and substantia nigra integrity showed these covariates did not influence that association. This indicates a degree of specificity for the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system's role in the SSRT in Parkinson's disease. However, future cross-over studies using specific noradrenergic versus dopaminergic agents would be beneficial to resolve residual ambiguity. Our current results point towards atomoxetine as a useful strategy to treat inhibitory deficits in Parkinson's disease, in the context of appropriate stratification using locus coeruleus integrity.

### Deep learning regressor model based on nigrosome MRI in parkinson syndrome effectively predicts striatal dopamine transporter-SPECT uptake [^1a3e4c9d]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our deep learning-based regressor model can quantitatively predict striatal DaT uptake based on 3 T SMWI in patients with Parkinsonism. The degree of decrease in striatal DaT uptake can be predicted using nigrosome MRI, making non-invasive 3 T SMWI both a diagnostic indicator and disease monitoring tool for Parkinsonism. Notably, the high attention regions on the attention maps were correlated with the regions of presenting nigral hyperintensity from the nigrosome-1; therefore, we can assume that the degree of the remaining nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was primarily used for the network to predict striatal DaT uptake. Until recently, the quantitative assessment of Parkinsonism using MRI has mainly focused on the use of neuromelanin MRI, rather than nigrosome MRI. The area and contrast ratio of T1 high-signal neuromelanin pigmentation in the SN decreased in patients with Parkinsonism, in correlation with striatal DaT uptake. The area of T1 high-signal neuromelanin-rich SN is easier to segment and measure than the more irregular and smaller shape of nigral hyperintensity, leading to several deep learning-based analyses of the neuromelanin-rich SN in Parkinsonism and the prodromal phase. Nigrosome MRI can be utilized to diagnose Parkinsonism based on the loss of nigral hyperintensity, but the quantitative correlation between nigral hyperintensity and DaT uptake cannot be performed, while the decrease in the area and the signal of the neuromelanin-rich area can be quantitatively correlated with DaT uptake but is difficult to utilize for the individual diagnosis of Parkinsonism. However, as our current study has provided a quantitative analysis of SMWI-based nigrosome imaging in correlation with DaT uptake using a deep learning-based regressor model, the overall role of MRI in assessing Parkinsonism can be expanded by covering individual diagnosis, quantification, and correlation with DaT imaging, and even monitoring disease progression.

### The basics of PET molecular imaging in neurodegenerative disorders with dementia and / or parkinsonism [^fd2fd97b]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although general concepts about the usefulness of PET neuroimaging in clinical practice and research are generally well-known, the details of imaging performance and interpretation are usually not familiar to prescribers and practitioners. Consequently, the aim of this review is to revise the standards of PET imaging in neurodegenerative disorders with dementia and/or parkinsonism. In particular, we will address the practical issues related to image procedures and interpretation, including image reading (normal and disease-related patterns) and quantification. In addition, we will also examine the potential pitfalls and artefacts that may arise in this process.

This review is structured according to the PET biomarkers that form the basis of this imaging technique, targeting the different molecular pathways involved in neurodegeneration and providing an overview of the different pathological processes and complementary information. We focus on the PET radiotracers that are currently available on the market and have a role in clinical practice in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment and/or parkinsonism, and the parameters that these radiotracers show: Protein aggregation (amyloid and tau PET imaging), neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration (2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy — glucose [18 F]FDG) and presynaptic dopaminergic activity (L-6-[18F]fluorodopa PET, DAT SPECT, and PET).

### Dopamine transporter imaging as objective monitoring biomarker in Parkinson's disease [^ca8b15f3]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Validation in more diverse clinical cohorts is needed to increase the generalizability of our findings and account for potential additional confounding factors in the relationship between the magnitude of DaT signal reduction and motor symptom severity. Whereas the PPMI database provides an exceptionally large dataset with longitudinal neuroimaging data, it primarily comprises young and mildly affected patients. However, there is a need to explore the capability of DaT availability as a monitoring biomarker across all disease stages. Additionally, our analysis was limited to investigating linear disease trajectories, given the limited number of DaT‐SPECT assessments of each patient due to radiation exposure. Despite supporting evidence suggesting a linear increase in MDS‐UPDRS‐III scores over a 5‐year follow‐up period, accounting for nonlinearity might further enhance monitoring accuracy.

Findings (report content for presynaptic dopaminergic imaging) — the report should provide visual impression of striatal binding compared with background with details on caudate nuclei and putamina, noting any significant asymmetries as mild asymmetry may occur in healthy individuals; criteria used for interpretation should be described (visual versus semiquantitative assessment or comparison with normal database), signal to noise ratio has to be commented, and extra-striatal uptake should be reported; if semiquantitative analysis for dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT is performed, report the values; comment findings in light of relevant anatomic changes on CT or MRI, list limitations including movement or concomitant medication and potential drug interferences, and address the pertinent clinical issues raised in the request.

### Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: decreased striatal dopamine transporter levels [^c66a1af7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

This study is limited by the small sample size and mixed ICDs. Larger studies specifically focusing on punding behaviours may be indicated to differentiate underlying mechanisms from ICDs. As the study is cross sectional, we cannot determine whether the decreased DAT is secondary to the dopaminergic medication or is a predisposing risk factor. Further research focusing on subtype differences or longitudinal studies is indicated. Assessing the relative contribution of sensitivity of the D2 autoreceptor and DAT levels to the enhanced release of dopamine would also be indicated.

We show that PD+ICD subjects have lower DAT binding compared to PD−ICD subjects. An effect on DAT regulation is consistent with observations in substance use disorders. Decreased reuptake may account for some of the enhancement in dopamine activity beyond that of dopamine release and may also contribute to the behavioural effects.

### EANM practice guideline / SNMMI procedure standard for dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes 1.0 [^284bca5a]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). High credibility.

EANM/SNMMI dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes — this joint practice guideline was developed collaboratively and its goal is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners in recommending, performing, interpreting, and reporting dopaminergic imaging results. Nuclear medicine investigations can assess both presynaptic and postsynaptic function, and prior procedural guidelines exist for dopamine transporter imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 2009 and 2011 and for D2 SPECT in 2009. Since those publications, details on acquisition protocols and simplified quantification methods are now available for dopamine transporter imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), including recently developed fluorinated tracers; additionally, [18F]fluorodopa PET is used in some centers for the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism although procedural guidelines defining standard [18F]fluorodopa imaging are still lacking. These emerging issues are addressed in the present procedural guidelines for dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes.
