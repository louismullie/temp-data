## Question

causes of split painful toe nails

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of split painful toenails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and the clinical significance of "split" versus "cracked" or "splitting". Then, I should categorize etiologies into congenital, traumatic/mechanical, infectious, inflammatory/systemic, and neoplastic. Next, I will prioritize the most common and clinically urgent causes, and finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and when to escalate to imaging or biopsy, making sure I verify each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misclassify the problem. "Split" can mean a longitudinal fissure or division of the nail plate, which is different from distal lamellar splitting (onychoschizia) and from complete nail plate division into two plates, as seen with double little toenails; I need to keep these entities distinct because their causes and treatments differ substantially [^eecb05f4] [^aa64b893].

> I will now examine congenital and developmental causes, starting with the double little toenail, because it is a classic cause of a painful split fifth toenail. Wait, let me verify the key features: it is often bilateral, may be hereditary, and presents with two nail plates separated by a longitudinal furrow; histology shows two independent matrices, and radiographs can occasionally reveal a Y-shaped distal phalanx, which helps distinguish it from other causes of splitting [^eecb05f4] [^6a8e7a07] [^8d3be37d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all splits being congenital. I need to check for traumatic and mechanical etiologies, which are actually the most common drivers of toenail dystrophy and splitting. Repeated microtrauma from ill-fitting shoes, hallux valgus, Morton's toe, and occupational or athletic stress can cause longitudinal ridging, splitting, onycholysis, and even onychomadesis; I should confirm that addressing footwear and biomechanics is essential to prevent recurrence after treatment [^2a2b40a8].

> Next, I should review infectious causes, especially onychomycosis, because it can distort the nail plate and lead to splitting and pain. Let me verify the prevalence and diagnostic caveat: onychomycosis accounts for roughly half of dystrophic nails, but trauma-induced dystrophy is common and can mimic fungus; thus, I need to ensure mycologic confirmation before labeling a dystrophic split nail as fungal, and I should remember that topical efinaconazole is FDA-approved for mild-to-moderate disease while terbinafine remains first-line for more extensive or dermatophyte-confirmed cases [^90cc0204] [^623a44dd] [^2121de69] [^94a315d4].

> I will now consider inflammatory and systemic diseases that can cause painful nail splitting. Nail lichen planus produces longitudinal ridging, splitting, thinning, and can progress to pterygium and anonychia; I should confirm that histopathology shows a lichenoid interface dermatitis when the diagnosis is uncertain, and I need to remember that pterygium signals severe disease and portends permanent nail loss if not treated promptly [^d72772cd] [^f4e2e54d]. But wait, what if the patient has psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis? Nail psoriasis can cause onycholysis, ridging, and splitting, and in inflammatory arthritis, systemic therapy may be indicated when multiple nails are involved, so I should screen for joint symptoms and consider dermatology/rheumatology input [^d94f95fb] [^dd8c599b].

> Let me think about neoplastic and structural lesions that can split the nail and cause focal pain. Subungual exostosis is a benign bony outgrowth that elevates and splits the nail plate, often on the great toe, and is best confirmed with radiography; excision of the cartilaginous cap is curative, though recurrence can occur if incompletely removed, so I should verify imaging before planning surgery [^98371126] [^d171d39e]. I should also keep in mind that glomus tumors and other matrix neoplasms can cause longitudinal erythronychia with distal splitting and exquisite pain; MRI or targeted ultrasound may help when the diagnosis is unclear, and excision is typically curative [^3b4d462c] [^bfcb5703].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "retronychia" might be a common cause of splitting, but I should double-check that. Retronychia is primarily a proximal nail fold disorder with granulation tissue and a doubled proximal plate that causes pain, not a classic longitudinal split of the plate; so I need to correct that assumption and keep retronychia in the differential for proximal nail pain rather than for a split nail per se [^c5499cd8].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm the basics: inspect the nail plate, folds, and periungual skin; ask about trauma, footwear, and family history; and palpate for masses or tenderness. If a double little toenail is suspected, radiographs can reveal bony anomalies and support the diagnosis; if a subungual mass or exostosis is suspected, plain radiographs are appropriate; if a glomus tumor or other soft-tissue lesion is suspected, MRI or ultrasound can assist, though clinical suspicion remains paramount [^6a8e7a07] [^98371126] [^bfcb5703]. I should confirm onychomycosis with KOH, histology, or culture when the presentation is atypical or before committing to systemic therapy, and I should biopsy the matrix if I suspect lichen planus or other inflammatory matrix disease, especially when pterygium or progressive dystrophy is present [^623a44dd] [^d72772cd].

> Finally, I need to ensure management aligns with etiology. For double little toenails, partial avulsion with phenol matrixectomy of the accessory plate is effective when symptomatic; for traumatic dystrophy, footwear modification and biomechanical correction are key; for onychomycosis, confirm the diagnosis and treat with topical or oral antifungals per guideline severity; for lichen planus, intralesional or systemic steroids and calcineurin inhibitors may be needed; and for subungual exostosis or glomus tumor, surgical excision is curative, ideally after radiologic confirmation to plan the approach [^301a6621] [^2a2b40a8] [^94a315d4] [^d72772cd] [^98371126] [^bfcb5703].

---

Split painful toenails most often result from **mechanical trauma** (tight shoes, repetitive impact, improper trimming) [^2a2b40a8] and **onychomycosis** (fungal infection) [^623a44dd], both of which cause nail plate splitting and pain. Other causes include **psoriasis** [^d94f95fb], lichen planus [^d72772cd], and congenital anomalies such as double little toenail [^eecb05f4]; less commonly, subungual exostosis [^98371126], glomus tumor [^bfcb5703], or medications (e.g. chemotherapy) [^3f51347d] are implicated. Evaluation should include a focused history, exam, and testing for fungus [^5de2211d]; management targets the cause — footwear modification, antifungals, or surgery (partial nail avulsion with phenol matrixectomy) [^e447b92b] for refractory cases [^e4e9a37c].

---

## Mechanical trauma and repetitive stress

Mechanical trauma is the **most common cause** of split painful toenails, especially in the great toe [^2a2b40a8]. Key contributors include:

- **Ill-fitting footwear**: Tight or narrow shoes compress the nail plate, causing longitudinal splits, onycholysis, and pain [^2a2b40a8].

- **Repetitive impact**: Running, jumping, or prolonged standing can cause microtrauma, leading to splitting and pain [^2a2b40a8].

- **Improper nail trimming**: Rounded edges or overly short cuts predispose to ingrown nails and splitting [^c829dad7].

- **Anatomical abnormalities**: Hallux valgus, Morton's toe, and flatfoot alter nail mechanics, increasing splitting risk [^2a2b40a8].

---

## Infectious causes

### Onychomycosis (fungal infection)

Onychomycosis is a **common cause** of nail splitting and pain, particularly in toenails [^623a44dd]. Dermatophytes invade the nail plate, causing thickening, brittleness, and longitudinal splitting [^41850420]. Pain arises from nail bed inflammation, onycholysis, and secondary bacterial infection [^623a44dd].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

### Psoriasis

Nail psoriasis causes **onychodystrophy**, including ridging, pitting, onycholysis, and splitting [^d94f95fb]. Pain results from inflammation, subungual hyperkeratosis, and secondary infection [^d94f95fb].

---

### Lichen planus

Lichen planus affects the nail matrix, causing **splitting, ridging, and thinning** [^d72772cd]. Pain is due to matrix inflammation and secondary infection [^d72772cd].

---

## Congenital and developmental anomalies

### Double little toenail (accessory nail of the fifth toe)

This congenital anomaly features a **second nail plate** on the lateral aspect of the fifth toe, often bilateral and hereditary [^eecb05f4]. The accessory nail can split, catch on footwear, and cause pain [^eecb05f4].

---

## Neoplastic and structural abnormalities

### Subungual exostosis

Subungual exostosis is a **benign bony outgrowth** beneath the nail plate, causing nail deformity, splitting, and pain [^98371126].

---

### Glomus tumor

A **glomus tumor** is a vascular neoplasm causing severe paroxysmal pain, cold sensitivity, and nail splitting [^bfcb5703].

---

## Systemic and medication-related causes

Chemotherapy can cause **onycholysis, Beau's lines, and splitting** with pain from matrix injury and secondary infection [^3f51347d].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach is essential:

- **History**: Trauma, footwear, nail care, systemic symptoms, medications [^2a2b40a8].

- **Physical examination**: Nail plate, bed, folds, and periungual skin for splitting, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, erythema, and masses [^623a44dd].

- **Laboratory tests**: KOH prep, fungal culture, or PCR for onychomycosis [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Radiographs for exostosis; MRI for suspected glomus tumor or deep infection [^98371126] [^bfcb5703].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

| **Cause** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Mechanical trauma | - Footwear modification <br/> - Proper nail trimming <br/> - Orthotics <br/> - Partial nail avulsion with phenol matrixectomy for refractory cases [^2a2b40a8] [^e447b92b] |
| Onychomycosis | - Topical antifungals (efinaconazole, tavaborole) <br/> - Oral terbinafine or itraconazole for severe disease [^2121de69] [^44ac59dc] [^94a315d4] [^2f342c8e] |
| Psoriasis/lichen planus | - Topical corticosteroids <br/> - Intralesional triamcinolone <br/> - Systemic agents for severe disease [^d94f95fb] [^d72772cd] |
| Double little toenail | - Partial avulsion with phenol matrixectomy of accessory nail [^301a6621] |
| Subungual exostosis | - Surgical excision of exostosis [^98371126] |
| Glomus tumor | - Surgical excision [^bfcb5703] |

---

Split painful toenails arise from diverse causes, with **mechanical trauma and onychomycosis** being most common. A focused history, exam, and targeted testing guide therapy, which ranges from conservative measures to surgery for refractory cases.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^75d83751]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old man with a history of verruca vulgaris on his hands presented for evaluation of left fifth toe pain. On examination, there was a wide fifth toenail with longitudinal nail plate split. This was bilateral, but more prominent and symptomatic on the left, with the split occurring approximately one-third of the distance from the lateral edge of the nail plate (Fig 1). He noted that this had been unchanged for decades. He denied previous significant trauma or surgery to his left fifth toenail but had discomfort with shoes. To his knowledge, there was no family history of similar findings.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Double (accessory) fifth toenail
B. Subungual exostosis
C. Periungual fibroma
D. Subungual verruca
E. Onychophosis

Question 3: Should definitive treatment be desired, what is the recommended treatment approach?
A. En-bloc excision of nail unit
B. Cotton cast placement under free edge of the nail plate
C. Urea cream twice daily
D. Avulsion and matrixectomy
E. Repeat cryotherapy

Answers:
A. En-bloc excision of nail unit – Incorrect. This technique is utilized for nail unit malignancies (eg, treatment of minimally invasive nail unit melanoma). As this is a benign finding, en-bloc excision is not necessary and the medial nail plate and matrix can remain intact.
B. Cotton cast placement under free edge of the nail plate – Incorrect. Although this technique can be helpful for onychocryptosis, it would not treat the underlying anatomic etiology.
C. Urea cream twice daily – Incorrect. This is a common conservative approach for nail dystrophy, including secondary to friction on the lateral aspect of the fifth toenail. This was discussed with this patient, however he elected for more definitive treatment.
D. Avulsion and matrixectomy – Correct. Although this finding is benign, it can be painful. If patients wish to pursue treatment, avulsion of the accessory toenail and application of 88% phenol to the matrix can be performed. As these are 2 independent nail plates, the avulsion is simple and only requires use of nail plate elevator and hemostat without need for nail splitter (Fig 3). This was performed for our patient with relief of his symptoms. Alternatively, surgical matrixectomyor complete surgical resection of the accessory matrix, proximal nail fold, and hyponychium can be performed, particularly if there is any doubt about the diagnosis and a pathology specimen is desired.
E. Repeat cryotherapy – Incorrect. Despite the patient's history of warts, this was not the case at these sites and cryotherapy is unlikely to be curative.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^3f51347d]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment‐related pain: chemotherapy

Systemic anticancer treatment, namely chemotherapy, is classically associated with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, a chronic, cumulative sensory neuropathy which develops over the course of chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs can be associated with more acute pain. Oxaliplatin, a platinum analogue used widely in gastrointestinal cancers, is associated with an unpleasant acute cold‐sensitive neuropathy affecting the hands, feet and oropharynx in 80–90% of patients. This can arise within hours of receiving oxaliplatin and may last up to 72 h. The underlying mechanism is thought to relate to oxaliplatin modulating the transcription of distinct ion channels that shape sensory neuronal cold responses. The presence of this phenomenon is a marker for the development of more severe longer‐term chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy.

Due to the rapid turnover of the cells of the nail matrix, toe and fingernails are particularly vulnerable to damage from chemotherapy. Certain nail toxicities may be acutely painful. Onycholysis, the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, is associated with taxane‐based chemotherapy and, when haemorrhagic, can cause severe pain. Other painful nail toxicities include subungual haematomas and paronychia. Specialist dermatological input to assist with the management of patients presenting with painful nail toxicity is advised.

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^42f30dbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies. None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes. Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment). In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation. In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail. In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes. Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^eecb05f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Double (accessory) fifth toenail – Correct. This is considered an incomplete form of polydactyly. On examination, the nail has 2 parts, the medial being wider, with a longitudinal furrow or split. In the largest review to date of this condition, 2 completely distinct nail plates were rare, and findings were often symmetrical. A quarter of cases in this series were more prominent on one side, like our patient, with more subtle findings on the other foot (Fig 2). This is often asymptomatic but can be tender due to compression of the lateral nail fold.
B. Subungual exostosis – Incorrect. Subungual exostosis is a benign bony tumor arising from the distal phalanx and is more common in toenails than fingernails. This presents as a nodule of the distal nail bed with accompanying onycholysis, not a nail plate split. Radiographs are confirmatory.
C. Periungual fibroma – Incorrect. Also known as Koenen's tumors in the setting of tuberous sclerosis, this is a benign papule with hyperkeratotic tip commonly presenting at the proximal nail fold. This leads to longitudinal depression in the nail plate, and not a split nail.
D. Subungual verruca – Incorrect. Despite his history of warts, the fifth toenails did not demonstrate clinical or dermoscopic findings to support a viral etiology.
E. Onychophosis – Incorrect. Onychophosis refers to localized or diffuse hyperkeratosis at the lateral or proximal nail folds, in the space between the nail fold and nail plate, as a result of repeated minor trauma. This does not describe the nail plate abnormality.

Question 2: What is the next best step in diagnosis?
A. Nail bed biopsy
B. Nail clipping for hematoxylin and eosin
C. Referral to genetics
D. Radiograph
E. Magnetic resonance imaging

Answers:
A. Nail bed biopsy – Incorrect. Well-developed accessory toenails, as seen in this patient, have no histologic abnormality of the nail matrix or bed. Excision shows all characteristics of a normal fifth toenail: proximal nail fold, matrix, and short nail bed.
B. Nail clipping for hematoxylin and eosin – Incorrect. Similar to answer choice A, there is no histologic abnormality of well-developed accessory toenails.
C. Referral to genetics – Incorrect. Double fifth toenail is thought to be autosomal dominant, but expression is variable. There have been reports that this is common in Han Chinese, but additional reports have shown a broad range of races and ethnicities with this presentation. Double fifth toenail diagnosis alone does not require a genetics evaluation.
D. Radiograph – Correct. In a previous series, 10 patients with clinical findings of a double fifth toenail underwent foot radiographs, with 30% demonstrating a Y-shaped distal phalanx. Other reports have not shown any abnormalities on foot radiographs, but 2 nail plates and 2 matrices were seen on ultrasound. The pathophysiology of the accessory nail is not well understood. There is question of whether the presence of bone in some patients induces nail formation or if the presence of nail epithelium causes underlying mesenchymal cells to generate bone. Our patient underwent radiographs of his feet which did not show any bone abnormalities. Radiographs prior to intervention also help evaluate for other possible diagnoses such as subungual exostosis.
E. Magnetic resonance imaging – Incorrect. Advanced imaging is not necessary for diagnosis or treatment planning.

### Subungual exostosis treated with an in situ thin split-thickness toenail bed graft [^d171d39e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Subungual exostosis is a slow-growing, benign outgrowth of normal bone or calcified cartilaginous remains of the distal phalanx. Complete surgical excision of lesions, including the cartilaginous cap, is a unique curative method. An 18-year-old male presented with a protruding papule on the right great toenail. Diagnosis of subungual exostosis had been established and complete excision was performed. In addition, an in situ thin split-thickness toenail bed graft was used to cover the defect. At 6 months after excision, the patient had no complaint of recurrence or pain. We report on a unique trial case of subungual exostosis treated with thin split-thickness nail bed grafts taken from the adjacent normal nail bed of the affected toe.

### Ingrown toenail management [^76b053cb]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ingrown toenails:

- **Definition**: Ingrown toenails, also known as onychocryptosis, is a condition where the toenail grows into the surrounding skin, leading to pain and inflammation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ingrown toenails involves the nail plate penetrating into the periungual skin. This penetration can lead to skin irritation and overgrowth, causing the nail to become embedded in the skin.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ingrown toenails in South Korea is estimated at 307.5 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ingrown toenails include familial predisposition, poor foot hygiene, and occupations or sports that increase pressure on the toes. Other factors such as previous nail avulsion and foot bone deformity have been associated with poorly controlled and recurrence-prone ingrown toenails.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with ingrown toenails often present with pain, redness, and swelling at the affected site. If left untreated, the condition can progress to infection, abscess formation, and even cellulitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for ingrown toenails is generally good with appropriate management.

### Split fingernails, underdeveloped thumbnails, and triangular lunulae [^a0d877fc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of split nails. His medical history was notable for bilateral elbow surgeries. On physical examination, it was noted that the patient had split nails of his index fingernails and underdevelopment of his thumbnails (Fig 1). All his fingernails, except for the thumbnails, had triangular lunulae.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Darier disease
B. Lichen planus (LP)
C. Nail-patella syndrome (NPS)
D. Pachyonychia congenita
E. Psoriasis

Answers:
A. Darier disease – Incorrect. Darier disease primarily affects keratinization, leading to hyperkeratotic and warty plaques in a seborrheic distribution. It also manifests with nail changes, including longitudinal red and white streaks, as well as distinct V-shaped notching of the distal nail plate, which may mimic the splitting and cracking seen in the nails of patients with NPS.
B. LP – Incorrect. LP is characterized by violaceous, pruritic papules, and plaques with Wickham striae. LP of the nail classically causes trachyonychia and dorsal pterygium.
C. NPS – Correct. NPS, also known as hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia or Fong disease, typically presents with abnormalities in the nails and the bones of knees, elbows, and pelvis. Nails may be absent, underdeveloped, split, or ridged with pathognomonic triangular lunulae. Bony abnormalities include absent or hypoplastic patellae, radial head dysplasia, and iliac bone exostoses.
D. Pachyonychia congenita – Incorrect. Pachyonychia congenita presents with oral leukokeratosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and thickened nails with subungual hyperkeratosis. In contrast, NPS is marked by dystrophic nails, triangular lunulae, and skeletal deformities.
E. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis is a skin condition that characteristically presents with well-circumscribed, erythematous, and scaly plaques. Psoriasis can affect nails with varying presentations, including irregular pitting, oil drop spots, and onycholysis. Psoriasis affecting the nail does not present with triangular lunulae.

### Ingrown toenail removal [^fac862a7]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail is a common problem resulting from various etiologies including improperly trimmed nails, hyperhidrosis, and poorly fitting shoes. Patients commonly present with pain in the affected nail but with progression, drainage, infection, and difficulty walking occur. Excision of the lateral nail plate combined with lateral matricectomy is thought to provide the best chance for eradication. The lateral aspect of the nail plate is removed with preservation of the remaining healthy nail plate. Electrocautery ablation is then used to destroy the exposed nail-forming matrix, creating a new lateral nail fold. Complications of the procedure include regrowth of a nail spicule secondary to incomplete matricectomy and postoperative nail bed infection. When performed correctly, the procedure produces the greatest success in the treatment of ingrown nails. Basic soft tissue surgery and electrosurgery experience are prerequisites for learning the technique.

### Ingrown toenail management [^c829dad7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingrown toenails account for approximately 20% of foot problems in primary care. The great toe is most often affected. Ingrown toenails occur most commonly in young men, and nail care habits and footwear are most often contributory factors. No consensus has been reached for the best treatment approach, but ingrown nails may be nonsurgically or surgically treated. Nonsurgical treatments are typically used for mild to moderate ingrown nails, whereas surgical approaches are used in moderate and severe cases. Simple nonsurgical palliative measures include correcting inappropriate footwear, managing hyperhidrosis and onychomycosis, soaking the affected toe followed by applying a mid- to high-potency topical steroid, and placing wisps of cotton or dental floss under the ingrown lateral nail edge. Application of a gutter splint to the ingrown nail edge to separate it from the lateral fold provides immediate pain relief. A cotton nail cast made from cotton and cyanoacrylate adhesive, taping the lateral nail fold, or orthonyxia may also alleviate mild to moderate ingrown toenail. Surgical approaches seek to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and inflammatory reaction. These approaches are superior to nonsurgical ones for preventing recurrence. The most common surgical approach is partial avulsion of the lateral edge of the nail plate. Matrixectomy further prevents recurrence and can be performed through surgical, chemical, or electrosurgical means.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^4d47ea5f]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic criteria of the double nail of the fifth toe, its differential diagnosis with the true ectopic nail, the possible pathogenesis, and surgical treatment are illustrated. We believe that this condition occurred in a particular location as a clinical variant of the congenital ectopic nail because of a late mutation.

### Ingrown toenail management [^e4e9a37c]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for ingrown toenails, more specifically with respect to partial nail avulsion with phenolization, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that partial nail avulsion with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence than surgical excision without phenolization.

### Thin split-thickness toenail bed grafts for avulsed nail bed defects [^68144496]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Avulsed defect of a fingernail bed is a common injury in acute hand trauma. Insufficient management for this type of nail bed avulsion often leads to an irregular and nonadherent nail. The use of thin split-thickness sterile matrix graft from the great toe for immediate replacement of a nail bed defect can regain a smooth, adherent, and normal-looking nail. Between May of 1998 and December of 2001, we used thin split-thickness toenail bed grafts in 13 fingers of 12 patients with avulsed defects of the nail bed. The end results of this technique were excellent and no deformities occurred in the graft donor area. Thin split-thickness toenail bed graft is a good choice for the treatment of acute nail bed avulsion.

### Hangnails: paste them back [^6382bcc7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hangnails are short torn down part of skin surrounding the nails. At times they are very painful. The usual treatment advised is cutting the excess skin with clippers or scissors. To provide an instant relief to the patients, we describe a simpler and effective way to use a surgical glue to paste them back in their original position.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^7958836e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most nail pathologies are slow healing and can be complicated to treat. Beau lines occur when the matrix ceases to produce nail keratin and the nail moves distally, resulting in depressions or breaks in the integrity of the nail plate. Complete shedding of the nail occurs when the nail plate distal to the Beau line separates from the nail bed (Fig 2).

Fig 2
Deep sulci and complete matrix arrest were associated with onychomadesis.

Onychomadesis of various causes is related to the arrest of nail matrix growth (Table I). In CMGT, lateral displacement of the nail apparatus causes recurrent, shearing microtrauma to the nail matrix that would not occur in properly aligned toenails. As such, CMGT increases the risk of various forms of nail dystrophy, including paronychia, retronychia, onycholysis, onychogryphosis, and onychocryptosis. We report that the identical genetically determined malalignment of the 4 toenails in the twins that was associated with weight gain and activities of daily living during pubescence, increases the strain on the nail matrix causing recurrent arrest of the matrical growth. This results in horizontal nail depressions (Beau lines) and, ultimately, onychomadesis.

Table I
The causes of onychomadesis and their relationship with temporary stunting of nail matrix growth

Efforts to prevent onychomadesis include minimization of trauma, treatment of any underlying systemic disease, and discontinuation of inciting medications such as chemotherapy. In CMGT, the shearing forces produced with normal ambulation probably cannot be prevented by measures such as avoiding ill-fitted shoes and choosing shoes with a wide toe box. Despite this, careful attention to properly sized and fitted footwear is mandatory to reduce the risk of secondary complications. Surgical options include removal and reimplantation of the nail matrix. In adults with recurrent onychomadesis and onychogryphosis, complete phenol nail matrixectomy may be required. Generally, surgical options become a priority only when patients become symptomatic with recurrent infection and painful onychocryptosis.

This rare case shows a clear association between CMGT and onychomadesis. The extended period of the necessary treatment window and the imperfect nature of the available preventive treatment make it difficult to establish whether the patients will benefit from our suggestions.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In two clinical trials, 1227 subjects were treated with JUBLIA, 1161 for at least 24 weeks and 780 for 48 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 48 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with JUBLIA and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of JUBLIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^c5499cd8]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig 1 and after gentle washing in Fig 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig 3.

Question 1. What is the diagnosis?

A. Acute paronychia
B. Onychomycosis
C. Retronychia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Ingrown nail

Answers

A. Acute paronychia – Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
B. Onychomycosis – Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
C. Retronychia – Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis are chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
D. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
E. Ingrown nail – Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the medial or lateral border of the nail fold. This patient's symptoms occurred at the proximal nail fold.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^2d209707]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

We suggest the following criteria for the diagnosis of double little toenail:
1 Fifth toe involvement
2 Congenital occurrence
3 Often bilateral
4 Possible hereditary involvement

It seems likely that double little toenail is linked to a variation in the normal genes controlling healthy nail growth and orientation. The pathomechanism is thought to be due to an incomplete development of the primary nail epithelium and onychodermis. In congenital occurrence, misdevelopment may started because the germinal matrix splits, leading to implantation of a fragment proximally into the nail fold. In our patients, we suspected congenital occurrence because the double little toenail matrix appears as an extroflexion or extension to the primary nail matrix at the intermediate lamina. These aspects led us to consider double little toenail as a form of the condition known as congenital onychoheterotopia. The treatment is segmental excision or phenolization. Cryotherapy followed by matrix phenolization is a second-choice treatment.

In conclusion, the double little toenail shows essential aspects in dermoscopy and scanning electron microscopy similar to those of the ectopic nail. We believe that this nail anomaly is unique and represents a clinical variant of ectopic nail.

Case 2

A 49-year-old female presented with persistent nail dystrophy of the right first toenail present for 4 months (Fig 2, A). Per patient history, the lesion began as a pink subungual papule without pain or discharge. Moderate longitudinal ridging and light tan hyperpigmentation were observed extending up to 3 mm from the proximal nail fold. The remaining 1 cm of the distal nail plate was markedly thinned. The proximal nail fold appeared uninvolved.

Fig 2
Presentation of right first (R1) toenail nail dystrophy in case 2. A, Examination findings 6 months prior to matrix biopsy. B, Presentation 2 years after matrix biopsy. C, Histopathology of the nail matrix obtained by biopsy of the patient is shown (40×, H&E) with the presence of a band of lymphocytes near the dermal-epidermal junction. H&E, Hematoxylin-eosin stain.

The lesion was initially monitored over the course of the next 10 months and eventually biopsied as nail dystrophy worsened. The pink subungual papule was reported to have grown. The lesion eventually involved almost the entire width of the nail with proximal nail plate thinning over the papule. Initial differential diagnosis included trauma, subungual fibroma, and squamous cell carcinoma. After partial nail plate avulsion and reflection of the proximal nailfold, a tangential shave biopsy of the nail matrix was performed. The biopsy demonstrated subepithelial patchy lymphocytic infiltrate supporting a diagnosis of nail lichen planus given clinical findings (Fig 2, C).

Healing after the nail biopsy was complicated by increased pain, erythema, and edema without purulence. Bacterial infection was suspected and empirically treated with cephalexin with partial improvement. The nail biopsy site also developed scarring with failure of nail plate formation and development of a dorsal pterygium that was subsequently surgically debrided. Intramatrical triamcinolone injections (5 total injections every 1–3 months, between 0.4 mL-0.7 mL of 10 to 20 mg/mL triamcinolone) were performed along with daily topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment and symptoms of pain and swelling all resolved and the nail plate regrew over the course of 2 years. However, the central portion of the nail plate remained hypoplastic with distal splitting of the nail plate (Fig 2, B).

EGFR inhibitor-associated paronychia and periungual lesions — patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are at risk for nail changes that typically develop after two or more months of chemotherapy exposure, most commonly nail fold inflammation (paronychia) and periungual pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, with possible resultant onycholysis or onychodystrophy. Paronychia is characterized by tender, edematous, often purulent inflammation of the nail folds, affecting fingernails and toenails with the first digits most commonly affected; precedent trauma is not believed to be causative but rather an aggravating factor, and morbidity is high with significant pain, functional limitation, and impairment of activities of daily living; periungual pyogenic granulomata are characterized by friable vascular tissue overgrowths on lateral nail folds.

### The role of great toe terminal branch artery split-thickness nail bed flaps in fingertip reconstruction surgery [^e42f4650]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The common treatments used to repair fingertip defects remain controversial. We have previously conducted research on split-thickness nail bed flaps, but this method still damages the proper plantar digital arteries and nerves. The great toe terminal branch arteries (TBAs) have not been described in detail.

Methods

Twenty cadaveric feet were used to dissect the terminal branches of the plantar arteries. The locations and diameters of the terminal branches were analyzed. Five patients underwent operations with a TBA split-thickness nail bed flap. We recorded the recovery of both the donor and recipient sites and evaluated the results.

Results

The diameter of the TBAs was between 0.4 and 0.8 mm. The TBA split-thickness nail bed flaps of five patients survived. No complications were found in any of the patients. The nail outcomes were excellent (A) in four patients and very good (B) in one patient. All patients were satisfied with the appearance of the recipient and donor sites. The mean static two-point discrimination was 6.0 mm (range, 4–9). The mean Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test score was 3.03 g (range, 1.65–3.84). Patients neither experienced severe pain in the reconstructed finger or at the donor site, nor did they experience severe cold intolerance. This microsurgical technique avoids the destruction of the proper plantar digital arteries and nerves.

Conclusions

A TBA split-thickness nail bed flap from the great toe is clinically feasible and can achieve satisfactory results in fingertip repair.

### Subungual exostosis of the toes: a systematic review [^98371126]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Subungual exostosis is a relatively common benign bone tumor that occurs in the distal phalanges of the toes and can be a source of pain and nail deformity. There is controversy about the treatment of these lesions and there are few studies that have synthesized what is known and provided meaningful information on treatment.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a systematic review to address the following questions: (1) What is the best surgical approach for excising these lesions? (2) What is the age range, sex distribution, and presenting symptoms of subungual exostoses and which toe is most frequently affected? (3) What complications arise from treatment?

Methods

Two authors independently searched multiple databases (Medline, 1950-May 2013; Cochrane EBM database, and EMBASE, 1980-May 2013 provided by OVID; ACP Journal Club, 2003-May 2013; CINAHL by EBSCO, 1937-May 2013; and PubMed by NLM, 1940-May 2013), and key words were chosen to achieve a broad search strategy. We included studies on the management of toe exostoses with > 10 cases and we excluded studies that reported on upper extremity exostoses or osteochondromas. Demographic and treatment data were collected from each article by two independent authors and collated. A total of 124 abstracts were screened, and 116 articles were reviewed in full, of which 13 met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Complete marginal excision through a fish mouth incision protecting the nail led to a recurrence rate of 4% and satisfactory clinical results, defined as no requirement for postoperative intervention and a satisfactory clinical appearance in 73%. Most studies provided incomplete descriptions of specific surgical techniques used. Fifty-five percent of the patients were younger than 18 years of age. A history of toe trauma before diagnosis was present in approximately 30% of the cases. Delayed diagnosis occurred in approximately 10% of the cases and onychodystrophy occurred in more than 10%.

Conclusions

There is weak evidence to guide management of subungual exostosis. Adequate wound management postexcision aiming to minimize disruption to the nail bed and matrix may prevent onychodystrophy, which is a common complication of treatment.

Longitudinal splitting of the nails can occur as a result of any growth arising in the nail matrix. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who presented with an 18-month history of longitudinal splitting of the nail on her right little finger, along with pain in the proximal nail fold region, which was extremely tender to touch. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intensely enhancing lesion, while colour Doppler imaging revealed hypervascularity within the mass. A provisional diagnosis of glomus tumour was considered. Histopathology demonstrated presence of a well-circumscribed tumour comprising a dual population of cells, which stained negatively with periodic-acid-Schiff. The histopathological features were consistent with those of eccrine spiradenoma (ES). In this case, glomus tumour was considered as the first differential diagnosis, but histopathology confirmed it as an ES.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^8d3be37d]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The double little toenail was first described more than 50 years ago. This defect occurs at birth or in childhood, and rarely in adulthood. It is congenital or acquired, with sporadic appearance. Histologically, it is similar to nail tissue with a matrix and nail bed, adjacent to the primary toenail. This disorder appears hereditary and it can be observed in both sexes but prevails in the female sex. In the family we discuss, the nail disorder has an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, the double little toenail develops adjacent to and partly overlapping the plate of the leading nail. The nail, apparently divided into 2 parts by an intermediate furrow, is visible. Congenital double little toenail shows a symmetry in both locations on the fifth toes, although one-fourth of these abnormal nails show a more marked picture on 1 side, as in 2 of our patients. A Y-shaped radiologic alteration of the distal phalanx was occasionally detected; this feature is similar to a hexadactyly. Indeed, a macronychia of the fifth toe with accessory double nail was observed as polydactyly. A case of double nail developing on the middle finger was recently described.

Double little toenail must be distinguished from the ectopic nail, acquired split nail, cutaneous horn, and nail fibrokeratoma. Ectopic nails of the feet are unusual. The morphology of the newly formed nails shows close similarities with the ectopic nail but differs from this for the site and heredity. The classification of ectopic nailincludes nail with accessory finger or polydactyly, dorsal and double nail, and a small nail located near the healthy toenail. The latter type includes the double little toenail. Onychoheterotopia is adjacent to but detached from the primary nail, unlike inherited double little toenail, in which the nail is attached to the primary nail. Similarities between the double little toenail and the ectopic nail are as follows: they arise spontaneously or after a trauma, they grow more slowly than usual, and they can recur after incomplete avulsion. The double little toenail shows a matrix and a horizontal-parallel growth pattern. The ectopic nail is equipped with a matrix in the center or the back, with a horizontal-vertical growth pattern and a distal or inverted orientation. Scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing the ectopic nail, identifying the morphologic aspects, and distinguishing from other periungual epithelial neoformations of the foot.

### Nail disorders as clues to systemic disease [^ff029ba7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disorders of the nail unit can provide important clues to underlying systemic diseases. Onychodystrophy or nail abnormalities include altered nail color, shape, or texture with morphology and growth patterns often related to local anatomic factors such as edema, vascular supply, and neurologic innervation. Associated pain or loss-of-function can also affect daily activities. Because nail changes may be due to a range of systemic diseases, the authors provide a systems-based broad overview of the common nail findings in patients with internal disease.

### Idiopathic chilblains [^c08366c7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chilblains is a benign condition infrequently encountered in clinical practice; its resemblance to vasculitis or peripheral thromboemboli can often result in an extensive and unnecessary diagnostic work-up.

Method

Three cases of chilblains seen by our Rheumatology service, along with 113 documented cases, were reviewed.

Results

Chilblains is characterized by painful red-to-purple papular lesions involving the acral surface of fingers or toes that resolves with symptomatic treatment. Female sex and low body mass index are risk factors.

Conclusion

Distinct clinical features of chilblains can be used for early recognition and management, thus avoiding unnecessary diagnostic testing and delays in patient care.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^f8954f48]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^dd8c599b]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Toenail pathologies are common in the general population and include onychocryptosis, onychauxis and onychomycosis. These can cause infection and wounds, which have additional implications in people with IA who are immunosuppressed. Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of self-management, and when and how to access a specialist foot services (see recommendation 3).

In PsA, where multiple nails are pathological, systemic rather than local treatment should be considered, and dermatology input should be sought. Systemic drugs for the treatment of nail disease in people with PsA have been shown to be effective; current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) for psoriatic nail disease. Topical therapies (e.g. calcipotriol and glucocorticoid preparations, topical tacrolimus, topical ciclosporin, intralesional glucocorticoids and pulsed dye laser) and systemic medications (ciclosporin, methotrexate, acitretin, JAK inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors) can also be considered. For foot skin disease in PsA, current GRAPPA guidelines strongly recommend topical agents (e.g. emollients, keratolytics, topical corticosteroids) when there is limited body surface area involved. More widespread psoriasis, or foot psoriasis that is unresponsive to topical treatment, should prompt a review of systemic disease management, with methotrexate, ciclosporin, PDE4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs strongly recommended.

Nail surgery should be considered for toenail pathologies that do not or are thought unlikely to resolve with conservative care. When infection is present, antibiotics should be considered and conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and bDMARD therapy should be suspended, with input from the rheumatology MDT. There is no evidence for one type of nail avulsion surgery procedure over another in IA or generally; matrixectomy should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Split-thickness nail bed flap graft in the management of distal partial defect of the nail bed combined with soft tissue [^4fa6e58c]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We report a surgical procedure for the management of nail bed injuries combined with soft tissue defects.

Methods

We reviewed the records of patients with a nail bed injury combined with a soft tissue defect, who were surgically treated at our hospital from 2015 through 2018. According to the Allen classification, 5 patients were characterized as type 2 and 3 were characterized as type 3. Two also had partial defects of the distal phalanx. In all cases, we created a split-thickness nail bed flap of the great toe to reconstruct the nail bed injury. All patients underwent supervised postoperative rehabilitation. We reviewed patients' medical records for the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, 2-point discrimination, and postoperative healing in the donor area.

Results

Both the nails and flaps of all patients survived. No complications were observed after surgery. The nail was completely attached to the nail bed. In addition, there were no deformities, and the nail plate appearance was close to normal. A nail with an unsatisfactory appearance was noted in one patient. The shape, texture, and elasticity of the flaps of all patients were acceptable. All patients were capable of normal pinching, gripping, and grasping. Twelve months after the operation, 3 of 8 patients had 2-point discrimination of 6 mm or less. All patients were satisfied with the hand function according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire. The toenail of the donor site grew well, and no deformity or pain with walking was noted.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that this approach is a safe means of repairing a nail bed injury combined with a soft tissue defect.

### Partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery: a comparison of two surgical methods in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^8976450e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An ingrown toenail is a common, painful, and debilitating condition.

Objective

This study aims to compare 2 surgical methods (partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery) in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

A total of 92 ingrown nails of the big toe in 86 patients underwent partial matricectomy with curettage, whereas 57 ingrown nails of the big toe in 52 patients underwent partial matricectomy with electrocautery.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 2 toenails in the partial matricectomy with curettage group, whereas no recurrence was observed in the partial matricectomy with electrocautery group (p > .05). The mean period of postoperative pain was 2.3 and 3.1 days in the curettage group and the electrocautery group, respectively (p < .05). There was a significant difference in the duration of scar tissue inflammation (p < .05).

Conclusion

Both surgical methods are safe treatment modalities with a high success rate. Partial matricectomy, which is achieved using curettage, seems to be superior to electrocautery in respect of reduced inflammation and duration of pain.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^e30a134b]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

Double little toenails, or inherited accessory nail of the fifth toe, are a rare onychodysplasia with variable genetic expression. Nevertheless, few cases of this condition in family members are reported in the literature. Here, we describe this nail defect observed in 4 female members of a family.

A 26-year-old woman was evaluated for 2 hyperkeratotic prominences located on the lateral fifth toe surfaces of the main nail (Fig 1 A and B). These accessory nails had arisen and grown at the same rate as the normal nail. This condition was causing slight pain during walking, and the patient also expressed concern about a cosmetic disfigurement. Her 34-year-old sister (Fig 1 C and D) and her 54-year-old mother have had the same abnormality since childhood. The 6-year-old girl, who was the proband's niece, has had this deformity since aged 3 years. The family was composed of 20 members in 3 generations (Fig 2, A).

### Evaluation and management of mechanical and structural nail disorders: a clinical review [^2a2b40a8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical trauma is the most common cause of toenail onychodystrophy, surpassing onychomycosis. Ill-fitting footwear and anatomical foot/toe abnormalities, including Morton's toe, hallux valgus/erectus/rigidus, and flat and splay foot, predispose the forefoot to nonphysiologic strain and toenail alterations, often resembling onychomycosis. Dystrophic toenails should therefore be assessed alongside foot and toe alignment while standing and walking, with close examination of footwear. Trauma-induced onychodystrophy predisposes to secondary onychomycosis, and histopathological/mycological confirmation is needed. Moreover, anatomic foot/toe abnormalities may worsen nail psoriasis through koebnerization. Thus, toenails may still appear dystrophic after treating comorbid conditions if the precipitating factor is not addressed or cannot be successfully treated. Additional nail disorders induced by mechanical trauma include subungual heloma, onychophosis, frictional onycholysis, leukonychia, melanonychia, Beau's lines/onychomadesis/retronychia, and disappearing nail bed. Additionally, arthritic conditions affecting the distal interphalangeal joint may theoretically impact the adjacent nail matrix and cause nail alterations. Hyperglycemia, neuropathy, and vasculopathy likely play a role in the pathogenesis of onychodystrophies in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients are prone to developing structural foot/toe problems, onychomycosis, and ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis), which increase their risk of ulcer formation. Therefore, treating onychomycosis and onychocryptosis in diabetic patients is crucial to prevent complications, including ulcers, osteomyelitis, and amputations.

### Diagnosis, management, and complications of glomus tumours of the digits in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^bfcb5703]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Glomus tumours are benign painful tumours of the glomus body, a thermoregulatory shunt in the digits. Glomus tumours of the fingers and toes are associated with the monogenic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and are recently recognised as part of the NF1 phenotype.

Methods and Results

A multi-institutional experience with 15 individuals with NF1 and glomus tumours of the fingers or toes is reported. The majority of individuals presented with at least two of the symptoms in the classic triad of localised tenderness, severe paroxysmal pain, and sensitivity to cold. Appearance of the nail and finger or toe is often normal. Women are affected more often than men. Multifocal tumours are common. There is often a delay in diagnosis of many years and clinical suspicion is key to diagnosis, although magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in some scenarios. Surgical extirpation can be curative; however, local tumour recurrence and metachronous tumours are common. Three of our patients developed signs and symptoms of the complex regional pain syndrome.

Conclusions

Glomus tumours in NF1 are more common than previously recognised and NF1 patients should be specifically queried about fingertip or toe pain.

### Curly fingernails as a potential new nail variant: a report of two cases [^d3b941da]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case reports

Case 1

A 40-year-old woman undergoing in vitro fertilization presented with a 30-year history of curly fingernails. She reported keeping her nails long regularly and noted that the curling was less notable when nails were short. She denied family history of similar nails, frequent use of hands for work or hobbies, or toenail involvement. She had a childhood history of right third digit trauma and a history of osteoarthritis. On physical examination, the fingernails were long and curled with minimal onycholysis (Figs 1 and 2). Toenails were normal. Histopathology of fingernail clippings were negative for presence of hyphae and parakeratosis with neutrophil infiltration, making diagnoses of onychomycosis and nail psoriasis unlikely. Bilateral hand X-rays were negative for psoriatic arthritis. She had curly hair. She reported a temporary episode of hair loss that coincided with her in vitro fertilization cycle, which resolved without treatment. At her 2-year follow-up, she reported that her nails were status quo and that she kept them short to minimize curliness.

Fig 1

Fig 2
A 40-year-old woman patient with wavy and curly fingernails of the left hand.

Case 2

A 38-year-old woman, 34 weeks pregnant, presented with curved and wavy nails. She reported that her fingernails began growing curved and wavy at 30 to 31 weeks of pregnancy. She recalled a brief episode of curly nails in the remote past. She complained that the curved areas of the nails were painful, which was relieved by cutting the nails short. She described her hair as wavy. On physical examination, her fingernails were undulating with minimal onycholysis (Fig 3).

Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by a triad of chronic severe plantar pain, focal palmoplantar keratoderma and hypertrophic nail dystrophy. Plantar pain can be debilitating and have a profound impact on quality of life. Current therapeutic options for pain in PC are limited to lifestyle adjustment and mechanical techniques, with a small subgroup of patients benefiting from oral retinoids. This review investigates the pathogenesis of pain in PC and provides a summary of the current and future therapeutic options.

### Curly fingernails as a potential new nail variant: a report of two cases [^023133f1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, only 1 case of curling of the fingernails has been reported, by Oberlin et al, of a 55-year-old African American woman with extremely long (lengths 5–30 cm) and curly fingernails. The primary differential diagnosis is parrot beak nails, characterized by excessive forward NP curvature of the free margin, and associated with trauma and systemic sclerosis. However, the overcurvature associated with parrot beak nails causes skin impingement and pain, whereas curly nails grow outward in an undulating fashion. Cohenreported a case of curly cuticles, but not NP, in an 83-year-old male patient, and proposed the term "eponychogryphosis" for this condition.

Congenital curved nail of the fourth toe, a rare disorder in which the fourth toe's NP curves toward the plantar foot, was first reported in 1991. Since then, only 19 cases have been reported, most of them in Japan, with only one case outside Asia. Most cases had bilateral involvement (15/19), with pain in 8 of 19 cases, and men affected in 16 of 19 cases. This nail disorder is thought to develop because of terminal phalanx shortening and soft tissue hypoplasia of the fourth toe. Etiology is hypothesized to be a mesodermal abnormality, as an ectodermic abnormality would result in involvement of multiple toes or fingers.X-ray frequently demonstrates isolated distal phalanx shortening of the fourth toe(s). Several cases had a positive family history, suggesting a potential genetic mutation. Involvement of all fingernails in our and Oberlin et al's 1 cases suggest a pathogenesis distinct from congenital curved nail of the fourth toe, although the 2 phenomena may be related.

### Longitudinal erythronychia: suggestions for evaluation and management [^ca51f036]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Longitudinal erythronychia is a frequent nail presentation with a limited differential diagnosis. This clinical entity may be divided into cases that involve one (localized) or multiple (polydactylous) nails. The different presentations have distinct differential diagnoses and workups yet often share a common pathogenesis. Localized longitudinal erythronychia most commonly represents onychopapilloma, yet malignancies may present identically. Therefore biopsy may be required. Polydactylous longitudinal erythronychia usually coincides with a regional or systemic cause. Occasionally, it may herald an important underlying disease. A thorough understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical presentations, and possible diagnoses is necessary for successful evaluation and management.

### A new surgical method to reconstruct the fingertip [^5b5fc375]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In our previous study, we used cross finger fascial flap combined with split-thickness toe nail bed graft to reconstruct large area defect of the nail bed with distal phalanx exposure. Fingertip avulsions are common injuries to the upper extremity and cause a great deal of distress for patients. Replantation, amputation and flap coverage are considered. However, all these methods have their limitations.

Methods

Five patients with fingertip avulsions were enrolled. We used the methods mentioned above combined with the reversed pedicled island flap to covered the defects of both the dorsal and volar sides and reconstruct the fingertip.

Results

All the 5 patients were followed for at least 3 months. The blood supply of the flaps and nail bed is good. All the patients were satisfied with their new fingertips.

Conclusions

The method we introduced in this study is proved to be an effective surgical method for fingertip avulsions.

### Biotin or pyridoxine versus combined regimen in the treatment of onychoschizia [^90af668d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychoschizia is characterized by distal nail plate splitting. Several therapeutic approaches exist, most of which are based on case reports or small non-comparative case series.

Objective

To evaluate safety and efficacy of oral biotin and pyridoxine for treating onychoschizia.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective comparative study was conducted among patients with idiopathic fingernail onychoschizia. Patients were prescribed 1 mg/day biotin, or 100 mg/day pyridoxine or both, for 3 months. Complete response (improvement of more than 90%) and partial response (improvement of more than 50%) were assessed after 6 to 9 months.

Results

The study included 61 patients with fingernail onychoschizia (mean age 40.5 years [range 20–68 years]). The average number of affected fingernails was 7.0 (&plusmn;2.0) per patient. The nail condition lasted 11.6 (&plusmn;4.7) years on average. The combined treatment regimen achieved significantly higher rates of complete response compared to biotin or pyridoxine alone (69.6% vs 10%, 11.1%, respectively; P values < .001). Partial response (> 50% improvement) was achieved in an additional 30.4%, 45%, and 38.9% of patients treated with combined regimen vs biotin or pyridoxine alone, respectively. No adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the use of biotin and pyridoxine combination is an effective treatment for fingernail onychoschizia. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(2):174–177. doi:10.36849/JDD.7687R1.

### Single digit micronychia in an infant [^e94505d8]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A two-month-old male presented to dermatology clinic for evaluation of nail dystrophy of the left second fingernail noted at birth. He was a full-term newborn and, apart from prenatal vitamins, his mother denied any medication or drug exposure during pregnancy. Physical exam revealed micronychia isolated to the left second fingernail (Fig 1) with normal appearance of other fingernails and toenails. Family history was negative for similar findings, including 2 older sisters.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Congenital hypertrophy of the lateral nail folds
B. Congenital onychodysplasia of the index finger (COIF)
C. Ectodermal dysplasia
D. Nail-patella syndrome
E. Pachyonychia congenita

Answers:
A. Congenital hypertrophy of the lateral nail folds – Incorrect. This is a nail finding in newborns most often affecting the first toenail. The lateral nail fold covers a portion of the nail plate, giving the appearance of micronychia. This resolves in the first year of life.
B. Congenital onychodysplasia of the index finger (COIF) – Correct. Iso-Kikuchi syndrome, subclassified as COIF when involving the index (second) fingernail, presents at birth with unilateral or bilateral anonychia, micronychia, polynychia (rudimentary splitting), hemionychogryphosis, nail malalignment, or an irregular lunula of the nail. The etiology is unknown; however, several theories have been proposed, including mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway, in utero damage to arterioles of the radial artery, or osteodystrophy of the phalanx during fetal development.
C. Ectodermal dysplasia – Incorrect. Nail hypoplasia can be observed in ectodermal dysplasia disorders. However, ectodermal dysplasias also present with hair, teeth, and sweat gland abnormalities. Nail changes involve multiple digits and are not specific but can include micronychia with thickening or brittle nails.
D. Nail-patella syndrome – Incorrect. Nail-patella syndrome presents with anonychia or micronychia, along with triangular lunulae, which is commonly bilateral and symmetrical, with severity most pronounced on the thumbs (first fingernails) and less severe moving toward the fifth fingernails.
E. Pachyonychia congenita – Incorrect. Pachyonychia congenita presents with nail thickening and increased curvature, not anonychia or micronychia. Nail changes become evident around 2 to 3 years old. Often, the first and second fingernails are most severely affected; however, in some patients, toenails are more significantly involved.

Interestingly, we found the same mutation, p. Gly568Asp, in Family 4 from South America. The first sign of a skin abnormality in the 25-year-old proband was peeling skin on her feet at age 4 years. Painful, focal keratoses formed on her feet and to a lesser extent on her hands. She has mild periungual hyperkeratosis on her fingers and toes, onychoschizia and longitudinal overcurvature of several toenails. She has no periorificial hyperkeratosis, and her hair is normal (Table 1). No clinical information or DNA samples were available from her parents or from other family members.

A 55-year-old man of European ancestry from Family 5 presented with painful calluses on the soles of his feet. Focal hyperkeratoses with thin surrounding rim of erythema started on his heels as a child when he started to walk and spread to the soles of his feet. He has thin nail plates with koilonychia and sparse, fragile hair. He develops severe hyperhidrosis accompanied by burning pain in the feet and bright erythema on the dorsal hands and feet in response to extremes of temperature. He has no palmar hyperkeratosis, but has had transient perioral and periauricular hyperkeratosis (Figure 1j, k, l, Table 1, Supplementary Figure S1 online). He believes that etretinate and acitretin have significantly improved his quality of life. His father was also affected. A heterozygous missense mutation, p. Gly573Ser; c.1717G > A, the most commonly reported mutation to date in TRPV3, was identified in this individual.

### Pincer nails treated using zigzag nail bed flap method: results of 71 toenails [^325c7613]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In instances of pincer nail deformity, patients complain of pain associated with walking, wearing shoes, or light touching. Cosmetic concerns and difficulties in terms of nail clipping also arise. Achievement of a satisfactory nail form remains elusive.

Objective

To introduce our original surgical procedure and present the satisfactory results.

Materials & Methods

The zigzag nail bed flap method was used on 71 toenails in 49 patients displaying pincer nails (11 male, 38 female; age range 12–88, mean, 48.6). This investigation evaluated 70 nails from the great toe and one nail from a second toe.

Results

No postoperative complications, including pain, infection and conspicuous scars, were evident. The degree of improvement was determined objectively with the width and height indices, revealing the accuracy of this therapeutic measure.

Conclusion

The authors recommend surgical intervention consequent to the vicious cycle corresponding to anatomical abnormalities associated with the nail plate-nail bed-phalanges relationship. Therefore, these architectures should be treated in conjunction rather than singularly.

### Partial matricectomy with a CO ₂ laser for ingrown toenail after nail matrix staining [^ca7616f9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail is a common nail disease that causes pain, discomfort, and difficulty in walking. It is treated with either conservative therapy or surgery.

Objective

To present a new surgical approach to ingrown toenail.

Materials and Methods

For 19 ingrown toenail borders of 14 toes in 14 patients (1 male and 13 females), the nail matrix was stained with methylene blue and then partial matricectomy was performed with a CO2 laser.

Results

There was no recurrence at 18 nail borders after a mean follow-up period of 13.4 months, whereas a spike grew at one border but caused no walking pain. No serious complications occurred. Cosmetic improvement was also satisfactory.

Conclusions

Partial nail matricectomy with a CO2 laser after staining the nail matrix with methylene blue allows visual confirmation of the completeness of cauterization.

### Isolated case of acquired onychodystrophy [^f4e2e54d]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following nail findings are indicative of severe disease presentation?
A. Mottled erythema of the lunula
B. Pterygium
C. Onycholysis
D. Distal nail splitting of < 3 mm in length
E. Subungual hyperkeratosis

Answers:
A. Mottled erythema of the lunula – Incorrect. This finding is consistent with moderate disease presentation of NLP. Additional moderate NLP features include partial fissuring, longitudinal grooves, distal splitting of 3 to 5 mm in length, onycholysis between 25% and 50%, and subungual hyperkeratosis.
B. Pterygium – Correct. Development of pterygium is consistent with severe disease presentation of NLP. Additional findings include complete fissuring, deep grooves, splitting of > 5 mm in length, onycholysis > 50%, diffuse erythema of the lunula, and anonychia.
C. Onycholysis – Incorrect. This finding is consistent with mild disease presentation of NLP. Additional mild NLP features include nail thinning, longitudinal ridging, distal splitting of < 3 mm in length, onycholysis < 25%, and no nail bed hyperkeratosis.
D. Distal nail splitting of < 3 mm in length – Incorrect. This finding is consistent with moderate disease presentation of NLP.
E. Subungual hyperkeratosis – Incorrect. This finding is consistent with moderate disease presentation of NLP.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^ed423292]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Double little toenails, or accessory nails of the fifth toe, are a rare and particular deformity distinct from other nail dysplasias. We describe 4 cases of female patients, including a 6-year-old girl, experiencing this bilateral condition after birth. The nail anomaly shows an autosomal-dominant type of transmission that affects only female individuals. The subjects examined were from a family without marriages between blood relatives and without neuroectodermal hereditary diseases. The 4 patients had no bone alterations of the terminal phalanges of the fifth toe or alterations of the joints of the toes or hair. One patient had nail deformity associated with epilepsy; another patient, associated with an infection of an accessory nail.

Recommendations

Recommendations for assessment and diagnosis

Assessment

(1) In adults, children and young people with suspected or confirmed IA, questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit and, if appropriate, clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken, including disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, gait assessment, footwear, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies. SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 92.

Rationale

The SOR is based on evidence from cross-sectional studies and expert consensus. Clinical assessment should be patient-centred and guided by symptoms and concerns. Foot symptoms should prompt a detailed clinical examination involving an assessment of disease activity, including palpation of the foot joints for localized swelling and tenderness. There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the MTP joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities and gait should be visually assessed, while footwear and any existing insoles should be physically examined for wear. Footwear should also be assessed for motion, width and depth, fastening mechanism and arch support. The overall condition of soft tissues and range of motion in the ankle, subtalar, midfoot and MTP joints should be assessed, in addition to the quality of this motion. Skin and toenails should be assessed for pathologies, including skin disease (e.g. psoriasis), callus, wounds and anhidrosis. An assessment of vascular status, primarily to assess for PAD, and neurological status should be performed given the increased risk of vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy in IA. Assessment findings can be augmented with imaging if appropriate (see recommendation 2). The recommendation that questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit was made in response to qualitative evidence indicating that people with IA are rarely asked about their feet.

In children and young people with IA specifically, age and developmental stage should be taken into consideration when assessing foot health. The foot joints should be assessed as part of the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) and the paediatric Gait Arms Legs and Spine (pGALS) screening. The pGALS is proposed when there are indicators of potential MSK disease and includes an assessment of gait and foot posture.

### A study on the efficacy of ω toenail correction treating paronychia [^fcc67243]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

To study the clinical effects of Ω toenail correction in the treatment of paronychia. One hundred thirty-six cases of 130 patients during the period from August 2018 to August 2021 were treated with Ω toenail correction according to clinical stages, the clinical therapeutic effects of which were evaluated in terms of the operation time, the time to resume movement, treatment cycle, 1-y recurrence rate, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after treatment. The clinical efficacy was analyzed and compared of Ω toenail correction in treating paronychia of different clinical stages. It has been demonstrated that there was no significant difference in operation time, time to resume movement, treatment cycle and recurrence rate among different stages of paronychia, while there existed the significant difference (p < .05) in VAS score of resting-state pain before and after correction which stood at 6.43 ± 0.29 points with the after-treatment VAS scores at 1.10 ± 0.22. There is a statistical difference (p < .05) in VAS score of movement-evoked pain between before and after treatment. The VAS scores of movement-evoked pain stood at 7.55 ± 0.42, which is in contrast with the after-treatment VAS at 1.74 ± 0.93. It has been concluded that Ω toenail correction characterized by easy operation can relieve the pain immediately, which can achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy for treating paronychia of different stages.

### Onychoheterotopia: pathogenesis, presentation, and management of ectopic nail [^13020ce4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Onychoheterotopia is an extremely rare condition in which the nail tissue grows outside the classic nail unit of the dorsal fingers and toes. It presents as either small outgrowths of a deviant nail or a complete double fingernail malformation. The histology of the onychoheterotopia matrix is oftentimes very similar to the normal nail matrix, although it plays a central role in diagnosis.

Objective

We sought to review the current literature on the clinical and histologic aspects of onychoheterotopia.

Methods

A literature search was performed to evaluate peer-reviewed articles on the topic.

Results

Detailed reports have characterized many features of onychoheterotopia. The various etiology and treatment options are reviewed.

Limitations

The study was limited to those articles in the English-language literature.

Conclusions

In this article, we provide a review of the literature based on the current understanding of onychoheterotopia, its diagnosis, and its management.

### Painful thickening of the soles: importance of keeping a wide differential [^bd963469]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Acquired plantar keratoderma refers to the hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles of the feet, which can result from a variety of underlying conditions. Psoriasis, allergic or irritant contact dermatitis and eczema are several causes of acquired plantar psoriasis. This case report describes a female patient in her 50s with plantar keratoderma, initially attributed to psoriasis that was recalcitrant to systemic treatments. Subsequent evaluation suggested the possibility of contact dermatitis triggered by footwear. Allergen avoidance and supportive management led to clinical improvement. This case highlights the critical importance of considering environmental irritants and allergens in the evaluation and management of refractory acquired keratoderma.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^0f49b36e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital malalignment of the great toenails (CMGTs) may result in onychocryptosis, a disappearing nail bed, paronychia, Beau lines, onychomadesis, retronychia, or erosion of the nail bed. Onychomadesis is a spontaneous arrest of the nail plate that leads to nail shedding and is a more severe manifestation of the same pathophysiologic process that produces Beau lines. Onychomadesis is commonly seen as a delayed onset effect of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Infectious diseases, trauma, autoimmune/systemic diseases, and medications may also injure the nail matrix, leading to onychomadesis. Rare cases of idiopathic forms of onychomadesis include familial autosomal dominant inheritance, as well as sporadic genetic mutation. This case illustrates the possible link between CMGT and onychomadesis.

### Occlusive drainage system for split-thickness skin graft: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^e2f6b721]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Split-thickness skin grafts are widely used in reconstruction of large area defects. Conventional postoperative recipient site care includes saline-moistened gauze with a protective layer of petroleum gauze and splints for immobilization. This method causes pain while changing the dressing. We designed a better occlusive drainage system for split-thickness skin grafts. We compared the treatment effect and subjective evaluation of our occlusive drainage system with that of the conventional method for coverage of split-thickness skin grafts.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial was carried out in patients who received split-thickness skin grafts. Patients aged 24–76 years were randomly assigned to the occlusive drainage system or the conventional indirect wet dressing method. The status of graft take, pain, and subjective evaluations were compared.

Results

Twenty-eight participants were enrolled, with 14 in each group. The percentage of graft take was no difference between the 2 groups. No wound infection developed. Patients in the occlusive drainage system group experienced less pain and greater satisfaction. All patients followed up for at least 3 months, and no hypertrophic scar formation was noted.

Conclusion

Comparing with the indirect wet dressing method, this new method is practical for covering split-thickness skin grafts, causes less pain, and provides a better experience for patients.

There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the MTP joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities, gait, range of motion, skin, toenails, and neurological and vascular status should be assessed, and footwear/insoles physically examined.

In children and young people with IA specifically, age and developmental stage should be considered. Foot joints should be assessed as part of Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) and paediatric Gait Arms Legs and SPine (pGALS) screening.

Imaging

2.

Rationale

The SOR is based on cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies, and expert opinion. X-ray, CT, US or MRI may be most appropriate depending on the clinical scenario. MRI is considered the reference standard modality for imaging synovitis and tenosynovitis in IA, and is more sensitive than conventional radiographs for the detection of inflammation. To assess foot health specifically, there is weak evidence for the use of MRI and US. Anyone who performs US should undertake a recognized formal training programme. Recommendations relating to imaging in other IA guidelines should be considered.

### Comparison of phenol matricectomy and nail-splinting with a flexible tube for the treatment of ingrown toenails [^ec3ab330]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of ingrown toenail is usually bothersome for patients and doctors.

Objectives

To compare two treatment techniques of ingrown toenails-phenol matricectomy (PM) and nail-splinting using a flexible tube (FT)-in terms of efficacy, postoperative pain, postoperative cosmetic satisfaction, amount of tissue damage, and recurrence.

Methods and Materials

One hundred twenty ingrown toenails were randomized and divided into PM and FT groups. All cases were evaluated 2 days and 1 and 6 months after treatment. Postoperative pain, cosmetic satisfaction, time to recovery, and recurrence rate were measured.

Results

Postoperative pain was less and cosmetic satisfaction was good in both groups (p < .001). Our recurrence rate was 8.4%. There were no statistical differences between groups in these measures. Tissue improvement rate was 6% in the PM group and 93% in the FT group 2 days after the procedures (p < .001).

Conclusions

Although FT provides faster recovery and less postoperative morbidity than PM, the techniques are equally effective in treating ingrown toenails.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^5de2211d]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinea infections (often called ringworm) are caused by dermatophyte fungi and classified by the body site involved. Tinea corporis and tinea capitis are most common in prepubertal children, and tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea unguium (most common type of onychomycosis) are more likely in adolescents and adults. Clinical diagnosis without testing may be unreliable because other conditions can resemble tinea infections (eg, tinea corporis can be confused with eczema, and onychomycosis with dystrophic toenails from repeated low-level trauma or psoriasis). Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis generally respond to inexpensive topical antifungal agents, but oral antifungal agents may be indicated for patients with extensive disease, lack of response to topical treatment, immunocompromise, or hair follicle involvement (eg, tinea capitis). Oral terbinafine is considered first-line therapy for tinea capitis and onychomycosis because it is well tolerated, effective, and inexpensive. Emerging tinea infections may be more severe than classic tinea infections and generally do not improve with first-line topical or oral antifungals. These infections may require prolonged oral antifungal therapy and specialized diagnostic testing. Antifungal stewardship, including avoiding the use of combination antifungal-corticosteroids, should be emphasized to optimize outcomes and help prevent resistance.

Double toenail is a rare abnormality that usually affects the fifth toe. It is considered as an inherited condition that may represent an incomplete form of polydactyly. Underlying bone abnormalities should be ruled out. We present a case of a double toenail of the second toe, a location that has not previously been described, with underlying bone involvement noted on ultrasound and plain films.

### Is slow nail growth a risk factor for onychomycosis? [^008ea755]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was carried out to determine whether slow nail growth is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis or if onychomycosis results in slow nail growth. Forty-nine patients with unilateral onychomycosis of the great toenail were enrolled and classified in two groups according to the size of affected area, i.e. more than half or less than half of the toenail. The growth rates of affected and unaffected great toenails of all patients were measured. Before a normal appearance was reached, the growth rates of affected great toenails, when the affected area occupied more than half of total nail plate, was slower than that of the unaffected great toenails. After a normal appearance was achieved, there were no differences in growth rates between affected and unaffected great toenails. Therefore, this study of patients with unilateral toenail onychomycosis did not support the hypothesis that slow nail growth rate is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis.

### Nail lichen planus in 81 patients: a retrospective study of clinical characteristics, histopathological features, and long-term treatment outcomes [^d72772cd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design and Participants

We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with isolated NLP from June 2016 to June 2024 at the Department of Dermatology of First Medical Center of PLA General Hospital. Diagnosis of NLP was established based on characteristic clinical features and supported by histopathological confirmation.

Typical clinical features of NLP include nail matrix changes (e.g. longitudinal ridging, splitting, thinning, chromonychia), nail bed involvement (e.g. onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis), nail fold inflammation (e.g. erythema, scaling), and irreversible damage such as dorsal pterygium and anonychia.

Histopathologic diagnosis was made when nail unit biopsy demonstrated a lichenoid interface dermatitis pattern with features such as basal keratinocyte degeneration, a band‐like lymphocytic infiltrate, and hypergranulosis. In late‐stage NLP, histologic changes may be less specific and include disappearance of the nail matrix, replacement of normal epithelial structures with scar tissue, and loss of inflammatory infiltrate. Inclusion criteria were NLP patients confirmed by longitudinal nail biopsy. Patients with incomplete clinical or histopathologic data were excluded. Of the 89 patients screened, 8 patients with incomplete data were excluded, and 81 patients were enrolled. The study received approval from the ethical committee (S2023‐179) of the Chinese PLA General Hospital and adhered to the ethical guidelines at our institution, following the principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration.

2.2 Clinical Data Collection

Clinical data included age, gender, disease duration, potential triggering factors, family history, presence of other lichen planus variants, and coexistence of other autoimmune disorders. Nail involvement was assessed by the number and location of affected nails (fingernails, toenails), associated symptoms, and NLP subtype. Clinical nail presentations were classified anatomically (Figure 1F–I): nail matrix involvement lesions included longitudinal ridging/splitting, onychoschizia, nail plate thinning, leukonychia, melanonychia, erythronychia, red lunula, pitting, pterygium, and atrophy. Nail bed involvement lesions comprised onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and splinter hemorrhages. Nail fold changes included erythema, hypertrophy, or scale lesions in the nail fold. Therapeutic regimens and follow‐up data were recorded.

### Ingrown toenail management… [^bdd5151b]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

SURGICAL THERAPY The goal of surgical intervention is to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and foreign body reaction 2. Surgical techniques involve removing the pressure of the nail plate on the nail fold by excising all or part of the nail plate or by excising all or part of the nail fold.
2. 2 Less recurrence after 12 months with wedge resection and radical excision of the nail fold than with the rotational flap technique was also noted. 2 Prevention of recurrence between wedge resection and radical excision of the nail fold showed no significant difference after 12 months.
2. 28 Segmental phenolization may produce less postprocedure pain and has better postoperative outcomes than sharp excision. 37, 38 Studies of phenol matrixectomy show recurrence rates of 1. 1% to
4. 3% over six to 33 months of follow-up.

28 A Cochrane systematic review found that partial nail avulsion combined with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence than surgical excision without phenolization. POSTPROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS The toe should be rested and preferably elevated during the first 12 to 24 hours. Pain should be minor when matrixectomy is performed because it ablates the nail-bed nerve endings. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen may be used for discomfort. The dressing should be changed in 24 to 48 hours, and normal ambulation may be fully resumed. 10 Overaggressive electrocautery or radiofrequency ablation to the nail matrix may damage the adjacent and underlying fascia or periosteum. If the toe is healing poorly several weeks after the procedure, debridement, oral antibiotics, and radiographic evaluation may be warranted.

11 Granulation tissue and the recess sometimes created by the removal of the nail will gradually resolve to a more normal appearance. Rarely, permanent loss of nail plate, nail-plate dystrophy, or pyogenic granuloma may occur. This article updates previous articles on this topic by Heidelbaugh and Lee, and Zuber. 8 40.

### Onychomycosis: clinical overview and diagnosis [^623a44dd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily life, and impair social interactions. In this continuing medical education series we review the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of onychomycosis and demonstrate current and emerging diagnostic strategies.

### Split second-and third-toe transplantation in mutilating-hand-injury reconstruction [^3c998cf8]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Although bilateral second-toe transplantation has offered a satisfactory solution for multiple toe transplantation when the neighboring amputation stumps present an intact web space, exceptions exist. To provide an alternative and adapt the experience from the established methods, we propose split second- and third-toe transplantation in a 1-stage hand-function reconstruction. Three male patients underwent 4 split second- and third-toe transplantations for fingers amputated distal to the preserved or recreated web space. The average age was 22 years old, and all patients were reconstructed secondarily. No failure of transplantation occurred. All patients achieved restored hand functions for daily and occupational activities. In situations in which multiple lesser toe transplantations are required and harvesting toes from the bilateral foot may be needed, a split second- and third-toe transplantation with a healthy contralateral foot for allowing another toe transfer proves to have a satisfactory functional result and affords an opportunity for simultaneous or staged great toe transplantation.

### Double little toenails: report of 4 familial cases [^ace37130]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

The patients did not report any history of trauma to the foot. The older sister had a staphylococcal infection in one of the abnormal toenails. All patients were healthy and had no skeletal, hair, or tooth abnormalities. The proband had been treated for epilepsy and had paroxysmal tachycardia. The examination showed that these nails, in addition to being small compared with the main nail, were separated from it by a vertical groove that departed from the cuticle up to the hyponychium. These were grayish yellow and the perionychium appeared normal. Dermoscopy of these nails highlighted a proximal fold, lateral nail fold, and the hyponychium. The size varied between 3 and 6 mm in diameter at the base and 4 and 7 mm long. Moreover, some accessory toenails showed a pattern with transverse bands and grooves that were reminiscent of staves of a barrel (Fig 2, B).

Superficial texture of accessory toenails was reproduced by a silicone cast technique. Its analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed a shrunken and stumpy nail with a wrinkled surface (Fig 2, C). Ultrasonography of the fifth toe showed 2 distinct nail plates with 2 matrices, 1 main and a smaller connected one located more laterally. The latter, which is the basis of the double little toenail, appears as a hypoechoic area connected by an offshoot or isthmus to the primary nail matrix portion in an intermediate position (Fig 2 D–F). No abnormalities were observed in karyotype analysis. The radiograph of the feet and the distal phalanx did not show any bone abnormalities. We diagnosed this nail defect according to morphologic criteria as double little toenails. One patient was treated with cryotherapy, followed by the application of a phenol solution. A recurrence was observed 2 years later. The follow-up is 7 years.

### Longitudinal erythronychia: individual or multiple linear red bands of the nail plate: a review of clinical features and associated conditions [^3b4d462c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Longitudinal erythronychia is a linear red band on the nail plate that originates at the proximal nail fold, traverses the lunula, and extends to the free edge of the nail plate. Longitudinal erythronychia is classified based upon the number of nails affected and the number of red streaks present on each nail as follows: type Ia (monodactylous - single band), type Ib (monodactylous - bifid bands), type IIa (polydactylous - single band), and type IIb (polydactylous - multiple bands). Associated morphologic findings that can be present at the distal tip of the nail with longitudinal erythronychia include fragility, onycholysis, splinter hemorrhage, splitting, subungual keratosis, thinning, and V-shaped nick. Some patients with longitudinal erythronychia seek medical evaluation because of pain in the associated distal digit; however, the linear red nail plate dyschromia is often asymptomatic and the individual is concerned about the cosmetic appearance or distal nail fragility. Longitudinal erythronychia can be a clinical manifestation of an underlying local or systemic condition. Benign tumors (glomus tumor, onychopapilloma, and warty dyskeratoma), malignant neoplasms (malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma), and other conditions (hemiplegia and postsurgical scar) can be associated with monodactylous longitudinal erythronychia or it may be idiopathic or the initial stage of polydactylous longitudinal erythronychia-associated systemic conditions. Polydactylous longitudinal erythronychia is most commonly reported in patients with Darier disease (keratosis follicularis); other associated conditions include acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal nevus, acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa, acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf, amyloidosis, graft-versus-host disease, lichen planus, and pseudobulbar syndrome. Polydactylous longitudinal erythronychia has also been observed as an idiopathic finding. Biopsy of the nail matrix and nail bed may be necessary to establish the diagnosis of a longitudinal erythronychia-associated condition. Indeed, a biopsy should be seriously considered in patients aged more than 50 years who present with a monodactylous longitudinal red band to exclude squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment of longitudinal erythronychia depends on the etiology. For patients with longitudinal erythronychia-associated discomfort or severe nail splitting, a surgical excision may provide not only the underlying diagnosis of the nail dyschromia, but also relief of related symptoms.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^091ef718]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.

The patient should be told to:

Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is for external use only.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.
Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).
Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).
Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.
A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.
Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.
Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Brittle nail syndrome: a pathogenesis-based approach with a proposed grading system [^aa64b893]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Brittle nail syndrome is a heterogeneous abnormality, characterized by increased fragility of the nail plate. Brittle nails affect about 20% of the population and women are affected twice as frequently as men. The vast majority of patients experience brittle nails as a significant cosmetic problem and a substantial number indicate that these nail abnormalities are painful, impair daily activities, and may have a negative impact on occupational abilities. Pathogenic factors leading to brittle nails are factors that impair intercellular adhesion of the corneocytes of the nail plate or factors that cause a pathologic nail formation by involving the matrix. Clinical features of brittle nail syndrome are onychoschizia and onychorrhexis: the impairment of intercellular adhesive factors of the nail plate is expressed as onychoschizia, whereas the involvement of the nail matrix is expressed as onychorrhexis. Although impairment of life quality has not been evaluated for patients with brittle nail syndrome, the reduction of life quality in other nail problems has been studied and is evident. A proposed scoring system of key features of brittle nails is presented, and therapeutic approaches focussed on the pathogenic factors are discussed.

### Congenital curved nail of the fourth toe: report of three cases and review of the literature [^b3c53b92]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital curved nail of the fourth toe (CNFT) is a rare disorder in which the nail plate of the fourth toe is deformed as it curves toward the sole of the foot. The cause is still unknown, but the congenital deformity of the nail plate is thought to be due to shortening of the terminal phalanx and hypoplasia of soft tissue of the fourth toe. Here, we report three typical cases who presented congenital curving nail on both their fourth toes. Their X-ray showed that the distal phalanges of the fourth toes were short. Thus far, 19 cases of CNFT were reported in English literature. Interestingly, almost all cases have been from Asia (18 out of 19). The majority of the cases were bilateral and asymptomatic. Tenderness was seen in eight cases, which was caused by the pressure of the nail plate on the skin or ingrown nail. Treatment is basically unnecessary for the deformity, but it is important to teach safe and appropriate nail clipping methods to avoid pain. We can easily diagnose CNFT because of the characteristic clinical presentation and should provide appropriate advice on the nail care from early stage.

### Palmoplantar keratoderma in a middle-aged male [^8c51552d]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

A 50-year-old male presented with thick, diffuse plaques over the palms and soles of the feet and a congenital form of sensorineural hearing loss (Fig 1). He was unable to work and required a full-time carer for activities of daily living due to limited dexterity and pain associated with fine movements of the hands and feet. There was a strong family history of palmoplantar keratoderma with a biological father, brother, daughter, 2 nephews and a paternal grandmother also being affected. On examination, there was evidence of honeycomb pattern of hyperkeratosis over the palms and soles of the feet and a "starfish"-shaped hyperkeratosis over the knuckles causing digital constricting bands. There were no ocular defects.

Fig 1
Figure 1 Clinical photograph demonstrating diffuse thickened plaques over the palms and soles of the feet.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Olmsted syndrome
B. Vohwinkel syndrome
C. Huriez syndrome
D. Punctate keratoderma
E. Hereditary painful callosities

Answers:
A. Olmsted syndrome — Incorrect. Olmsted syndrome is not associated with sensorineural hearing loss.
B. Vohwinkel syndrome — Correct. The classical presentation of Vohwinkel syndrome includes a honeycomb pattern of hyperkeratosis over the palms and soles of the feet, sensorineural hearing impairment and a "starfish"-shaped hyperkeratosis typically over the knuckles which may cause digital constricting bands.
C. Huriez syndrome — Incorrect. This condition presents with the triad of congenital sclero-atrophy, hypoplastic nails, and palmoplantar keratoderma.
D. Punctate keratoderma — Incorrect. This condition presents with small round bumps along the palms and soles as opposed to thick, diffuse plaques.
E. Hereditary painful callosities — Incorrect. This condition presents with keratotic lesions over pressure points over the palms and soles; a pattern not demonstrated here.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^db0747fc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

Eleven-year-old male monozygotic twins presented with a lifelong history of abnormal growth and discoloration of the bilateral great and second toenails. The past medical history for the first twin was significant for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for communicating hydrocephalus at birth and surgical occlusion of a patent ductus arteriosus and unremarkable for the second twin. During infancy, both the twins had abnormal first and second toenail plates. Neither twin had any toenail pain or pain with ambulation. Fungal cultures of the great toenail clippings demonstrated no fungal growth. There was no improvement following a therapeutic trial of griseofulvin 20 mg/kg for 4 months and oral terbinafine 125 mg daily for 12 weeks.

Physical examination of both twins revealed yellow discoloration, lateral deviation of the great toenail, and multiple complete transverse indentations with nail plate separations (Beau lines) involving the first and second toenail plates (Fig 1). Several nail plate separations were full thickness, illustrating a complete spontaneous arrest of the nail matrix. Due to the onset, presentation, and chronic condition of their toenails, both patients were diagnosed with onychomadesis secondary to CMGT.

Fig 1
A and B, Twins with bilateral congenital malalignment of the great toenails showed complete transverse indentations associated with arrest of nail growth.

The patients were instructed to wear properly fitted shoes, practice good nail hygiene, and trim nails horizontally and not round at the edges to decrease the chances of an ingrowing nail. Surgical intervention, such as complete nail matrixectomy, was not recommended for these asymptomatic twins.

### Onchomycosis: an overview [^41850420]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, more common in toenails than in fingernails, and caused by a variety of fungi including dermatophytes, nondermatophyte molds, and <em> Candida. </em> There are 4 to 5 subtypes related to the method of fungal invasion of the nail unit, the most common being distal lateral subungual onychomycosis. Here the fungus enters the distal lateral part of the nail bed, the region of the hyponychium, often as an extension of tinea pedis. Hyperkeratosis occurs under the nail plate, resulting in detachment of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis), with subungual thickening.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 [^dd67910d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 49-year-old previously healthy man presented with progressively worsening skin lesions and arthritis. Roughly 1 week after receiving the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, he developed a painful rash and swelling of the right foot, with progression of the rash to the left foot and penis. He did not have any preceding genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. His primary care provider diagnosed a bacterial infection and prescribed a 2-week course of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. He then received a 10-day course of prednisone 20 mg daily for joint pains. Over the next 2 weeks, he developed worsening arthritis of the shoulders, hands, and feet. At this time, he received prescriptions for gabapentin 600 mg and nifedipine 30 mg once daily for a presumed diagnosis of chilblains. The patient's cutaneous and systemic symptoms persisted, and he experienced an unintentional weight loss of approximately 20 pounds.

The patient presented to our emergency department approximately 2 months after the onset of his rash. Physical examination revealed pink papulopustules and keratoderma on the plantar aspects of the feet (Fig 1, A and B), extensive onycholysis, nail thickening, and subungual debris of the toenails (Fig 1, C); tender edema of the right foot and joints of the right hand (Fig 1, D and E), and a scaly erythematous plaque on the penis (Fig 1, F). Laboratory workup showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an elevated level of C-reactive protein. Blood and urine cultures were negative. HLA-B27 testing by flow cytometry was indeterminate. Further HLA-B27 genotyping was not performed; a definitive result was therefore not obtained. Additionally, the patient tested negative for syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

Methods

Study design

The study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2018 as a multicenter, open‐label, single‐arm study in 36 facilities nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with severe (> 50% clinical involvement) onychomycosis and the efficacy of long‐term use of EFCZ for more than 1 year. We also obtained information on patient QOL with EFCZ therapy. The study was conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects, with the approval of the appropriate ethics committee. Upon participating in the research, all the patients were given a written explanation of the study before they provided written informed consent.

Subjects

The subjects included in the study were male or female patients aged 20 years or older (at the time of informed consent) who provided written consent and were diagnosed with onychomycosis in either the left or right great toenail (target nail). The lesion should be definitely diagnosed using a potassium hydroxide examination, with 20% or more clinical involvement of the affected great toenail (not reaching the proximal nail fold), and the growth of the target nail (requiring nail clipping at least once a month) should be confirmed by consultation (regardless of the nail thickness). If both the left and right great toenails were affected, the target nail with the larger clinical involvement was selected. In case the clinical involvement was of the same size, then the right nail was chosen.

The following subjects were excluded: (i) patients with either proximal subungual onychomycosis or total dystrophic onychomycosis; (ii) patients with nail psoriasis, lichen planus of the nails, palmoplantar pustulosis of the nails, and complicated nail deformation due to causes other than onychomycosis such as dystrophia unguium; (iii) patients who received EFCZ, oral antifungals or any topical therapeutic drug for onychomycosis within 3 months before the date of informed consent; (iv) patients scheduled to use concomitant medications or combination therapies (oral antifungals, topical therapeutic medicine for onychomycosis other than EFCZ, laser irradiation, occlusive dressing therapy such as urea ointment; removal of nail thickening is allowed) during the period of participation in this study; and (v) patients with negative fungal culture (confirmed at the time of research enrollment after informed consent).

Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death, with DAYTRANA use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms, such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Priapism

Advise patients, caregivers, and family members of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism). Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention in the event of priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Circulation problems in fingers and toes [Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon] [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with DAYTRANA about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon, and in associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red.
Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.
Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while using DAYTRANA.
Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.
