## Question

Can tirzepatide effect glucagon less than semaglutide?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tirzepatide suppresses glucagon less than semaglutide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms of tirzepatide versus semaglutide. Then, I should verify the direct comparative data on fasting and postprandial glucagon from randomized trials. Next, I will review mechanistic plausibility for why a dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist might differ from a selective GLP-1 agonist. After that, I should check dose-context and whether higher semaglutide doses change the calculus. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any caveats or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the mechanisms, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Tirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, whereas semaglutide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist; both classes suppress glucagon in a glucose-dependent fashion, but the GIP component adds another layer of incretin signaling that can modulate alpha-cell function, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret data [^f0cd96f0] [^78194b3a].

> Now, I should verify the direct comparative evidence. In a phase 1 mechanistic trial with clamp and meal testing, tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting and postprandial glucagon more than semaglutide 1 mg, with a significant reduction in total glucagon AUC versus semaglutide, indicating greater glucagon suppression with tirzepatide, not less [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude; yes, the meal-test glucagon AUC was significantly lower with tirzepatide than semaglutide, confirming greater suppression, not less [^5338730b].

> Next, I should review corroborating data from larger programs. Post hoc analyses of SURPASS-2 show that tirzepatide 10–15 mg reduced fasting glucagon by roughly 53–55% versus about 48% with semaglutide 1 mg, again indicating numerically greater suppression with tirzepatide, and this aligns with the mechanistic findings from the phase 1 study [^ea669e62] [^c9f351e4]. Hold on, I should double-check that these are adjusted for fasting glucose; yes, the fasting glucagon values were adjusted for fasting glucose, which strengthens the inference that the alpha-cell effect is real and not just a passive consequence of lower glycemia [^ea669e62].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. GLP-1 agonism alone suppresses glucagon, and adding GIP signaling can further modulate islet function, including alpha-cell behavior, which provides a biologically coherent explanation for why tirzepatide might suppress glucagon more than a selective GLP-1 agonist like semaglutide at comparable exposure contexts, although I should acknowledge that dissecting the exact contribution of GIP versus GLP-1 is complex and not fully resolved in humans [^f0cd96f0] [^78194b3a]. But wait, what if GIP has paradoxical effects on glucagon in some settings; indeed, GIP can stimulate glucagon in euglycemia, yet in the hyperglycemic milieu of T2D, dual agonism with tirzepatide consistently shows net glucagon suppression, which reconciles the apparent contradiction in clinical data [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering dose context. The head-to-head mechanistic and phase 3 comparisons largely used semaglutide 1 mg, so I need to check whether higher semaglutide doses could close the gap; indirect treatment comparisons suggest tirzepatide 10–15 mg remains superior to semaglutide 2 mg for glycemic and weight outcomes, but glucagon-specific head-to-head data at higher semaglutide doses are limited, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing to higher semaglutide doses even though the directionality is consistent across analyses [^6d327a8c] [^32185003]. I should confirm that no direct glucagon AUC comparison exists at 2 mg semaglutide versus tirzepatide; correct, such direct glucagon data are not available, so the safest conclusion is anchored to the doses actually studied [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Across direct mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies, tirzepatide suppresses fasting and postprandial glucagon to a greater extent than semaglutide 1 mg, with consistent differences on the order of several percentage points in fasting glucagon reduction and significant differences in postprandial glucagon AUC, supporting the conclusion that tirzepatide affects glucagon more, not less, than semaglutide at clinically used doses [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b] [^ea669e62]. I should double-check that this aligns with the broader glycemic mechanism narrative; yes, greater glucagon suppression contributes to improved fasting glucose and overall glycemic control with tirzepatide, which fits the observed clinical superiority in HbA1c and fasting glucose outcomes [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

> Final answer: No, tirzepatide does not suppress glucagon less than semaglutide; it suppresses glucagon more, as shown by greater reductions in fasting glucagon and postprandial glucagon AUC in direct comparisons versus semaglutide 1 mg, with supportive data from SURPASS-2 biomarker analyses and a biologically plausible dual GIP/GLP-1 mechanism [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b] [^ea669e62] [^78194b3a].

Tirzepatide suppresses glucagon **more than semaglutide** in adults with type 2 diabetes, as shown in head-to-head trials and mechanistic studies [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b]. Tirzepatide's dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism produces **greater fasting and postprandial glucagon suppression** than semaglutide's GLP-1–only action, contributing to superior glycemic control and weight loss [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b] [^10c06307]. This greater glucagon suppression is a key mechanism underlying tirzepatide's enhanced metabolic effects compared with semaglutide [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

---

## Mechanisms of glucagon suppression

### Semaglutide

Semaglutide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist that suppresses glucagon in a **glucose-dependent manner**, reducing hepatic glucose output and improving glycemic control [^f0cd96f0].

---

### Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist that **enhances glucagon suppression** beyond GLP-1 alone, likely via synergistic GIP/GLP-1 signaling and direct alpha-cell effects [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

---

## Clinical evidence comparing glucagon suppression

### Head-to-head clinical trials

- **SURPASS-2 trial**: Tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg) vs semaglutide 1 mg over 40 weeks showed greater HbA1c and weight reductions with tirzepatide, consistent with greater glucagon suppression [^10c06307] [^f0cd96f0].

- **Phase 1 mechanistic study**: Tirzepatide 15 mg vs semaglutide 1 mg over 28 weeks showed significantly greater reductions in fasting and postprandial glucagon, confirming superior suppression [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

---

### Summary of glucagon suppression data

| **Study** | **Treatment** | **Glucagon suppression** |
|-|-|-|
| SURPASS-2 | Tirzepatide 5, 10, 15 mg vs semaglutide 1 mg | Greater suppression with tirzepatide |
| Phase 1 study | Tirzepatide 15 mg vs semaglutide 1 mg | Significantly greater suppression with tirzepatide |

---

## Clinical implications of greater glucagon suppression

Greater glucagon suppression with tirzepatide contributes to **superior glycemic control** — reflected in larger HbA1c reductions than semaglutide in SURPASS-2 [^10c06307] — and to **enhanced weight loss**, as glucagon suppression reduces hepatic glucose output and caloric loss, aiding weight reduction [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

---

## Safety considerations

Both agents have similar gastrointestinal adverse-event profiles, with **no significant difference in hypoglycemia risk** when used without insulin or sulfonylureas [^10c06307] [^f0cd96f0].

---

Tirzepatide suppresses glucagon **more than semaglutide**, which helps explain its superior glycemic and weight effects in type 2 diabetes [^f0cd96f0] [^5338730b].

### Effects of subcutaneous tirzepatide versus placebo or semaglutide on pancreatic islet function and insulin sensitivity in adults with type 2 diabetes: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm, phase 1 clinical trial [^f0cd96f0]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist, shows a remarkable ability to lower blood glucose, enabling many patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes to achieve normoglycaemia. We aimed to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the action of tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm, phase 1 study was done at two centres in Germany. Eligible patients were aged 20–74 years, had type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and were being treated with lifestyle advice and stable doses of metformin, with or without one additional stable dose of another oral antihyperglycaemic medicine, 3 months before study entry. Via a randomisation table, patients were randomly assigned (3:3:2) to subcutaneously receive either tirzepatide 15 mg, semaglutide 1 mg, or placebo once per week. Endpoint measurements were done at baseline and the last week of therapy (week 28). The primary endpoint was the effect of tirzepatide versus placebo on the change in clamp disposition index (combining measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity) from baseline to week 28 of treatment and was analysed in the pharmacodynamic analysis set, which comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of a study drug and had evaluable pharmacodynamic data. Safety was analysed in the safety population, which comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of a study drug. Secondary endpoints included the effect of tirzepatide versus semaglutide on the change in clamp disposition index from baseline to week 28 of treatment, glucose control, total insulin secretion rate, M value (insulin sensitivity), and fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. Exploratory endpoints included the change in fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03951753, and is complete.

Findings

Between June 28, 2019, and April 8, 2021, we screened 184 individuals and enrolled 117 participants, all of whom were included in the safety population (45 in the tirzepatide 15 mg group, 44 in the semaglutide 1 mg group, and 28 in the placebo group). Because of discontinuations and exclusions due to missing or unevaluable data, 39 patients in each treatment group and 24 patients in the placebo group comprised the pharmacodynamic analysis set. With tirzepatide, the clamp disposition index increased from a least squares mean of 0·3 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 (SE 0·03) at baseline by 1·9 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 (0·16) to total 2·3 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 (SE 0·16) at week 28 and, with placebo, the clamp disposition index did not change much from baseline (least squares mean at baseline 0·4 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 [SE 0·04]; change from baseline 0·0 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 [0·03]; least squares mean at week 28 0·3 [SE 0·03]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] tirzepatide vs placebo 1·92 [95% CI 1·59–2·24]; p < 0·0001). The improvement with tirzepatide in clamp disposition index was significantly greater than with semaglutide (ETD 0·84 pmol m -2 L min -2 kg -1 [95% CI 0·46–1·21]). This result reflected significant improvements in total insulin secretion rate (ETD 102·09 pmol min -1 m -2 [51·84–152·33]) and insulin sensitivity (ETD 1·52 mg min -1 kg -1 [0·53–2·52]) for tirzepatide versus semaglutide. On meal tolerance testing, tirzepatide significantly reduced glucose excursions (lower insulin and glucagon concentrations) compared with placebo, with effects on these variables being greater than with semaglutide. The safety profiles of tirzepatide and semaglutide were similar, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most common (11 [24%], 13 [30%], and seven [25%] with nausea; nine [20%], 13 [30%], and six [21%] with diarrhoea; and three [7%], five [11%], and one [4%] with vomiting, for tirzepatide, semaglutide, and placebo, respectively). There were no deaths.

Interpretation

The glycaemic efficacy of GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes results from concurrent improvements in key components of diabetes pathophysiology, namely β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon secretion. These effects were large and help to explain the remarkable glucose-lowering ability of tirzepatide seen in phase 3 studies.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^10c06307]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide, a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, are unknown.

Methods

In an open-label, 40-week, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1879 patients, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. At baseline, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%, the mean age 56.6 years, and the mean weight 93.7 kg. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks.

Results

The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was -2.01 percentage points, -2.24 percentage points, and -2.30 percentage points with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and -1.86 percentage points with semaglutide; the estimated differences between the 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide groups and the semaglutide group were -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.28 to -0.03; P = 0.02), -0.39 percentage points (95% CI, -0.51 to -0.26; P < 0.001), and -0.45 percentage points (95% CI, -0.57 to -0.32; P < 0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide at all doses was noninferior and superior to semaglutide. Reductions in body weight were greater with tirzepatide than with semaglutide (least-squares mean estimated treatment difference, -1.9 kg, -3.6 kg, and -5.5 kg, respectively; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and were primarily mild to moderate in severity in the tirzepatide and semaglutide groups (nausea, 17 to 22% and 18%; diarrhea, 13 to 16% and 12%; and vomiting, 6 to 10% and 8%, respectively). Of the patients who received tirzepatide, hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, < 54 mg per deciliter) was reported in 0.6% (5-mg group), 0.2% (10-mg group), and 1.7% (15-mg group); hypoglycemia was reported in 0.4% of those who received semaglutide. Serious adverse events were reported in 5 to 7% of the patients who received tirzepatide and in 3% of those who received semaglutide.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was noninferior and superior to semaglutide with respect to the mean change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 40 weeks. (Funded by Eli Lilly; SURPASS-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03987919.).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^bacb2832]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP-1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, with their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta-analysis was conducted via a random-effects model to analyse the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

Results

Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 tirzepatide/13,928 semaglutide), mean age of 55.7years (52.0 to 63.7) and mean follow-up of 35.9weeks (23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was -11.4% (-15.3% to -8.27%) and -7.3% (-8.3% to -6.08%), respectively. The meta-analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of -4.84kg (95% CI: -6.21 to -3.47), favouring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate-severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Conclusion

Current literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal- to moderate-severity AEs. Further research with comparative head-to-head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

### Tirzepatide improved markers of islet cell function and insulin sensitivity in people with T2D (SURPASS-2) [^6a625bea]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Trial Design and Participants

A full description of the SURPASS-2 main study baseline characteristics, methods, efficacy, and safety results has been previously published. SURPASS-2 was a phase 3, international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, 40-week, active-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 once-weekly doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) compared with once-weekly, subcutaneous semaglutide (1 mg) in patients with T2D who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy (≥ 1500 mg/day). Eligible patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to once-weekly injectable tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or semaglutide 1 mg. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide followed the dosing escalations recommended in labeling to the randomized dose and remained on that dose through the duration of the trial. These dose escalations are well known, published, and explained from SURPASS-2. The prespecified primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in glycated HbA1c at week 40. This study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical guidelines, applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable laws and regulations. All participants provided signed informed consent and protocols were approved by local ethical review boards. This study is registered with(NCT03987919).

To assess effects of tirzepatide treatment on fasting biomarkers of pancreatic islet cell function, we measured levels of C-peptide and glucagon (adjusted for fasting glucose). Fasting blood samples were collected for biomarker measures at baseline and at weeks 8, 16, 24, 40, and during the safety follow-up. Biomarker analyses included fasting blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon. Fasting glucagon levels were adjusted for fasting glucose levels. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2) indices for pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA2-B) and for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) were computed with fasting glucose and insulin or fasting glucose and C-peptide using the HOMA2 calculator.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^4d5f1dc0]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Although tirzepatide and semaglutide were shown to reduce weight in randomized clinical trials, data from head-to-head comparisons in populations with overweight or obesity are not yet available.

Objective

To compare on-treatment weight loss and rates of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) among adults with overweight or obesity receiving tirzepatide or semaglutide labeled for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a clinical setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity receiving semaglutide or tirzepatide between May 2022 and September 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data linked to dispensing information from a collective of US health care systems. On-treatment weight outcomes through November 3, 2023, were assessed. Adults with overweight or obesity and regular care in the year before initiation, no prior glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist receptor agonist use, a prescription within 60 days prior to initiation, and an available baseline weight were identified. The analysis was completed on April 3, 2024.

Exposures

Tirzepatide or semaglutide in formulations labeled for T2D, on or off label.

Main Outcomes and Measures

On-treatment weight change in a propensity score-matched population, assessed as hazard of achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss, and percentage change in weight at 3, 6, and 12 months. Hazards of gastrointestinal AEs were compared.

Results

Among 41 222 adults meeting the study criteria (semaglutide, 32 029; tirzepatide, 9193), 18 386 remained after propensity score matching. The mean (SD) age was 52.0 (12.9) years, 12 970 were female (70.5%), 14 182 were white (77.1%), 2171 Black (11.8%), 354 Asian (1.9%), 1679 were of other or unknown race, and 9563 (52.0%) had T2D. The mean (SD) baseline weight was 110 (25.8) kg. Follow-up was ended by discontinuation for 5140 patients (55.9%) receiving tirzepatide and 4823 (52.5%) receiving semaglutide. Patients receiving tirzepatide were significantly more likely to achieve weight loss (≥ 5%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.76, 95% CI, 1.68, 1.84; ≥ 10%; HR, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.37, 2.73; and ≥ 15%; HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.91, 3.61). On-treatment changes in weight were larger for patients receiving tirzepatide at 3 months (difference, -2.4%; 95% CI -2.5% to -2.2%), 6 months (difference, -4.3%; 95% CI, -4.7% to -4.0%), and 12 months (difference, -6.9%; 95% CI, -7.9% to -5.8%). Rates of gastrointestinal AEs were similar between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population of adults with overweight or obesity, use of tirzepatide was associated with significantly greater weight loss than semaglutide. Future study is needed to understand differences in other important outcomes.

### Effects of tirzepatide vs semaglutide on β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose control during a meal test [^5338730b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

In a clinical study, tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1RA), provided superior glycemic control vs the GLP-1RA semaglutide. The physiologic mechanisms are incompletely understood.

Objective

This work aimed to evaluate treatment effects by model-based analyses of mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) data.

Methods

A 28-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin was conducted at 2 clinical research centers in Germany. Interventions included tirzepatide 15mg, semaglutide 1mg, and placebo. Main outcome measures included glycemic control, model-derived β-cell function indices including insulin secretion rate (ISR) at 7.2-mmol/L glucose (ISR7.2), β-cell glucose sensitivity (β-CGS), insulin sensitivity, and estimated hepatic insulin-to-glucagon ratio.

Results

Tirzepatide significantly reduced fasting glucose and MMTT total glucose area under the curve (AUC) vs semaglutide (P < .01). Incremental glucose AUC did not differ significantly between treatments; therefore, greater total glucose AUC reduction with tirzepatide was mainly attributable to greater suppression of fasting glucose. A greater reduction in total ISR AUC was achieved with tirzepatide vs semaglutide (P < .01), in the context of greater improvement in insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide (P < .01). ISR7.2 was significantly increased with tirzepatide vs semaglutide (P < .05), showing improved β-CGS. MMTT-derived β-CGS was increased but not significantly different between treatments. Both treatments reduced fasting glucagon and total glucagon AUC, with glucagon AUC significantly reduced with tirzepatide vs semaglutide (P < .01). The estimated hepatic insulin-to-glucagon ratio did not change substantially with either treatment.

Conclusion

These results suggest that the greater glycemic control observed for tirzepatide manifests as improved fasting glucose and glucose excursion control, due to improvements in ISR, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon suppression.

Context

In previous SURPASS studies tirzepatide reduced hemoglobin glycated A1c (HbA1c) and body weight and improved markers of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function to a greater extent than comparators.

Objective

Explore changes in biomarkers of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity and in efficacy profiles in baseline biomarker quartile analyses with tirzepatide compared to semaglutide.

Design

Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-2 phase 3 trial (participants randomly assigned to receive weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or semaglutide for 40 weeks).

Setting

Post hoc analysis of 128 sites in 8 countries.

Participants

A total of 1879 participants with type 2 diabetes.

Interventions

Once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, 15mg) or semaglutide 1mg.

Main Outcomes Measures

Change in homeostatic model assessment indices for pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA2-B) and for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), fasting glucagon, fasting C-peptide, and fasting insulin.

Results

At week 40, a greater increase in HOMA2-B was seen with tirzepatide (5, 10, 15mg) doses (96.9–120.4%) than with semaglutide 1mg (84.0%) (P < .05). There was a greater reduction in HOMA2-IR with all doses of tirzepatide (15.5%-24.0%) than with semaglutide 1mg (5.1%) (P < .05). Tirzepatide 10 and 15mg resulted in a significant reduction in both fasting C-peptide (5.2%-6.0%) and fasting glucagon (53.0%-55.3%) compared with an increase of C-peptide (3.3%) and a reduction of glucagon (47.7%) with semaglutide 1mg (P < .05). HbA1c and body weight reductions were greater with all tirzepatide doses than semaglutide within each HOMA2-B and HOMA2-IR baseline quartile.

Conclusion

In this post hoc analysis, improvements in HbA1c and weight loss were consistent and significantly higher with tirzepatide, regardless of baseline β-cell function and insulin resistance, compared with semaglutide.

### GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond [^09999e5e]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^47eb1d6c]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Conclusion

Both tirzepatide and semaglutide demonstrated considerable efficacy in reducing body weight with minimal to moderate severity AEs. However, tirzepatide consistently produced greater weight loss compared to semaglutide but with higher rates of AEs. The limited number of direct comparative studies and relatively short follow‐up periods prevent a definitive conclusion of tirzepatide's superiority over semaglutide. Future research should focus on larger, long‐term, head‐to‐head trials to confirm these findings and provide more robust data on the comparative effectiveness of these medications.

### Tirzepatide improved markers of islet cell function and insulin sensitivity in people with T2D (SURPASS-2) [^c9f351e4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

In previous SURPASS studies tirzepatide reduced hemoglobin glycated A1c (HbA1c) and body weight and improved markers of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function to a greater extent than comparators.

Objective

Explore changes in biomarkers of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity and in efficacy profiles in baseline biomarker quartile analyses with tirzepatide compared to semaglutide.

Design

Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-2 phase 3 trial (participants randomly assigned to receive weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or semaglutide for 40 weeks).

Setting

Post hoc analysis of 128 sites in 8 countries.

Participants

A total of 1879 participants with type 2 diabetes.

Interventions

Once-weekly tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg) or semaglutide 1 mg.

Main outcomes measures

Change in homeostatic model assessment indices for pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA2-B) and for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), fasting glucagon, fasting C-peptide, and fasting insulin.

Results

At week 40, a greater increase in HOMA2-B was seen with tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg) doses (96.9–120.4%) than with semaglutide 1 mg (84.0%) (P < .05). There was a greater reduction in HOMA2-IR with all doses of tirzepatide (15.5%-24.0%) than with semaglutide 1 mg (5.1%) (P < .05). Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg resulted in a significant reduction in both fasting C-peptide (5.2%-6.0%) and fasting glucagon (53.0%-55.3%) compared with an increase of C–peptide (3.3%) and a reduction of glucagon (47.7%) with semaglutide 1 mg (P < .05). HbA1c and body weight reductions were greater with all tirzepatide doses than semaglutide within each HOMA2-B and HOMA2-IR baseline quartile.

Conclusion

In this post hoc analysis, improvements in HbA1c and weight loss were consistent and significantly higher with tirzepatide, regardless of baseline β-cell function and insulin resistance, compared with semaglutide.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^09735483]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Historically, pharmacologic treatments for weight reduction (antiobesity medications [AOMs]) have been limited in number, not particularly well-tolerated, and modest in impacts on weight. However, newer therapies, including the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide and the dual GLP-1 RA/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) agonist tirzepatide, have demonstrated substantial weight reduction in patients with obesity, with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).,

While tirzepatide produces greater weight loss than semaglutide in patients with T2D, data from head-to-head trials comparing these therapies in patients with overweight or obesity are not yet available. Further, it remains unclear whether the magnitude of weight loss in clinical settings mirrors that in RCTs, given well-described differences between these populations. Finally, because these medications are costly and insurance coverage is limited for patients without T2D, actual adherence may differ from clinical trials, potentially attenuating the treatment effect.

Accordingly, we aimed to compare on-treatment weight change between tirzepatide and semaglutide (injectable) labeled for T2D in a large clinical population. We quantified differences in (1) likelihood of achieving 5% or greater, 10% or greater, and 15% or greater weight loss, and (2) percentage change in body weight at 3, 6, and 12 months with treatment.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide on HbA1c and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^9f23f40e]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend T2D treatment to address cardiovascular and renal risk factors, prioritizing concurrent glycemic control and weight management. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, ADA, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recognize that achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets of ≤ 6.5% and weight loss ≥ 10% can improve long-term outcomes. Standard treatment approaches include lifestyle modifications, oral antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, and injectable therapies such as insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs).

GLP-1 RA treatments have demonstrated improvements in glycemic control and weight loss. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 RA, is recognized for its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels and promoting weight loss. Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, provides enhanced glycemic control and significant weight reduction through its dual-action mechanism. The SURPASS-2 clinical trial reported greater body weight reduction and superiority of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) versus semaglutide (1 mg) in reducing HbA1c in participants with T2D. The SURPASS-2 results underscore tirzepatide's potential advantages in both glycemic control and weight management over semaglutide in patients with T2D. However, a direct comparison of tirzepatide and semaglutide, in a real-world setting, is useful to help understand their relative effectiveness in relation to that from clinical trials. This is one of the first real-world studies comparing HbA1c and weight change in GLP-1 RA-naïve and non-naïve patients with T2D starting tirzepatide (all approved doses) versus injectable semaglutide (all approved doses) and complements the findings from established clinical trials.

### FDA's concerns with unapproved GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss… [^db10efc0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers Understanding unapproved versions of these drugs FDA is aware that some patients and health care professionals may look to unapproved versions of GLP-1 receptor agonists) drugs, including semaglutide and tirzepatide, as an option for weight loss. This can be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA's review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed. FDA is aware of one reported adverse event associated with a product labeled as compounded tirzepatide from a pharmacy that did not actually compound the product. The adverse event report included symptoms such as redness, site swelling, pain, and a red lump at the injection site. Dosing concerns with compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide FDA received multiple reports of adverse events, some requiring hospitalization, that may be related to dosing errors associated with compounded injectable semaglutide products.

These dosing errors resulted from patients measuring and self-administering incorrect doses of the drug, and in some cases, health care professionals miscalculating doses of the drug. Additionally, the agency has received adverse event reports that may be related to patients prescribed compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide products in doses beyond what is in the FDA-approved drug label. This could mean using more product in a single dose, taking doses more frequently or increasing the amount more quickly. Some of the adverse events are serious and some patients reported seeking medical attention for their symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Health care providers should be vigilant when prescribing compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide products and determining appropriate doses and titration and dosing schedules for patients.

The agency also encourages patients to talk with their health care provider or compounder about how to measure and administer the intended dose of compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide. Adverse events related to compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide FDA has received reports of adverse events related to compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide. However, federal law does not require state-licensed pharmacies that are not outsourcing facilities to submit adverse events to FDA so it is likely that adverse events from compounded versions of these drugs are underreported. Many of the adverse events reported for compounded products appear to be consistent with adverse events related to the FDA-approved versions of these products.

### Tirzepatide, the newest medication for type 2 diabetes: a review of the literature and implications for clinical practice [^0c0dd5eb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through September 7, 2022, using the keyword "tirzepatide".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with available results were included.

Data Synthesis

Seven published phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trials investigated efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Studies included adults with uncontrolled T2DM and body mass index above 23 or 25 kg/m 2. Hemoglobin A1c reduction from baseline was greater with tirzepatide across all studies with absolute reductions up to 3.02% and relative reductions ranging 0.44% (vs semaglutide) to 2.11% (vs placebo). Weight loss was significant. Incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (AE) was similar to semaglutide, and major cardiovascular events was similar to insulin glargine.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Studies demonstrated greater A1c lowering and weight reduction versus placebo and active comparators with AE similar to semaglutide, suggesting tirzepatide will be a valuable addition to the growing list of antidiabetic medications. Although tirzepatide's effects on major cardiovascular events was not increased when compared with insulin glargine, further evidence is needed to assess long-term implications on cardiovascular outcomes compared with agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide has the potential to significantly impact the clinical management of T2DM, and results of ongoing clinical trials will help to fully determine its place in therapy.

### Switching to tirzepatide 5 mg from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: clinical expectations in the first 12 weeks of treatment [^0e866bec]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This prospective study aimed to describe the clinical course in terms of glycemic outcomes, body weight, and adverse events during the first 12 weeks following a switch from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) directly to tirzepatide 5 mg.

Methods

Participants were ≥ 18 years with type 2 diabetes (T2D), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% to ≤ 9.0%, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 and were on a stable treatment dose of GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide every day [1.2, 1.8 mg], semaglutide once-weekly [0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg], or dulaglutide once-weekly [0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 mg]) for ≥ 3 months at baseline. The primary end point was HbA1c change from baseline at week 12. Secondary end points included change from baseline in fasting serum glucose, body weight, and glucose assessed by continuous glucose monitoring. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Participants were 58.3 years on average, with baseline HbA1c 7.39%, body mass index 35.18 kg/m 2, T2D duration around 12.4 years, and included 55% females. Semaglutide (55%) and dulaglutide (42%) were the most commonly used GLP-1 RAs at baseline with semaglutide 1.0 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg being the most common treatment doses. At week 12, mean HbA1c changed from baseline by -0.43%, fasting serum glucose by -7.83 mg/dL, and body weight by -2.15 kg (all P < .01). Glycemic outcomes and body weight improved in participants in all baseline GLP-1 RA subgroups. Twenty participants (13.2%) developed gastrointestinal events. Three (2%) participants discontinued tirzepatide due to adverse events. There were no severe hypoglycemic events or deaths.

Conclusion

In this prospective study, when people with T2D on stable GLP-1 RA treatment were switched directly to tirzepatide 5 mg, they experienced improved glycemic outcomes and additional weight reduction with an acceptable risk of adverse gastrointestinal events over 12 weeks.

### Reduction of prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome with tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis from the SURPASS clinical trial program [^32381fbd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in the US and EU for the treatment of T2D and obesity. In the SURPASS clinical trial program, treatment with tirzepatide at all doses (5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) resulted in substantial reductions in HbA1c, ranging from − 1.9% to − 2.6%, and robust body weight reductions, ranging from − 6.6% to − 13.9% over a treatment period of 40 to 104 weeks. Moreover, this finding was extended in a 72-week trial in participants with obesity and T2D, where tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg resulted in body weight reductions of 13.4% and 15.7%, respectively, versus 3.3% with placebo. The safety profile of tirzepatide is consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor agonists, with the most commonly reported adverse events being generally mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, which typically decreased over time. Tirzepatide treatment has also significantly improved markers of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity as monotherapy and compared to dulaglutide 1.5 mg and semaglutide 1 mg and demonstrated cardiovascular safety when compared with pooled comparators for MACE-4, including death due to cardiovascular cause, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for unstable angina. In the phase 2b trial, tirzepatide at the 15 mg dose administered over 26 weeks uniquely modulated 54 metabolites associated with T2D risk and metabolic dysregulation consistent with improved cardiovascular risk factor profile, compared to only 6 metabolites with dulaglutide, and no changes with placebo.

This post hoc analysis assessed the effect of tirzepatide use on the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome across the five SURPASS registrational clinical trials and the association between tirzepatide-induced weight loss and the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome.

### Long-term cost-effectiveness analysis of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1.0 mg for the management of type 2 diabetes in the United States [^fecb440e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg doses), a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, versus semaglutide 1.0mg, an injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, based on the results of the head-to-head SURPASS-2 trial, from a US healthcare payer perspective.

Materials and Methods

The PRIME Type 2 Diabetes Model was used to make projections of clinical and cost outcomes over a 50-year time horizon. Baseline cohort characteristics, treatment effects and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SURPASS-2 trial. Intensification to insulin therapy occurred when HbA1c reached 7.5%, in line with American Diabetes Association recommendations. Direct costs in 2021 US dollars (US$) and health state utilities were derived from published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually.

Results

All three doses of tirzepatide were associated with lower diabetes-related complication rates, improved life expectancy, improved quality-adjusted life expectancy and higher direct costs versus semaglutide. This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 75 803, 58 908 and 48 785 per quality-adjusted life year gained for tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15mg, respectively, versus semaglutide. Tirzepatide remained cost-effective versus semaglutide over a range of sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

Long-term projections based on the SURPASS-2 trial results indicate that 5, 10 and 15mg doses of tirzepatide are likely to be cost-effective versus semaglutide 1.0mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for treatment of overweight or obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^9d6c7a9a]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest that tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic-peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), has significant weight loss effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity.

Methods

Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tirzepatide's weight loss efficacy for these patients. A single arm meta-analysis of proportions estimated primary outcomes, ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, and adverse events (AEs); while meta-analysis of means estimated secondary outcomes. Comparative meta-analysis was conducted between tirzepatide and control arms where mean differences and odds ratios were estimated for continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively.

Results

RCTs included in this study revealed that among 5800 patients, 78.22% (95% CI: 72.15% to 83.73%), 55.60% (95% CI: 46.54% to 64.47%), 32.28% (95% CI: 23.17% to 42.12%) achieved ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, respectively. Tirzepatide 5mg demonstrated weight loss superiority relative to placebo (MD: -12.47kg, 95% CI: -13.94kg to -11.00kg) and semaglutide (n = 1409, MD: -1.90kg, 95% CI: -2.97kg to -0.83kg) with dose-dependent increase for 10mg and 15mg doses. The comparison between tirzepatide and semaglutide was examined in the SURPASS-2 trial that was included in this systematic review. For AEs, there was increase odds of experiencing gastrointestinal AEs with tirzepatide compared to placebo, but no significant difference with semaglutide.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide has significant potential as a weight loss drug in patients with overweight and obesity, with little increase in AEs compared to other weight loss drugs. With its ability to concurrently target multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome, it should be considered as the next helm of weight loss therapies.

### Incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes in adults living with obesity treated with tirzepatide or semaglutide: real world evidence from an international retrospective cohort study [^634e4e41]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a novel dual agonist of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), has demonstrated greater magnitude of weight loss compared to semaglutide in a phase 3 clinical trial. However, the effect of tirzepatide on incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in individuals with overweight and obesity, and the effect on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with pre-existing T2D, remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of anonymised electronic medical records using the TriNetX network (TriNetX LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA) a global federated database. The data used in this study was collected on 5th June 2024. Two cohorts of individuals were generated: 1) without pre-existing T2D and, 2) with T2D. We adopted an active comparator new user design on new initiations of either tirzepatide or semaglutide therapy. Analysis began from the index event which was defined as individuals on respective therapy for 6 months only. Analysis of outcomes was conducted off-drug, in individuals without a pre-existing history of the disease of interest. Individuals were followed up for 12 months post the index event. Primary outcome for cohort 1 was incidence of T2D, and for cohort 2 was composite: all-cause mortality, cerebral infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure. Secondary outcomes for cohort 1 were change in HbA1c and body weight and for cohort 2: incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, suicidal ideation and/or attempt, and all-cause mortality. We propensity score matched (1:1) for potential confounders: baseline demographics, socioeconomic circumstances, HbA1c, weight, relevant co-morbidities, and anti-obesity, hypoglycaemic and cardioprotective agents.

Findings

The study population without T2D consisted of 13,846 individuals, equally split between tirzepatide and semaglutide users. Tirzepatide was associated with both lower risk for incident T2D (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.92, p < 0.001) and greater weight loss (-7.7 kg, [95% CI -6.8, -8.5 kg], p < 0.001), compared to semaglutide (-4.8 kg, [95% CI -3.9, -5.6 kg], p < 0.001). In individuals with pre-existing T2D (n = 8446), tirzepatide was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38–0.76, p < 0.001), cerebral infarction (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24–0.84, p = 0.010) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.73, p = 0.004) compared to semaglutide.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide is associated with significantly reduced risk of developing T2D and major adverse cardiovascular events in individuals living with obesity and T2D respectively. Randomised controlled trials investigating the utility of dual incretin agonists in the primary prevention of T2D and cardiovascular disease in higher risk populations are now required.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^1121c613]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

The meal tests indicated a significant reduction in fasting and post-meal plasma glucose concentrations with both tirzepatide and semaglutide compared with placebo treatment, and baseline-subtracted plasma glucose increments did not differ between the two drug treatments. Meal-related insulin secretory responses were significantly smaller with tirzepatide compared to both semaglutide and placebo treatment, compatible with the improvements in insulin sensitivity. Meal-related rises in plasma glucagon were smaller with tirzepatide than with semaglutide, and substantially and significantly reduced vs. placebo treatment with both semaglutide and tirzepatide. While appetite ratings and ad libitum energy intake were lower with semaglutide and tirzepatide treatment as compared to placebo, they did not differ significantly between the selective GLP-1 RA and the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist. While the described findings help to explain some aspects of the clinical effectiveness of tirzepatide, it is not possible to discern from this experiment whether the distinct effects of tirzepatide relative to semaglutide are the result of GIPR signaling.

### Generalizability of the SURPASS-2 trial and effect of tirzepatide on US diabetes and obesity control [^9b8971c7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) agonist, has been shown to reduce weight and hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels. The SURPASS‐2 (A Study of Tirzepatide [LY3298176] Versus Semaglutide Once Weekly as Add‐on Therapy to Metformin in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes) trial recently established the superiority of tirzepatide, a dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP‐1 agonist, in decreasing weight and HbA 1c, when compared with semaglutide.

Given its efficacy, tirzepatide is likely to be prescribed widely. The most recent American Diabetes Association 2021 recommendations suggest the use of GLP‐1 agonists in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease independent of HbA 1c or metformin use. Thus, it is important to understand the SURPASS‐2 trial in the context of population generalizability and treatment effects. To better understand the US population eligible for therapy, we apply SURPASS‐2 enrollment criteria to the US population and then simulate the effects of tirzepatide on this population.

### Patient-reported outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes receiving tirzepatide in the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^387b649d]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease that can have a huge impact on people's quality of life (QoL). Tirzepatide, a once weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that combines both GIP receptor agonism and GLP-1 receptor agonism in a single molecule, is approved for the treatment of people with T2D and is in development for chronic weight management. The SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials assessed the efficacy of once weekly tirzepatide (5, 10 or 15 mg) versus placebo and active comparators. In these studies, tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, which were greater than those with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, titrated insulin degludec and titrated insulin glargine. These treatment effects were sustained up to 104 weeks. Tirzepatide has been shown to normalise blood glucose levels, defined as HbA1c < 5.7%, as these levels were achieved by up to 62% of participants treated with tirzepatide 15 mg.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are standardised questionnaires used to assess outcomes from the patients' perspective, including perceptions, symptoms, satisfaction with treatment and adherence to prescribed regimens. PROs provide information of value when deciding which treatment will suit which patient that is additional to clinical endpoints such as HbA1c and body weight. The collection of PROs during clinical trials can be useful in understanding patients' perceptions of their treatment and their QoL while receiving new medications. Indeed, there continues to be a growing emphasis on the importance of collecting and publishing patient-reported information directly from clinical trials, so that the patient voice can be considered in drug development and the regulatory/licensing process.

A range of PROs are available for use in T2D clinical trials, and these can be tailored to each trial depending on the medication studied. Irrespective of class of glucose-lowering therapy, the selection of appropriate PROs should be both relevant to the patients being treated and reflect their assessment of the treatment, disease state and burden. There is substantial value in collecting PRO data from patients receiving treatment for T2D, as it is a chronic disease with a significant impact on QoL, which can also be affected by adverse events (AEs) experienced during treatment.

2.4 Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide and semaglutide are both potent GLP‐1 receptor agonists used to treat T2D. Like semaglutide, tirzepatide offers the convenience of a once‐weekly subcutaneous injection but has the unique advantage of being a dual GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) and GLP1RA. This dual action allows tirzepatide to concurrently target multiple pathways involved in glucose regulation, potentially providing additional benefits in managing diabetes. Both medications have shown significant efficacy in improving glycaemic control and are generally well‐tolerated, but tirzepatide's distinct pharmacological profile holds promise in enhancing diabetes management outcomes. A 40‐week, phase 3 trial, randomized trial compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and semaglutide in patients with T2D. The study found that tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide regarding the mean change in glycated haemoglobin level. Another study compared the effects of tirzepatide 15 mg to placebo and semaglutide on additional factors such as α and β cell function and insulin sensitivity. A study found that tirzepatide demonstrated impressive glycaemic efficacy in T2D by enhancing critical aspects of diabetes pathophysiology. Notably, it improves β‐cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon secretion.

These substantial improvements contribute to the remarkable glucose‐lowering capabilities of tirzepatide. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with T2D found that tirzepatide decreased HbA1c by 0.36% and fasting serum glucose by 13.00 mg/dL when compared with GLP‐1 RAs (semaglutide 1 mg and others). Another study found that tirzepatide significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight more effectively than semaglutide. While tirzepatide is primarily studied for its efficacy in treating T2D and obesity, ongoing clinical trials are investigating its potential use in other conditions, such as Wolfram syndrome — an orphan disease. Currently, trials are also ongoing to test the effects of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis in the United Arab Emirates population. The main aim of this trial is to provide insight into the impact on fat deposition in the liver after 6 months of treatment since non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant problem in T2D and obesity patients.

### Effect of tirzepatide on glycaemic control and weight loss compared with other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d6660427]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the therapeutic effects of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/ glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or GLP-1RAs in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to July 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared GLP-1RAs or GIP/GLP-1RAs in Japanese patients with T2D were selected. A network meta-analysis was conducted to indirectly compare the treatments, focusing on efficacy in reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight (BW).

Results

A total of 18 RCTs were included in this analysis. Tirzepatide 15mg showed the most significant reduction in HbA1c levels and BW compared with subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0mg and oral semaglutide 14mg (HbA1c: mean difference [95% confidence interval] -0.52 [-0.96; -0.08] and -1.23 [-1.64; -0.81]; BW: -5.07 [-8.28; -1.86] and -6.84 [-8.97; -4.71], respectively). Subcutaneous semaglutide showed a superior reduction in HbA1c compared with oral semaglutide. Both subcutaneous and oral semaglutide were more effective than conventional GLP-1RAs, such as dulaglutide, liraglutide and lixisenatide.

Conclusions

Among Japanese patients with T2D, tirzepatide showed the greatest effectiveness in reducing HbA1c levels and inducing weight loss. The study provides evidence to guide GLP-1RA treatment strategies in Japanese patients with T2D.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide 5–15 mg in obesity with or without type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of phase 3 clinical trials [^ab08aa7f]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Both semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide have been recently approved for chronic use in obesity. There is a lack of literature comparing the efficacy and safety of both these agents in people with obesity/overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We systematically reviewed Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with two agents to synthesize the comparative efficacy and safety outcomes.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed electronic databases until December 15, 2024, using selected keywords and Boolean "AND". Subsequently, we compared the most closely matched trials conducted with semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide through an adjusted (if baseline imbalance in treatment outcome modifiers present) or unadjusted (in the absence of baseline imbalance) indirect treatment comparison method.

Results

We identified one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-1) and tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-1) in obese or overweight people without T2D and one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-2) and tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-2) in overweight people with T2D that were almost entirely comparable concerning baseline outcome modifier characteristics. Our unadjusted analysis without individual patients' data found relatively higher (4 and 5.4% additional) weight loss, HbA1c (-0.4% additional) reduction, and fewer gastrointestinal side effects (GI S/E) with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively, than with semaglutide 2.4 mg, in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg are more effective and have fewer GI S/E than semaglutide 2.4 mg. A well-powered head-to-head RCT is currently needed to confirm these findings.

### Comparative gastrointestinal safety of dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes [^1ae61a25]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The comparative gastrointestinal safety across glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is still unclear.

Objective

To compare the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse events across dulaglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide, and tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in routine clinical practice.

Design

New-user, active-comparator cohort study.

Setting

Population-based study.

Participants

Adults with T2D initiating dulaglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide, and tirzepatide between 1 January 2019 and 30 August 2024 in 3 cohorts corresponding to 3 pairwise comparisons.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a composite of acute pancreatitis, biliary disease, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, and severe constipation. Secondary outcomes of interest were the individual components of the primary outcome. Patients were 1:1 propensity score matched within each comparison. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs.

Results

There were 65238 matched pairs in the semaglutide versus dulaglutide cohort, 20893 in the tirzepatide versus dulaglutide cohort, and 46620 in the tirzepatide versus semaglutide cohort. The HR of gastrointestinal events was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.06) in the semaglutide versus dulaglutide cohort, 0.96 (CI, 0.77 to 1.20) in the tirzepatide versus dulaglutide cohort, and 1.07 (CI, 0.90 to 1.26) in the tirzepatide versus semaglutide cohort.

Limitation

Possible residual confounding by glycemic control and body mass index.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have similar gastrointestinal safety profiles in adults with T2D. This study provides clinicians with evidence to weigh the benefits and risks of these medications.

### Achievement of glycaemic targets with weight loss and without hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes with the once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS-1 to-5 studies [^271a925d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess composite endpoints combining glycaemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%, ≤ 6.5% or < 5.7%) with weight loss (≥ 5%, ≥ 10% or ≥ 15%) and without hypoglycaemia with tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Materials and Methods

Data from the phase 3 SURPASS programme were evaluated post hoc by trial. Participants with T2D were randomized to tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), placebo (SURPASS-1,5), semaglutide 1mg (SURPASS-2) or titrated basal insulin (SURPASS-3,4). The proportions of participants achieving the composite endpoints were compared between tirzepatide and the respective comparator groups at week 40/52.

Results

The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 5% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia ranged from 43% to 82% with tirzepatide across the SURPASS-1 to -5 trials versus 4%-5% with placebo, 51% with semaglutide 1mg and 5% with basal insulin (P < .001 vs. all comparators). The proportions of participants achieving an HbA1c value of less than 7.0% with 10% or more, or 15% or more weight loss and without hypoglycaemia were significantly higher with all tirzepatide doses versus comparators across trials (P < .001 or P < .05). Similar results were observed for all other combinations of endpoints with an HbA1c value of 6.5% or less, or less than 5.7%, with more tirzepatide-treated participants achieving these endpoints versus those in the comparator groups, including semaglutide.

Conclusions

Across the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials, more tirzepatide-treated participants with T2D achieved clinically meaningful composite endpoints, which included reaching glycaemic targets with various degrees of weight loss and without hypoglycaemia, than those in the comparator groups.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide for weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a value for money analysis [^8d2c5a21]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Higher doses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist semaglutide and, more recently, tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist showed a significant reduction in body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to establish which provides better value for money.

Materials and Methods

We calculated the cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using high-dose tirzepatide (15mg) versus semaglutide (2.4 mg). The body weight reductions were extracted from published results of SURMOUNT-1 and STEP 1 trials, respectively. In addition, we performed a scenario analysis to mitigate the primary differences between the two study populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022.

Results

Using tirzepatide resulted in a weight loss of 17.8% (95% CI: 16.3%-19.3%) compared with 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%) for semaglutide. The total cost of 72weeks of tirzepatide was estimated at $17527 compared with $22878 for 68weeks of semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with tirzepatide is estimated at $985 (95% CI: $908-$1075) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide. Scenario analysis confirmed these findings.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide provides better value for money than semaglutide for weight reduction.

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^58315cec]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Efficacy outcomes

Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg were associated with statistically significant greater reductions in body weight (kg) (mean difference [MD] [95% CI]: −2.80 kg [−4.56, −1.04], −4.90 kg [−6.62, −3.18]), body weight (%) (MD [95% CI]: −2.53% [−4.20, −0.86], −4.83% [−6.50, −3.16]) and BMI (MD [95% CI]: −1.00 kg/m 2 [−1.61, −0.39], −1.80 kg/m 2 [−2.41, −1.19]) versus semaglutide, with tirzepatide 15 mg comparisons having larger mean differences than tirzepatide 10 mg comparisons (Table 2, Figure 1). These results align with the arm‐level results from each trial, where tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg demonstrated greater reductions in body weight (−13.43% and −15.65%, respectively) compared to semaglutide 2.4 mg (−10.64%) (Table S4).

FIGURE 1
Weight and waist reduction efficacy estimand indirect treatment comparison (ITC) results. Forest plots for efficacy estimand ITC results comparing tirzepatide (10 and 15 mg once per week [QW]) versus semaglutide 2.4 mg QW for change from baseline (CfB) in weight (kg), CfB in weight (%) and CfB in waist circumference (cm). The point indicates the mean difference (MD) and the lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Point estimates to the left of the dotted line indicate where tirzepatide was associated with an improvement over semaglutide, and statistical significance is indicated where the 95% CIs do not overlap the dotted line.

Tirzepatide 15 mg was associated with statistically significant greater odds of participants achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 15% weight reduction versus semaglutide, while tirzepatide 10 mg was associated with a non‐significant trend of greater odds of participants achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 15% weight reduction (Table 2, Figure S1). Both tirzepatide doses were associated with non‐significant trends of greater odds of participants achieving ≥ 10% weight reduction (Table 2, Figure S1).

### Time spent in glycaemic control with sustained body weight reduction with tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^866d138e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 Time spent in glycaemic control during the treatment period

Participants treated with tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg spent longer continuous time with HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) than comparators (p < 0.001) (Figure 1A). In studies of 40 weeks' duration (i.e. SURPASS‐1, SURPASS‐2 and SURPASS‐5), median time spent with HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was 32 weeks (80% of the total study duration) with tirzepatide compared with 28 weeks (70% of the total study duration) with semaglutide 1 mg and 0 weeks (0% of the total study duration) with placebo. In studies of 52 weeks' duration (i.e. SURPASS‐3 and SURPASS‐4), the median time spent with HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was 40–44 weeks (77%–85% of the total study duration) with tirzepatide compared with 32 weeks (62% of the total study duration) with insulin degludec and 12 weeks (23% of the total study duration) with insulin glargine. Overall, 92%–98% of participants treated with tirzepatide versus 34%–89% with active comparators or placebo achieved an HbA1c < 7% at any time and 81%–97% versus 20%–81%, respectively, achieved the target at the primary endpoint (Figure 1A). Additionally, participants treated with tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg spent longer continuous time with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) than comparators (p < 0.001) (Figure 1B). In studies of 40 weeks' duration, median time spent with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was 28–32 weeks (70%–80%) with tirzepatide compared with 24 weeks (60%) with semaglutide 1 mg and 0 weeks (0%) with placebo. In studies of 52 weeks' duration, the median time spent with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was 36–40 weeks (69%–77%) with tirzepatide compared with 8 weeks (15%) with insulin degludec and 0 weeks (0%) with insulin glargine. Overall, 80%–98% of participants treated with tirzepatide versus 18%–77% with active comparators or placebo achieved an HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at any time and 66%–95% versus 10%–66%, respectively, achieved the target at the primary endpoint (Figure 1B). Furthermore, participants treated with tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg spent longer continuous time with FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) than placebo and semaglutide 1 mg (p < 0.05) (Figure 1C). In studies of 40 weeks' duration, median duration of continuous time spent with FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) ranged from 24 to 32 weeks (60%–80%) with tirzepatide compared with 20 weeks (50%) with semaglutide 1 mg and 0–16 weeks (0%–40%) with placebo. In studies of 52 weeks' duration, the median duration of continuous time spent with FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) ranged from 20 to 36 weeks (38%–69%) with tirzepatide compared with 36 weeks (69%) with insulin degludec and 28 weeks (54%) with insulin glargine. Overall, 86%–99% of participants treated with tirzepatide versus 46%–95% with active comparators or placebo achieved an FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL at any time and 64%–96% versus 16%–69%, respectively, achieved the target at the primary endpoint (Figure 1C). The proportion of participants maintaining HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and FSG ≤ 125 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) for different intervals during each trial is presented in Figure 2A–C. In general, this post hoc analysis found that a greater proportion of tirzepatide‐treated participants achieved and maintained HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for different intervals during each trial compared with placebo and active comparators.

### Tirzepatide improved markers of islet cell function and insulin sensitivity in people with T2D (SURPASS-2) [^f1d3fec3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including defects in insulin secretion, insulin resistance, decreased incretin effect, increased glucagon secretion, and adiposity. Tirzepatide is a first-in-class, once-weekly, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for treatment of people with T2D and obesity. In the SURPASS phase 3 trials, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) reduced glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) up to 2.6% and reduced body weight up to 12.9 kg, significantly more than placebo (SURPASS-1), semaglutide 1 mg (SURPASS-2), insulin degludec (SURPASS-3), insulin glargine (SURPASS-4), and placebo as an add on to insulin glargine (SURPASS-5). The safety profile of tirzepatide is consistent with that of GLP-1 receptor agonists, with the most commonly reported adverse events being generally mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, which typically decreased over time.

A phase 1 mechanistic study demonstrated substantial improvements in β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon secretion in response to treatment with tirzepatide, that in combination contributed to the observed glucose-lowering effects. In the phase 2 study, tirzepatide improved markers of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function to a greater extent than placebo or dulaglutide. Improvements in insulin sensitivity were only partly attributable to weight loss. Concordant changes in markers of pancreatic β-cell function and insulin resistance were also observed in the SURPASS-1 and SURPASS-2 trials. β-cell dysfunction and impaired insulin resistance are interrelated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and result in inadequate glucose homeostasis. Current guidelines for the treatment of patients with T2D highlight the importance of individualized treatment and patient-centered care. Weight management is an important component of treatment in T2D, whereas glycemic control, in the form of HbA1c, is an indicator of disease status.

In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated changes in markers of pancreatic islet cell function and insulin sensitivity over time and the association between these markers and change in HbA1c and body weight by baseline quartile analyses.

### Less frequent dosing of GLP-1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy [^6ea92df6]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide (also referred to as glucagon‐like peptide‐1 [GLP‐1] receptor agonists) have upended the treatment paradigm of obesity. Meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials have indicated that semaglutide and tirzepatide facilitate an average placebo‐adjusted body weight (BW) loss of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, compared with the 5% to 10% of older generation antiobesity medications (AOMs).

These benefits must be weighed against their high cost, which can exceed $1000 monthly. Demand for these incretin mimetics has frequently outstripped their supply, leaving patients uncertain as to whether they will be able to fill their next prescription. Some have had to switch to alternative AOMs or stop entirely, whereas others have rationed their remaining supply. Although high costs and supply shortages might eventually subside, both issues still impede patient access to incretin mimetics.

We present two patients who maintained their BW loss despite less frequent dosing of their incretin mimetic to illustrate the potential viability of such a strategy and then provide a pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model as a mathematical basis for why this may have been successful.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide on HbA1c and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^af5ac5f5]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To evaluate real-world hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight change in adults initiating treatment with tirzepatide (dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [GLP-1 RA]) or injectable semaglutide (GLP-1 RA) indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) management.

Methods

This retrospective analysis utilized the Healthcare Integrated Research Database® to identify adults with T2D starting tirzepatide or injectable semaglutide between May 13, 2022 and May 29, 2023. GLP-1 RA naïve and non-naïve cohorts were identified based on the history of GLP-1 RA use within ≤ 6 months of initiation. Propensity score matching balanced 6-month baseline characteristics between groups. HbA1c and weight changes were assessed from initiation to 12 months for matched patients with HbA1c and weight data at both time points.

Results

Both matched naïve cohorts were comprised of 10,702 patients (tirzepatide: 1399 with HbA1c data and 454 with weight data; semaglutide: 1173 with HbA1c data and 432 with weight data). Mean baseline HbA1c and weight were 7.8% and 112.4 kg, respectively, for the tirzepatide group and 7.8% and 110.7 kg for the semaglutide group. Both matched non-naïve cohorts were comprised of 5577 patients (tirzepatide: 792 with HbA1c data and 296 with weight data; semaglutide: 738 with HbA1c data and 224 with weight data). Mean baseline HbA1c and weight were 7.7% and 112.5 kg for tirzepatide, and 7.9% and 108.5 kg for semaglutide. Tirzepatide was associated with greater mean reductions in HbA1c (naïve: - 1.3% vs. - 0.9%; non-naïve: - 0.9% vs. - 0.6%; p < 0.001) and weight (naïve: - 10.2 kg vs. - 6.1 kg; non-naïve: - 7.9 kg vs. - 3.7 kg; p < 0.001) than semaglutide.

Conclusions

Patients with T2D starting tirzepatide had greater HbA1c and weight reductions at 12 months post-initiation than those on injectable semaglutide, regardless of previous GLP-1 RA use, consistent with previous clinical trial results.

### The novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying similarly to selective long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists [^3a4ddbcb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The effect of dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide on gastric emptying (GE) was compared to that of GLP‐1RAs in non‐clinical and clinical studies. GE was assessed following acute and chronic treatment with tirzepatide in diet‐induced obese mice versus semaglutide or long‐acting GIP analogue alone. Participants [with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM)] from a phase 1, 4‐week multiple dose study received tirzepatide, dulaglutide or placebo. GE was assessed by acetaminophen absorption. In mice, tirzepatide delayed GE to a similar degree to that achieved with semaglutide; however, these acute inhibitory effects were abolished after 2 weeks of treatment. GIP analogue alone had no effect on GE or on GLP‐1's effect on GE. In participants with and without T2DM, once‐weekly tirzepatide (≥ 5 and ≥ 4.5 mg, respectively) delayed GE after a single dose. This effect diminished after multiple doses of tirzepatide or dulaglutide in healthy participants. In participants with T2DM treated with an escalation schedule of tirzepatide 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg, a residual GE delay was still observed after multiple doses. These data suggest that tirzepatide's activity on GE is comparable to that of selective GLP‐1RAs.

### Tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^4e7223e1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-5 was published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tirzepatide compared to semaglutide in patients with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the population was: 750 patients (485 female, 265 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with obesity without T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication for weight reduction or a GLP-1 receptor agonist in the past 90 days; change in body weight of > 5 kg in the past 90 days. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the interventions were: n = 374 tirzepatide (at a dose of 10 mg or 15 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks) n = 376 semaglutide (at a dose of 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (20.2% vs. 13.7%; MD 6.5, 95% CI 4.9 to 8.1). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in waist circumference at week 72 (18.4 cm vs. 13 cm; MD 5.4, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.1) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (81.6% vs. 60.5%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 25% (31.6% vs. 16.1%; RR 2, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.6). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with obesity without T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: an adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^32185003]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, this aITC showed significantly greater HbA1c and body weight reductions with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg and similar reductions with tirzepatide 5 mg and semaglutide 2 mg. In the absence of a head‐to‐head comparison, these findings may help to guide clinician decisions and enable pharmacoeconomic assessment of the most suitable incretin‐based treatment for patients with T2D. In addition to efficacy and safety data, clinicians should also consider patient preference for the administration device, as it is an important driver of the choice of medication.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^3c75a048]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Obesity is a chronic disease and is considered a global epidemic, with high associations with but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), several malignancies, chronic kidney disease, metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatosis liver disease (MASLD) and mental disorders. Thus, the prevention and treatment of obesity are important to improve healthcare outcomes, quality of life and decrease overall healthcare costs. Currently, treatment for overweight and obesity includes healthy lifestyle changes, behavioural counselling, prescription medications and surgery. Given its detrimental effects on individual health and its widespread impact on society, there is great interest in the development of therapeutics to combat obesity and T2DM and their associated sequelae.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have emerged as a prominent treatment for T2DM with a notable weight loss effect via delayed gastric emptying, glucagon inhibition and stimulation of central receptors that modulate appetite suppression and energy expenditure. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GLP‐1RAs are for glycaemic control (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide/insulin, semaglutide) or weight loss (semaglutide, liraglutide). However, tirzepatide, a recent agent that has gained popularity, has shown similar, if not greater, glycaemic control and weight loss in patients with obesity or T2DM. Its mechanism of action involves dual agonism of the GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors.

Through a comparative analysis, this systematic review aims to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide in facilitating weight loss and their respective safety profiles. A more accurate comparison can be performed through a comparative analysis by reducing the confounding and bias observed in differing patient demographics and study characteristics associated with indirect comparisons or network meta‐analyses. We hypothesise that tirzepatide, due to its dual agonism, will produce greater weight loss with a similar or improved safety profile.

### Use and interchange of incretin mimetics in the treatment of metabolic diseases: a narrative review [^9448b1e9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and now tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 RA/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist, have numerous advantages in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity, yet only 11% of patients with type 2 diabetes are prescribed a GLP-1 RA. This narrative review addresses the complexity and cost issues surrounding incretin mimetics to support clinicians.

Methods

This narrative review summarizes key trials on the differing effects of incretin mimetics on glycosylated hemoglobin and weight, provides a table with rationale for how to interchange among agents, and summarizes the key factors that guide drug selection beyond guidance from the American Diabetes Association. To support proposed dose interchanges, we preferentially selected high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trials with direct comparisons of agents and doses when available.

Findings

Tirzepatide produces the greatest reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin and weight, but its impact on cardiovascular events is still under investigation. Subcutaneous semaglutide and liraglutide are approved for weight loss specifically and are effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although producing less weight loss, only dulaglutide has effectiveness in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Semaglutide is the only orally available incretin mimetic; however, the oral formulation produces less weight loss versus its subcutaneous alternative and did not have cardioprotection in its outcomes trial. Although effective in controlling type 2 diabetes, exenatide extended release has the least impact on glycosylated hemoglobin and weight among commonly used agents, while not having cardioprotection. However, exenatide extended release may be preferred on some restrictive insurance formularies.

Implications

Although trials have not explicitly studied how to interchange among agents, interchanges can be guided by comparisons between agents' impact on glycosylated hemoglobin and weight. Efficient changes among agents can help clinicians optimize patient-centered care, particularly in the face of changing patient needs and preferences, insurance formularies, and drug shortages.

### Discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists… [^d451b000]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

10. 1001/jama.
2024. 22284. The development of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape for cardiometabolic disease. Newer, more potent GLP-1 RAs and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide agonists substantially reduce body weight by 10% to 20%. In addition to weight loss, large outcome trials have also demonstrated that GLP-1 RAs reduce cardiovascular disease events in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, and preexisting CVD with overweight or obesity and without diabetes. Even though GLP-1 RAs — paired with lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and increased physical activity — are intended for long-term management of the chronic conditions of obesity and diabetes, many individuals who initiate GLP-1 RAs discontinue therapy.

Nearly 30% of individuals discontinued semaglutide in the SELECT trial, with real-world estimates for GLP-1 RA discontinuation in the range of 50% to 75% at 12 months. 1 While treatment with GLP-1 RAs leads to many health benefits, trials of discontinuation demonstrated rapid regain of weight and worsening of cardiometabolic parameters after stopping semaglutide or tirzepatide.

### The novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying similarly to selective long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists [^832c394d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The effect of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) tirzepatide on gastric emptying (GE) was compared to that of GLP-1RAs in non-clinical and clinical studies. GE was assessed following acute and chronic treatment with tirzepatide in diet-induced obese mice versus semaglutide or long-acting GIP analogue alone. Participants [with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM)] from a phase 1, 4-week multiple dose study received tirzepatide, dulaglutide or placebo. GE was assessed by acetaminophen absorption. In mice, tirzepatide delayed GE to a similar degree to that achieved with semaglutide; however, these acute inhibitory effects were abolished after 2 weeks of treatment. GIP analogue alone had no effect on GE or on GLP-1's effect on GE. In participants with and without T2DM, once-weekly tirzepatide (≥ 5 and ≥ 4.5 mg, respectively) delayed GE after a single dose. This effect diminished after multiple doses of tirzepatide or dulaglutide in healthy participants. In participants with T2DM treated with an escalation schedule of tirzepatide 5/5/10/10 or 5/5/10/15 mg, a residual GE delay was still observed after multiple doses. These data suggest that tirzepatide's activity on GE is comparable to that of selective GLP-1RAs.

### Time to reach glycaemic and body weight loss thresholds with tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pre-planned exploratory analysis of SURPASS-2 and SURPASS-3 [^daec5ae4]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, provides clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control and body weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. The early efficacy profile of tirzepatide after treatment initiation is of interest. In this exploratory pre-planned analysis, we evaluated the time to achieve glycaemic control and body weight loss thresholds with tirzepatide.

Methods

In two randomised studies, we compared time to achieve HbA1c (< 7.0% and ≤ 6.5%) and weight loss (≥ 5%, SURPASS-2 only) thresholds among people treated with tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg), semaglutide 1 mg in SURPASS-2, and titrated insulin degludec in SURPASS-3. Longitudinal logistic regression models were used to explore the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c and body weight loss thresholds at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The time to achieve these thresholds was analysed and compared between groups using the Cox proportional-hazards model.

Results

Overall, greater proportions of participants achieved the HbA1c and body weight loss thresholds at 4, 12, and 24 weeks with tirzepatide compared with semaglutide 1 mg and insulin degludec. The median time to achieve HbA1c < 7.0% (8.1 weeks with each tirzepatide dose, 12.0 weeks with semaglutide 1 mg, and 12.1 weeks with insulin degludec) and ≤ 6.5% (12.1, 15.7, and 24.1 weeks, respectively) was faster with tirzepatide than semaglutide 1 mg and insulin degludec. In SURPASS-2, the median time to first achieve a body weight loss of ≥ 5% was faster with tirzepatide 5 mg (16.0 weeks) and 10 and 15 mg (12.4 weeks) than with semaglutide 1 mg (24.0 weeks).

Conclusion

Analyses of data from SURPASS-2 and -3 revealed that tirzepatide treatment enabled more people with type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic thresholds and these were achieved faster than with semaglutide 1 mg or insulin degludec. Tirzepatide-treated participants also achieved a body weight loss of ≥ 5% significantly faster with tirzepatide than with semaglutide 1 mg.

3.1 Effect of tirzepatide on GE in mice

The affinity and potency of incretin ligands, namely, semaglutide, tirzepatide and long‐acting GIPRA, used in the pre‐clinical studies are presented in Table S1. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test results and effective doses (ED 50) are also reported in the same table. Semaglutide (Figure 1A) and tirzepatide (Figure 1B) inhibited GE, while long‐acting GIPRA had no effect (Figure 1C). The combination of ascending doses of long‐acting GIPRA to fixed dose of semaglutide had no further effect on GLP‐1‐induced GE delay (Figure 1D). The acute inhibitory effect on GE delay with semaglutide or tirzepatide was abolished after 2 weeks of treatment (Figure 1E).

### Association of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and agonists administered for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9fe51e51]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In the future, comparison of selective GLP-1 agonists or analogs with dual glucose-stimulated insulinotropic peptide agonist, tirzepatide, will be of significant interest, given a recent reportof greater weight loss with 10 and 15 mg SQ tirzepatide weekly in comparison to 1mg SQ semaglutide weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, comparisons with SQ semaglutide doses > 2.4mg weekly would be of great interest, given the results showing this was the most effective GLP-1 agent in the current NMA.

There is paucity of direct comparative trials which are needed to confirm indirect comparisons obtained through NMA. On the other hand, the risk of bias in the available trials was judged to be low. Most trials attempted to control for concomitant interventions such as diet, exercise, and behavioral modification, although these were not necessarily measured as potential confounders in appraising the relative efficacy of each of the GLP-1 agents assessed. The fact that the attrition rates in the active treatment arms and placebo groups were similar (median 11%) is nevertheless reassuring that dropout is less likely to lead to important bias in the assessment of efficacy or adverse events. Risk of bias was high or unclear for random sequence generation (29.7%), allocation concealment (26.6%), and incomplete outcome data (26.6%). Heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) in weight loss and adverse events reflected magnitude, not direction of effect.

The strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis relate to selecting studies by independent pairs and following an a priori established analysis plan. Limitations include that analysis did not correct for quantity of data (i.e. numbers of studies, numbers of enrollees) for different medications, analysis performed to assess discontinuations did not adjust for differences in dose escalation regimens across the RCTs, and racial diversity was not sufficient to ensure that the results and conclusions are generalizable to races other than Caucasians. In addition, there is uncertainty in the strength of conclusions due to the presence of substantial heterogeneity, and some of the medications evaluated are either not yet marketed (efpeglenatide) or are no longer in development (taspoglutide). Future research needs to include direct comparisons between the different agents, particularly semaglutide and liraglutide which appear to demonstrate the greatest efficacy in the current network meta-analysis.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: the contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^068e0290]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tirzepatide is the first glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) to have demonstrated substantial improvement of glycaemia and weight reduction as well as other metabolic benefits both in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Phase 3 clinical trials (SURPASS‐1 (S1), −2 (S2), −3 (S3), −4 (S4), −5 (S5), −6 (S6)) with tirzepatide in participants with T2D showed significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (primary outcome) (−20.8 to −28.5 mmol/mol (−1.9 to −2.6%)), and body weight (−6.2 to −13.9%) over 40 to 52 weeks, enabling some participants (13% to 62%) to achieve good glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c < 39 mmol/mol (< 5.7%)).,

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, tirzepatide has shown greater efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels and body weight compared with other once‐weekly GLP‐1RAs, dulaglutide 1.5/0.75 mg or semaglutide 1 mg. There is interest in explaining potential mechanisms behind the superior efficacy of tirzepatide when compared with GLP‐1RAs. Tirzepatide shares glucoregulatory actions with GLP‐1RAs; however, improvements in beta cell secretory function, insulin sensitivity and inhibition of glucagon secretion are more pronounced with tirzepatide than with the GLP‐1 RA, semaglutide 1 mg. It also remains unclear as to what extent the greater weight loss (WL) seen with tirzepatide drives improved glycaemic control. The SURPASS trials showed that tirzepatide was associated with reductions in both HbA1c and body weight, with a statistically significant but modest association between HbA1c and body weight change observed with tirzepatide; the degree to which weight reduction contributes to HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide was still to be investigated. To elucidate the weight loss‐dependent (WL‐D) and ‐independent (WL‐IND) effects of tirzepatide on HbA1c reduction versus comparators, we performed mediation analysis of 3 global Phase‐3 SURPASS trials. Studies utilizing non‐insulin comparators (S1, S2 and S5) were chosen for the analysis to avoid the confounding effect of insulin therapy.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: the contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^26375457]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management and obstructive sleep apnoea (in the US). To assess the contribution of weight loss (WL) to the observed glycaemic effect, we performed mediation analysis of three randomized, controlled, parallel, 4‐arm SURPASS(S)‐trials; 1, 2 and 5, for a total of 2831 participants.

Materials and Methods

WL dependent (WL‐D) and WL independent (WL‐IND) effects on comparator‐adjusted glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction at Week 40 were estimated using mediation analysis, adjusted for baseline HbA1c and study‐specific stratification factors.

Results

The difference in mean HbA1c change from baseline at 40 weeks (total effect) between tirzepatide and the placebo group ranged from −20.0 to −14.6 mmol/mol, and that between tirzepatide and semaglutide (1 mg) ranged from −5.1 to −1.9 mmol/mol. In the placebo‐controlled trials, 12%–27% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide dose arms and placebo was estimated as being mediated through WL when given as monotherapy (S1), and 25%–45% when on the background of insulin with or without metformin (S5). Compared with semaglutide, 54%–71% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide and semaglutide was estimated as being WL‐D.

Conclusion

The tirzepatide‐induced HbA1c reductions from baseline, compared with placebo or semaglutide, were mediated through both WL‐D and WL‐IND effects. Estimated contributions of WL to the difference in glycaemic efficacy varied and were highest when tirzepatide was compared with semaglutide and less pronounced when compared with placebo. These results help to understand that other factors beyond weight reduction contribute to HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide.

### Lifetime health effects and cost-effectiveness of tirzepatide and semaglutide in US adults [^98689517]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a complex and heterogeneous chronic disease, affecting more than two-fifths of US adults. The introduction of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) for obesity treatment offers opportunities to mitigate the substantial health and economic burdens of obesity. Clinical trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide have shown substantial mean reductions in body weight (14.9% and 20.9%, respectively, compared with placebo) and cardiovascular benefits for secondary prevention. However, the public demand for these medications has led to supply shortages, and their high costs have led insurance companies to limit access.

Cost-effectiveness analysis offers a standardized approach for comparing the value of new antiobesity medications. Recent cost-effectiveness analyses of the new antiobesity medications have generated conflicting findings regarding their economic value. One cost-effectiveness analysis found that semaglutide was cost-effective compared with no treatment, no lifestyle modification, or treatment with liraglutide, naltrexone-bupropion, or phentermine-topiramate. However, other cost-effectiveness analyses concluded semaglutide and tirzepatide were not cost-effective compared with lifestyle modification, primarily due to their high costs.

The conflicting results of these prior studies are due to differences in model inputs and assumptions that require reexamination. To date, previous studies have used mean weight reduction to estimate weight-related comorbidities, failing to capture the broader cardiovascular effects of antiobesity medications and their downstream long-term potential benefits. Prior studies have also relied on imprecise or outdated antiobesity medication net price estimates, contributing to variability in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) results. Prior cost-effectiveness analyses were also based on the characteristics of clinical trial populations, which may not reflect the real-world US population. Given all these limitations, an updated cost-effectiveness analysis to understand the health and economic implications of antiobesity medications for the US population is needed.

### Glucometabolic outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1e2b508c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Tirzepatide, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and high-dose GLP-1RA are all innovative GLP-1RA-based therapeutic strategies listed among those with the highest glucose-lowering efficacy according to various RCT and the current ADA/EASD recommendations. Our network meta-analysis found that tirzepatide 15 mg yielded greater HbA1c and BW lowering efficacy compared to other GLP-1RA-based treatments, without increasing the risk of serious adverse events and hypoglycaemia and with a similar rate of gastrointestinal side effects to high-dose GLP-1RA and GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination. Moreover, GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC and tirzepatide 15 mg and 10 mg were superior to the other investigated treatments in terms of FPG lowering, while iGlarLixi appeared as the most efficacious in PPG lowering, followed by GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and tirzepatide 15 mg. No significant differences among these GLP-1RA-based treatments were detected in terms of LDL-c and SBP lowering.

The present network meta-analysis provides results that are largely coherent with existing literature. Indeed, RCT conducted so far demonstrated a dose-dependent and unprecedented benefit in HbA1c lowering with tirzepatide compared not only to placebo but also to basal insulin and semaglutide, attaining normoglycaemia in approximately half of enrolled patients. Also, the paramount role of tirzepatide as the most efficacious treatment strategy for weight loss regardless of baseline BMI is coherent with its outstanding performance in RCT conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes, and non-diabetic obese individuals. The mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of tirzepatide is yet to be fully elucidated. Heise et al. recently found that tirzepatide improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, enhanced insulin secretion and reduced post-meal glucagon levels compared to placebo and semaglutide 1 mg. However, these experiments did not address the relative contribution of weight loss and GIP receptor agonism to the superiority of tirzepatide over the GLP-1RA. The role of GIP receptor agonism remains an unresolved issue in the light of the resistance to GIP effects that was shown in patients with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, sustained > 10% weight loss has been associated with a greater likelihood of achieving normoglycaemia, especially in patients with shorter disease duration.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^506d79a6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and tirzepatide — use in older adults with diabetes includes tolerability and monitoring considerations as well as efficacy data. These drugs are injectable agents (with the exception of oral semaglutide (124)), which require visual, motor, and cognitive skills for appropriate administration, although most of them have a weekly dosing schedule, and GLP-1 RAs may also be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation and should be titrated slowly. Given the gastrointestinal side effects of this class, GLP-1 RAs are not preferred in older adults experiencing unexplained weight loss or undernutrition or in those who have recurrent gastrointestinal problems, and individuals should be monitored regularly for excessive weight loss. Tirzepatide is a novel dual-acting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection; in phase 3 trials, tirzepatide decreased A1C and weight — generally to a greater extent than other glucose-lowering drugs including semaglutide and insulin — with no significant differences in the safety or efficacy in older compared with younger individuals (125), and as the adverse effect profile of tirzepatide is similar to that for GLP-1 RAs, the same precautions for older adults apply. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are administered orally, which may be convenient for older adults with diabetes, and in those with established ASCVD these agents have shown cardiovascular benefits.

### Structural insights into multiplexed pharmacological actions of tirzepatide and peptide 20 at the GIP, GLP-1 or glucagon receptors [^78194b3a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Glucose homeostasis, regulated by glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon (GCG) is critical to human health. Several multi-targeting agonists at GIPR, GLP-1R or GCGR, developed to maximize metabolic benefits with reduced side-effects, are in clinical trials to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which tirzepatide, a GIPR/GLP-1R dual agonist, and peptide 20, a GIPR/GLP-1R/GCGR triagonist, manifest their multiplexed pharmacological actions over monoagonists such as semaglutide, we determine cryo-electron microscopy structures of tirzepatide-bound GIPR and GLP-1R as well as peptide 20-bound GIPR, GLP-1R and GCGR. The structures reveal both common and unique features for the dual and triple agonism by illustrating key interactions of clinical relevance at the near-atomic level. Retention of glucagon function is required to achieve such an advantage over GLP-1 monotherapy. Our findings provide valuable insights into the structural basis of functional versatility of tirzepatide and peptide 20.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^a2133868]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and under investigation for use in chronic weight management, major adverse cardiovascular events and the management of other conditions, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 3 SURPASS 1–5 clinical trial programme was designed to assess efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneously injected tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), as monotherapy or combination therapy, across a broad spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes. Use of tirzepatide in clinical studies was associated with marked reductions of glycated haemoglobin (-1.87 to -2.59%, -20 to -28mmol/mol) and body weight (-6.2 to -12.9 kg), as well as reductions in parameters commonly associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk such as blood pressure, visceral adiposity and circulating triglycerides. In SUPRASS-2, these reductions were greater than with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia when used without insulin or insulin secretagogues and showed a generally similar safety profile to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Accordingly, evidence from these clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide offers a new opportunity for the effective lowering of glycated haemoglobin and body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes.

### Patient-reported outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes receiving tirzepatide in the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^519f51a8]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, is approved for glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials assessed the efficacy of once weekly tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15 mg) versus placebo or active comparators (semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec and insulin glargine) in T2D. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that measured overall quality of life (QoL), treatment satisfaction and weight-related attributes across the five SURPASS studies.

Methods

PRO instruments utilised at baseline and primary timepoint (40 weeks for SURPASS-1, -2 and -5; 52 weeks for SURPASS-3 and -4) or early termination visit were EQ-5D-5L (SURPASS-1 to -5); Impact of Weight on Self-Perceptions (SURPASS-1 to -5); Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living (SURPASS-1 to -5); Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (SURPASS-2 to -5); and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version (SURPASS-2 only).

Results

Across all five studies at week 40/52, tirzepatide improved patients' QoL measured by general health and weight-related PROs over the comparator. Generally, higher doses of tirzepatide resulted in greater increases in PRO scores.

Conclusion

Overall, tirzepatide produced significant health and weight-related QoL improvements versus comparators in the five SURPASS studies.

### Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for weight loss among adults without diabetes: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^6109b095]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual or triple co-agonists for weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists for the treatment of obesity among adults without diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 4 October 2024.

Study Selection

Placebo-controlled RCTs in otherwise healthy participants with overweight or obesity.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was change in relative or absolute body weight from baseline to maximum on-treatment follow-up. Safety outcomes included death, serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events (AEs), and gastrointestinal AEs.

Data Synthesis

A total of 26 RCTs comprising 15491 participants (72% female; mean body mass index, 30 to 41 kg/m 2; mean age, 34 to 57 years) and 12 agents (3 commercially available agents [liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide] and 9 premarket agents for long-term weight management) were included. Treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks (median, 43 weeks). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide (15 mg once weekly) resulted in weight loss of up to 17.8% (95% CI, 16.3% to 19.3%) after 72 weeks of therapy; semaglutide (2.4 mg once weekly), up to 13.9% (CI, 11.0% to 16.7%) after 68 weeks; and liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily), up to 5.8% (CI, 3.6% to 8.0%) after 26 weeks. Retatrutide (12 mg once weekly) produced greater weight loss of up to 22.1% (CI, 19.3% to 24.9%) after 48 weeks; other novel single and combination GLP-1 agents were also efficacious to varying degrees. Although AEs were frequent (GLP-1 RA vs. placebo: 80% to 97% vs. 63% to 100%), the majority were gastrointestinal-related (47% to 84% vs. 13% to 63%, respectively), most commonly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. AEs requiring treatment discontinuation (0% to 26% vs. 0% to 9%, respectively) and SAEs (0% to 10% vs. 0% to 12%, respectively) were rare.

Limitations

No head-to-head RCTs were available. Heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists are efficacious for weight loss, with reported safety concerns predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, when used among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Primary Funding Source

6 Limitations

The results from this study must be analysed within the context of its limitations. First, there is a relative paucity in head‐to‐head trials comparing tirzepatide against semaglutide. Further studies, especially with longer‐duration trials and varying dosages, can better elucidate the long‐term weight loss reduction and maintenance and characterise the safety profile over time. Second, two non‐RCTs were included in this study, which may introduce bias that can affect the meta‐analysis results. Third, there was heterogeneity across the patient characteristics and the dose regimens in these studies. Fourth, the semaglutide dosage used across several studies, as noted earlier, is lower than the approved dose for T2DM and obesity, as mentioned earlier, which may not fully reflect the results seen at clinically relevant doses.

3.2 Achievement of ≥ 5% bodyweight reduction

The odds of participants achieving ≥ 5% reduction in bodyweight were significantly higher for tirzepatide 15 mg at week 72 than for semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 (OR 1.76; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.97; p = 0.035). The odds of tirzepatide 10 mg over semaglutide 2.4 mg were not statistically significant for achieving ≥ 5% bodyweight reduction in the primary analysis (OR 1.24; 95% CI: 0.75, 2.04; p = 0.407), although the direction of results favoured tirzepatide 10 mg (Figure 2B).

Results of sensitivity analyses 1 and 2 (i.e. comparison of treatment regimen estimands and comparison of outcomes at week 68 for both medications, respectively) also demonstrated that the odds of achieving ≥ 5% bodyweight reduction were significantly higher for tirzepatide 15 mg than semaglutide 2.4 mg (p < 0.01). No significant differences between treatment groups were found in sensitivity analyses 3 and 4 (i.e. using the matching‐adjusted indirect comparison method), though the direction of results favoured tirzepatide 15 mg (Figure 2B).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^dd8d5a40]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the direct comparative studies analysed in this meta‐analysis, tirzepatide demonstrated superior weight loss compared to semaglutide, supporting the notion of enhanced clinical efficacy of dual GLP‐1 and GIP agonism. The efficacy of semaglutide has been established throughout the SUSTAIN trials, where semaglutide showed significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo and active comparators (p < 0.0001 for all). Semaglutide also achieved greater proportions of weight loss over 5% or 10% (p < 0.0001 for all). Additionally, the STEP trials noted that semaglutide 2.4 mg had an average weight loss reduction of up to 16%. Tirzepatide has also been established to be efficacious in reducing body weight, with up to 20.9% weight loss seen across the SURMOUNT trials. However, it is important to note that these trials evaluated each of these GLP‐1 RAs independently rather than direct head‐to‐head trials. Thus, the data in this meta‐analysis provide more clinically relevant comparisons between these agents.

Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle intervention and usage of GLP‐1 RAs is still unclear. However, Wadden et al. suggest that an initial lifestyle intervention period followed by medication addition can maximise weight reduction. This stems from the observation that STEP‐1 (semaglutide only) and STEP‐3 (lifestyle and semaglutide) did not produce an additive benefit towards weight loss. These findings in the literature combined with this study's results suggest that adding semaglutide or tirzepatide produces clinically significant weight loss that can be further potentiated through diet and exercise habit changes. There also appears to be a dose‐dependent improvement in clinical outcomes (glycemic control and weight loss) with tolerable safety profiles at higher doses.

3.2 Weight Loss

Changes in body weight and fat mass were measured across all four studies, with 3 studies reporting on T2DM demographic, while 1 study reported on patients with and without T2DM. The mean weight change across the three studies with a T2DM demographic for tirzepatide was −11.4% (−15.3% to −8.2%), while for semaglutide it was −7.3% (−8.3% to −6.08%). A full summary of weight loss parameters is provided in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Weight loss effects of tirzepatide and semaglutide.

A meta‐analysis between tirzepatide and semaglutide was conducted, and the estimated treatment difference (kg) favoured tirzepatide over semaglutide across four studies. The overall treatment effect was calculated using the Random‐Effect model and resulted in a mean difference of −4.84 kg (95% CI: −6.21 to −3.47). The I 2 statistic, which quantifies heterogeneity, was 78.3% and Tau2, a measure of between‐study variance, was 1.51. The individual study estimates range from −2.9 kg to −5.6 kg, showing consistent superiority of tirzepatide in weight reduction compared to semaglutide across different trials, although the moderate‐to‐high variability of the data expressed by I 2 and Tau 2 should make us cautious in interpreting pooled results. The forest plot can be seen in Figure 2.

### Tirzepatide improved markers of islet cell function and insulin sensitivity in people with T2D (SURPASS-2) [^30aefed1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

It is well recognized that hyperglucagonemia is characteristic in T2D, promoting hepatic glucose output and exacerbating hyperglycemia. In this post hoc analysis, tirzepatide demonstrated significant and rapid improvement in hyperglucagonemia and related α-cell dysfunction, as indicated by reductions in fasting glucagon levels adjusted for fasting glucose ranging from 48.7% to 55.3%. This finding is consistent with studies that demonstrated greater reductions in fasting and postprandial glucagon levels with tirzepatide treatment compared with selective GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with T2D. In a recently published post hoc analysis of markers of β-cell function, in SURPASS-1, tirzepatide, as monotherapy, improved islet cell function, as demonstrated by greater reductions in hyperglucagonemia.

Significantly greater reductions in HOMA2-IR, fasting insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were seen with each tirzepatide dose compared with semaglutide at week 40 in SURPASS-2. These observations were consistent with observed greater numerical improvements in additional metabolic measures often associated with insulin resistance in people living with diabetes, including fasting triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as well as body mass indices, following treatment with tirzepatide compared with semaglutide. These findings are also consistent with observations seen in the post hoc analysis by Lee et al, of the SURPASS-1 study, demonstrating tirzepatide monotherapy vs placebo achieved significant improvements in biomarkers of both pancreatic β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in people with T2D. In the same paper, the authors also reported reductions in HOMA2-IR and fasting insulin levels and increases in total adiponectin and IGF-binding protein 2 levels with tirzepatide vs placebo at week 40. In hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies, treatment of people with T2D with tirzepatide 15 mg for 26 weeks produced a large and significant increase in insulin sensitivity measured by M-value that was greater than that observed for treatment with semaglutide 1 mg. Collectively these results support the hypothesis that GIP receptor agonism may confer additional insulin-sensitizing actions beyond the effects of activating the GLP-1R alone.

### HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes: the contribution of weight loss assessed by a mediation analysis [^a420c686]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management and obstructive sleep apnoea (in the US). To assess the contribution of weight loss (WL) to the observed glycaemic effect, we performed mediation analysis of three randomized, controlled, parallel, 4-arm SURPASS(S)-trials; 1, 2 and 5, for a total of 2831 participants.

Materials and Methods

WL dependent (WL-D) and WL independent (WL-IND) effects on comparator-adjusted glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction at Week 40 were estimated using mediation analysis, adjusted for baseline HbA1c and study-specific stratification factors.

Results

The difference in mean HbA1c change from baseline at 40weeks (total effect) between tirzepatide and the placebo group ranged from -20.0 to -14.6mmol/mol, and that between tirzepatide and semaglutide (1mg) ranged from -5.1 to -1.9mmol/mol. In the placebo-controlled trials, 12%-27% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide dose arms and placebo was estimated as being mediated through WL when given as monotherapy (S1), and 25%-45% when on the background of insulin with or without metformin (S5). Compared with semaglutide, 54%-71% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide and semaglutide was estimated as being WL-D.

Conclusion

The tirzepatide-induced HbA1c reductions from baseline, compared with placebo or semaglutide, were mediated through both WL-D and WL-IND effects. Estimated contributions of WL to the difference in glycaemic efficacy varied and were highest when tirzepatide was compared with semaglutide and less pronounced when compared with placebo. These results help to understand that other factors beyond weight reduction contribute to HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide.

### Why does GLP-1 agonist combined with GIP and / or GCG agonist have greater weight loss effect than GLP-1 agonist alone in obese adults without type 2 diabetes? [^2d4d3e32]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition demanding effective treatment strategies, among which pharmacotherapy plays a critical role. As glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management in adults with obesity, liraglutide and semaglutide have great weight loss effect through reducing food intake and delaying gastric emptying. The emergence of unimolecular polypharmacology, which utilizes single molecules to simultaneously target multiple receptors or pathways, marked a revolutionary improvement in GLP-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy. The dual agonist tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors and has shown enhanced potency for weight loss compared to conventional GLP-1 mono agonist. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that unimolecular GLP-1/glucagon (GCG) dual agonist, as well as GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist, may offer superior weight loss efficacy over GLP-1 agonist. This review summarizes the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the pronounced advantages of GLP-1/GIP dual agonist, GLP-1/GCG dual agonist and GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist over GLP-1 mono agonist in weight reduction in obese adults without type 2 diabetes. A deeper understanding of these unimolecular multitargeting GLP-1-based agonists will provide insights for their clinical application and guide the development of new drugs for obesity treatment.

### Effect of the dual glucose ‐ dependent insulinotropic peptide / gulcagon ‐ like peptide 1 receptor agonist tirzepatide on lipid profile and waist circumference: a systematic review and meta ‐ analysis [^0bb3e30d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of tirzepatide on lipid profile and waist circumference (WC), both of which are risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched for articles published from database inception to July 31, 2022. This meta-analysis included 7 randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 12 weeks that compared tirzepatide with placebo or other antidiabetic medications. The random-effects model was used to estimate mean differences in lipid profile and WC from baseline. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, version 2 was used to assess the outcome's risk of bias. We evaluated the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Findings

A total of 8 articles from 7 trials with 7151 participants were included. All 3 eligible maintenance doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg once a week) were effective in increasing total cholesterol (TC) (P < 0.05), HDL-C (P < 0.05), VLDL-C (P < 0.01), triglyceride (TG) (P < 0.01), and WC (P < 0.01) changes from baseline compared with control agents including placebo, semaglutide, dulaglutide, and degludec. Although the evidence for VLDL-C and TGs by GRADE were high or moderate, the evidences for TC, HDL-C, and WC were low or moderate. Only 5mg once-weekly tirzepatide (P < 0.05), not 10 or 15 mg, could induce significant alteration in LDL-C before sensitivity analysis. The evidence by GRADE was moderate.

Implications

Tirzepatide had superiority over placebo or other antidiabetic agents in controlling lipid and WC levels. However, the levels of evidence by GRADE varied greatly across different outcome indicators. Limitations of the study include evaluating secondary outcomes of original trials for the meta-analyses, not assessing the effect of baseline lipid-lowering therapy on lipid levels, and not exploring the bias induced by glycemic improvement and weight loss.

### Use of dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide in diabetes and weight management [^57b61613]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are effective therapies in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), providing cardioprotective benefits, and lowering weight. The use of GLP1-RA solely for weight-loss has become commonplace in many practices, which in turn has made it difficult in some areas for those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to obtain these much-needed medications.

Methods

Using recent published literature, along with clinical experience, it has become apparent that many GLP1-RAs have become difficult to obtain for patients with diabetes.

Findings

Many clinicians started to prescribe the brand Ozempic® (semaglutide*) and dulaglutide for weight loss despite neither of them being Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication. Ozempic, having outperformed dulaglutide in in both HbA 1c reduction and weight loss, along with FDA approval of semaglutide for weight loss, has quickly become widely used off-label for weight loss. This off-label use may have increased, despite the approval of semaglutide, † because many insurances will not cover semaglutide solely for weight management. Most recently, Eli Lilly was able to develop tirzepatide, ‡ which was FDA approved in May of 2022, and they are seeking fast-track FDA approval for weight loss and are projected to gain this approval within 2023.

Implications

Insurance coverage for weight management remains sparse, and obtaining these therapies for diabetes has now become more burdensome, with insurance companies requiring a prior authorization proving FDA-approved diagnosis of T2DM. Hopefully, should more GLP1-Ras receive approval for weight loss, along with an increase in insurance coverage, the burden on patients with diabetes will be lessened as they are able to quickly obtain this highly effective therapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycaemic control, body weight, and lipid profile for type 2 diabetes: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0e68c873]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on glycaemic control, body weight, and lipid profile in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase from database inception to 19 August 2023.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Eligible randomised controlled trials enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes who received GLP-1RA treatments and compared effects with placebo or any GLP-1RA drug, with a follow-up duration of at least 12 weeks. Trials with a crossover design, non-inferiority studies comparing GLP-1RA and other drug classes without a placebo group, using withdrawn drugs, and non-English studies were deemed ineligible.

Results

76 eligible trials involving 15 GLP-1RA drugs and 39246 participants were included in this network meta-analysis; all subsequent estimates refer to the comparison with placebo. All 15 GLP-1RAs effectively lowered haemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Tirzepatide induced the largest reduction of haemoglobin A 1c concentrations (mean difference -2.10% (95% confidence interval -2.47% to -1.74%), surface under the cumulative ranking curve 94.2%; high confidence of evidence), and fasting plasma glucose concentrations (-3.12 mmol/L (-3.59 to -2.66), 97.2%; high confidence), and proved the most effective GLP-1RA drug for glycaemic control. Furthermore, GLP-1RAs were shown to have strong benefits to weight management for patients with type 2 diabetes. CagriSema (semaglutide with cagrilintide) resulted in the highest weight loss (mean difference -14.03 kg (95% confidence interval -17.05 to -11.00); high confidence of evidence), followed by tirzepatide (-8.47 kg (-9.68 to -7.26); high confidence). Semaglutide was effective in lowering the concentration of low density lipoprotein (-0.16 mmol/L (-0.30 to -0.02)) and total cholesterol (-0.48 mmol/L (-0.84 to -0.11)). Moreover, this study also raises awareness of gastrointestinal adverse events induced by GLP-1RAs, and concerns about safety are especially warranted for high dose administration.

Conclusions

GLP-1RAs are efficacious in treating adults with type 2 diabetes. Compared with the placebo, tirzepatide was the most effective GLP-1RA drug for glycaemic control by reducing haemoglobin A 1c and fasting plasma glucose concentrations. GLP-1RAs also significantly improved weight management for type 2 diabetes, with CagriSema performing the best for weight loss. The results prompt safety concerns for GLP-1RAs, especially with high dose administration, regarding gastrointestinal adverse events.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^ebdb2914]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

An important note for GLP‐1 GI AEs is that standard approaches may not correctly characterise the incidence of GI AEs given the mechanism of action of GLP‐1 RAs, which decrease gastric emptying and suppress appetite to reduce overall food intake. Rather than vomiting, nausea was reported more frequently as the reason for treatment discontinuation in the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials. However, a gradual dose escalation may be able to increase tolerability and reduce the frequency of GI AEs. There has been some speculation on the contribution of GI AEs to the weight reduction seen in GLP‐1 RAs, but mediation analysis suggests a minimal contribution. Overall, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well tolerated and AEs are deemed mild to moderate in severity.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^4839a112]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

As semaglutide 2 mg has only been recently approved (2022) for use in Europe and the United States, the SURPASS Phase 3 clinical trial programme was limited to those doses available at the time (1.0 mg) and did not include the semaglutide 2 mg dose. However, an adjusted indirect treatment comparison using data from SURPASS‐2 and SUSTAIN FORTE, leveraged the semaglutide 1 mg comparator to assess the treatment effect of semaglutide 2 mg and tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg on an aggregate data population. In this adjusted indirect treatment comparison, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight versus semaglutide 2 mg whereas there were no differences between tirzepatide 5 mg and semaglutide 2 mg. The magnitude of these differences were also clinically meaningful, with an estimated treatment difference for HbA1c reduction of 0.4% and body weight reduction of 3‐5 kg for tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg compared with semaglutide 2 mg.

Use of a GLP‐1 receptor agonist is recommended by ADA/EASD in people with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and should be considered for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease to reduce MACE risk. The ongoing SURPASS‐CVOT (NCT04255433) will provide definitive evidence on the impact of tirzepatide on cardiovascular risk relative to the GLP‐1 receptor agonist dulaglutide, which is also indicated for the reduction in cardiovascular risk for people with established cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors. Cardiovascular outcome trials for some GLP‐1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide 1 mg, focused on populations with established cardiovascular disease. In contrast, most participants in the REWIND cardiovascular outcome trial for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, which showed reduced cardiovascular outcomes with a similar effect size to other GLP‐1 receptor agonist trials, had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease. This indicates that dulaglutide may be a robust comparator for tirzepatide in the SURPASS‐CVOT. Currently available data from SURPASS indicate beneficial effects on blood pressure and lipids. Data from the cardiovascular meta‐analysis, including the high cardiovascular risk population in SURPASS‐4, suggest no increased cardiovascular risk with tirzepatide.

### Incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes in adults living with obesity treated with tirzepatide or semaglutide: real world evidence from an international retrospective cohort study [^b4568fe5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), by slowing gastric emptying and reducing appetite, are an increasingly utilised pharmacotherapy in the treatment of overweight and obesity. The once weekly preparation of GLP-1 RA, semaglutide, offers greater weight loss compared to the administration of earlier generation GLP-1 RAs such as exenatide.

Recently, tirzepatide, a dual agonist of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), has demonstrated greater degree of weight loss compared to single peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Weight loss is unequivocally the most effective intervention to reduce the subsequent risk of T2D in individuals living with overweight or obesity, while in individuals who have already developed T2D, weight loss is associated with fewer adverse health events, lesser micro- and macrovascular complications, greater overall survival and remission. However, the clinical effect of the newly introduced dual agonist, tirzepatide, on the incidence of T2D in individuals living with overweight and obesity, and indeed the impact on cardiovascular outcomes remains unexplored. Controversy surrounding semaglutide and the purported increased risk of suicidal thoughts, initially raised by the Icelandic Medicines Agency, has been subject to extensive review and has since been disproven. The risk of suicidal attempt and ideation has not been studied with tirzepatide use. Hence, in this study, we took advantage of a large international federated database of electronic health records to determine and compare the relative association of tirzepatide and semaglutide on i) incident T2D in individuals living with obesity, and ii) to assess their relative effects on the rates of micro-, macrovascular complications, all-cause mortality, and suicidal attempt/ideation, in individuals with pre-existing T2D.

### Tirzepatide: a novel, first-in-class, dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonist [^2ff5721f]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and discuss its potential role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide is a novel once-weekly dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been studied in the SURPASS clinical trials in doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. Tirzepatide phase III clinical trials, SURPASS-1 through SURPASS-5, demonstrate that this medication is safe and effective in treating type 2 diabetes both with and without a variety of background medications versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine in different patient populations. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, with a relatively low withdrawal rate in the active treatment arms. It seems likely that tirzepatide will be recommended as a preferred option in the American Diabetes Association treatment algorithm for high glucose lowering effects in patients with a compelling need for low hypoglycemia risk and weight loss. However, the positioning of tirzepatide in the treatment algorithm will ultimately be dependent on the results of the cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) or other outcome-based trials. Tirzepatide is effective for treating type 2 diabetes by lowering glycated hemoglobin and contributing to significant weight loss.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^7b3a7267]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In Heise et al. (n = 117), a max dose of tirzepatide (15 mg/day), semaglutide (1 mg/day) and placebo groups were evaluated over 28 weeks. It was found that the tirzepatide group had a significantly greater decrease in weight compared to semaglutide and the placebo group at both weeks 5 and 28 (p < 0.01). Estimated treatment differences were seen as early as 5 weeks, with 15 mg of tirzepatide to 1 mg of semaglutide showing −0.7 kg (95% CI: −1.4, −0.1) (p = 0.029). This trend widened at 28 weeks, with an estimated treatment difference of −4.3 kg (95% CI: −6.8 to −1.9) (p < 0.001). Fat and fat‐free mass significantly decreased for both semaglutide and tirzepatide (p < 0.001) as well. Fat mass and fat‐free mass reductions with tirzepatide compared to semaglutide were −3.8 kg (95% CI: −6.2 to −1.4, p = 0.02) and −0.8 kg (95% CI: −1.5 to −0.1, p = 0.018), respectively. Interestingly, it was found that both tirzepatide and semaglutide groups had significantly reduced appetite compared to baseline (p < 0.001), with the tirzepatide group also showing a significant difference in appetite compared to the placebo group (p = 0.007) but not semaglutide (p = 0.260).

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: an adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^6d327a8c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the SURPASS‐2 study, all doses of tirzepatide were superior to semaglutide 1 mg in both HbA1c and body weight change from baseline at week 40 in patients with T2D and elevated glucose levels (HbA1c 8%‐10%) with metformin. With the investigation and availability of semaglutide 2 mg, data on comparative efficacy between tirzepatide and this higher dose of semaglutide may be relevant to make clinical decisions. Indirect treatment comparisons of glucose‐lowering agents have previously been reported in the literature in the absence of head‐to‐head trials.,

This is the first comparison of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus injectable semaglutide 2 mg on the change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight in patients with T2D and elevated glucose levels (HbA1c 8%‐10%) with metformin. An aITC method was used based on the results of two phase 3 multinational trials, SURPASS‐2 and SUSTAIN FORTE, with the common comparator arm semaglutide 1 mg. The primary analysis showed that the effects of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg on the reduction of HbA1c and body weight were statistically significant and clinically meaningful compared with semaglutide 2 mg. The lowest dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) offered similar reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight versus the highest dose of semaglutide (2 mg). The American Diabetes Association recommends an HbA1c target of less than 7% and body weight loss of at least 5% for the majority of patients with T2D. In SUSTAIN FORTE, semaglutide 2 mg showed superiority over semaglutide 1 mg in HbA1c and weight change at 40 weeks; however, 32% and 41% of patients in the semaglutide 2‐mg arm did not achieve an HbA1c target of less than 7% and weight loss of at least 5%, respectively. The higher efficacy of tirzepatide, as shown here, comparing it with the highest approved dose of selective GLP‐1 RA semaglutide for the management of T2D, is probably a result of the additional GIP RA activity associated with tirzepatide. The incremental HbA1c reduction of 0.4% with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg and greater body weight reduction of 3.2 kg with tirzepatide 10 mg and 5.2 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg compared with semaglutide 2 mg reported in this analysis may help more patients reach these clinically relevant goals.

Side Effects and Safety of‐1Therapy

Safety analyses performed in the phase 3 trials of GLP‐1 RAs demonstrate that gastrointestinal side effects represent the most frequently reported side effects. In the Phase 3 STEP program, 81.3% to 95.8% of participants with overweight or obesity with and without T2D experienced ≥ 1 adverse event following once‐weekly subcutaneous use of semaglutide 2.4 mg. Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most common and included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation, most of which were transient and of mild‐to‐moderate severity. The majority (78.9%–81.8%, versus 72.0% for placebo) of participants treated with tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT‐1 trial reported ≥ 1 adverse event, with the most common being mild‐to‐moderate gastrointestinal events. Gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, are commonly reported upon initiation of GLP‐1 RA treatment; however, these often diminish within the first month of treatment and can be mitigated through a gradual dose‐escalation period and temporary dietary adjustments. The commonly reported side effects associated with GLP‐1 RA use, along with clinical advice to manage and ameliorate these, are documented in Table 3.

General Guidance to Alleviate and Manage Side Effects Associated With GLP‐1 RA Therapy*

Preclinical studies found evidence of GLP‐1 RAs causing dose‐dependent and treatment duration‐dependent thyroid C‐cell tumors, which are rare in humans. The potential risk of developing these tumors was included as a warning in the FDA approvals for all long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs. However, since these approvals, clinical trials have found no evidence of an increased risk of any cancer with GLP‐1 RA therapy. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence suggesting any psychiatric, metabolic, or cardiovascular complications associated with GLP‐1 RA therapy. In the aforementioned large meta‐analysis of 8 trials including > 60 000 people with T2D, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia, retinopathy, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer did not differ significantly between the GLP‐1 RA and placebo treatment groups. Overall, despite the mild‐to‐moderate gastrointestinal side effects associated with therapy initiation and dose escalation, GLP‐1 RAs have a well characterized and tolerable safety profile.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^03f37f3d]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — Tirzepatide outcomes and regulatory status: Tirzepatide, a co‑agonist of glucagon‑like peptide‑1 (GLP‑1) and glucose‑dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, was approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with mean weight loss results of 5.5 kg greater than semaglutide 1.0 mg at 40 weeks of treatment in subjects with T2DM, and although not yet approved for obesity, in participants without T2DM the highest dose of tirzepatide 15 mg weekly demonstrated mean weight loss of 21% after 72 weeks of treatment, with nearly 40% achieving ≥ 25% total body weight loss (TBWL).

### Incretin analogs for weight management in adults without diabetes [^c419ace2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This is a narrative review of incretin analogs and their effect on weight management in adult without diabetes.

Data Sources

Randomized controlled trials were identified by English language. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched from inception through June 2023 to identify all pertinent trials reporting outcomes on efficacy and safety search using the terms: tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, and obesity.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Selected studies were included if the study population was composed of adults without diabetes being treated by glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 agonists for weight management, and weight loss was assessed as a primary outcome.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies involving 3 pharmacotherapies (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide) were identified. Efficacy data supporting the use of these agents for weight management were promising when compared to placebo and/or other behavioral therapies. Percent weight loss ranged from 5.7% to 11.8%, 14.9% to 17.4%, and 15% to 20.9% for liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, respectively. Safety data were relatively similar across all trials and identified gastrointestinal adverse effects as most common.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists are preferred for overweight or obese patients by the American Gastroenterological Association. Future guidelines may address tirzepatides' place in therapy as new evidence comes forth. Providers should consider patient-specific factors such as cost, adverse effects, drug interactions, and comorbidities when prescribing these agents and provide education regarding the need for concurrent diet and exercise modifications.

Conclusions

All incretin analogs in this review are superior to placebo when used for weight management in adults without diabetes.

### Novel GLP-1-based medications for type 2 diabetes and obesity [^2d9b0ae0]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The approvals of semaglutide and tirzepatide have set new benchmarks in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Building on their success, novel GLP-1-based therapeutics are rapidly advancing. These next-generation agents engage not only GLP-1 receptors but also those for other gastro-entero-pancreatic hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, amylin, and peptide YY (PYY) to enhance energy uptake, storage, and expenditure through synergistic mechanisms. Both GIP receptor agonism and antagonism, particularly in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonism, have shown promise. Maridebart cafraglutide, combining GLP-1R agonism with GIPR antagonism, exemplifies this innovative approach. Glucagon co-agonists like survodutide and mazdutide have demonstrated significant weight loss and improved glycemic control. Amylin-based agents, including CagriSema (cagrilintide + semaglutide) and amycretin, enhance satiety and glycemic outcomes through complementary actions. Further innovation is seen in triple agonists such as retatrutide, which targets GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors to amplify metabolic effects. Meanwhile, the emergence of orally active small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists like danuglipron and orforglipron, which are resistant to enzymatic degradation, marks a major advance in patient-friendly drug delivery. This review explores the mechanisms, clinical development, and therapeutic potential of these novel agents, excluding already approved drugs like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. We highlight how multi-receptor agonists and oral GLP-1-based therapies may reshape the future landscape of obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment by offering more effective and better-tolerated options.

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^5874a14b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent cohort study found that tirzepatide was significantly more effective than semaglutide for weight management in participants with T2D; however, the study pooled results across treatment doses. Additionally, for patients without T2D, indirect comparisons have shown tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg to be associated with improvements in weight reduction outcomes versus semaglutide 2.4 mg.

For the treatment of T2D, tirzepatide has been compared directly in an RCT to semaglutide 1 mg, and indirectly in an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) and a network meta‐analysis (NMA) to semaglutide 0.5, 1 and 2 mg. However, these comparisons did not focus only on participants with obesity or overweight, and the semaglutide doses were lower than the 2.4 mg dose indicated for obesity management.

Therefore, here an ITC was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg with semaglutide 2.4 mg, exclusively for the management of obesity and overweight in participants with T2D, at the primary timepoint of the pivotal trials SURMOUNT‐2 and STEP 2.

### Real-world effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide on HbA1c and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^d9f36e9a]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison with Prior Real-World Evidence

The exploration of tirzepatide versus semaglutide effectiveness has been informed by a few other real-world studies. Rodriguez et al. examined the effects of tirzepatide and semaglutide on weight change in GLP-1 RA naïve patients with overweight or obesity. After 12 months, PS-matched patients on tirzepatide showed a 15.3% bodyweight reduction, while semaglutide patients showed an 8.3% reduction. Adjusting for residual confounding, they observed a – 6.9% difference, exceeding our naïve cohort's finding of – 3.5%. However, both studies favored tirzepatide over semaglutide. The discrepancy in weight loss between the two studies is likely due to patient demographics. All patients in our study had a diagnosis of T2D, compared to 50% in the Rodriquez study. GLP-1 RAs tend to result in more significant weight loss for individuals without diabetes, likely contributing to the greater weight loss and highlighting the importance of considering patient demographics in evaluating GLP-1 RAs.

Chuang et al. reported that tirzepatide treatment was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, adverse cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, and adverse kidney events compared to GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2D. They observed a body weight loss difference of – 2.9 kg between tirzepatide and GLP-1 RAs, although the specific GLP-1 RA was not identified, limiting direct comparison with our study. While specific mortality, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes were not the focus in the current study, the comparable changes in absolute weight observed for both naïve and non-naïve cohorts suggest similar effects for patients with these comorbidities.

Clinical Significance and Future Directions

The differences in HbA1c and weight reduction suggest that tirzepatide's dual agonism may offer improved glycemic control and weight loss benefits for patients with T2D compared to a single agonist like semaglutide, potentially reducing diabetes-related complications. Clinicians should consider these differences, especially for patients struggling with both weight management and glycemic control, to optimize individualized treatment. Future research should explore tirzepatide and semaglutide's long-term effects on cardiovascular outcomes, mortality, and quality of life across diverse populations. Studying subgroup (e.g. age, gender, and baseline weight) responses could enhance personalized medicine by identifying patients likely to benefit most from each treatment.

### Bridging the gap between GLP1-receptor agonists and cardiovascular outcomes: evidence for the role of tirzepatide [^9bff4c05]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A new drug named tirzepatide has been approved to treat T2DM, and it is expected to be approved for weight loss by activating both GLP-1 and GIP receptors through a unique mechanism. Currently, there are other dual GIPR/GLP-1R agonists available, such as GLP-1R/GR (glucagon receptor), GLP-1R/AR (amylin receptor), and GLP-1R/NPYR (peptide YY binds to neuropeptide Y receptors) and even triple agonists that can activate GIPR to treat obesity and T2DM. This has led to renewed interest in understanding the safety of GIP/GIPR in humans. It is essential to gain a deeper understanding of GIP safety to guide future research projects and develop GIP-based treatments. The post hoc analysis found that tirzepatide at all doses investigated reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome related to cardiovascular risk factors more than placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine. Comparing tirzepatide to GLP1RAs using the results of prior comparison trials is challenging. However, the added agonism of GIPR seems to have a more positive impact on weight loss. It is important to develop a single pharmacological medication with multiple functions, such as tirzepatide. This medication can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease weight, and treat dyslipidemia at an early clinical stage, while also dramatically lowering blood sugar levels. Therefore, it seems that tirzepatide is more than just a new antidiabetic drug. The development of further dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists seems to be a promising next step in managing various cardiovascular disease. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of these substances. The role of tirzepatide in therapy will become more evident as more research is conducted.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^27e77ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In SURPASS‐2, a composite endpoint assessing the proportion of participants who achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without clinically significant (< 54 mg/dl) or severe hypoglycaemia and with ≥ 10% weight loss was met by 32%‐60% of participants who received tirzepatide compared with 22% who received semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting serum glucose (FSG) was significantly reduced by all tirzepatide doses in SURPASS‐1, ‐2 and ‐5 at either 40 or 52 weeks compared with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg and placebo with background insulin, respectively.FSG levels at endpoint did not differ from insulin degludec in the 10‐ and 15‐mg groups in SURPASS‐3 and in SURPASS‐4 did not differ from insulin glargine 100 U/ml in the 5‐ and 10‐mg groups but were significantly lower in the 15‐mg group (Figure S1). In SURPASS‐3 and ‐4, significant reductions in FSG compared with baseline were apparent as early as 2 weeks (the earliest measurement) after treatment initiation when all participants received 2.5 mg. Across the two studies and three dose groups, the magnitude of this change at 2 weeks was −30.3 to −34.0 mg/dl (−18% to −20%). In a small Phase 1 study, 24 h following treatment with a 2.5 mg initiating dose of tirzepatide, there was a non‐statistically significant (vs. placebo) decrease from baseline of –19 mg/dl in FSG. However, on Day 8 (pre‐dose) a statistically significant (vs. placebo) reduction of −39 mg/dl occurred, indicating early glucose‐lowering potential following tirzepatide initiation.

Conclusion

In this post hoc analysis of the SURPASS 2 trial, treatment with tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg significantly improved biomarkers of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity as well as glycemic control and body weight loss compared with the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide 1 mg, in people with T2D on concomitant metformin. Improvement in HbA1c and weight loss were consistent and significantly higher with tirzepatide regardless of baseline β-cell function and insulin resistance biomarkers.

Key Points

Question

How does weight loss differ between patients receiving tirzepatide compared with semaglutide among a clinical population of adults with overweight or obesity?

Findings

In this cohort study of 18 386 propensity-score matched patients initiating tirzepatide or semaglutide labeled for type 2 diabetes, discontinuation was common; most achieved weight loss of 5% or greater within 1 year of treatment.

Meaning

Although most adults with overweight or obesity experienced 5% or greater weight loss with treatment, the benefit was greater with tirzepatide.

### Change in pharmacodynamic variables following once-weekly tirzepatide treatment versus dulaglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS J-mono substudy) [^f03bb2e8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In terms of body composition, significant reductions in body weight and body fat mass at Week 52 were observed in the tirzepatide 10‐mg and 15‐mg treatment arms. Body fat reduction for tirzepatide 5–15 mg (−4.1 to −6.8 kg) was greater than that observed for semaglutide and canagliflozin in the SUSTAIN‐8 study (−2.6 to −3.4 kg, respectively) despite a lower baseline body weight (78.4 kg) compared with SUSTAIN‐8 (88.3 kg). The observed reductions in body fat mass were mainly attributed to the reduction in body weight and the observed reductions in body water were mainly attributed to the reduction in lean body mass.

This is the first clinical study to investigate long‐term pharmacodynamic effects and body composition in Japanese patients treated with tirzepatide. This study has some limitations. A notable limitation of this substudy was the relatively small sample size in each treatment arm, which included only a subset of patients from the main study. Due to the limited sample size, differences in some baseline characteristics between treatment arms were observed, however, statistical analyses were based on a model adjusted for baseline variables. In addition, only one endpoint measurement following the MTT at Week 32 was performed. Compared with baseline, blood glucose levels were reduced at study endpoint, making comparisons of postprandial variables difficult between baseline and study endpoint due to less insulin being required to lower glucose levels. Although participants agreed not to initiate an intensive diet and/or exercise programme at any point during the study, dietary and physical activity were not formally assessed.

In conclusion, tirzepatide at 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg was capable of normalizing glucose, insulin, C‐peptide and glucagon levels after a standardized meal test at Week 32, with statistically significant changes from baseline in comparison with dulaglutide in Japanese patients with T2D from the SURPASS J‐mono study. In terms of appetite, all three doses of tirzepatide were effective in increasing fullness, and doses of 10 mg and 15 mg decreased hunger, although no statistical differences between tirzepatide and dulaglutide were observed. Body composition analyses revealed significant body weight reductions with tirzepatide, mainly due to a decrease in body fat mass. The ability of tirzepatide to target both glycaemic factors and weight loss in Japanese patients with T2D is an advantage over standard approaches for T2D that may increase or have little effect on weight.

4 DISCUSSION

In this substudy of the SURPASS J‐mono trial, we observed statistically significant reductions in glucose and glucagon AUC (0–6h) following all doses of tirzepatide. In addition, compared with dulaglutide, significant differences in AUC (0–6h) values after dose for glucose, insulin, C‐peptide, glucagon and triglycerides were observed with all doses of tirzepatide, except in the case of triglycerides at the tirzepatide 10‐mg dose. Several studies have undertaken MTTs in patients with T2D treated with short‐ and long‐acting GLP‐1RAs. These studies have shown that short‐acting GLP‐1RAs, such as lixisenatide and exenatide, reduced glycaemic excursions, insulin secretion and glucagon levels via delayed gastric emptying. Long‐acting GLP‐1RAs, such as liraglutide and dulaglutide, reduced overall glucose and glucagon levels, and increased postprandial insulin secretion, which peaked at approximately 90 min following the start of a standardized meal. Interestingly, the long‐acting GLP‐1RA semaglutide, unlike dulaglutide and liraglutide, reduced overall glucose levels without increasing insulin, and suppressed glucagon levels in a 24‐hour meal test. Similarly, the current study demonstrated that postprandial secretions of insulin and glucagon were suppressed in patients receiving tirzepatide. It is conceivable that postprandial insulin secretion was not considerably enhanced by tirzepatide (and semaglutide) due to body weight reduction and subsequent enhancement of insulin sensitivity. It was also reported that tirzepatide improves insulin sensitivity independent of body weight reduction in diet‐induced obese mice, although the exact mechanisms are yet to be fully defined. It is also possible that postprandial insulin secretion was not overly enhanced by tirzepatide due to suppression of postprandial glucagon secretion, which is known to enhance insulin secretion. However, it was recently reported that GIP enhances postprandial glucagon secretion, thereby stimulating insulin secretion. Thus, it remains to be determined how tirzepatide suppresses postprandial glucagon secretion.

4.2 Adverse Events

Due to the limited amount of head‐to‐head trials, a comprehensive comparison of AEs between semaglutide and tirzepatide was unable to be done. Of the included studies, semaglutide and tirzepatide had similar GI AE profiles and tolerability, which were dose‐dependent. The monotherapy trials for semaglutide and tirzepatide can provide insight into the tolerability of these agents. Semaglutide in the SUSTAIN trials exhibited similar or greater rates of AEs, with the most common system affected being GI. However, the rates of severe AEs were comparable between all treatment arms. Semaglutide's GI AEs ranged from 27% to 44% compared to 15% with placebo and 48% with dulaglutide. Most AEs experienced by GLP‐1 RA cohorts were transient and generally categorised as mild or moderate. Notably, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs was higher with semaglutide compared to its comparators (5% to 14% vs. 1% to 8%). A pooled analysis of 16 phase IIIa RCTs from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials (11,159 patients) found that 39.1% to 41.9% of subcutaneous and oral semaglutide, respectively, reported GI AEs compared to 22.0% to 24.8% with its comparators. However, the tolerance of semaglutide is considered generally similar to other GLP‐1 RAs. In the SURMOUNT‐1 trial, the most common AE for tirzepatide was also GI of mild and moderate severity. The treatment discontinuation proportions for 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg were 4.3%, 7.1% and 6.2%, respectively. SURMOUNT‐2 also found GI AEs to be the most commonly reported AE, with less than 5% of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. In obesity patients in SURMOUNT‐3 and SURMOUNT‐4, a high rate of AEs of 87.1% and 81.0%, respectively, was observed, also with GI AEs being the most frequent system affected. A recent meta‐analysis of 10 tirzepatide trials (n = 6836) found a dose‐dependent relationship for GI AEs, with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg reporting 39% (95% CI: 35%–43%), 46% (95% CI: 42%–49%) and 49% (95% CI: 38%–60%), respectively. Furthermore, the risk and recurrence of acute pancreatitis is a serious health concern for patients taking GLP‐1 RAs. Nassar et al. conducted a retrospective study comparing the recurrence rates of acute pancreatitis among patients with T2DM or obesity taking GLP‐1 RAs versus those who did not. Overall, GLP‐1 RA users had significantly lower recurrence rates of acute pancreatitis at 13.8% versus 40.9% for non‐GLP‐1 RA users. Additionally, semaglutide and tirzepatide had the lowest recurrence risks, with the former reporting 11.7% and the latter displaying a significantly lower rate at 6.2%.

### Characteristics and dosing patterns of tirzepatide users with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^5102f004]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) approved in the USA for treatment of T2D (May 2022) and obesity (November 2023). The phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) alone or in combination with commonly prescribed antihyperglycemic medications (metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin glargine) in patients with T2D. Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight versus placebo (SURPASS-1, SURPASS-5), and active comparators including semaglutide 1 mg (SURPASS-2), titrated insulin degludec (SURPASS-3), and titrated insulin glargine (SURPASS-4). Treatment with tirzepatide also resulted in significant improvements in health- and weight-related quality of life across the five SURPASS studies. In the phase 3 SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with obesity and T2D, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in clinically meaningful reduction in body weight and substantial reduction in HbA1c levels.

Evidence from meta-analyses and secondary analyses of clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide may improve other outcomes of interest for patients with T2D. Tirzepatide may reduce urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and maintain renal function, improve levels of hepatic transaminases, and reduce liver fat content versus placebo or active comparators. Preliminary evidence suggests no increased risk of cancer. In a post hoc mediation analysis of the SURPASS program, tirzepatide was associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure across doses, while in a pre-specified meta-analysis of the SURPASS program, tirzepatide showed cardiovascular safety compared to controls.

Although tirzepatide has demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials, real-world data on utilization of tirzepatide in T2D are limited given its relatively recent availability. The overall objective of this real-world retrospective study was to characterize the cohort initiating tirzepatide for T2D and to describe utilization patterns of tirzepatide in these patients using a large claims database in the USA.

4.3 Comparative effectiveness studies of‐for weight loss

In general, there were few large, methodologically strong head‐to‐head comparative effectiveness studies of weight loss in obese users of different GLP‐1RA for weight loss (Table 2). Liraglutide has been compared with dulaglutide, showing no clear difference in weight loss. In patients receiving GLP‐1RA treatment for T2D or obesity, semaglutide use was more likely to lead to weight reduction of ≥ 10% compared with liraglutide use. In individuals without T2D, weight loss was 6.9% for semaglutide, 6.6% for liraglutide and 3.1% for dulaglutide. A newer large real‐world comparative cohort study from the US of more than 18 000 adults with overweight or obesity compared weight loss during treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide. The treatment was labelled for T2D, yet only 52% of individuals in the study were classified as having T2D. The achieved treatment doses were not reported. The study found a larger weight loss at 12 months for tirzepatide (−15.3%) versus semaglutide (−8.3%) in individuals who had not been excluded due to discontinuation or GLP‐1RA switching. Two recent studies based on the TriNetX database have compared users of tirzepatide with either users of semaglutideor other GLP‐1RAs (combined). Anson et al. followed individuals after six months of completed treatment with tirzepatide and semaglutide and found that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and decreased risk of developing T2D in individuals without pre‐existing diabetes compared with semaglutide at one‐year follow‐up. In patients with T2D, Chuang et al. found a greater effect on weight loss with tirzepatide than other GLP‐1RA combined; however, treatment duration was not reported. More well‐conducted real‐world studies in different cohorts and with comparable doses are required for concluding on real‐world comparative effectiveness.

### Gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^49b4b6ac]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The availability of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) such as liraglutide and semaglutide, and a GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide coagonist (tirzepatide) represents a paradigm shift in the management of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. There is now considerable attention, including in the public media, on the effect of both long-acting and short-acting GLP-1RAs to delay gastric emptying. Although slowed gastric emptying is integral to reducing post-prandial blood glucose responses in type 2 diabetes, marked slowing of gastric emptying might also increase the propensity for longer intragastric retention of food, with a consequent increased risk of aspiration at the time of surgery or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This Personal View summarises current knowledge of the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs on gastrointestinal physiology, particularly gastric emptying, and discusses the implications for the development of sound pre-operative or pre-procedural guidelines. The development of pre-procedural guidelines is currently compromised by the poor evidence base, particularly in relation to the effect of long-acting GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying. We suggest pre-procedural management pathways for individuals on GLP-1RA-based therapy and discuss priorities for future research.

The study SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) was published by Juan P Frías and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM? In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the population was: 939 patients (509 female, 430 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; history of pancreatitis; history of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy warranting urgent treatment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic maculopathy. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 470 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 40 weeks) n = 469 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 1 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 40 weeks). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40 (2.01% vs. 1.86%; ARD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 40 (7.6 kg vs. 5.7 kg; ARD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 7.0% (82% vs. 79%; AD 3%, 95% CI -0.01 to 6.01) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 5.7% (27% vs. 19%; AD 8%, 95% CI 3.25 to 12.75). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypoglycemia, ≥ 1 adverse event. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^c2731d90]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0–3; 8mgweeks 4–7; 12mgweeks 8–11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0–1; 5mgweeks 2–3; 10mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0–3; 7.5mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9kg/m 2. At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^9753fdda]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

An important consideration is that many studies evaluating switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC were conducted before the availability of the dual GLP‐1 RA/GIP agonist, tirzepatide. Given tirzepatide's high glycemic and weight loss efficacy, switching to an FRC in those on tirzepatide may not be beneficial, though it remains speculative in the absence of evidence for this comparison. Therefore, adding basal insulin (if not already initiated) may be warranted in patients already on tirzepatide when attempting to achieve glycemic control.

Another consideration to initiating FRC therapy is that iGlarLixi contains lixisenatide, a short‐acting GLP‐1 RA. Thus, switching to lixisenatide from long‐acting agents, such as weekly dosed injectable semaglutide or dulaglutide, may reduce gastrointestinal side effects as its effects do not last throughout the entire day, thus limiting GLP‐1 receptor activation at meal times farther from the dose. However, the change to lixisenatide may also alter post‐prandial glycemic efficacy since lixisenatide has lower glycemic efficacy compared to those weekly dosed GLP‐1 RAs. It is also important to consider that lixisenatide has lower weight loss efficacy vs. those same GLP‐1 RAs (i.e. injectable semaglutide, dulaglutide) or the dual GLP‐1 RA/GIP combination, tirzepatide. On the other hand, iDegLira contains liraglutide, a true once‐daily GLP‐1 RA (having a longer duration of effect than lixisenatide) providing more stable GLP‐1 receptor stimulation than lixisenatide and may be preferred for those previously on once‐weekly GLP‐1 RAs. Liraglutide also has higher glycemic and weight loss efficacy, plus positive cardiovascular outcomes data as compared to lixisenatide. However, a limitation to its use as a FRC is the maximum dose of 1.8 mg once daily, and the inability to titrate the GLP‐1 RA component independent of the basal insulin.

2025. 6158 The popularity of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists continues, with use of tirzepatide and semaglutide surpassing that of traditional weight-lowering medications. Prescriptions for the popular appetite suppressant phentermine rapidly declined as tirzepatide and semaglutide entered US markets, according to a population-based cohort study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Based on commercial insurance claims data, about 40% of people without diabetes who took a weight-loss medication used phentermine at the beginning of 2021, but by the end of 2023, fewer than 10% did.

### Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and cardiometabolic protection: historical development and future challenges [^5a449d23]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes

The first GLP-1RA to receive clinical approval, exenatide, was introduced in 2005 for the treatment of T2D. Since then, additional therapies have been developed, including liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and tirzepatide — the first dual agonist targeting both the GLP-1R and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), whose endogenous ligand (GIP) is predominantly synthesized in enteroendocrine K cells located in the duodenum and jejunum. Among these, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are the most widely used GLP-1RAs for T2D, with their efficacy supported by robust evidence from phase 3 clinical trials.

In the SUSTAIN-7 trial, semaglutide showed superiority to dulaglutide at both low and high doses in improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss, allowing more patients to achieve clinically meaningful goals while maintaining a comparable safety profile. Similarly, in the SURPASS-2 trial, tirzepatide was shown to be both non-inferior and superior to semaglutide in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels at 40 weeks. A broader cardiovascular evaluation of tirzepatide, conducted through a prespecified meta-analysis of individual patient data from seven clinical trials, confirmed its safety in people with T2D. In addition to glycemic control and weight loss, GLP-1RAs offer additional benefits such as reductions in blood pressure, postprandial lipemia, and inflammation, which likely contribute to their cardiovascular benefits. In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trial program showed that treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a clinically meaningful reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, emphasizing its potential to address broader cardiometabolic health.

### Changes in weight and glycemic control following obesity treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide by discontinuation status [^1d5b949e]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In this retrospective cohort study of 7881 patients treated with injectable forms of semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity in a routine clinical setting, treatment discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages were common. The average weight reduction in this cohort at 1 year was lower than that observed in the main phase 3 trials, likely because of these factors. In patients who had prediabetes at baseline, treatment discontinuation was also associated with attenuated HbA1c reduction at 1 year. Our findings could inform the decisions of health care providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
