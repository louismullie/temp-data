## Question

HIV patient presented with erythematous rash over his knuckles that gets worse during sun exposure, your are suspecting a diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda, which of the following is the best diagnostic study:
a. Serum porphyrin level.
b. Pink florescence urine.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic test is best to confirm suspected porphyria cutanea tarda in an HIV patient with a photosensitive, erythematous rash on the knuckles: serum porphyrin level versus pink fluorescence urine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of PCT and which porphyrins accumulate. Then, I should verify which specimen type and assay best detects those porphyrins. Next, I will review comparative diagnostic performance and guideline or expert recommendations. After that, I need to consider HIV-specific nuances and preanalytical pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and state the best single test with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. PCT results from reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity, leading to accumulation of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, which are water-soluble and excreted in urine and present in plasma, causing photosensitivity and skin fragility; HIV is a recognized susceptibility factor via hepatic injury and iron dysregulation, so the biochemical signal should still be detectable in urine and plasma [^a250bdf7] [^236577f9] [^552d38e6].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic targets. The hallmark biochemical abnormality in PCT is markedly elevated urinary porphyrins, particularly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, with plasma porphyrins also elevated; this pattern distinguishes PCT from other porphyrias and from pseudoporphyria, which lacks porphyrin elevation despite similar clinical features [^e63717de] [^1f91e2da].

> I will now examine the two options. Option A, serum porphyrin level, is a plasma-based test that can detect circulating porphyrins and is useful, but I should confirm whether it is the most sensitive first-line screen. Option B, "pink fluorescence urine", is a colloquial way of referring to a Wood's lamp examination of urine that shows coral-red fluorescence when porphyrins are elevated, which is a classic bedside clue but not a quantitative diagnostic test; the actual diagnostic step is a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile, which is the reference-standard biochemical confirmation for PCT [^6eb7f09a] [^e63717de].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought serum porphyrins might be the best single test because plasma is convenient, but I should double-check comparative sensitivity and guideline direction. Multiple authoritative sources emphasize that urinary porphyrin analysis is the primary diagnostic test for PCT, with plasma porphyrins as supportive; a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile demonstrating a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin confirms the diagnosis, whereas plasma alone may miss subtle cases or be less sensitive in early disease [^e63717de] [^a250bdf7] [^58e5aa2e].

> Let me consider HIV-specific issues. HIV-associated PCT still produces the same biochemical signature of elevated urinary uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, so the diagnostic approach does not change; however, I need to ensure that any concurrent liver disease or iron overload is evaluated because these are common in HIV and can modulate severity and management, even though they do not alter the initial biochemical test choice [^552d38e6] [^a250bdf7].

> I should confirm preanalytical considerations. Urine porphyrins are relatively stable, but I need to protect samples from prolonged light exposure and follow proper collection protocols; importantly, plasma porphyrins in PCT are more stable than in erythropoietic protoporphyria, so if plasma is used, it remains diagnostically meaningful, yet urine remains the most sensitive first-line matrix for PCT detection [^f9f5578e] [^e67061f2].

> Next, I should review the practical sequence. The best next step is to order a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile to quantify total porphyrins and characterize the uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin predominance; concurrently, a plasma porphyrin screen can be obtained as supportive evidence, and Wood's lamp examination of urine can provide a quick qualitative clue but should not replace quantitative testing [^e63717de] [^6eb7f09a].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. The best diagnostic study to confirm PCT in this scenario is a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile demonstrating elevated uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin; if forced to choose between the two listed options, serum porphyrin level is the better of the two because it is a quantitative laboratory test, whereas "pink fluorescence urine" is a descriptive bedside sign and not a standalone diagnostic assay [^e63717de] [^6eb7f09a].

> Final answer: Serum porphyrin level is the better choice between the two options, but the most accurate and preferred diagnostic approach is a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile to confirm PCT in this HIV patient with photosensitive hand lesions [^e63717de] [^a250bdf7].

The best diagnostic test for suspected porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in an HIV patient with a photosensitive, erythematous rash on the knuckles is **a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile** [^e63717de] measuring total porphyrins, with a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, which confirms PCT [^e63717de]. Serum porphyrins can be elevated but are **less specific and less sensitive** than urine testing for PCT [^notfound]. Pink fluorescence urine (Wood's lamp) is a supportive bedside clue [^6eb7f09a] but is **not diagnostic** and should not replace quantitative porphyrin analysis [^e63717de]. If urine collection is impractical, a plasma porphyrin scan can be used, but urine testing remains first-line [^e63717de].

## Pathophysiology of porphyria cutanea tarda

PCT results from **reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity**, causing accumulation of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin [^a250bdf7]. These porphyrins are photosensitizers that cause skin fragility, bullae, and hyperpigmentation on sun-exposed areas [^a250bdf7]. HIV infection is a recognized susceptibility factor, likely via hepatic injury and iron dysregulation [^552d38e6] [^a250bdf7].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for porphyria cutanea tarda

Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus biochemical confirmation** of elevated porphyrins [^e63717de]:

- **Clinical features**: Skin fragility, bullae, erosions, milia, hyperpigmentation, and hypertrichosis on sun-exposed sites [^a250bdf7].
- **Biochemical confirmation**: Elevated porphyrins, especially uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, in urine or plasma [^e63717de].

---

## Comparative analysis of diagnostic tests

| **Attribute** | **Serum porphyrin level** | **Pink fluorescence urine (wood's lamp)** |
|-|-|-|
| Principle | Measures total porphyrins in plasma | Qualitative bedside test for porphyrin fluorescence |
| Sensitivity/specificity | Moderate sensitivity; less specific for PCT | Low sensitivity; not diagnostic |
| Clinical utility | Supportive; less reliable than urine | Bedside clue; not definitive |
| Limitations | False positives/negatives; less specific | Subjective; false positives/negatives |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

The **first-line test** is a 24-hour urine porphyrin profile [^e63717de] quantifying total porphyrins with a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, which confirms PCT [^e63717de]. If urine collection is impractical, a plasma porphyrin scan is an alternative, but urine testing remains preferred [^e63717de]. Pink fluorescence urine is a supportive clue [^6eb7f09a] but is **not diagnostic** and should not replace quantitative testing [^e63717de].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis can cause **significant morbidity**, including chronic skin scarring, secondary infections, and psychological distress [^c1aa9b1a]. Early recognition and treatment — such as phlebotomy or low-dose hydroxychloroquine — improve outcomes [^236577f9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best diagnostic test for suspected PCT in an HIV patient with a photosensitive knuckle rash is a **24-hour urine porphyrin profile** [^e63717de] measuring total porphyrins, with a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin, which confirms PCT [^e63717de]. Serum porphyrins are less specific and less sensitive, and pink fluorescence urine is only a supportive clue, not diagnostic [^e63717de].

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: a unique iron-related disorder [^a250bdf7]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of disorders of heme biosynthesis, each characterized by an enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) arises due to the inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the presence of hepatic iron and oxidative stress. Most patients with PCT have evidence of siderosis on liver biopsy, and the disease resolves with iron depletion. PCT manifests as skin fragility, blistering cutaneous lesions on sun-exposed areas, dark urine, and elevated plasma and urine porphyrins. Factors contributing to the development of PCT include alcohol use, hepatitis C virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus, estrogen use, UROD pathogenic variants, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to decrease total body iron levels and low-dose hydroxychloroquine, which reduces hepatic porphyrin content. The following review explores the biology of PCT, the critical role of iron in disease pathogenesis, and our approach to the management of these patients.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: recent update [^236577f9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common human porphyria, due to hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which is acquired in the presence of iron overload and various susceptibility factors, such as alcohol abuse, smoking, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV infection, iron overload with HFE gene mutations, use of estrogens, and UROD mutation. Patients with familial or type II PCT due to autosomal dominant UROD mutation also require other susceptibility factors, as the disease phenotype requires hepatic UROD deficiency to below 20% of normal. PCT clinically manifests with increased skin fragility and blistering skin lesions on sun exposed areas. The common age of presentation is 5th to 6th decade and occurs slightly more commonly in males. Although mild liver biochemical profile are common, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can occasionally develop. Screening for HCC using ultrasound examination is recommended in PCT patients, especially with cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis. PCT is effectively and readily treatable with the use of either repeated phlebotomy or use of 100 mg hydroxychloroquine orally twice a week, and both the treatments are equally effective and safe. With the advent of new or direct antiviral agents for HCV infection, treatment of concomitant HCV has become safer and effective. Data are emerging on the benefit of these drugs as monotherapy for both PCT and HCV. After the achievement of remission of PCT, there remains a potential for relapse, especially when the susceptibility factors are not adequately controlled. Scanty data from retrospective and observational studies shows the relapse rate to be somewhat higher after remission with low-dose hydroxychloroquine as compared to phlebotomy induced remission. Future studies are needed on exploring mechanism of action of 4-aminoquinolines, understanding interaction of HCV and PCT, and relapse of PCT on long-term follow-up.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda in young women… [^6eb7f09a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Porphyria cutanea tarda or symptomatic porphyria is the commonest of the recognized disorders of porphyrin metabolism. 1–3 Although its symptoms are restricted to the skin, the considerable discomfort and disfigurement that often result warrant a careful search for this treatable disease1, 4-. 7 in all patients having erosions, bullae, milia, scarring, or sclerodermatous change of sun-exposed skin, hirsutism, generalized hyperpigmentation, or a history of pink urine. Recently, two young women with classic findings of PCT were seen in our clinic an average of 18 months after first seeking medical attention. Because of the patients' youth, sex, and absence of alcoholism or liver disease, the diagnosis of PCT apparently was not considered by the physicians initially consulted. Urine specimens from both women showed coral-red fluorescence with Wood light illumination, permitting firm diagnosis1 during the first clinic visit.

Subsequently, 24-hour urine collections revealed the porphyrin profile of PCT. Gilchrest B, Pathak MA, Parrish JA. Porphyria Cutanea Tarda in Young Women. Arch Dermatol. 1975; 111: 263–264.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^1c7bec5a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 55-year-old woman (transgender male-to-female) maintained on oral estradiol for 23 years presented with a 3-month history of burning pain, pruritus, and recurrent blisters on her forearms and hands after exposure to sunlight. One month before symptom onset, the patient initiated a trial of micronized progesterone (100 mg/d) and increased her daily estradiol from 2 mg to 4 mg in an effort to better control gender dysphoria. Her subsequent laboratory findings were notable for a supratherapeutic total estrogen level (1945 pg/mL). Other medications included lisinopril, spironolactone, medroxyprogesterone, and occasional ibuprofen. She denied a personal or family history of liver disease, hepatitis, iron abnormalities, or blistering eruptions. She consumed 2 beers daily and had a 30-pack-year smoking history.

Physical examination confirmed the presence of vesicles and bullae on erythematous bases with scattered milia over the bilateral dorsal forearms, hands, and ears (Figs 1 and 2). Hypertrichosis was not observed or endorsed by the patient. Punch biopsy found a subepidermal blister overlying festooning of the dermal papillae with minimal superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and a negative immunofluorescence examination (Fig 3). A periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Laboratory findings revealed mild hepatic transaminitis, negative HIV and hepatitis C antibodies, unremarkable iron studies, elevated total serum porphyrins, urine uroporphyrin and heptaporphyrin, and HFE C282Y heterozygosity (Table I). A liver ultrasound scan was recommended but not obtained. A diagnosis of PCT was discussed with the patient. She was counseled on smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, and photoprotection. She became distressed upon learning that estrogen may be contributing to her symptoms but ultimately decided to temporarily hold estrogen therapy. Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg twice weekly, was initiated in lieu of repeated phlebotomy due to patient preference. She achieved clinical remission within 5 months without restricting her alcohol or tobacco use. At that time, estradiol was reintroduced via 0.025-mg patch twice weekly without recurrence.

### Pseudoporphyria [^1f91e2da]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pseudoporphyria is the term used to describe a photodistributed bullous disorder with clinical and histologic features of porphyria cutanea tarda, but without accompanying biochemical porphyrin abnormalities. Medications, chronic renal failure/dialysis, excessive sun exposure and UVA radiation have all been reported to cause pseudoporphyria. Recognition, diagnosis, and appropriate management of pseudoporphyria are discussed.

### The management of porphyria cutanea tarda [^7c857bcd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the commonest of all porphyrias, is usually characterized by blisters and fragility of skin in light-exposed areas. It can be clinically indistinguishable from other disorders including variegate porphyria and the diagnosis can only be made by rigorous biochemical analysis. PCT does not cause acute attacks of porphyria. It is usually an acquired condition caused by inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme in the liver. Hereditary haemochromatosis, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, oestrogens and a family history of PCT are the major risk factors for the condition and should be searched for specifically in all patients. Liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is common in patients with PCT, and should be investigated for at presentation by means of a liver biopsy where possible. Patients with severe hepatic pathology or longstanding untreated PCT need to be monitored for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the long term. Low dose twice weekly chloroquine is the mainstay of treatment, but venesection should be used in patients with severe iron overload or hepatitis C-related liver disease. Subsequently, long-term follow-up is needed in all patients to monitor for relapse.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: an under-recognised manifestation of haemochromatosis [^e8e12aa6]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We present a case of a woman who presented with a photosensitive skin rash and blisters on her extremities which did not improve with steroids. These were associated with polyarthralgia and a deranged liver function test on her admission. Further workup revealed that the patient has an undiagnosed porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and hereditary haemochromatosis. The patient later underwent regular venesections which improved her condition. This case report not only illustrates the challenge in diagnosing PCT but also aims to highlight the association between PCT and hereditary haemochromatosis.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic approach for this disease?
A. Autoantibody profile
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile
C. History and physical
D. Skin biopsy
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction

Answers:
A. Autoantibody profile – Incorrect. An autoantibody profile would be more useful for the diagnosis of connective tissue disease when there is clinical suspicion. Specifically, autoantibodies are frequently associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Depending on the review of systems findings and clinical systemic symptoms, further laboratory testing may be indicated.
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile – Incorrect. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda is often confirmed by obtaining a biochemical porphyrin profile. In porphyria cutanea tarda, urinary porphyrins and plasma porphyrins are elevated. Fecal porphyrins may be elevated as well. Urinary excretion of porphobilinogen is normal, differentiating porphyria cutanea tarda from other porphyrias.
C. History and physical – Incorrect. Although a thorough history and physical is an important method for any diagnosis, this patient's atypical presentation and the rarity of this diagnosis required further laboratory confirmation.
D. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. Although skin biopsy can be utilized to make the correct diagnosis, a noninvasive diagnostic technique would be preferred as the next diagnostic step. On histopathologic examination, varicella will show multinucleated giant cellswith nuclear molding, cytopathic effect, and mild leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction – Correct. This patient's diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to detect VZV. Serologic techniques can also be used to diagnose VZV, with active infection revealing elevated IgM titers. Studies have demonstrated that immunologic techniques and molecular amplification are superior for VZV detection when compared with serologic techniques.

### Erythematous desquamating rash after initiation of chemotherapy [^b18dc007]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pseudoporphyria
B. Photo recall dermatitis
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction
E. Polymorphous light eruption

Answers:
A. Pseudoporphyria – Incorrect. Pseudoporphyria is a drug induced form of porphyria cutanea tarda that presents with blisters and scarring on sun exposed areas, most commonly the dorsal hands. Blistering occurs quickly after sun exposure, not in the area of previously healed sunburn. Common drug triggers include: naproxen, thiazides, voriconazole, and furosemide.
B. Photo recall dermatitis – Correct. Photo recall dermatitis is an acute inflammatory reaction involving previously sunburned areas that can be triggered by drugs, most commonly chemotherapeutic agents. Patients present with varying degrees of erythema and ulceration in the areas of previous ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, with the potential of progression to necrosis. Her preceding severe sunburn acted as the initial trigger with subsequent chemotherapy driving the cutaneous reaction.
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced phototoxic reactions can present similarly, with the development of confluent erythema and occasional edema, blistering, and desquamation following exposure to a phototoxic substance and UVR. However, phototoxicity usually occurs within 48 hours after the initial exposure to an offending agent, whereas our patient developed an ulcerating rash 2 weeks after initial UVR exposure.
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in previously sensitized individuals to the same substance. Patients often complain of itching rather than burning and present with red, scaly papules and plaques in sun-exposed areas.
E. Polymorphous light eruption – Incorrect. Polymorphous light eruptions present as erythematous papules, vesicles, and plaques in sun-exposed areas. This rash tends to present minutes to hours after exposure to UVR and would be less likely to present with erythematous patches in the absence of papulovesicular lesions.

### A rare case of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with a homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis gene H63D mutation in the setting of hereditary hemochromatosis [^78a6a2b6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is the most common cutaneous porphyria and manifests as photosensitivity, blistering, skin fragility, erosions, milia, and crusts on sun-exposed body areas.PCT is a hepatocutaneous disease of heme synthesis in which uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) has reduced activity, resulting in the accumulation of porphyrins and heme intermediates in the liver and skin. Alcohol consumption, tobacco use, estrogen therapy, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections, iron overload, hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and polychlorinated hydrocarbons are all established causes of PCT. We present a case of PCT in a patient found to be homozygous for the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) H63D mutation in the setting of previously undiagnosed HH. Though the association between PCT and HH is well known, the association with the HFE H63D mutation, to our knowledge, has only been reported once in the medical literature.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^73c21aef]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The results show that, at their worst, PCT symptoms can be experienced as dramatic, and that a shift in focus from skin to blood after establishing the diagnosis led to the perception of PCT as a chronic, systemic disease that may cause a range of unknown health problems. This suggests there is a need for information and reassurance in clinical consultations, and as long as patients are in biochemical remission and follow control guidelines, there is little reason for them to expect health problems related to PCT. The effects of itching in PCT should not be underestimated and was reported to be a severe problem for some participants. It is important that physicians and healthcare personnel, as well as specialist centres that give advice on PCT, are aware of the differences in how the patients experience their disease, and that many of them experience it as much more than a skin disease, so that patient care and disease management can be optimized.

### A first report of porphyria cutanea tarda successfully treated with glycyrrhizin [^f7e85fd4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a condition that affects liver and skin by reduction of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity. It is characterized by blistering lesions, erosions and crusts on sun-exposed areas. We report a 51-year-old male presenting with recurrent episodes of bullae, erosions, and crust on his neck and dorsum of the hands for 3 months. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as total plasma porphyrin and urinary uroporphyrin levels were elevated. Based on the clinical manifestations, the history and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of PCT was made. The cutaneous and biochemical abnormalities of the patient improved with therapy of glycyrrhizin.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Drug discontinuation
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir
D. Phlebotomy
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Drug discontinuation – Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir – Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at a greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
D. Phlebotomy – Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated symptomatically. However, in immunosuppressed patients, antivirals should be promptly initiated to minimize the risk of complications.

### A rare case of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with a homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis gene H63D mutation in the setting of hereditary hemochromatosis [^45428985]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PCT is either an acquired/sporadic (type I) or inherited (type II) disorder, with both types usually manifesting in the third or fourth decade of life. PCT (type I) is caused by extrinsic factors contributing to liver disease, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use, estrogen therapy, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus infection, iron overload, HH, and exposure to polychlorinated hydrocarbons, all of which result in decreased UROD activity restricted to the liver. In contrast, type II PCT is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance in which reduced levels of UROD activity of up to 50% can be found in the liver, red blood cells, and fibroblasts. Patients with PCT can expect to have a normal life expectancy when comorbid conditions are absent.

PCT must be differentiated from other forms of cutaneous porphyria, as well as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, hydroa vacciniforme, polymorphous light eruption, and phototoxic or photoallergic reactions. This can be achieved through a skin biopsy and measuring the excretion of urinary and stool porphyrins. Typically, skin biopsy shows a cell-poor subepidermal blister with periodic acid-Schiff-positive hyaline cuffing of papillary dermal vessels. Periodic acid-Schiff-positive amorphous hyaline material is often carried up into the epidermis forming "caterpillar bodies", a distinct finding in PCT. Direct immunofluorescence shows IgG deposits within vessel walls of the papillary dermis.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^2eff08ac]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

Theme 3: managing porphyria cutanea tarda – strategies for prevention, treatment and controls

Preventive strategies: frequent controls, taking calculated risks or doing nothing?

PCT was perceived as a chronic condition that patients needed to manage for the remainder of their lives. For some, this meant frequent controls and a vigilant lifestyle, with a focus on eating habits, avoiding the sun and generally being careful. For others, prevention involved taking blood samples and having control intervals. Control intervals varied greatly, from having ferritin levels never checked to having them checked every 2 weeks, every month and twice a year. The merits of this were debated by participants, and the more 'experienced' patients with PCT were asked for advice as to how often they should be tested, which test should be done and who should perform them. A few participants said they did nothing to prevent PCT. As Lilly said, 'I have a disease, but I'm not ill'. Most took calculated risks and would enjoy alcohol, sun and good food, but in moderation. They said they knew they risked skin symptoms, but it was worth it. However, the suspicion that PCT caused other problems was more worrying. Lilly said:

I think about it. But I choose to do it. And I think, like, if I'm traveling to sunny places, if I happen to get a blister, well that's just… I have a blister, blood samples and bloodletting. But what I might think about sometimes is, what does it do to other things in the body? Right? I'm thinking cirrhosis. Kidney failure? I mean, what if I defy this and perhaps avoid getting a blister. But perhaps I got it because I didn't take the precautions I should. And I just used bloodletting as a way to exceed my limitations. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because I don't want that, but this is something you don't know a lot about yet. Right? What it does to other organs? Because if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood? Well, then we can just do whatever we want, can't we?

A. PV – Incorrect. PV is an autoimmune bullous disease with predominant mucosal involvement. PV is characterized by flaccid bullae and oral lesions. DIF demonstrates intercellular IgG and C3 deposition between keratinocytes.
B. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis – Incorrect. Linear IgA dermatosis is an immune-mediated disease commonly associated with widespread vesicular and bullous involvement with mucosal erosions. DIF shows linear deposition of IgA along the dermoepidermal junction.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disease of defective heme biosynthesis characterized by photosensitivity, vesicles, bullae, and erosions in photodistributed areas. This patient does not have typical risk factors associated with porphyria cutanea tarda, such as excess iron, alcohol or tobacco use, hepatitis or HIV infection. Furthermore, positive C3/IgG in a hemidesmosomal pattern on DIF is not expected.
D. ICI-BP – Correct. ICI-BP is a rare variant of drug-induced BP. Like idiopathic BP, it is characterized by tense bullae, pruritus, and IgG/C3 deposition at the dermoepidermal junction on DIF. Unlike idiopathic BP, ICI-BP is characterized by a longer pruritic prodrome, delayed diagnosis, and increased likelihood of requiring systemic immunosuppression for disease remission. This patient's ICI-BP is also likely associated with radiation therapy given localized disease onset limited to previously irradiated areas.
E. Bullous cellulitis – Incorrect. Cellulitis is caused by bacterial infection of dermal and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by erythema, pain, and swelling along with constitutional symptoms. Although vesicles and bullae may be present in severe cases, it is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this patient with longstanding pruritus and facial erosions.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^a72d2df7]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^8a0bdae9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Some participants with PCT mentioned itching to be a troublesome symptom. Although pruritus is not well documented in PCT, it has been reported previously. Itching is common in many skin conditions and is likely to delay skin healing, and is associated with reduced QoL, depression and sleep disturbances.–Consequently, this unsuspected finding warrants further investigation. To obtain more information on this topic, the Norwegian Porphyria Registry has introduced this as a variable in the questionnaire sent to patients.

Based on the experiences of the participants in this study, venesection was an acceptable first choice in treatment; however, some problematic aspects were introduced and, as low-dose chloroquine is widely used, this might be preferable for some patients. Our findings suggest that too vigilant a strategy in the prevention of symptoms might lead to medicalization rather than benefitting the patient. To the best of our knowledge, there seems to be a lack of data regarding biochemical and clinical relapse frequency. However, an annual assessment of urinary porphyrin concentration and iron metabolism is suggested in the detection of relapses. Although PCT has been associated with changes in glucose metabolism, and an increased risk of liver cancer, the mechanisms are unclear and do not warrant the frequent check-ups (every 2 weeks or every month) reported by some participants.–

### Porphyria cutanea tarda… [^d2cc3a88]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda, or chronic porphyria, is a rare disease, in which there is vesicle formation on parts exposed to the sun, especially the face and hands. Its successful treatment has not previously been reported, even with the use of the steroid hormones, dimercaprol, 1 folic acid, vitamin B12, or riboflavin.
2. Chloroquine has been used more or less successfully in the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, 3 solar dermatitis, and hydroa estivale, 4 all considered to be related to sunlight sensitivity. Because of the definite relationship of bulla and vesicle formation, following exposure to the sun, in a patient with chronic porphyria, chloroquine has been tried and found to clear the lesions completely in a short time.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda… [^c1a7b3a1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

WALDENSTRÖM1 has divided the porphyrias into the following groups: Porphyria congenita, a familial disease, probably recessive in character, present at birth and characterized by sensitivity to light, pigmented bones and teeth, and greatly increased coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin excretion, mainly of Series I. Porphyria cutanea tarda, a disease in which the porphyrinuria and sensitivity to light develop later in life and a sclerodermic tendency is noticeable. The occurrence of colic and the occasional excretion in the urine of uroporphyrin suggest a relationship with the group next to be described. Severe nervous symptoms have not yet been reported.
2. Porphyria acuta, a familial disease, dominant in character, accompanied with the excretion of coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin mainly of Series III.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: identification of 19 novel uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase mutations [^fda1d9a9]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT) is a cutaneous porphyria that results from the hepatic inhibition of the heme biosynthetic enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), and can occur either in the absence or presence of an inherited heterozygous UROD mutation (PCT subtypes 1 and 2, respectively). A heterozygous UROD mutation causes half-normal levels of UROD activity systemically, which is a susceptibility factor but is not sufficient alone to cause type 2 PCT. In both Types 1 and 2 PCT, the cutaneous manifestations are precipitated by additional factors that lead to generation of an inhibitor that more profoundly reduces hepatic UROD activity. PCT is an iron-related disorder, and many of its known susceptibility factors, which include infections (e.g. hepatitis C virus, HIV), high alcohol consumption, smoking, estrogens, and genetic traits (e.g. hemochromatosis mutations) can increase hepatic iron accumulation. Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria (HEP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that results from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for UROD mutations and often causes infantile or childhood onset of both erythropoietic and cutaneous manifestations. During the 11-year period from 01/01/2007 through 12/31/2017, the Mount Sinai Porphyrias Diagnostic Laboratory provided molecular diagnostic testing for 387 unrelated patients with PCT and four unrelated patients with HEP. Of the 387 unrelated individuals tested for Type 2 PCT, 79 (20%) were heterozygous for UROD mutations. Among 26 family members of mutation-positive PCT patients, eight (31%) had the respective family mutation. Additionally, of the four unrelated HEP patients referred for UROD mutation analyses, all had homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for UROD mutations, and all eight asymptomatic family members were heterozygotes for UROD mutations. Of the UROD mutations identified, 19 were novel, including nine missense, two nonsense, one consensus splice-site, and seven insertions and deletions. These results expand the molecular heterogeneity of PCT and HEP by adding a total of 19 novel UROD mutations. Moreover, the results document the usefulness of molecular testing to confirm a genetic susceptibility trait in Type 2 PCT, confirm a diagnosis in HEP, and identify heterozygous family members.

### Desferrioxamine treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda in a patient with HIV and chronic renal failure [^a0a04942]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) can occur in HIV patients. Current evidence suggests that HIV infection may interfere with the hepatic cytochrome oxidase system, leading to porphyrin metabolism impairment. Moreover, chronic hemodialysis in renal failure may be a risk factor for PCT. In addition to the contributory factors for PCT associated to HIV infection, it is possible that porphyrin accumulation secondary to renal failure may play a role in the expression of this disease. We report a case of PCT in an HIV-1 infected patient under blood dialysis, refractory to antimalarials and controlled with desferrioxamine.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^6950cea5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

The results are presented as three main themes with subsections. Quotes are used to elucidate and elaborate the experiences of the participants. Participants are anonymized.

Theme 1: large variations in participants' experiences of skin symptoms – from trivializing to nightmare descriptions

Trivializing symptoms

Participants' skin symptoms typically presented as small blisters or very fragile skin, and simple things like putting hands into a pocket could cause skin trauma. Slow-healing sores were suspected by participants to have been caused by burning or cutting themselves without noticing, or from allergic reactions to chemicals or similar incidents. Discoloured urine was explained by drinking too little. This tendency to trivialize PCT symptoms as being caused by 'normal things' resulted in participants waiting to seek medical expertise, which contributed to a delayed diagnosis. Several persons explained that other people's comments about their skin made them realize they needed to see a doctor. When they finally did, diagnosis was often missed, especially if they were not referred to a dermatologist. Veronica explained:

I haven't had those really large, fluid-filled blisters. But I had very small blisters and really fragile skin. I've had to be very careful not to bump into things when it was at its worst, because it didn't take much, just barely scraping with a fingernail. And it never healed; it just itched. And also the part with the coloured urine, because that started long before the symptoms on my hands did.

Analysis

Analysis was performed in accordance with interpretive descriptive guidelines and was also influenced by systematic text condensation. Analysis was primarily performed by the first author (J. A.), with discussions and guidance from the other authors (E.G. S.S. and M.R.). Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim and initially read as a whole. In the first step, focus was on reflections and main impressions and four preliminary themes were identified: (i) large variations in symptom experience; (ii) taking control; (iii) treatment; and (iv) prevention of symptoms. In step two, coding and text condensation were performed based on these themes, while special attention was given to avoidance of premature closure of coding. Coding was first conducted cross-case, followed by longitudinal coding at an individual level. In step three, coding was elaborated with subgroups and further text condensation. Step four was an iterative process where focus shifted from the decontextualized codes and the transcripts as a whole; based on this, a synthesis of the coded material was presented as three main themes with subthemes. For validation, the full transcripts were re-read several times and systematically searched for data that challenged the results.

### Painful violaceus bullae of the hands [^35295095]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 63 year-old-woman with a medical history of aortic valve replacement on anticoagulation, type II diabetes, and recently diagnosed ovarian cancer presented to the emergency department. She had fever, chest pain, a lactic acid level of 7.2 mmol (normal, 0.5–2.0 mmol), pulse rate of 154, and several painful violaceous bullae of the palms with surrounding stellate macules and rare splinter hemorrhages (Fig 1). Results of a punch biopsy are shown in Fig 2.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Coumadin-induced necrosis
B. Drug-induced vasculitis
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Septic emboli
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:
A. Coumadin-induced necrosis – Incorrect. The classic distribution often involves areas with excessive adipose tissue, like the abdomen, thighs, or breasts. The duration of anticoagulation was not specified in the history but would typically be within the first 2 weeks of anticoagulation.
B. Drug-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. The patient history does not indicate any recent changes in medications, and the distribution would be more widespread on the trunk and extremities. Additionally, signs and symptoms of sepsis would remain unexplained.
C. Calciphylaxis – Incorrect. Calciphylaxis commonly occurs in the setting of end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The distribution is typically more localized to the abdomen, thighs, and legs and would not typically be on the hands or feet. This would also not account for the acute illness depicted in the question stem.
D. Septic emboli – Correct. The patient presented with characteristic findings of septic emboli including splinter hemorrhages and distal extremity stellate purpura. Our patient's symptoms support an infective process. Also, her history of aortic valve replacement and recent cancer diagnosis make her susceptible to bacteremia with endocarditis complicated by Streptococcus pyogenes.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda would appear more commonly on the dorsal aspect of the hands, forearms, chest, and face. The patient history would most likely include the development of skin findings after sun exposure and a history of liver disease. Lastly, this answer choice did not account for the acute illness of the patient.

Itching – an underestimated problem?

It became evident that itching was a problem, with some considering itching to be the worst aspect of PCT. Itching was attributed to skin healing and seen as a sign of rising porphyrin levels. Participants would itch both when experiencing symptoms and when in remission. The itching was predominant at night, and would typically start after going to bed. It was debatable whether this was because of the warmth of the bed, or because it was more noticeable at this time. The itching disrupted or prevented sleep, and already fragile skin was easily ruptured, resulting in bleeding, further delaying skin healing and increasing the probability of infection. Some slept with gloves on to prevent inadvertently hurting themselves. Nick said:

It itches so much [several nods in agreement], so that's what I feel is the biggest problem. And then you lie awake at night and you scratch and it bleeds. Because of this, it never heals because it is scratched too often. It is there all the time, but it is at night that I scratch because I cannot help myself. So yes, that is when I notice it the most. It itches all the time, but that is when you might hurt yourself.

### Chronic hand eczema [^965ecfd1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Examination

Clinical examination requires the inspection of the hands as well as the whole skin, especially the feet. The clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis of CHE are broad and comprise a whole spectrum of different entities such as psoriasis, lichen planus, tinea manuum, secondary syphilis, scabies, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, drug eruption, pityriasis rubra pilaris, porphyria cutanea tarda, palmoplantar keratodermas, and Bowen´s disease.

Diagnosing CHE should always include the subjective perception of the patient and the individual's opinion on its cause. This may help to identify unexpected or unusual etiologies, especially in contact dermatitis. A recent study showed that the patient's perspective and the assessment of the individual disease in daily dermatological care of CHE differs between patients and dermatologists.

Diagnostic Tests

Assessment of exposure to contact allergens and irritants, qualitatively and quantitatively, is important to facilitate planning of skin test strategies, make a correct diagnosis, and establish preventive measures and a treatment plan.

### Blistering disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^c6e4e0f8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Blistering diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect either skin and mucous membrane, or both, varying in presentation, clinical course, pathohistology, immunopathology and treatment. Not infrequently the diagnosis is delayed. This can result in severe, and sometimes fatal consequences. Although these diseases are rare, it is very important to make an accurate diagnosis based on a combination of clinical profile and laboratory observations. A brief review is presented of the following bullous diseases: pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, and subcorneal pustular dermatitis.

### The role of inherited and acquired factors in the development of porphyria cutanea tarda in the Argentinean population [^31237297]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Inherited and environmental factors are implicated in the expression of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT); the contribution of each factor depends on the population.

Objective

To provide a review of PCT cases diagnosed in Argentina over 24 years and evaluate the role of different precipitating factors in its pathogenesis. Methods Plasma and urinary porphyrin levels and erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) activity were determined. Potential precipitating factors were identified in each patient. Additional tests for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hemochromatosis gene mutations were carried out.

Results

Several factors (mainly alcohol abuse in men and estrogen ingestion in women), alone or combined were identified in our patients. Prevalence of HCV infection was 35.2%. Inherited URO-D deficiency occurs in 25.0% of cases. H63D was the most common hemochromatosis gene mutation. High incidence of PCT associated with HIV infection was found.

Conclusions

PCT is multifactorial. Therefore, knowledge of all risk factors in each patient is important for the management of the disease.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^c1aa9b1a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is characterized by fragile skin with blistering on sun-exposed areas. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens and various liver diseases. Treatment consists of phlebotomy to reduce iron, or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chlorochin. To optimize patient care, health personnel need to understand the subjective experiences of PCT.

Objectives

To explore the experiences of persons with PCT with regard to symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

Methods

Interpretive description was used as a qualitative approach. Twenty-one participants attended three focus groups. All participants had experienced PCT symptoms during the last 5 years.

Results

Participants' experiences varied from trivializing symptoms and fragile skin to what was described as a desperate situation, with huge blisters, skin falling off and feeling as if one was in a 'horror movie'. For some, itching was very troublesome, preventing sleep and delaying skin healing. In managing PCT a shift in focus from skin to blood was described. PCT was perceived as a chronic and systemic disease causing a range of health problems. Strategies for preventing symptoms ranged from doing nothing to frequent controls and check-ups.

Conclusions

Participants had a systemic perception of PCT, and a tendency to attribute a range of health problems to the condition. This study adds insight into the experiences patients have with PCT.

A 72-year-old man with multiple prior head and neck skin cancers presented with 8 months of facial erosions. He had received excision, radiation therapy, and carboplatin/paclitaxel for advanced facial squamous cell carcinomas and completed pembrolizumab for stage III melanoma of the chest 1 year prior to presentation. Examination revealed an afebrile man with geometric bilateral cheek erosions and a bulla above the right medial canthus (Fig 1). Histopathology demonstrated a subepidermal blister with eosinophil-rich infiltrate along the dermoepidermal junction (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) for complement component 3 (C3) (Fig 2) revealed a hemidesmosomal pattern of reactivity along the basal layer of the blister roof.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?

B. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced bullous pemphigoid (ICI-BP)
E. Bullous cellulitis

### Dusky pink annular plaques with a vesicular border [^8cbfbeaf]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Based on clinical (Fig 1) and histologic findings (Fig 2), which leading diagnosis should be considered in this patient?
A. Atopic eruption of pregnancy
B. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP)
C. Bullous pemphigoid
D. Pemphigoid gestationis (PG)
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)

Answers:
A. Atopic eruption of pregnancy – Incorrect. Atopic eruption of pregnancy presents as an eczematous rash occurring in early pregnancy, it does not develop into vesicles or bullae. In addition, the histologic exam would show negative immunofluorescence and nonspecific hematoxylin and eosin findings.
B. PUPPP – Incorrect. Also referred to as Polymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy, in the prebullous stage, clinical differentiation between PG is difficult. However, PUPPP commonly develops during the third trimester as pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques in the abdominal striae distensae and spares the umbilical region.
C. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. PG is a variant of bullous pemphigoid, the latter of which typically presents in elderly patients over 70 years of age.
D. PG – Correct. PG presents as pruritic papules and plaques that develop into a vesiculobullous eruption in multigravida women during the second or third trimester with pruritic, erythematous plaques on the upper arms, abdomen, trunk, and thighs. Differentials for PG include other pruritic dermatoses such as PUPPP in the prebullous stage and atopic eruption of pregnancy. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology showing subepidermal vesicles, epidermal spongiosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates eosinophilic preponderance. Direct immunofluorescence of the basement membrane shows linear deposition of C3 and IgG with a greater preponderance of C3.
E. PCT – Incorrect. PCT presents with tense bulla or vesicles that often are accompanied by crusting, erosion, milia formation in sun-exposed distributions. Scarring in PCT leads to hyperpigmented or atrophic scars. Pregnancy increases patient susceptibility to PCT, however, it clinically presents as vesicles or bullae on sun-exposed areas.

### Association of porphyria cutanea tarda with hereditary hemochromatosis [^852f69d3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

An increased frequency of hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations occurs in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of peripheral blood for hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations is available for clinical use. Early detection and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis limit disease progression and improve life expectancy.

Objective

We present 8 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda subsequently found to have hereditary hemochromatosis or mutations in the HFE gene.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients in whom both porphyria cutanea tarda and hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutations were diagnosed between 1976 and 2000.

Results

Eight patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (6 males, 2 females; age range, 4–60 years; mean age at diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda, 42 years) were subsequently found to have hepatic iron overload or HFE gene mutations. Two patients had liver biopsy findings compatible with homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. In the other 6 patients, HFE gene analysis revealed 3 homozygous C282Y, 1 compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D, and 2 heterozygous C282Y mutations. Seven patients (88%) had no specific signs or symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis at diagnosis. In 5 patients (63%), the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutation was initially suspected by the dermatologist.

Conclusion

Porphyria cutanea tarda can be an important cutaneous marker for patients with mutations of the HFE gene. HFE gene analysis should be done in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda. The dermatologist may play a key role in the early diagnosis of subclinical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^3d820d47]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a rare disease characterized by fragile skin and blistering on sun-exposed areas. Increased urinary porphyrin excretion causes red- or dark-coloured urine. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by hepatic iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens, hepatitis C and various liver stressors, in combination with exposure to light. The prevalence of symptomatic disease is estimated to be 1 in 10 000. The condition exists in both a familial and sporadic subtype. Compared with 25% of cases worldwide, about 50% of cases of PCT in Norway are hereditary because of two founder mutations. Penetrance is very low, and only an estimated 10% of mutation carriers develop symptoms throughout life. Treatment consists of avoidance of precipitating factors, phlebotomy to reduce iron or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chloroquine.

It might take 6–15 months before complete clinical and biochemical remission is reached, but the prognosis is good, and many patients experience lifelong remission. To detect relapse, urinary porphyrin concentration, iron and liver functions should be assessed annually.

The principal aim of the Norwegian Porphyria Centre is to optimize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with porphyria. Although the clinical benefits of mutation screening are controversial, distinguishing between sporadic and familial cases appears to be important to many patients and their relatives, and NAPOS therefore offers, in hereditary cases, predictive genetic testing and counselling to at-risk adult family members.

Photodermatoses can have a high psychological impact. Jong et al.investigated quality of life (QoL) in patients with a range of photodermatoses, including PCT. They concluded that, overall, photodermatoses had a major impact on QoL, but that PCT had a lower impact on QoL than did other cutaneous porphyrias. Very little knowledge of the psychosocial impact of PCT is available and more information on the subjective experiences is therefore needed to secure optimal treatment, follow-up and counselling of this group. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore the experiences persons with PCT have regarding symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

Discussion

The distribution of the rash and the worsening in summer hints that light/photosensitivity plays a role.

Actinic prurigo (AP) is a rare immunological photodermatosis, which typically presents with pruritic papules, sometimes vesicles, and plaques with excoriations and scars over photodistributed sites. Infrequently, it also affects unexposed sites such as the buttocks. Ocular involvement and cheilitis may occur but is less frequently reported in UK cases than in those from South America. AP is more common in females and is much more frequently reported in people of Latin American or Amerindian descent with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR4 subtype (HLA DRB1✱0407/). A positive family history may be present in 75% of this patient cohort, whereas it typically occurs in approximately 50% of cases in the UK. Our patient was positive for HLA DRB1✱0407 but had no known family history or Latin American/Amerindian ancestry. AP may spontaneously resolve by the late teens but can also persist into adulthood.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) typically presents with immediate pain and oedema on light‐exposed sites and will usually present in early childhood. The genetic background of EPP is typically that of inheritance of a low‐expression allele polymorphism in addition to a recessive mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme ferrochelatase. This can cause accumulation of a haemoglobin precursor, protoporphyrin IX, which is a photosensitizer to visible light. This significantly accumulates in red blood cells, plasma, liver and skin. Thus, photoactivation of protoporphyrin IX causes phototoxic insult, resulting in tissue damage, which manifests as skin pain and sometimes oedema, erythema and waxy scarring on photoexposed sites caused by photosensitivity to visible light. If visible light exposure is not prolonged, the patient will usually have symptoms of pain only on exposed sites, with visible skin changes evident only with more prolonged or repeated exposures. Protoporphyrin IX localizes within the erythrocytes as opposed to the basement membrane localization of uroporphyrinogen III in porphyria cutanea tarda.

### ACP best practice No 165: front line tests for the investigation of suspected porphyria [^e67061f2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are uncommon disorders of haem biosynthesis and their effective management requires prompt and accurate diagnosis. This article describes methods for the determination of urinary porphobilinogen, urinary and faecal total porphyrins, and total porphyrins in erythrocytes and plasma that are suitable for use in non-specialist laboratories. The selection and interpretation of these methods, and the indications for further, more specialised, investigation are discussed.

### The cutaneous porphyrias [^aacc3935]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks. The cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, complications, and current approach to porphyria management. Although focusing mainly on their dermatological aspects, the article also covers the management of acute porphyria, which by virtue of its association with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, may become the responsibility of the clinical dermatologist.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^90c1c43d]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we report a case of PCT arising in a male-to-female transgender patient on gender-affirming HT. In PCT, decreased uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase activity in hepatocytes leads to the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, provoking photosensitivity. PCT is uncommon but has been associated with estrogen, iron accumulation, hepatotoxins, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, hepatitis C, HIV, and mutations in the hemochromatosis alleles, HFE C282Y and H63D.

A growing number of patients are seeking out gender-affirming HT to achieve physical, emotional, and social characteristics consistent with their gender identity. The prolonged need to suppress endogenous sex hormone secretion and maintain hormone levels within the range consistent with gender identity exposes transgender patients to higher hormone doses relative to other indications for hormone administration. Lack of strong evidence-based guidelines and inadequate provider training regarding the optimal drugs, dosage, and routes lead to significant variability in gender-affirming HT regimens. Treatment is often guided by patients eager to maximize resultsand based on social media reports of what has worked for others. Pharmacokinetic variability is further driven by cost and drug shortages, which prompt changes in formulation and potential use of black-market products.

Our patient had PCT after 23 years taking 1 to 4 mg oral estradiol therapy daily. She had intermittently been on progesterone, and immediately prior to the onset of her symptoms simultaneously increased her estradiol and began a trial of oral micronized progesterone. Her subsequent supratherapeutic serum estrogen prompted discontinuation of micronized progesterone and a 1-month break in estradiol followed by dose reduction. The timeline suggests that supratherapeutic estrogen may have combined with other risk factors (HFE heterozygosity and tobacco and alcohol use) to trigger PCT. She previously tolerated 4 mg estradiol daily, raising concern that combination with micronized progesterone (selected for promotional pricing and reported anxiolytic effects) may have also contributed. Although total estrogen was elevated (goal, 600–1000 pg/mL), serum estradiol and prescribed HT dosing were within published expert opinion–based guidelines.

### Pruritic eruption on the extremities: report of 2 generations treated with dupilumab [^7f855325]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is your diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Bullous lupus
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
D. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP)
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:
A. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies targeted against bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 and bullous pemphigoid antigen 2. Histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with eosinophils; DIF would be positive for IgG and C3 in a linear pattern at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) in an N-serrated pattern. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin would localize to the roof.
B. Bullous lupus – Incorrect. Bullous lupus is caused by circulating antibodies targeted against collagen VII; however, histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with neutrophils. DIF would show a "full-house pattern" with granular deposition of IgG, IgA, immunoglobulin (Ig) M, and C3 at the BMZ in a U-serrated pattern. Collagen VII is the target epitope in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a rare, acquired subepidermal bullous disease. Classically, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita shows a cell-poor subepidermal blister on histopathology. DIF would show a broad linear band of IgG > C3 in a U-serrated pattern along the BMZ. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin in both disorders would localize to the floor.
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an inherited blistering disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding keratin 5 and keratin 14, resulting in tissue fragility. Histopathology would show an intraepidermal split. DIF would be negative.
D. EBP – Correct. EBP is a rare subtype of inherited dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) characterized by extremely pruritic lichenified, prurigo-like plaques and nodules. Pretibial involvement is typical, but it can also involve the forearms and trunk; nail dystrophy is common. Histopathology shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and subepidermal cleavage. DIF is negative.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a blistering disorder caused by a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase. Histopathology would show a subepidermal noninflammatory blister with festooning, caterpillar bodies, and periodic acid–Schiff + perivascular hyaline material. DIF would show IgM + C3 around vessels.

### The porphyrias: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^cdfceb8e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The inborn errors of heme biosynthesis, the porphyrias, are 8 genetically distinct metabolic disorders that can be classified as "acute hepatic", "hepatic cutaneous", and "erythropoietic cutaneous" diseases. Recent advances in understanding their pathogenesis and molecular genetic heterogeneity have led to improved diagnosis and treatment. These advances include DNA-based diagnoses for all the porphyrias, new understanding of the pathogenesis of the acute hepatic porphyrias, identification of the iron overload-induced inhibitor of hepatic uroporphyrin decarboxylase activity that causes the most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, the identification of an X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria due to gain-of-function mutations in erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), and new and experimental treatments for the erythropoietic prophyrias. Knowledge of these advances is relevant for hematologists because they administer the hematin infusions to treat the acute attacks in patients with the acute hepatic porphyrias, perform the chronic phlebotomies to reduce the iron overload and clear the dermatologic lesions in porphyria cutanea tarda, and diagnose and treat the erythropoietic porphyrias, including chronic erythrocyte transfusions, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, and experimental pharmacologic chaperone and stem cell gene therapies for congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria. These developments are reviewed to update hematologists on the latest advances in these diverse disorders.

### Radiation and chemotherapy with no excessive toxicity in a patient with human papillomavirus-related tonsillar cancer and porphyria cutanea tarda: case report and literature review [^3b5721ff]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria is a condition of cutaneous photosensitivity. It is unclear if radiotherapy (RT) is safe in patients with porphyria.

Methods

We report a patient case with uncontrolled porphyria cutanea tarda treated with chemoradiation for p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Given the scarcity of data on this subject, we also conducted a literature review on the topic of radiation in patients with porphyria.

Results

The patient in our study did not experience any unusual acute or late toxicity, despite receiving a high dose of cutaneous radiation. We also found the majority of the literature supports the safe use of therapeutic radiation in patients with porphyria.

Conclusion

In this patient, and in the majority of the literature, radiation seems safe in patients with porphyria; however, there are few reports on the subject in the literature, therefore, caution is warranted.

### Porphyria: often discussed but too often missed [^29381078]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is often overlooked. We describe a patient with this condition who had all the 'bells and whistles', in whom the diagnosis was only made after considerable delay. Far from an esoteric condition haunting examination candidates, AIP is an important cause of a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms. Its early recognition allows the astute clinician to prevent potentially devastating sequelae. We provide practical guidance on the investigation and management of this complex disorder. With a 'back to basics' approach to the underlying genetics and biochemistry, we hope to dispel some of the confusion that may obstruct a timely diagnosis.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^c4fb0ed3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

PCT is generally defined as a skin disease but, aetiologically, it is also a hepatic and metabolic disorder. Because the symptoms are of a cutaneous nature, one would expect that the patients experienced PCT as a skin condition. However, participants in this study described a shift in focus from skin to blood and began to perceive PCT as a chronic and systemic disease. The tendency to attribute health problems to PCT was striking. We are all 'naïve psychologists' seeking to explain why events occur and to attribute causal explanations. According to the common sense model (CSM) of illness, there are five components of illness representations that help people make sense of their symptoms: the identity or the label given to the condition; the perceived cause of the condition; the predictive understanding of how long the condition will last; the individual's beliefs about the consequences of the condition; and whether the condition can be cured or controlled. In this case, the identity of the condition is 'porphyria'. Porphyrias are a group of diseases, and separating PCT from other porphyrias can be difficult for both patients and healthcare providers. Patients with PCT may perceive the disease as being chronic and systemic because porphyrins, enzymes, blood and genes are involved, and treatment consists of bloodletting. This perception can, in turn, explain why participants in this study attributed a number of their health problems to PCT. The CSM uses the perception of the condition to guide which further actions are taken. Lilly stated that medical experts do not fully understand the possible long-term complications that this patient group might expect, and therefore phlebotomies cannot be an 'easy fix' if symptoms arise. As Lilly commented, 'if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood, well, then we can just do whatever we want to, can't we?' The genetic component of PCT also seemed intriguing to the participants. A worry that a PCT mutation might prevent anyone from having children, as was the case in the family of one participant, emphasizes that the perceived cause of the condition and the understanding of its consequences should not be underestimated. When addressing the issue of symptoms, consequences and controllability of PCT in clinical consultation, it is therefore important to recognize that the patient's illness representation can influence perception of risk and how they express and act upon this information.

### Vesiculobullous eruption with loncastuximab tesirine in a patient with relapsed follicular lymphoma [^8a4f83a0]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of follicular lymphoma first diagnosed in 2014. He was started on rituximab with 2 years of maintenance therapy and experienced a good partial response. He developed progressive lymphadenopathy in late 2019 that progressed despite additional rituximab and trials of 8 cycles of obinutuzumab (anti-CD20), 6 cycles of bendamustine, and a 5-month trial of the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Repeat lymph node biopsy showed loss of CD20 expression. At this point, he was enrolled in the LOTIS-7 clinical trial of the anti-CD19 antibody loncastuximab teserine with the anti-CD79 B antibody polatuzumab vedotin, with his first treatment in March 2023.

During the third cycle of treatment, the patient developed a nonpruritic rash on the head and neck that progressed to include redness and swelling of both hands (Fig 1, A) and the feeling of a "sunburn". A week later, he reported worsening with a "burning" sensation, mild pruritus, swollen hands, and sloughing of the skin. He was referred to our clinic, where physical exam showed confluent red, slightly poikilodermatous, thin plaques with dusky/gray exfoliative scale in a photo-distributed pattern and a solitary, 1 millimeter tense vesicle on the right ulnar wrist (Fig 1, B and C). He reported regular sunscreen application and worked at night without significant sun exposure. Biopsy of the wrist lesion showed intraepidermal vesiculation and interface vacuolar dermatitis in the context of a mixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate (Fig 2), with the direct immunofluorescence finding of granular C3 and rare dot-like IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone. PAS and herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus immunostains were negative. Given these findings, a vesiculobullous reaction to loncastuximab was favored over other considerations: herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus and dermatophytes were not detected; histology and immunofluorescence were not characteristic of bullous pemphigoid, porphyria cutanea tarda, or connective tissue disease (in particular, intraepidermal vesiculation is uncharacteristic of connective tissue diseases). The clinical appearance was considered less typical of dyshidrotic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis. Twice daily clobetasol 0.05% ointment to the hands and continued strict sun protection were recommended.

### Boston keratoprosthesis for visual rehabilitation in porphyria cutanea tarda [^76d89c98]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old man, presented with bilateral chronic visual loss associated with generalised skin lesions. He had undergone multiple penetrating keratoplasties in his right eye for recurrent corneal infections and perforations. On ocular examination, his left eye was phthisical and his right eye had light perception vision owing to a failed and vascularised corneal graft. Dermatological evaluation revealed multiple hyperpigmented and hypopigmented lesions along with thickening of skin on nose, scalp and dorsum of hands. Skin biopsy showed focal areas of deposition of faint periodic acid Schiff-positive diastase-resistant perivascular material. The high-performance liquid chromatography assessment revealed increased presence of porphyrins in blood and urine, thus confirming a diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda. The patient's vision in the right eye improved after undergoing Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis along with general photoprotective measures for the exposed parts of the body.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^3e6057d4]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The porphyrias are a diverse group of metabolic disorders, each characterized by alterations in 1 of the 8 enzymatic steps in heme biosynthesis (Figure 1). Porphyrias can be classified as hepatic or erythropoietic, reflecting whether porphyrin precursors or porphyrins accumulate initially in the liver or bone marrow. A clinical classification of acute, blistering cutaneous, and nonblistering cutaneous is also useful because it is based on 3 very distinct presentations that should prompt different first-line diagnostic testing. The 3 most common porphyrias, acute intermittent porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) are examples of these 3 clinical categories. This How I Treat article focuses on the 2 nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias, EPP and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP), collectively called protoporphyria.

Figure 1.
The heme biosynthetic pathway. Heme biosynthesis occurs by 8 sequential enzymatic steps. Decreased activity of ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in the pathway, leads to EPP. XLP is caused by gain-of-function mutations in ALAS2, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in this pathway within the erythroblast.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda presenting as cicatricial conjunctivitis [^84fc47c9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of porphyria cutanea tarda presenting as cicatricial conjunctivitis.

Design

Observational study.

Methods

A 31-year-old man presented with bilateral inferior symblepharon, superior tarsal conjunctival scarring and concretions, and recurrent conjunctival and episcleral injection.

Results

Four years after initial presentation, the patient developed hepatitis C, and 2 years later blisters on his scalp and hands. Direct immunofluorescence studies of biopsies taken from the palpebral conjunctiva of the right lower lid were negative for cicatricial pemphigoid. A twenty-four hour urine specimen analysis revealed elevated levels of uroporphyrins and polycarboxylated porphyrins, confirming the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda. The patient was treated with repeated phlebotomies and oral hydroxychloroquine, which resulted in a significant decrease in the skin lesions, conjunctival injection, and concretions under the upper lids.

Conclusions

Cicatricial conjunctivitis may be a manifestation of porphyria cutanea tarda.

### Pseudoporphyria: discussion of etiologic agents [^064a30ff]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudoporphyria describes a photodistributed bullous disorder with negative urinary, fecal, and serum porphyrin studies. Although pseudoporphyria is thought to be extremely rare (less than 100 reported cases4-5), we propose that this entity is underreported. One author (KB) has seen four cases of pseudoporphyria in the past four years. We describe a patient with nonpruritic, nonpainful bulla on the dorsum of his hands. Biopsy revealed a split at the dermal-epidermal junction; laboratory tests and urinary porphyrin evaluation were negative.

### Facial hyperpigmentation and crusted papules on the hands [^e63717de]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the first-line diagnostic test for this patient's condition?
A. Ferritin level
B. Histopathologic exam
C. Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation analysis
D. Direct immunofluorescence
E. Plasma and urinary total porphyrins

Answers:
A. Ferritin level – Incorrect. Ferritin levels will be elevated in iron-overload PCT, but this will not establish the diagnosis.
B. Histopathologic exam – Incorrect. Histopathologic exam may reveal subepidermal split with minimal inflammation, basement membrane trapping in the epidermis (caterpillar bodies), festooning of dermis, and hyalinization of vessels; however, these findings are not specific for PCT.
C. HFE mutation analysis – Incorrect. HFE mutations may predispose to PCT, and more than 50% of patients with PCT carry a mutation for hemochromatosis. Patients with PCT should undergo testing for HFE mutations, but it is not required for diagnosis.
D. Direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Although direct immunofluorescence would be expected to show immunoglobulin and complement deposition along the basement membrane zone and perivascular space, this does not distinguish PCT from other porphyrias or pseudoporphyrias.
E. Plasma and urinary total porphyrins – Correct. Porphyrin analysis is necessary to diagnose PCT, as normal levels exclude all cutaneous porphyrias. Testing will reveal increased plasma and urine porphyrins with a predominance of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyporphyrin.

### Guide to porphyrias. A historical and clinical perspective [^6dd99949]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis classified as neurovisceral, cutaneous, or mixed. A deficiency of any of the 8 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. Classification depends on the defective enzyme. Porphyrias often are misdiagnosed because patients have vague symptoms. However, acute forms of porphyria can be life-threatening, so it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate proper medical management. We discuss the history, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of porphyrias and then briefly describe the 8 types of porphyrias and their distinguishing features.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^2d547f19]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Theme 2: a skin disease, a blood disease or something in between?

A shift in focus from skin to blood

After their diagnosis was established, participants described a shift in focus. One participant explained that she was surprised when she understood that PCT was not a simple skin disease. At first, PCT presented as skin symptoms, and diagnosis was based on patients seeking medical care for this. However, after diagnosis was established, the focus shifted from the skin to the blood. The use of phlebotomy as a treatment for PCT emphasized this. Blood samples, blood values and phlebotomy introduced a technical aspect, and many participants displayed a keen interest. They brought copies of their blood work to the focus groups and compared and discussed who had the highest ferritin levels and at what level they preferred to undergo prophylactic phlebotomy. Nora said:

Yes, and it's like I can feel something crawling in my skin. And after I learned about this, I just feel the porphyrins flying around.

Suspecting porphyria cutanea tarda caused more health problems than skin symptoms

Many participants suspected PCT caused health problems that were not limited to the skin. They felt that porphyrins were in their blood, and that genes and enzymes were involved, which made them comment that things in the body were connected. A variety of symptoms caused by PCT were proposed and the participants showed a growing need to find legitimate reasons for other health complaints. Maria explained:

Perhaps it is a bit more complicated than what is believed? That there are actually more symptoms? That more things are connected to it? Because this is something that happens inside the body; that's what I think, that there might be.

Their suspicion was explained by the fact that the symptom in question arose at the same time as their skin symptoms appeared, and that other explanations had not been detected. Participants learned that they had similar health problems after speaking with other patients, which confirmed their suspicions. Fatigue was explicitly discussed as being related to PCT, but known acute porphyria symptoms, such as stomach pains and muscle aches, were also attributed to PCT, both by participants and sometimes by local health personnel. Participants questioned why these symptoms were not recognized by medical experts as being related to PCT and pointed to the need for further research. However, the focus on what could be attributed to PCT was so evident in the groups that some participants commented that surely not everything could be caused by the disease.

Hemochromatosis — symptoms and signs prompting evaluation are outlined as follows: When patients present with symptoms, hemochromatosis should be considered when there are complaints of fatigue, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, arthralgias (typically of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints), chondrocalcinosis, impotence, decreased libido, and symptoms of heart failure or diabetes. Similarly, physical findings of an enlarged liver, particularly in the presence of cirrhosis, extrahepatic manifestations of chronic liver disease, testicular atrophy, congestive heart failure, skin pigmentation, changes of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), or arthritis should raise the suspicion of hemochromatosis.

Common drugs used for treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected children — Pyrazinamide preparations include tablets 500 mg and an oral suspension as an extemporaneous preparation. Major toxicities indicating need for medical attention include more frequent arthralgia, less frequent hepatotoxicity (dose-related), and rare acute gouty arthritis secondary to hyperuricemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, interstitial nephritis, and porphyria; effects indicating need for medical attention if persistent or bothersome include skin rash, pruritus, photosensitivity, malaise, GI disturbances (nausea, vomiting), arthralgia, and hyperuricemia. Special instructions are to avoid in patients with severe hepatic impairment, reduce dose in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and monitor LFTs and uric acid.

### Improvement in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid following treatment for porphyria cutanea tarda [^9db96eca]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Caucasian male complaining of redness and tearing for 3 years in both eyes was referred for evaluation of cicatricial conjunctivitis. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid was suspected and this diagnosis was confirmed through biopsy. The patient's condition showed moderate improvement following treatment with methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was later diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda and phlebotomy treatments were subsequently initiated. The patient's ocular symptoms improved further after he began receiving these phlebotomy treatments, and conventional treatment was discontinued. The authors hypothesize that circulating porphyrins activated by ultraviolet light could be the cause of the ocular cicatricial pemphigoid in this patient.

Hemodialysis-related porphyria cutanea tarda (HRPCT) is characterized by porphyria-like blisters on sun-exposed parts of the face, arms and hands due to elevated porphyrin levels. Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a rare cancer that typically occurs on the sun-damaged ocular surface of elderly male patients. Herein, we report a case of CSCC in a 72-year-old patient who had been on hemodialysis for 8 years, and had been followed up with a diagnosis of HRPCT for 3 years. To our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting an association between HRPCT and CSCC, which may reflect a pathogenetic process connecting them.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^ec5a8b57]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias

A group of rare, underdiagnosed conditions whose leading symptom is an acute, severe pain are the acute porphyrias. The porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders. Several enzymatic steps are involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway (Figure 3). A malfunctioning of any of them leads to an accumulation of heme precursors like 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) or porphobilinogen (PBG), predominantly in either the liver or bone marrow. Depending on the specific enzyme that is altered in its activity, eight different hereditary types of porphyrias are known. They can be classified as "hepatic" or "erythropoietic" (describing the location primarily affected from the precursor-accumulation) or as "acute" or "cutaneous" (based on clinical manifestations). Two types of porphyrias, the hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and the variegate porphyria (VP), are classified as both acute and cutaneous.

The most common acute porphyria, the acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), is reported to affect 1:75,000 people in European countries. Sweden, where 1:1000 people are affected, is an exception due to a founder effect. The most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), has a prevalence of 1:10,000 according to European studies.

### Associations among behavior-related susceptibility factors in porphyria cutanea tarda [^834b2394]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common of the human porphyrias and results from an acquired deficiency of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Some susceptibility factors have been identified; we examined associations among multiple factors in a large cohort of patients.

Methods

Multiple known or suspected susceptibility factors and demographic and clinical features of 143 patients (mean age 52 years, 66% male, 88% Caucasian) with documented PCT (mean onset at 41 ± 8.8 years) were tabulated; associations were examined by contingency tables, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and logistic regression.

Results

The most common susceptibility factors for PCT were ethanol use (87%), smoking (81%), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (69%), and HFE mutations (53%; 6% C282Y/C282Y and 8% C282Y/H63D). Of those who underwent hepatic biopsy or ultrasound, 56% had evidence of hepatic steatosis. Of those with PCT, 66% of females took estrogen, 8% were diabetic, 13% had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and 17% had inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency (determined by low erythrocyte UROD activity). Three or more susceptibility factors were identified in 70% of patients. HCV infection in patients with PCT was significantly associated with other behavior-related factors such as ethanol use (odds ratio [OR], 6.3) and smoking (OR, 11.9).

Conclusions

Susceptibility factors for PCT were similar to previous studies; most patients had 3 or more susceptibility factors. Associations between PCT and HCV, ethanol or smoking could be accounted for by a history of multiple substance abuse; other factors are distributed more randomly among patients.

### The sensitivity and specificity of "caterpillar bodies" in the differential diagnosis of subepidermal blistering disorders [^44373de1]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2003). Low credibility.

Caterpillar bodies are eosinophilic, elongated, segmented bodies located within the roofs of blisters and are considered to represent a specific histopathologic feature of porphyric bullous eruptions, including porphyria cutanea tarda and erythropoietic protoporphyria. The possibility that similar or identical bodies may be present in other disorders prompted further study exploring the specificity of caterpillar bodies in the differential diagnosis of subepidermal vesiculobullous disorders. Seventy-six cases exhibiting subepidermal clefting were reviewed by light microscopy. "Classic" caterpillar bodies were present in porphyria cutanea tarda (6 of 14) and 1 case representing either venous stasis-associated bulla or possibly bullosis diabeticorum. Caterpillar body-like clusters were present in porphyria cutanea tarda (5 of 14), erythropoietic protoporphyria (1 of 3), bullous pemphigoid (7 of 24), and junctional or dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (3 of 5). In some cases, classic caterpillar body and caterpillar body-like clusters coexisted in a blister roof. Caterpillar bodies or caterpillar body-like clusters were not identified in any cases of dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, bullous erythema multiforme, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, or wound-healing reactions. In contrast to caterpillar bodies, caterpillar body-like clusters were negative for PAS or Type IV collagen stains. In conclusion, caterpillar bodies appear to represent a specific feature of porphyria cutanea tarda (specificity, 98%) but were present in less than half of those cases in this study (sensitivity, 43%). Caterpillar body-like clusters are less specific and may be present in porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, pseudoporphyria, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

### Current and innovative emerging therapies for porphyrias with hepatic involvement [^f61f24c0]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders caused by specific enzyme dysfunctions in the haem synthesis pathway, which result in abnormal accumulation of specific pathway intermediates. The symptoms depend upon the chemical characteristics of these substances. Porphyrins are photoreactive and cause photocutaneous lesions on sunlight-exposed areas, whereas accumulation of porphyrin precursors is related to acute neurovisceral attacks. Current therapies are suboptimal and mostly address symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in the understanding of the molecular bases and pathogenesis of porphyrias have paved the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this Clinical Trial Watch we summarise the basic principles of these emerging approaches and what is currently known about their application to porphyrias of hepatic origin or with hepatic involvement.

### Photosensitivity disorders in children: part I [^b8545afb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Compared to adult patients, underlying systemic disorders, including genetic or metabolic defects, are common causes in pediatric photosensitivity disorders. Photosensitivity in a child should be suspected if the child develops a sunburn reaction in sun-exposed sites after limited sun exposure. Diagnosis of a photodermatosis is made based on careful history taking and a physical examination. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis are essential to minimize long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection. In part I of this continuing medical education article, immunologically mediated photodermatoses, photodermatoses caused by exogenous photosensitizers, and the cutaneous porphyrias will be covered.

### Mixed IgM-and IgA-mediated epidermolysis bullosa acquisita associated with IgM-λ paraproteinemia in an 81-year-old woman [^8dbb26f3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Classically, EBA is a noninflammatory mechanobullous disorder affecting acral and dependent body surfaces as well as sites of trauma, resulting in scarring and milia when healed. The pathogenesis of EBA involves circulating anti-type VII collagen autoantibodies, typically IgG, that localize to the dermal ("floor") side in salt-split skin. The uncommon IgA subtype of EBA (IgA-EBA), previously considered a variant of linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), features a subepidermal split accompanied by prominent neutrophilic infiltrate, occasional eosinophils, and linear anti-type VII collagen IgA deposition along the dermal side in salt-split skin. IgA-EBA lesions clinically mimic those seen in LABD and also tend to involve mucosal surfaces; however, lesions heal without scarring. Rarer is the IgM subtype of EBA (IgM-EBA); only 2 cases featuring linear IgM deposition along the dermal side of the BMZ have been reported. IgM-EBA appears to be predominantly mechanobullous with milder disease presentation compared to its IgG and IgA counterparts. One case in the literature describes mixed IgA- and IgG-mediated EBA with cutaneous and mucosal involvement. To our knowledge, the case reported here is the first to report mixed IgM- and IgA-mediated EBA.

An accurate diagnosis of EBA can be challenging given its clinical overlap with other immunobullous disorders that involve autoantibodies targeting BMZ components, including porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous pemphigoid, bullous lupus erythematous, and LABD. Negative porphyrin studies and the lack of perivascular antibody deposition on DIF made porphyria cutanea tarda unlikely. The mechanobullous nature of the disease, absence of significant neutrophilic infiltration on hematoxylin and eosin, and negative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays argued against bullous pemphigoid, bullous lupus, and LABD. Her lesional histopathologic findings of the cell-poor subepidermal split, perilesional DIF findings of mixed IgM and IgA deposition along the BMZ with a u-serrated pattern, along with salt-split DIF findings of IgM and IgA localization to the floor of the blister confirmed the clinical suspicion of EBA.

### A 9-year-old girl with blisters on the hands and face: an early presentation of variegate porphyria [^911667a8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Variegate porphyria (VP) is a rare subtype of porphyrias characterized by dysfunction of enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway leading to an accumulation of porphyrins and their precursors. The resulting buildup can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms and photosensitive blistering eruptions on sun-exposed skin. We report a case of VP in a 9-year-old girl with many confounding medical factors that warranted alternative explanations for her cutaneous lesions. VP has been reported infrequently in the pediatric population and is associated with more severe neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to adult-onset disease.

### Porphyrias [^58e5aa2e]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Seven different porphyrias form a group of inherited metabolic disorders, each resulting from a partial deficiency of a specific enzyme in the haem biosynthesis pathway. Clinically, the three most important entities are an acute porphyric attack and acute and chronic skin symptoms. Porphyrias are rare and sometimes misdiagnosed, because various symptoms and signs mimic other diseases. Once porphyria is suspected, biochemical analyses easily detect porphyrins and their precursors from blood, urine, or faeces. Mutation screening can be done at the quiescent phase of the disease. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical manifestations differ in individual porphyrias and most of them require a specific treatment. Early diagnosis and information about precipitating factors can diminish mortality and prevent subsequent attacks among patients with acute porphyrias, so mutation screening is recommended for family members.

### Occurrence of porphyria cutanea tarda during peginterferon / ribavirin therapy for chronic viral hepatitis C [^00db05e1]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a metabolic disorder characterized by a reduced hepatic activity of uroporphynogen decarboxylase (URO-D), an enzyme of the heme synthesis. The clinical features of PCT may be brought into light by hepatic injury induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV). A significant association between HCV and PCT is well recognized, although the role of HCV in the appearance of PCT is still debated because confounding factors often coexist, such as alcohol, other viruses, drugs or iron overload (). HCV therapy may improve PCT although PCT was rarely reported as a de novo occurrence during an interferon/ribavirin therapy (Jessner et al. Hepatology 2002;36:1301–1302); here, we describe two such other cases.

### Sclerodermatous changes of face, neck and scalp associated with familial porphyria cutanea tarda [^37145c33]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the porphyrias, is a mainly acquired disease of the liver, which manifests with bullous skin lesions. However, up to 20% of patients with PCT, usually those with chronic untreated disease, are reported to develop some sclerodermatous changes that may affect both light-exposed and nonexposed areas and that can be histologically indistinguishable from true scleroderma. A small number of patients with PCT has severe or generalized scleroderma, which is not necessarily due to coexistent systemic sclerosis. There are few reports in the literature that detail whether the severe sclerodermatous changes respond to control of the porphyria. We report a case of familial PCT with associated severe sclerodermatous changes causing scarring alopecia, cicatricial ectropion and skin thickening over the upper trunk. The scleroderma improved slightly over a 4-year follow-up period after treatment to normalize porphyrin excretion and prevent relapse.

### Stability of plasma and erythrocyte porphyrins: implications for diagnosis and monitoring of erythropoietic protoporphyria [^f9f5578e]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing and identifying the type of porphyria in a patient requires specialist analysis of porphyrins and/or precursors in blood, urine and faeces. Correct sample storage and handling prior to analysis is essential to minimise preanalytical error. We evaluated the impact of light exposure, time and temperature on erythrocyte and plasma porphyrins in samples from patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) stored as whole blood for up to 96hours, and in addition, the effect of freeze-thaw on plasma porphyrins in EPP, PCT and hereditary coproporphyria patient samples. Plasma porphyrins in the EPP patient samples decreased on average by 19% after 6hours despite light protection and fridge storage, 36% by 24hours stored light protected at room temperature, 67% within 1hour when light exposed and 33% after one freeze-thaw cycle. In contrast, plasma porphyrin in PCT samples demonstrated greater stability compared to the EPP samples when stored light protected or exposed at room temperature and during freeze-thaw. Erythrocyte porphyrins in EPP samples were stable for 96hours under all three storage conditions examined. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin analysis should be undertaken as an additional first-line investigation alongside plasma porphyrin analysis whenever protoporphyria needs to be excluded, due to the significant instability of plasma protoporphyrin.

### Isolated congenital hair tuft at an unusual location [^34c04876]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 43-year-old Hispanic woman with an unremarkable medical and family history underwent a routine health screening on an international medical service trip in Honduras. Auscultation of her posterior chest revealed an 8-inch tuft of hair overlying the central thoracic spine (Fig 1). The patient noted that the hair on her spine had been present since birth but had not caused her any issues, so she had never sought medical evaluation. There was no associated pitting, discoloration, depression, or atrophy underlying the terminal hair shafts. Review of systems and complete neurological exam were unremarkable.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Hirsutism
B. Anorexia nervosa
C. Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa
D. Localized hypertrichosis
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:
A. Hirsutism – Incorrect. Hirsutism presents with androgen-dependent terminal hair growth in women, and it may be associated with other signs of androgen excess like acne, androgenetic alopecia, and menstrual irregularities.
B. Anorexia nervosa – Incorrect. Anorexia nervosa presents with generalized lanugo-like hair instead of a single tuft of terminal hair.
C. Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa – Incorrect. Congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa is characterized by long, fine, silvery-gray to blond lanugo hair that covers the entire body, except for the palms, soles, and mucous membranes.
D. Localized hypertrichosis – Correct. Faun tail nevus, or localized hypertrichosis, is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a triangular patch of hair, usually on the lumbosacral spine. Location over the thoracic spine is very rare. The hair can be either dark or light in color, and the texture is usually silky, although it can vary.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda presents with hypertrichosis on sun-exposed areas, especially on the lateral face. In addition, other symptoms of porphyria would be expected including a blistering photosensitive eruption.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^bd28f415]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was based on interpretive description, which is a well-documented qualitative approach with emphasis on clinical practice and exploration of health-related issues.–Focus groups with interactive discussions were deemed appropriate. The study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Norwegian regional ethics committee (2012/1078).

Recruitment

A convenience sample was recruited in connection with a biennial patient seminar arranged by NAPOS in 2012. Information regarding the focus groups was included with invitations to the seminar. Experience with symptoms during the last 5 years was set as the inclusion criterion. Forty-six people with PCT participated at the seminar and 23 provided written consent to participate in the focus groups. Two were excluded because of clinical remission exceeding 5 years.

Data production and participants

The patient seminar consisted of joint sessions and lectures on symptoms and treatment, in addition to conversation groups for patients to share their experiences. Three focus groups with seven participants were held over two consecutive days at the seminar. In light of the rich information provided, the sample size was deemed satisfactory. The interviews lasted approximately 90 min. The participants included 11 women and 10 men, aged 31–77 years. Three participants reported having haemochromatosis (Table 1). The interviews were moderated by the first author (J. A.), who is experienced in counselling patients with porphyria. One co-moderator participated in the first two groups while a second participated in the third group. The interviews were semistructured and focused on three main themes with subquestions. The main themes of the interview guide were: (i) experience with symptoms; (ii) treatment; and (iii) future expectations. Emerging themes that were not addressed by the interview guide were followed up in consecutive interviews.

### Novel treatment using cimetidine for erythropoietic protoporphyria in children [^42696c4e]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare hereditary disease of heme biosynthesis that manifests as severe photosensitivity and hepatotoxicity. There have been no effective treatments to date. Cimetidine has been shown to inhibit heme biosynthesis and results in symptomatic improvement in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). There is only 1 report in the literature describing the use of cimetidine in the effective treatment of an adult patient with EPP.

Objective

To describe the successful use of cimetidine in pediatric patients with EPP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective medical record review carried out in a pediatric dermatology practice at an academic institution of patients diagnosed with EPP who were younger than 18 years and treated with systemic cimetidine in the past 3 years.

Interventions

Systemic cimetidine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Resolution of skin photodamage was evaluated on clinical examination. Subjective measures including tolerability to sun exposure, ability to participate in outdoor activities, and objective evaluation including serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and liver function tests following treatment were assessed.

Results

All 3 cases reported a rapid reduction in photosensitivity within weeks following initiation of systemic therapy. Their skin photodamage were also improved or resolved completely on subsequent examination. Laboratory study results also revealed reduction in serum erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and improved liver function. None of the patients have reported any adverse effects of the systemic treatment after more than 2 years of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Children with EPP currently have limited therapeutic options and experience substantial disease impact on their quality of life. This is the first case series demonstrating that cimetidine, a readily available oral medication, can be a promising treatment for children with EPP.

### Sight-threatening progressive corneo-scleral involvement in porphyria cutanea tarda [^dc113c1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common type of porphyria. It is associated with a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme responsible for heme synthesis. Clinical manifestations are predominantly dermatological and very rarely present with ocular involvement. Although scleral thinning in the interpalpebral area is a well-documented entity, sight-threatening corneal involvement is rarely described. We, herein report a case of a 58-year-old man who presented with ocular surface dryness, photophobia and mild redness. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed corneo-scleral thinning in both eyes. The diagnosis was confirmed with a urine porphyrin test, serum iron and serum ferritin levels. We started him on conservative management after which he was lost to follow-up. He presented again after 6years with total corneal opacification and progressive loss of vision in the right eye.

### Diagnosis and initial management of acute HIV infection [^71a18132]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recognition and diagnosis of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the primary care setting presents an opportunity for patient education and health promotion. Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients. The decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should be guided by consultation with an HIV specialist.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the hepatic porphyrias [^a2461e5c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a peculiar group of diseases resulting from hereditary or acquired partial deficiencies in seven of the eight enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of heme. Biosynthesis of heme takes place in the erythropoietic system or in the hepatic tissue. Depending on the main location of the enzyme defect, porphyrias can be classified as erythropoietic or hepatic. There are seven basic clinical forms of porphyria related to a deficiency of each of the involved enzymes. Clinical manifestations in porphyria may be neurovisceral or cutaneous. Patients may present with acute attacks (acute porphyrias), cutaneous lesions (cutaneous porphyrias), or both (mixed porphyrias). Study of patients supected of having porphyria should include several steps: 1) clinical evaluation, 2) biochemical study, which enables us to classify the patient to a specific form of porphyria, followed if possible by 3) enzymatic assay(s), and 4) genetic studies to confirm an enzyme deficiency and its level and the causal genetic mutation. Unfortunately no curative treatment is available for any of the porphyrias. However, symptomatic treatments are available and are discussed in this article.

### Heme biosynthesis and the porphyrias [^80311722]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias, is a general term for a group of metabolic diseases that are genetic in nature. In each specific porphyria the activity of specific enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway is defective and leads to accumulation of pathway intermediates. Phenotypically, each disease leads to either neurologic and/or photocutaneous symptoms based on the metabolic intermediate that accumulates. In each porphyria the distinct patterns of these substances in plasma, erythrocytes, urine and feces are the basis for diagnostically defining the metabolic defect underlying the clinical observations. Porphyrias may also be classified as either erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on the principal site of accumulation of pathway intermediates. The erythropoietic porphyrias are congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). The acute hepatic porphyrias include ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP). Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the only porphyria that has both genetic and/or environmental factors that lead to reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in the liver. Each of the 8 enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway have been associated with a specific porphyria (Table 1). Mutations affecting the erythroid form of ALA synthase (ALAS2) are most commonly associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia, however, gain-of-function mutations of ALAS2 have also been associated with a variant form of EPP. This overview does not describe the full clinical spectrum of the porphyrias, but is meant to be an overview of the biochemical steps that are required to make heme in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells.

### Modern diagnosis and management of the porphyrias [^b7e4aa30]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the molecular understanding of the porphyrias now offer specific diagnosis and precise definition of the types of genetic mutations involved in the disease. Molecular diagnostic testing is powerful and very useful in kindred evaluation and genetic counselling when a disease-responsible mutation has been identified in the family. It is also the only way to properly screen asymptomatic gene carriers, facilitating correct treatment and appropriate genetic counselling of family members at risk. However, it should be noted that DNA-based testing is for the diagnosis of the gene carrier status, but not for the diagnosis of clinical syndrome or severity of the disease, e.g. an acute attack. For the diagnosis of clinically expressed porphyrias, a logical stepwise approach including the analysis of porphyrins and their precursors should not be underestimated, as it is still very useful, and is often the best from the cost-effective point of view.
