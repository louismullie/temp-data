## Question

Antidepressant with antiplatelet property

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidepressants have antiplatelet properties and what the mechanism, magnitude, and clinical implications of that effect are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic basis linking serotonin, platelets, and antidepressants. Then, I should verify which antidepressant classes and specific agents most consistently demonstrate antiplatelet effects. Next, I will review the strength and consistency of evidence across in vitro, ex vivo, and clinical studies. After that, I need to quantify the clinical bleeding risk and identify high-risk combinations. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and practical prescribing choices, including alternatives for patients at bleeding risk.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Platelets rely on serotonin for granule content and amplification of aggregation. They cannot synthesize serotonin and depend on the serotonin transporter (SERT) to take it up from plasma, which is the same transporter targeted by SSRIs and related serotonergic antidepressants, so chronic SERT blockade depletes platelet serotonin and impairs aggregation and hemostasis, especially in response to weaker agonists like ADP and epinephrine [^116bZzy7] [^114cnVGT] [^117QzogW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all antidepressants. I need to check which classes show the clearest antiplatelet signal. SSRIs consistently demonstrate reduced platelet reactivity across multiple assays, with effects on ADP, collagen, and thromboxane-mimetic responses, and they reduce platelet activation biomarkers such as beta-thromboglobulin and P-selectin in clinical cohorts, supporting a pharmacodynamic antiplatelet effect rather than just a class labeling artifact [^116bZzy7] [^114UGMNV] [^1165w4yZ].

> Wait, let me verify whether SNRIs behave similarly. SNRIs also inhibit serotonin reuptake and carry bleeding warnings, and mechanistic and epidemiologic data suggest increased bleeding risk, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, when combined with NSAIDs or anticoagulants, indicating a clinically meaningful antiplatelet effect even though their serotonin transporter affinity is generally lower than SSRIs [^114RMuA2] [^111b8ddN] [^115Yh3nt].

> I should also examine serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) like trazodone. Evidence suggests SARIs may suppress multiple platelet activation pathways, with signals for reduced ADP and collagen-induced aggregation and even potential 5-HT2A antagonism on platelets, though some associations are borderline and warrant cautious interpretation pending larger samples [^114VRLUT] [^114dM3Pb].

> Let me consider TCAs and other non-serotonergic agents. Nortriptyline showed reduced platelet aggregation in responders in a randomized study, but this may reflect indirect effects rather than a consistent SERT-mediated mechanism. Importantly, bupropion and mirtazapine have been proposed as alternatives for patients at bleeding risk, yet meta-analytic data suggest mirtazapine may still carry a modest GI bleeding signal and bupropion is not clearly safer across all contexts, so I should be careful not to overstate their neutrality [^115rhixx] [^114isYC5].

> Next, I should review the magnitude and consistency of evidence. Large population-based platelet phenotyping demonstrates robust, reproducible reductions in platelet reactivity with serotonin-affecting antidepressants, including attenuation of secondary aggregation and less stable aggregates, and these effects persist after adjustment for aspirin use, indicating a true pharmacodynamic effect superimposed on background antiplatelet therapy in some participants [^116bZzy7] [^114UGMNV] [^114cnVGT].

> I will now examine clinical bleeding outcomes to ensure this translates beyond the lab. Meta-analyses and large observational studies associate SSRI use with about a 1.5-fold increase in upper gastrointestinal bleeding, with risk amplified to roughly 2–3 fold when combined with NSAIDs or aspirin, and a smaller but significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage risk, particularly early in therapy and with strong SERT inhibitors; FDA labeling for SSRIs and SNRIs carries explicit bleeding warnings and advises caution with antiplatelets and anticoagulants [^111x5nbx] [^112HbXYb] [^111CcPeV] [^113ZHw7s] [^117TsmT7] [^114RMuA2].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on clopidogrel or a DOAC. I should double-check interaction risks. SSRIs and SNRIs can additively increase bleeding with clopidogrel, and certain SSRIs like fluoxetine and fluvoxamine inhibit CYP2C19, potentially reducing clopidogrel activation and creating a complex risk–benefit scenario; concomitant use with oral anticoagulants, including DOACs, is associated with higher major bleeding risk, with risk peaking early and persisting over months, prompting guideline recommendations for close monitoring and individualized risk assessment [^112YWYaz] [^111wqN1a] [^112By7Sa] [^116WUQeu].

> Let me think about special populations and procedures. In older adults, the absolute risk of GI bleeding is higher and falls rise, so SSRI-associated platelet dysfunction may compound these risks. Perioperative and interventional pain guidelines advise multidisciplinary discussion and consideration of holding SSRIs in high-risk procedures, and neuraxial or epidural interventions carry a particular concern for hematoma when combined with antithrombotics and SSRIs, as highlighted by case reports and consensus statements [^112TCcHL] [^113pSD9j] [^113mzgZd] [^1132Pjvm].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup negates this signal. In patients with hematologic malignancies and thrombocytopenia, a small retrospective cohort did not find increased clinically significant bleeding with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, suggesting that in profoundly thrombocytopenic contexts, SSRI antiplatelet effects may be less determinative of bleeding risk, though this requires cautious interpretation and individualized assessment [^115SbdeF].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing choices. For patients with high GI bleeding risk, concurrent NSAID or anticoagulant use, or upcoming surgery, I need to ensure informed consent about bleeding risk, consider gastroprotection if an SSRI/SNRI is necessary, and in select cases choose agents with less serotonergic platelet effect or use the lowest effective dose. Bupropion or mirtazapine may be reasonable alternatives in some patients, but I should confirm that evidence for bleeding neutrality is limited and that clinical judgment must prevail [^111x5nbx] [^112TFdDJ] [^114isYC5].

> I should confirm monitoring steps. Baseline assessment of bleeding risk, medication reconciliation for antiplatelets, NSAIDs, and anticoagulants, patient education on bleeding signs, and consideration of platelet function testing in high-risk scenarios are prudent. If warfarin is coadministered, closer INR monitoring during SSRI initiation or dose changes is advised, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for early bleeding, particularly in the first month of SSRI therapy [^113ZHw7s] [^117TsmT7] [^116VjbZo].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. Antidepressants with clear antiplatelet properties are those that meaningfully inhibit platelet serotonin reuptake, namely SSRIs and SNRIs, with the strongest and most consistent evidence for SSRIs; SARIs like trazodone show plausible antiplatelet signals but less definitive data, whereas bupropion and mirtazapine are often considered alternatives for bleeding risk yet are not proven safer across all contexts, so medication selection should be individualized and risk-mitigation strategies implemented when serotonergic antidepressants are necessary in patients with bleeding risk factors [^116bZzy7] [^114UGMNV] [^114RMuA2] [^114VRLUT] [^114isYC5].

---

SSRIs and SNRIs have **clinically relevant antiplatelet effects** [^114UGMNV] due to platelet serotonin depletion [^117QzogW], which impairs aggregation and increases bleeding risk, especially with NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants [^111x5nbx] [^112By7Sa]. Bupropion and mirtazapine are **preferred in patients at high bleeding risk** because they lack significant serotonergic platelet effects [^113FjFtU] [^114isYC5]. Clinicians should monitor for bleeding [^112TFdDJ], use gastroprotection when indicated [^111x5nbx], and consider platelet function testing in high-risk patients [^114UGMNV].

---

## Mechanism of antiplatelet effects

SSRIs and SNRIs inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT) on platelets, reducing serotonin storage in dense granules [^117QzogW] [^115jQ9F3]. Upon activation, platelets release serotonin to amplify aggregation; **depleted stores blunt this response** [^117QzogW], impairing aggregation and hemostasis [^114DfdSc].

## Clinical implications and risks

### Bleeding risk

SSRIs/SNRIs increase **upper GI bleeding risk** [^111x5nbx], especially with NSAIDs or anticoagulants [^111x5nbx] [^112By7Sa]. Intracranial hemorrhage risk is modestly increased, particularly early in therapy or with anticoagulants [^111CcPeV]. Postpartum hemorrhage risk is also increased, especially peripartum [^113ZHw7s].

---

### Surgical and procedural considerations

SSRIs/SNRIs increase **perioperative bleeding risk** [^1132Pjvm]; multidisciplinary planning is advised. For high-risk procedures, consider holding SSRIs/SNRIs when feasible [^113pSD9j].

---

### Drug interactions

SSRIs/SNRIs **add bleeding risk** when combined with NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants [^111x5nbx] [^112By7Sa]. CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) may reduce clopidogrel efficacy, though clinical significance varies [^111wqN1a] [^117PDyrL].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate bleeding risk before prescribing SSRIs/SNRIs, especially with antiplatelets/anticoagulants [^116VjbZo].
- **Alternative antidepressants**: Consider bupropion or mirtazapine in high-risk patients [^113FjFtU].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for bleeding, especially GI and intracranial, particularly early in therapy or with interacting drugs [^111CcPeV].
- **Gastroprotection**: Use PPIs in patients at GI bleeding risk [^111x5nbx].
- **Platelet function testing**: Consider in high-risk patients to guide therapy [^114UGMNV].

---

## Summary of key findings

SSRIs and SNRIs have **clinically meaningful antiplatelet effects** [^114UGMNV] that increase bleeding risk, especially with NSAIDs or anticoagulants [^111x5nbx] [^112By7Sa]. Bupropion and mirtazapine are preferred in high-risk patients due to minimal platelet effects [^113FjFtU]. Clinicians should assess bleeding risk, monitor for bleeding, and use gastroprotection or platelet testing when indicated [^116VjbZo].

### Variables affecting the potential efficacy of PRP in providing chronic pain relief [^116NwQ5x]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs and other consumables

Increasing levels of alcohol consumption are associated with decreased platelet activation and aggregation, in men more than women, and reduced platelet responses to thrombinand collagen. Limited smoking (three cigarettes/day) increases platelet aggregation. Therefore, reducing or eliminating alcohol and tobacco consumption prior to preparing PRP may allow platelets to reestablish their normal factor content and aggregation properties.

Platelet content is also affected by various drugs and drug therapies, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, antibiotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs suppress normal platelet functions, factor content, and their ability to aggregate, while quinine reduces platelet count.

The importance of serotonin, and specifically platelet-released serotonin, in inflammatory pain states is indicated by the finding that inflammation is associated with increased endogenous peripheral serotonin levels. The application of serotonin to nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons induces long-term neuron excitation and sensitization during inflammation, indicating that serotonin directly triggers pain. Platelets that aggregate at injured nociceptive neurons are the primary source of serotonin activating these neurons. The nociceptive influence of platelet-released serotonin at injury sites is increased by platelet-released serotonin inducing more platelet recruitment and aggregation, which continues in a cyclical fashion, while also blocking serotonin reuptake, which further increases nociceptive neuron excitation.

These findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce platelet-induced pain by reducing platelet serotonin content prior to preparing PRP. This can be done by activating platelet delta granules with nitroglycerin, or 3,4-methyl-enedioxymethamphetamine.SSRIs also reduce neuron, and plateletserotonin content by blocking the serotonin transporter, which is responsible for serotonin uptake and accumulation. The potential efficacy of reducing platelet serotonin content as a means of reducing pain is suggested by the finding that individuals on SSRIs show reduced pain due to multiple causes.

The influence of SSRIs in reducing platelet serotonin content and production is short-lived, and shortly after stopping SSRI administration, platelet serotonin content returns to normal. This suggests that the short-term administration of SSRIs to healthy individuals may be beneficial in reducing pain by reducing platelet serotonin content. Therefore, it should be possible to increase PRP analgesic efficacy by: 1) inhibiting platelet serotonin release during platelet aggregation;2) reducing platelet serotonin content, thereby reducing the amount of platelet serotonin available for release;, and 3) reducing platelet aggregation, thereby further reducing the amount of serotonin available for release.

By contrast, the weak/non-2C19 inhibiting antidepressant citalopram was used by 1930 patients during follow-up, and 207 (11%) of these had the primary outcome (table 6). This compared with 2553 (7%) in non-citalopram users and gave a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.52 (1.32 to 1.76). For secondary outcomes the fully adjusted hazard ratios were 1.61 (1.38 to 1.88) for all cause mortality, 1.14 (0.84 to 1.56) for incident myocardial infarction, 1.44 (1.16 to 1.79) for vascular mortality, and 1.84 (1.48 to 2.29) for non-vascular mortality (fig 2).

### Desvenlafaxine [^111b8ddN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Elevated Blood Pressure

Patients receiving desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets should have regular monitoring of blood pressure since increases in blood pressure were observed in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets.

Sustained blood pressure increases could have adverse consequences. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SNRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets.

5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

### Aspirin: a review of its neurobiological properties and therapeutic potential for mental illness [^112ZLWdB]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

One of the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in medicine, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), is an agent that may be capable of interrupting this neurotoxic cascade. Aspirin exerts its effects on the inflammatory cascades, irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) — 1, and modifying enzyme activity of COX-2, suppressing production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. These anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet mechanisms have been found to have positive effects on the risk of atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, and potentially, some cancers. Given that similar disease mechanisms may underwrite the pathophysiology of major neuropsychiatric disorders, it is possible that aspirin, by interrupting neurotoxic cascades, could be a potential candidate for secondary prevention. In this review, we assess the evidence base supporting inflammatory and oxidative-stress disturbance in major neuropsychiatric disorders, and propose how aspirin may alter such pathways. Other reviews that have explored the use of somatic drugs for psychiatric diseases have placed a strong focus on COX-2 as the most important and powerful anti-inflammatory, but in this paper, we propose that COX-1 is in fact the key component in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In addition, we identify some early indications of the preventative effect of aspirin on neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in patients with coronary artery disease [^113BpQ15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression occurs frequently in individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with a poor prognosis.

Objectives

To determine the effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in CAD patients with comorbid depression.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases up to August 2020. We also searched three clinical trials registers in September 2021. We examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and contacted primary authors. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs investigating psychological and pharmacological interventions for depression in adults with CAD and comorbid depression. Our primary outcomes included depression, mortality, and cardiac events. Secondary outcomes were healthcare costs and utilisation, health-related quality of life, cardiovascular vital signs, biomarkers of platelet activation, electrocardiogram wave parameters, non-cardiac adverse events, and pharmacological side effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently examined the identified papers for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. We performed random-effects model meta-analyses to compute overall estimates of treatment outcomes.

Main Results

Thirty-seven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Psychological interventions may result in a reduction in end-of-treatment depression symptoms compared to controls (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to -0.19, I² = 88%; low certainty evidence; 10 trials; n = 1226). No effect was evident on medium-term depression symptoms one to six months after the end of treatment (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.01, I² = 69%; 7 trials; n = 2654). The evidence for long-term depression symptoms and depression response was sparse for this comparison. There is low certainty evidence that psychological interventions may result in little to no difference in end-of-treatment depression remission (odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.19, I² = 87%; low certainty evidence; 3 trials; n = 862). Based on one to two trials per outcome, no beneficial effects on mortality and cardiac events of psychological interventions versus control were consistently found. The evidence was very uncertain for end-of-treatment effects on all-cause mortality, and data were not reported for end-of-treatment cardiovascular mortality and occurrence of myocardial infarction for this comparison. In the trials examining a head-to-head comparison of varying psychological interventions or clinical management, the evidence regarding the effect on end-of-treatment depression symptoms is very uncertain for: cognitive behavioural therapy compared to supportive stress management; behaviour therapy compared to person-centred therapy; cognitive behavioural therapy and well-being therapy compared to clinical management. There is low certainty evidence from one trial that cognitive behavioural therapy may result in little to no difference in end-of-treatment depression remission compared to supportive stress management (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.50; low certainty evidence; n = 83). Based on one to two trials per outcome, no beneficial effects on depression remission, depression response, mortality rates, and cardiac events were consistently found in head-to-head comparisons between psychological interventions or clinical management. The review suggests that pharmacological intervention may have a large effect on end-of-treatment depression symptoms (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.32, I² = 90%; low certainty evidence; 8 trials; n = 750). Pharmacological interventions probably result in a moderate to large increase in depression remission (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.89, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence; 4 trials; n = 646). We found an effect favouring pharmacological intervention versus placebo on depression response at the end of treatment, though strength of evidence was not rated (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.54, I² = 62%; 5 trials; n = 891). Based on one to four trials per outcome, no beneficial effects regarding mortality and cardiac events were consistently found for pharmacological versus placebo trials, and the evidence was very uncertain for end-of-treatment effects on all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. In the trials examining a head-to-head comparison of varying pharmacological agents, the evidence was very uncertain for end-of-treatment effects on depression symptoms. The evidence regarding the effects of different pharmacological agents on depression symptoms at end of treatment is very uncertain for: simvastatin versus atorvastatin; paroxetine versus fluoxetine; and escitalopram versus Bu Xin Qi. No trials were eligible for the comparison of a psychological intervention with a pharmacological intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

In individuals with CAD and depression, there is low certainty evidence that psychological intervention may result in a reduction in depression symptoms at the end of treatment. There was also low certainty evidence that pharmacological interventions may result in a large reduction of depression symptoms at the end of treatment. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological intervention probably results in a moderate to large increase in depression remission at the end of treatment. Evidence on maintenance effects and the durability of these short-term findings is still missing. The evidence for our primary and secondary outcomes, apart from depression symptoms at end of treatment, is still sparse due to the low number of trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions. As psychological and pharmacological interventions can seemingly have a large to only a small or no effect on depression, there is a need for research focusing on extracting those approaches able to substantially improve depression in individuals with CAD and depression.

### Aspirin for recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder-promising, yet clinically understudied? [^113rvj7y]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Current available maintenance pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder (BD) leaves ample room for improvement. Up to 50% of patients with BD do not respond adequately to available treatments and still suffer from manic and/or depressive episodes. Although a number of pharmaceutical companies have invested in novel medications, none of the recently developed compounds has shown efficacy for recurrence prevention.

Given that BD is associated with dysregulations of the immune system, there is increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of immune‐modulating medications. Although aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has been investigated to treat depressive symptoms, 1 low‐dose (typically ≤ 150 mg/day) aspirin may be a particularly promising candidate for recurrence prevention: it is well tolerated, even with long‐term use, well absorbed, passes the blood‐brain barrier, and likely exerts anti‐inflammatory effects in both the brain and the periphery.

In this perspective article, we will give an overview of the neuropharmacodynamics of (low‐dose) aspirin, reflect on the published clinical studies and argue that aspirin is a promising, yet understudied option for recurrence prevention.

### Cerebrovascular effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a systematic review [^113AgiAm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

An understanding of cerebro-vascular effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is essential, since SSRIs are a widely used antidepressant, serotonin is a vasoactive and thrombostatic amine, and there is a bidirectional relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed to identify published reports over the period of 1966 through 2003, using the terms SSRIs and antidepressants matched with the terms platelets, coagulation, anticoagulation, bleeding, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, embolism, cerebral ischemia, stroke, cerebrovascular accident, acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular disorder, and cerebral circulation. Adverse event reports collected from the World Health Organization (WHO), manufacturers, and the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) were also examined.

Data Synthesis

Two case-control studies failed to show an association between SSRI use and intracranial hemorrhage, and of these, 1 showed no association with ischemic stroke. Sixteen studies of SSRI treatment in poststroke patients found no significant cerebrovascular adverse reactions. The WHO data have shown several hundred cases of SSRI-associated cerebrovascular disease, but definitive causal relationships remain undetermined. Four cases of vasoconstrictive stroke related to drug interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs have been reported. PDR and manufacturer reference sources categorized cerebrovascular reaction as an infrequent or rare adverse event related to SSRI use.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that SSRI treatment has a very low rate of cerebrovascular adverse reaction. Pharmacovigilance is required in the use of SSRIs in high-risk populations for bleeding and vasoconstrictive stroke. More research is warranted to examine the variability of pharmacologic and genetic factors, depressive illness, and stroke on the antiplatelet and vasospastic effects of SSRIs and their significance to cerebrovascular protection or adverse reactions.

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and abnormal bleeding: a review for clinicians and a reconsideration of mechanisms [^112AKAf5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally believed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs increase the risk of abnormal bleeding and decrease the risk of ischemic heart disease events by blocking the uptake of serotonin into platelets, leading to an impairment in the platelet hemostatic response.

Objective

To perform a detailed qualitative review of existing literature on the association of abnormal bleeding with the use of SSRIs.

Data Sources

We conducted a PubMed search during June 2009 using the search terms antidepressants and SSRIs (including the names of individual SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram) in association with bleeding, platelets, hemostasis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, proton pump inhibitors, peptic ulcer, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, surgery, tooth extraction, dental bleeding, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and other terms related to the field. We then searched the reference lists of identified studies.

Study Selection

We provide a qualitative discussion of all studies that would inform clinicians about the mechanisms of bleeding and bleeding risks associated with these drugs in different clinical contexts.

Results

Epidemiologic studies show that SSRI use is associated with roughly doubled odds of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; bleeding at other sites has been less commonly described, as has a possibly increased risk of bleeding associated with surgical procedures. The risk of SSRI-associated GI bleeding is increased with the concurrent use of NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents and is decreased by concurrent proton pump inhibitors. The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with cirrhosis of the liver or liver failure. There is, curiously, little literature on use of SSRIs and menstrual or postpartum blood loss. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear protective against ischemic heart disease events. The data are too limited to allow interpretations about influences on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusions

On the basis of the findings of our literature search, we suggest that SSRI-induced increase in gastric acid secretion may explain the GI bleeding risk and that SSRI-related effects on platelet reactivity, endothelial reactivity, and inflammatory markers may explain the ischemic heart disease protective effect. Because the absolute risk of GI bleeds with SSRIs is low, precautions are probably necessary only in high-risk patients, such as those with acid-peptic disease and those with a history of bleeds. We discuss management issues and areas for future research.

### Effects of antidepressant medication on morbidity and mortality in depressed patients after myocardial infarction… [^115Cw5f6]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Less is known about the effects of antidepressants in patients with CVD and especially in patients with CVD and depression. In a small controlled study, Roose et al12 found that paroxetine and nortriptyline hydrochloride are effective treatments for depressed patients with ischemic heart disease. However, nortriptyline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of serious adverse cardiac events compared with paroxetine. Based on self-report, the median duration of antidepressant treatment was approximately 12 months for both groups. Individuals in the PI arm with an HRSD score of 25 or higher after 5 weeks of CBT were to be examined for pharmacologic treatment with sertraline according to protocol-specified procedures. In the PI group, 35. 3% of patients with an HRSD score of 25 or higher were given antidepressants.

The main finding of this study is that antidepressant use post-AMI by depressed patients in the ENRICHD clinical trial was associated with significantly lower rates of the study primary end points, death and reinfarction. Depressed patients reporting SSRI use post-AMI had a relative risk of death or recurrent MI of 0. 57, adjusted for disease severity and other factors, compared with nonusers. These analyses reflect the effects on morbidity and mortality when individuals are using antidepressants and do not address the effects of antidepressants when they are discontinued. Major depression is also associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity. 29 Increased sympathetic nervous system activity may also lead to increased risk for CVD-related death in post-MI patients. Preclinical data suggest that serotonin inhibition can reduce sympathetic nervous system outflow.

Short-term administration of sertraline has also been shown to reduce the plasma norepinephrine appearance rate, which reflects total body sympathetic nervous system activity, in healthy volunteers at least. 30 There is also evidence that depressed cardiac patients have increased platelet activation, 27, 31–33 a risk factor for cardiac events. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to improve platelet function. 34, 35 It is also possible that antidepressants may have effects on mechanisms related to increased risk of recurrent events but not related to depression. The results of this study, combined with the epidemiologic and other data, clearly demonstrate the need for a properly powered, prospective, randomized trial to determine whether SSRIs can alter cardiovascular outcomes post-MI.

Role of aspirin in mood disorders; clinical data

There is some evidence suggesting beneficial effects for aspirin in mood disorders, through a shortened onset of action of antidepressants. However, there are negative epidemiological data from a study of 5,556 older men, which showed no association between current aspirin use and depression, although the men who discontinued aspirin had a greater odds ratio for depression compared with those who had never used aspirin. In a treatment-intervention study of 70 patients with depression, administration of aspirin together with fluoxetine conferred a greater reduction of OS parameters compared with fluoxetine monotherapy. Another randomized controlled clinical trial is currently underway to investigate the potential benefits of aspirin as an adjunctive treatment in bipolar depression.

### Clinical impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors therapy with bleeding risks [^117LyJXa]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extensively used for the treatment of multiple psychiatric conditions. In vitro and ex vivo data with these agents indicate they may have varying degrees of antiplatelet activity via multiple receptors. Reports of bleeding in patients receiving SSRIs appeared soon after their introduction. A review of the literature suggests SSRI therapy may increase the risk of bleeding especially with concomitant aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing these agents in high risk patients and maintain awareness of the potential contribution of SSRIs to unexplained bleeding episodes.

### Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in older people: population based cohort study [^114ijoEp]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Several observational studies have examined the effects of antidepressant drugs on single adverse outcomes, although few have been done specifically in older people or have examined them as a subgroup and few, if any, studies have directly compared adverse event rates across a range of important clinical outcomes. These studies have identified several adverse outcomes that may be associated with antidepressants, but an intrinsic problem with observational studies of antidepressants is the difficulty of distinguishing between the effects of antidepressant drugs and depression itself.

Attempted suicide/self harm

Relatively few studies have looked at antidepressants and attempted suicide/self harm in older people. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials registered with the US Food and Drug Administration found a reduced risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation associated with antidepressants in the group aged 65 years and over. It found no evidence of a difference between drug classes across people of all ages. A systematic review of observational studies also found a reduction in risk of suicide or attempted suicide associated with use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the subgroup aged 65 years and older. Little evidence supports or refutes our findings of increased rates associated with mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and trazodone compared with other antidepressants, and these warrant further investigation.

Myocardial infarction and stroke

The literature contains no clear findings for risk of myocardial infarction and antidepressant use in older people. Some studies have found an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with antidepressant use, some have found a protective effect, and others have found no association. An increased risk has been observed as being restricted to tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, applying across classes, or restricted to particular drugs. Evidence of a protective effect is largely limited to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Findings from previous studies of antidepressants and risk of stroke are inconsistent, but some studies have found (as we did) a possible increase in risk among users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the group of other antidepressants. If selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have an effect on occurrence of stroke, this may result from an increased risk of bleeding complications, as these drugs limit uptake of blood serotonin by platelets, which leads to inhibition of platelet aggregation, thereby preventing haemostasis by platelets. This mechanism could explain an association specifically with haemorrhagic stroke, but we were not able to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in this study.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^1125Ao93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1	CYP2C19 Inducers

Since clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel.

Rifampin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or Esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of Plavix when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with Plavix. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3	Opioids

As with other oral P2Y12inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of clopidogrel, presumably because of slowed gastric emptying, resulting in reduced exposure to its metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists.

7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.5 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitro, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.6 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — bleeding risk signals: SSRIs decrease platelet serotonin uptake and have been associated with surgical bleeding in breast and orthopedic surgery and with increased gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with antiplatelet therapy. In a large epidemiologic study, combined SSRI use with NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin increased the observed/expected ratios of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to 12.2 (95% CI, 7.1–19.5) and 5.2 (95% CI, 3.2–8.0), respectively. Although routine discontinuation is not advocated, for high-risk patients multidisciplinary discussion with the treating physician may aid decision-making.

### Are the antiplatelet and profibrinolytic properties of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors relevant to their brain effects? [^114DfdSc]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) is found in neuron and platelet membranes. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for severe depression. They may at least partly counteract the effects of serotonin on the vascular biology system, can lower agonists-induced platelet activation, aggregation and procoagulant activity in vitro, thus modulating platelet thrombogenicity. Other effects, such as those mediated through PAI-1 modulation, may indirectly influence neurobiology-relevant mechanisms involved in depression. Patients receiving SSRIs are at increased bleeding risk and decreased risk of arterial occlusive events, such as myocardial infarction, compared to those using non-SSRI antidepressants. The objectives of this review were to highlight antiplatelet and profibrinolytic properties of SSRIs and discuss the potential role of these activities in the context of SSRI brain effects.

### Anticoagulation and psychotropic medications [^112dgRwa]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants and psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed together. Thus, the potential for interaction exists. Whereas thrombolytics and heparins are implicated in few pharmacokinetic interactions, warfarin and platelet inhibitors have been implicated in various interactions with psychotropic medications. In this article, I review the various psychotropic drug classes' relationships to anticoagulants. In a field devoid of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, clinical vigilance is advised when managing patients on concomitant therapy.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^1134QxZS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have cited associations between depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity. Additionally, comorbidity of CVD and depression is commonly seen in clinical settings and is linked to poor prognosis. Given that impaired central serotonin signaling has been linked to depression, and that serotonin can induce platelet aggregability and is released from platelet dense granules upon activation, platelets have been hypothesized as a link between CVD and depression. Past studies in the field have utilized a wide range of platelet activation and aggregation assays in small sample sizes, with variable findings. For example, some studies found that depression was associated with increased expression of activated platelet markers such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and P‐selectin, hyper‐aggregation in response to collagen and thrombin, and increased serotonin‐augmented epinephrine aggregation. In other cases, however, no relationships were found. To better understand the role of platelets in linking depression with CVD, a large‐scale study with multiple platelet reactivity parameters across a breadth of agonists is warranted.

Antidepressants (ADs), particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often prescribed after a diagnosis of depression or other affective disorders. As serotonin transporters are similarly expressed in platelets and the central nervous system, some classes of antidepressants potentially impact platelet function. Several studies have sought to elucidate the effects of different antidepressant drug classes on platelet function and have subsequently shown that serotonin‐affecting ADs exert an inhibitory effect on platelets across a broad range of platelet function assays and agonists. However, given the heterogeneity of platelet assays and small sample sizes utilized, the extent to which these drugs affect platelets remains inconclusive.

We aimed to assess relationships between depressive symptomatology and AD use, respectively, and platelet reactivity traits from five distinct platelet function assays and a broad range of platelet agonists in a large sample within the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We hypothesized that depression would be associated with higher, and AD use lower, platelet reactivity trait values.

### Serotonergic antidepressant use and risk of clinically significant bleeding in thrombocytopenic hematologic malignancy patients [^115SbdeF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants have known antiplatelet properties. Patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) are at an increased risk of bleeding complications due to their malignancy and treatment-induced thrombocytopenia.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of clinically significant bleeding (CSB) in patients with HM and thrombocytopenia who are prescribed SRIs.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients admitted to the hospital with HM and thrombocytopenia. Patients were stratified into SRI-exposed and SRI-unexposed groups. Patients were followed up until resolution of thrombocytopenia, hospital discharge, death, or SRI therapy interruption. The primary outcome was the incidence of CSB.

Results

A total of the 324 patients were included in the study (119 SRI exposed vs 205 SRI unexposed). The median baseline platelet value was 35 × 10 9 /L and 31 × 10 9 /L, respectively. The median platelet nadir was 6 × 10 9 /L, and the median duration of study inclusion was 12 days in both groups. No difference was seen in the incidence of CSB between groups (16% vs 13%, P = 0.487). Hospital length of stay (LOS) (20 vs 19 days, P = 0.227) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (3.9 vs 3.9 days, P = 0.996) were similar between groups. On multivariable analysis, SRI exposure was not independently associated with CSB (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–2.86).

Conclusion and Relevance

In patients with HM and thrombocytopenia, SRI exposure was not associated with an increased risk of CSB. Given the small study size, assessment of patient-specific risks versus benefits should still be considered when prescribing SRI therapy in this patient population.

### Sertraline [^117TsmT7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including sertraline hydrochloride, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with sertraline hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride tablets. Prior to initiating treatment with sertraline hydrochloride tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.6 Seizures

Sertraline hydrochloride has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Sertraline hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.

### Should selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors be prescribed to all patients with ischemic heart disease? [^115smTKn]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies have uncovered more and more evidence demonstrating the adverse relationship between depression and ischemic heart disease. One of the most significant mechanisms that may explain the adverse relationship is the increased platelet activity, otherwise known as aggregation, observed to occur in patients with depression or ischemic heart disease. Platelet activity is further elevated in patients with depression and ischemic heart disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are antidepressants and also act like platelet inhibitors. The results of large-scale clinical trials suggest that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce cardiac events in post-myocardial infarction patients or in those with unstable angina that may be related to the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on platelet aggregation.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride [^114RMuA2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events, ranging from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, petechiae, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage to life-threatening hemorrhage. Concomitant use of aspirin, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants or other drugs known to affect platelet function may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SNRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

5.5 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Mania or hypomania was reported in venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules treated patients in the premarketing studies in MDD, SAD, and PD (see Table 2). Prior to initiating treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, screen for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride [^1137uuZh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation have been reported, although causality with Paroxetine HCL CR has not been established.

Paroxetine HCL CR should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients taking anti-arrhythmic or other medications that may potentially prolong QT interval, or those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease.

The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, Paroxetine HCL CR should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Paroxetine HCL CR, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case‑control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^117DCVJp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Anticoagulants, Antiplatelets, Thrombolytics, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): Avoid concomitant use due to increased risk of bleeding. (7.1)
Rifampin: Avoid concomitant use (7.2)

7.1	Anticoagulants, Antiplatelets, Thrombolytics, and SSRIs/SNRIs

Co-administration of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, thrombolytics and SSRIs or SNRIs may increase the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Long-term concomitant treatment with SAVAYSA and other anticoagulants is not recommended because of increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Short term co-administration may be needed for patients transitioning to or from SAVAYSA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

In clinical studies with SAVAYSA concomitant use of aspirin (low dose ≤ 100 mg/day) or thienopyridines, and NSAIDs was permitted and resulted in increased rates of Clinically Relevant Bleeding. Carefully monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with low dose aspirin and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at an increased risk of bleeding in case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2	P-gp Inducers

Avoid the concomitant use of SAVAYSA with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3	P-gp Inhibitors

Treatment of NVAF

Based on clinical experience from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, dose reduction in patients concomitantly receiving P-gp inhibitors resulted in edoxaban blood levels that were lower than in patients who were given the full dose. Consequently, no dose reduction is recommended for concomitant P-gp inhibitor use [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of hemorrhagic stroke [^114xkJHF]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are widely prescribed. Several reports have observed an increased bleeding risk associated with SSRI use, which is hypothesized to be secondary to their antiplatelet effect.

Methods

We tested the hypothesis that SSRIs increase the risk for or potentiate the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

Results

In multivariate analysis, we found no increased risk associated with SSRI use for intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.7 to 1.8; P = 0.63) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (odds ratio = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.0; P = 0.054). In addition, potentiation of risk with warfarin or antiplatelets was not observed.

Conclusions

Further studies with larger populations would be needed to exclude a small increase in intracranial hemorrhage risk with SSRI use.

### Impact of an interaction between clopidogrel and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^111wqN1a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires activation by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. Patients receiving clopidogrel are often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for co-existing depression. SSRIs that inhibit the CYP2C19 enzyme have the potential to reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel. Using 5 US databases (1998 to 2013), we conducted a cohort study of adults who initiated clopidogrel while being treated with either an SSRI that inhibits CYP2C19 (fluoxetine and fluvoxamine) or a noninhibiting SSRI. Patients were matched by propensity score and followed for as long as they were exposed to both clopidogrel and the index SSRI group (primary analysis) or for 180 days after clopidogrel initiation (sensitivity analysis). Outcomes included a composite ischemic event (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or a revascularization procedure) and a composite major bleeding event (gastrointestinal bleed or hemorrhagic stroke). The final propensity score-matched cohort comprised 9,281 clopidogrel initiators on CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRIs and 44,278 clopidogrel initiators on a noninhibiting SSRIs. Compared with those treated with a noninhibiting SSRI, patients on a CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRI had an increased risk of ischemic events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.24), which was more pronounced in patients ≥ 65 years (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.48). The HR for major bleeding was 0.76 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.17). In conclusion, the findings from this large, population-based study suggest that being treated with a CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRI when initiating clopidogrel may be associated with slight decrease in effectiveness of clopidogrel.

### Prothrombotic platelet phenotype in major depression: downregulation by antidepressant treatment [^115TACnF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonergic mechanisms have been suggested as a link between major depression and cardiovascular risk. We investigated the existence of a prothrombotic condition in depressed patients and its possible modulation during treatment with a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

Methods

Modifications in a series of biomarkers of platelet and coagulation activation were evaluated in blood from 19 patients with a major depression disorder (MDD) at the time of diagnosis, and at 8 and 24 weeks of treatment with escitalopram. Response of blood aliquots recirculated through a thrombogenic surface was assessed in a thrombosis model. Results were compared with those of 20 healthy-matched controls.

Results

In comparison with controls, platelets from MDD patients showed elevated volumes (p < 0.01), significantly enhanced aggregating response to arachidonic acid and augmented expression of GPIb, fibrinogen, factor V, and anionic phospholipids by flow cytometry (p < 0.05). Clot firmness and procoagulant activity of platelet-associated tissue factor were also significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Studies with circulating blood revealed increased fibrin formation in early diagnosed patients (71.1 ± 9.5% vs. 45.8 ± 5.3%; p < 0.05 vs. controls). After 24 weeks of treatment with escitalopram, the majority of the alterations observed were normalized, except for a residual increased expression of GPIIbIIIa (p < 0.05) and persistent alterations in thromboelatometic parameters.

Limitations

Despite the reduced number of followed-up patients our findings were consistent reaching statistical significance.

Conclusions

Our results reveal a prothrombotic phenotype in MDD patients. While continuous treatment with an SSRI downregulated the majority of the biomarkers analyzed, alterations in viscoelastic parameters of clot formation remained unaffected by the antidepressant treatment.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^113FjFtU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of our study could lend support to either hypothesis of clinical relevance. The role of platelets in arterial thrombosis is well established, and platelets have long been a proven drug target for secondary CVD prevention and management. Thus, it follows that the antiplatelet effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs could lead to improvements in cardiovascular health. Given that CVD and depression are often comorbid, adding a serotonin‐affecting AD to the regimen of those at high risk for thrombosis may bear parallels to dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and an ADP inhibitor, which has been found to decrease the risk of secondary cardiovascular events when compared with aspirin alone. Conversely, it is intuitive that inhibiting platelets too much could eventually lead to adverse bleeding. Use of aspirin in primary prevention has grown out of favor in recent years. Still, whether aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy combinations are applied in primary or secondary prevention, our results suggest there could be synergistic pharmacodynamic effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs with these medications that might be beneficial in patients at high risk for thrombosis, while also potentially increasing the likelihood of bleeding outcomes, a trade‐off that might not be overall favorable in low‐risk individuals. While it is unlikely that SSRIs significantly increase the risk of bleeding in the general population, those at a higher risk for bleeding may benefit more from a nonserotonergic AD such as the NDRI bupropion, which has been shown to be well tolerated and which seemed to exert minimal effects on platelets in our study. Overall, future large‐scale, comprehensively controlled studies of serotonin‐affecting AD use and both bleeding and cardiovascular event risk, respectively, are needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of serotonin‐affecting AD's antiplatelet effects.

### Antiplatelet drugs: weighing risks and benefits… [^117AmwEj]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Of course, these applications and benefits of antiplatelet medications must be weighed and personalized against the risk of harm to the patient. Common contraindications to use of antiplatelet medications include a thrombocytopenia, a history of intracranial hemorrhage, esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer disease. Treatment with aspirin alone increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease. This risk is increased in patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy, and screening for. H. pylori infection; use of steroids, anticoagulants, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; and recent falls. The risk of major bleeding with aspirin alone is approximately 0. 6%. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding appears to be similar between aspirin and clopidogrel monotherapy. In patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, co-therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor is recommended.

Several calculators are available to help assess risk of major bleeding in patients taking antiplatelet medications. The S2TOP-BLEED score may be used to estimate bleeding risk and has been validated for use in patients with noncardioembolic stroke or cardiovascular disease. The S2TOP-BLEED score considers a patient's age, sex, smoking status, type of antiplatelet regimen, prior stroke history, body mass index, blood pressure, history of diabetes, modified Rankin score, and race. A patient's S2TOP-BLEED score is compared with their age on a table to estimate the patient's 3-year risk of major bleeding. DAPT combines aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor. Current indications for short-term DAPT include following acute coronary syndrome, transient ischemic attack, or stroke.

Long-term DAPT is typically not recommended. The DAPT score is validated for estimating bleeding risk in patients following coronary stent placement and consideration of DAPT. In general, a 40% to 50% increased relative risk of major and minor bleeding is found for patients on DAPT compared with those on single antiplatelet therapy. This translates to a 0. 6% to
2. 0% increased absolute risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Sign up to receive twice monthly emails from.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^113FRwMe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

We further found that, in contrast to benzodiazepine exposure during ACS, exposure to morphine and β‐blockers and current use of antidepressants was not significantly associated with the development of PTSS. This is consistent with the available evidence from randomized controlled trials on early pharmacotherapy in survivors of noncardiac trauma. 22, 23, 42 However, such studies are rare, precluding meta‐analysis on effects of morphine, 42 which reduced PTSD incidence in civilian and military patients, 18, 19 but may delay onset of action of oral antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS. 43 In addition, only propranolol was tested, 23 a lipophilic and nonselective β‐blocker, able to cross the blood‐brain barrier and to block traumatic memory consolidation, 44 but not administered during ACS. Interestingly, metoprolol, which is also lipophilic but a selective β1‐adrenoreceptor antagonist, was previously suggested to have fear‐reducing properties after trauma. 45 In a previous study, patients exposed to β‐blockers during emergency department evaluation for ACS had less severe PTSS at 1 month, although not the subgroup with confirmed ACS, and, unfortunately, the types of used β‐blockers were unknown. 24 Previous trials with escitalopram were not prevention, but early treatment, trials, 46, 47 and our patients were taking antidepressants yet before MI, pointing to the vulnerable health of this small subgroup. Specifically, current use of antidepressants was associated with a history of lifetime depression, poorer self‐rated health, and negative mood. The rate of almost 30% of preexisting depression in our study participants is consistent with other cardiovascular literature. 48 The low number of patients with current use of antidepressants, and the high number exposed to morphine and metoprolol during ACS as well, made it difficult to find a significant group difference for the development of PTSS. Clearly, we would need randomized controlled trials to demonstrate potentially preventive effects of early pharmacotherapy on the development of ACS‐induced PTSS if cardiovascular adverse effects of drug candidates will not prohibit this.

### Association of platelet function with depression and its treatment with sertraline in patients with chronic kidney disease: analysis of a randomized trial [^114kpjeh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Second, we did not observe a sertraline effect on plasma markers of platelet activation or platelet aggregation after 12 weeks of treatment in CKD patients with depression, except for a small negative correlation between sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline serum levels and ATP secretion in response to thrombin. In vitro studies analyzing effects of another SSRI medication, citalopram, on isolated platelets reported minimal inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, collagen and ADP. In a non-randomized clinical trial of 19 MDD patients compared to 20 healthy controls, 24-weeks of therapy with escitalopram did not change platelet aggregability or clot firmness. A subgroup analysis of the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Trial (SADHART) was the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial that reported 24 weeks of treatment with sertraline, vs. placebo, was associated with a decrease in serum markers of platelet activation (P-selectin and β-TG) in 64 patients with MDD and acute coronary syndrome. Another subgroup analysis of the same study in 26 patients demonstrated negative correlations between plasma levels of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline and platelet activation markers. In our study, we not only measured circulating plasma levels of P-selectin and E-selectin, but also performed a comprehensive panel of whole blood platelet aggregometry and ATP secretion to various agonists before and after sertraline treatment in a CLIA-certified coagulation reference laboratory. Our study adds to the findings of previous reports in a larger sample size using randomization and blinding to report no major differences in platelet function and aggregation in patients with CKD and MDD after 12 weeks of sertraline therapy. Importantly, it is the first study to report treatment effects of an SSRI on platelet function in a CKD sample.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) bleeding risk: considerations for the consult-liaison psychiatrist [^116VjbZo]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To present a clinically oriented review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-related bleeding issues commonly addressed by consult-liaison psychiatrists.

Recent Findings

Concomitant medical, surgical, or hospital-based conditions exacerbate the risk of SSRI-related bleeding even though a review of the literature suggests it is only marginally elevated. Psychiatrists and other clinicians need to consider these conditions along with antidepressant benefits when answering the question: to start, hold, continue, or change the antidepressant? Where an evidence base is limited, mechanistic understanding may help consult-liaison psychiatrists navigate this terrain and collaborate with other medical specialties on responsible antidepressant management. Most often, the risk is cumulative; data are not directly applicable to complex clinical situations. This review incorporates a hematologic perspective and approach to bleeding risk assessment along with extant data on SSRI-induced bleeding risk ad specific medical conditions.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^114UGMNV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Past research has shown positive associations between depression and platelet reactivity, and negative associations between antidepressant use and platelet reactivity. These studies, however, have predominantly been performed in small sample sizes and have utilized heterogenous platelet function assays, leading to inconsistent results.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Our study looked at the effects of depression and antidepressant use, respectively, on platelet reactivity using five distinct platelet function assays across multiple agonists in a large sample size.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Our study shows that antidepressants, particularly those affecting the serotonergic system, have a clear inhibitory effect on platelets in a large, predominantly healthy population. These results spanned multiple platelet reactivity traits derived from a range of platelet agonists. The strongest result of serotonin drugs associating with decreased thromboxane receptor activation was replicated in a distinct Hispanic population. We also show significant associations in an aspirin‐taking subset indicating a synergistic platelet inhibitory effect with concurrent antidepressant and aspirin use. Future researchers employing platelet assays should account for antidepressant use as well as other antiplatelet medications.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Our results indicate that the antiplatelet effect of serotonin‐affecting antidepressants may increase the risk of adverse bleeding or decrease the risk of thrombosis. These results may inform future prospective studies of antidepressant use and bleeding, and thrombotic events, respectively, and may ultimately suggest platelet function testing in clinic for prescription and monitoring of antidepressants.

### Paroxetine [^111hxRAE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine, should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

### Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in people aged 20–64 years: cohort study using a primary care database [^114atFvQ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate associations between each of the outcomes and antidepressant drug exposure, using robust standard errors to allow for clustering of patients within practices and excluding patients from the analysis if they had the outcome recorded at baseline. The main analyses were based on the first 5 years of follow-up after study entry. We selected 5 years of follow-up for the main analyses as this includes periods of long-term treatment and allows more events to accrue to increase the power of the study compared with a shorter period. Patients prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors at any time were excluded from the analyses due to small numbers.

The analysis calculated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) by antidepressant class treated as a time-varying exposure to allow for patients starting and stopping and also changing between treatments during follow-up. The reference category for these analyses was no current use of antidepressant treatment. This category included both unexposed time in patients treated with antidepressants at other time points during follow-up, as well as unexposed time from the group of patients who did not receive any prescriptions for antidepressants during follow-up. In an additional analysis we used treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the reference category. We used Wald's significance tests to identify significant differences between the antidepressant classes.

Analyses were also performed for antidepressant dose with separate dose categories within each class (≤ 0.5, > 0.5 and ≤ 1.0, and > 1.0 defined daily doses). We carried out tests for trend for each class using dose as a continuous variable. Analyses were performed for time-varying exposures of time since starting treatment (categorised as no use, 1–28 days, 29–84 days, 85 or more days) and since stopping (1–28 days, 29–84 days and 85–182 days after stopping treatment) within each antidepressant class. The 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants were also analysed separately, first using periods of time with no antidepressant treatment as the reference category then using citalopram (the most commonly prescribed antidepressant) as the reference category, and we used Wald's significance tests to identify significant differences between these 11 drugs. We tested for interactions between antidepressant class and age and also for the upper gastrointestinal bleed outcome we tested for interactions between antidepressant class and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin. We assessed the proportional hazards assumption using log minus log plots.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reduce P2Y12 receptor-mediated amplification of platelet aggregation [^114fF2ax]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to reduce platelet aggregation induced by ADP. ADP induces platelet aggregation through two purinergic receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12. We characterized the inhibitory properties of SSRIs on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and investigated the effects of SSRIs on the signaling pathways downstream of P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors. Specific antagonists were used to evaluate which purinergic receptor-mediated aggregation was influenced by SSRIs. The primary phase of ADP-induced aggregation was not inhibited by citalopram. Citalopram failed to influence ADP-induced platelet shape change, intracellular calcium mobilization and the early phosphorylation of PKCα. Differently, citalopram inhibited the secondary phase of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. Other SSRIs, including fluoxetine and sertraline, exhibited the same anti-platelet effects. Under P2Y1 blockade, citalopram inhibited platelet aggregation and integrin αIIbβ3 activation in response to ADP, indicating that citalopram inhibited P2Y12-mediated aggregation. Citalopram concentration-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3β, p38 MAPK and Syk induced by ADP, but showed no effect on the decrease of cAMP and VASP phosphorylation. With integrin αIIbβ3 blockade, however, the phosphorylation of Akt triggered by ADP was unaltered by the addition of citalopram. Taken together, under the stimulation of ADP, SSRIs inhibit the amplification of platelet aggregation secondary to the activation of P2Y12 receptor, and subsequently reduce the activation of the downstream molecules of the outside-in signaling pathways.

### Effect of antidepressants and their relative affinity for the serotonin transporter on the risk of myocardial infarction [^117NDJ2B]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), attenuate platelet activation by depleting serotonin storage and may decrease risk of myocardial infarction (MI). These drugs differ in their affinity for the platelet serotonin transporter and therefore may vary in their effects on MI protection.

Methods and Results

A case-control study of first MI in patients aged 40 through 75 years was conducted among 36 hospitals in a 5-county area during a 3-year period. Case subjects were patients hospitalized with a first MI, and control subjects were randomly selected from the same geographic area. Detailed information regarding medication use and other clinical and demographic data were obtained by telephone interview. Among the 1080 cases and 4256 controls who participated, there were 223 users of antidepressants with high serotonin transporter affinity, all of which were SSRIs (paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline). After adjustment with multivariable logistic regression for age, gender, race, education, physical activity, quantity of cigarettes smoked per day, body mass index, aspirin use, family history of MI, and history of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, the odds ratio for MI among current users of antidepressants with high serotonin transporter affinity compared with nonusers was 0.59 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.91; P = 0.02). Increasing serotonin transporter affinity was associated with reduced odds of MI among users of all SSRIs (P for trend < 0.01) but not tricyclic (P = 0.77) or atypical (P = 0.70) antidepressants. There was no association detected between non-SSRI antidepressant use and MI.

Conclusions

Increasing serotonin transporter affinity correlates with greater MI protection with SSRI but not other antidepressant exposure.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113mzgZd]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — procedural checklist for managing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional techniques outlines patient evaluation of risk factors (age, diabetes, bleeding disorders, hypertension, obesity, low body weight, renal disease, low creatinine clearance) and identification of antithrombotic medications. Aspirin use is classified as "Primary Prophylaxis: Absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor" and "Secondary Prophylaxis: Presence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease", with the same primary/secondary categories listed for fish oil. The medication inventory includes antiplatelets (clopidogrel [Plavix], prasugrel [Effient], ticagrelor [Brilinta]); direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (dabigatran [Pradaxa], apixaban [Eliquis], rivaroxaban [Xarelto], edoxaban [Savaysa, Lixiana]); warfarin (Coumadin); identification of over-the-counter drugs influencing thrombolysis (garlic, vitamin E); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram [Celexa], fluoxetine [Prozac], escitalopram [Lexapro], paroxetine [Paxil], sertraline [Zoloft]); and NSAIDs. Subsequent steps include risk stratification and recommendations (low risk, moderate or intermediate risk, high risk), informed decision making, restarting of drugs, and postoperative monitoring.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^114D3f6y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Depressive symptomology

We quantified depressive symptomology using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES‐D) scale. Briefly, the CES‐D is a self‐report survey consisting of 20 questions, answered on a Likert scale, relating to depressive mood. The survey is scored on a range of 0 to 60.

Past studies have established the CES‐D as a valid method of analyzing depressive symptoms in epidemiological studies, including with Latino populations. Scoring guidelines suggest that an individual scoring ≥ 16 is at risk for clinical depression, and this threshold was used to categorize "depression". Similarly, we analyzed "severe depression" as a those scoring ≥ 21.

Aspirin use

Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) with arachidonic acid (AA) agonist stimulation is a highly sensitive means of detecting aspirin use, as aspirin takers generally do not reach > 20% final aggregation on the LTA‐AA assay, and nonaspirin takers generally do not score < 60% final aggregation. Thus, we utilized a liberal threshold of 40% final aggregation on the LTA‐AA assay to define aspirin use in our study (Figure S1). Where individual LTA‐AA participant data were unavailable, we utilized the Multiplate AA/Aspi assay at the manufacturer recommended cutoff of 40 area under the time‐aggregation curve (AUC) aggregation for defining aspirin use, or self‐report. Only self‐report of regular (daily or weekly) aspirin use was available for the BPRHS. Many past studies have implicated aspirin as having a major effect on platelet assays. In models of aspirin effects alone, assays dependent upon endogenous generation, such as AA or low concentrations of ADP, are strongly suppressed by aspirin use; activators such as TRAP‐6 (thrombin receptor activating peptide‐6), and high concentrations of agonists like ADP, or the thromboxane A2–mimetic U46619 are less affected (Table S3). Because of these effects, we adjusted for aspirin use in our analyses.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^116KBQLW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conversely, our study presents many strengths in the field of platelet function testing. We analyzed platelet activation and reactivity traits spanning multiple assays, agonists, and in the context of both whole blood and platelet‐rich plasma, which allows insight into the antiplatelet mechanisms at play in serotonin‐affecting AD therapy. Additionally, we present a large sample size consisting of predominantly healthy middle‐aged individuals, which may be well generalizable to the overall population. While our study results show clear antiplatelet effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs, the average age of participants is still somewhat low to analyze clinical associations such as bleeding or cardiovascular events; thus, future examinations of the Generation 3 and NOS cohorts of the FHS research on serotonin‐affecting AD use and risk of bleeding and cardiovascular event, respectively, may allow better understanding of the clinical significance of serotonin‐affecting AD antiplatelet effects and may ultimately support clinical platelet function testing in prescribing and monitoring ADs.

### Platelet / endothelial biomarkers in depressed patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline after acute coronary events: the sertraline antiDepressant heart attack randomized trial (SADHART) platelet substudy [^1165w4yZ]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression after acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) has been identified as an independent risk factor for subsequent cardiac death. Enhanced platelet activation has been hypothesized to represent 1 of the mechanisms underlying this association. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to inhibit platelet activity. Whether treatment of depressed post-ACS patients with SSRIs alters platelet function was not known. Accordingly, we serially assessed the release of established platelet/endothelial biomarkers in patients treated with sertraline vs placebo in the Sertraline AntiDepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART).

Methods and Results

Plasma samples (baseline, week 6, and week 16) were collected from patients randomized to sertraline (n = 28) or placebo (n = 36). Anticoagulants, aspirin, and ADP-receptor inhibitors were permitted in this study. Platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, P-selectin, thromboxane B2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1a, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured by ELISA. Treatment with sertraline was associated with substantially less release of platelet/endothelial biomarkers than was treatment with placebo. These differences attained statistical significance for betaTG (P = 0.03) at weeks 6 and 16 and for P-selectin (P = 0.04) at week 16. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant advantage for sertraline vs placebo for diminishing E-selectin and betaTG concentrations across the entire treatment period.

Conclusions

Treatment with sertraline in depressed post-ACS patients is associated with reductions in platelet/endothelial activation despite coadministration of widespread antiplatelet regimens including aspirin and clopidogrel. The antiplatelet and endothelium-protective properties of SSRIs might represent an attractive additional advantage in patients with depression and comorbid coronary artery and/or cerebrovascular disease.

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of abnormal bleeding [^115jQ9F3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) increase the risk of abnormal bleeding by lowering platelet serotonin and hence the efficiency of platelet-driven hemostasis; by increasing gastric acidity and possibly gastric ulceration; and by other mechanisms. The upper gastrointestinal tract is the commonest site of SRI-related abnormal bleeding; bleeding at this location may be increased by concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and by treatment with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Bleeding at this location may be reduced by concurrent administration of acid-suppressing drugs.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^112By7Sa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antidepressant medications are among the most frequently prescribed class of drugs worldwide, with up to 19% of individuals aged 60 years or older in the US reporting use of an antidepressant over the past 30 days. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely used antidepressant medications and are often recommended over other classes of antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder due to their comparable efficacy and favorable safety profile. However, SSRIs have been shown to increase the risk of major bleeding, possibly owing to their inhibition of platelet activation during hemostasis. Although the absolute risk remains low for most individuals who use SSRIs, coprescription with drugs such as oral anticoagulants (OACs) may be consequential. Concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs is common given the prevalence of mental health disorders.

Some observational studies have assessed the association between concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs and the risk of major bleeding. However, some had notable limitations, including exposure misclassification, possible informative censoring, residual confounding, and limited statistical power. Gaps in evidence that may inform the coprescription of SSRIs and OACs include whether the risk varies with demographic or clinical characteristics or between direct OACs (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In addition, data on the risk of specific types of major bleeding are limited.

To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a population-based, nested case-control study to assess whether the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs was associated with the risk of major bleeding compared with OAC use alone among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We also assessed whether the risk varied by duration of use, relevant demographic and other risk factors, potency of SSRIs, and OAC type.

### Increased platelet aggregability in major depression? [^114G95ng]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

There is compelling evidence that depression constitutes an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As exaggerated platelet reactivity is associated with an increased risk of intra-arterial thrombus formation, we studied platelet aggregability in patients with major depression both before and after 5 weeks of anti-depressant therapy as well as in healthy control subjects. Twenty-two depressed patients and 24 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Washed and rediluted platelets were stimulated with the agonists collagen and thrombin in three concentration steps. Depression was associated with a higher aggregability after stimulation with thrombin in the intermediate concentration and with collagen at the low concentration, with ceiling effects for the other concentrations. After 5 weeks of anti-depressant therapy, aggregability was somewhat less exaggerated, although this effect did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that major depression is associated with increased platelet aggregability, which seems to persist even under a marked improvement in depressive symptomatology. This effect may contribute to the increased cardiovascular morbidity in depressed patients.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116WUQeu]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with oral anticoagulants — bleeding risk: Concomitant use of SSRIs and oral anticoagulants was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, with risk peaking early and persisting for months; in the cited large study there were 42,190 patients with major bleeding, and an association was also present with SSRIs and DOACs. The authors concluded that such concomitant use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding compared with oral anticoagulant use alone, "requiring close monitoring and management of risk factors for bleeding, particularly in the first few months of use".

### Decreased serotonin content and reduced agonist-induced aggregation in platelets of patients chronically medicated with SSRI drugs [^117QzogW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reduces the risk and severity of cardiovascular diseases. SSRIs block the serotonin transporter, thereby inhibiting serotonin (5-HT) uptake into presynaptic neurons as well as into platelets where 5-HT is stored in dense granules. When 5-HT is released in response to agonists it enhances platelet aggregation induced by injury-related signals. Chronic administration of SSRIs may thus reduce platelet aggregability secondary to depletion of platelets' serotonin stores.

Methods

The study included ten DSM-IV-TR major depression (MDD) and four obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and fourteen healthy untreated age- and sex-matched controls. The patients were chronically medicated (6–108 months) with various SSRIs. Platelet serotonin content was assessed in fresh samples of platelet rich plasma (PRP) using radioimmunoassay. ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid and epinephrine were used as inducers of platelet aggregation measured in PRP by turbometric method in a microplate reader.

Results

Lower platelet serotonin content (66%; p < 0.05) and lower ADP, collagen or epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation (10–52%; p < 0.05) were detected in PRP of SSRI-medicated patients, while no such effect was obtained with arachidonic acid.

Limitations

The small sample size and the co-treatment with non-SSRI drugs such as benzodiazepines.

Conclusion

Patients chronically medicated with SSRIs exhibit lower platelet 5-HT content and reduced platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and epinephrine, but not by arachidonic acid. Our observations may explain the increased bleeding risk associated with chronic SSRI treatment as well as the reported beneficial effect of SSRIs in prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction.

5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine, should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine tablet or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

### Association between antidepressant use and ED or hospital visits in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 [^111G9PB1]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In contrast, no dose-response effect was observed in this cohort when the SSRIs were stratified according to their level of S1R affinity. The relatively high adjusted odds ratio for the one S1R antagonist, sertraline, suggests it may be less protective than other SSRIs; however, the confidence intervals for all SSRI odds ratios overlap, and therefore, the strengths of the effects cannot be distinguished. Although the S1R-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of fluvoxamine have been studied in some detail, the effects of other SSRIs on the S1R are not as well understood. Additionally, the beneficial effects of SSRIs and non-SSRI agents with serotonin antagonism may be time-dependent in COVID-19, owing to their diverse anti-platelet and serotonin modulating properties. On one hand, early or pre-illness use of SSRIs may be beneficial by diminishing the degree of serotonin loading onto mature platelets during the viral replication phase, before the onset of severe platelet activation and pathogenic platelet mediator release that are hallmarks of the inflammatory phase in COVID-19. Thus, early or pre-illness SSRI use preemptively reduces a key content of platelet granules, serotonin, which is demonstrated to cause pathogenicity in illnesses driven by immune-mediated platelet activation and also drives immunothrombosis in severe COVID-19. On the other hand, the direct serotonin receptor inhibitory effects of some SSRIs and non-SSRI agents (e.g. bupropion) may be beneficial even after the inflammatory phase has begun, by inhibiting the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory action of released serotonin from severely activated platelets in this illness. Further research is necessary to explore the optimal timing of treatment with serotonin modulating agents. If antidepressants are demonstrated to have multiple modalities of action as discussed above, their benefit may not be limited to a specific phase of illness, unlike antivirals (best if given in the first 5 days of symptoms) and systemic steroids (if given too early, could suppress the appropriate immune response to the virus).

### Association of platelet function with depression and its treatment with sertraline in patients with chronic kidney disease: analysis of a randomized trial [^111z1KtX]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, depressive symptoms did not correlate with platelet aggregability or function, and treatment of MDD with sertraline did not change platelet function in patients with CKD and MDD. In addition, heightened ADP-induced platelet aggregability was observed in CKD patients as compared to controls with normal kidney function, regardless of presence of comorbid MDD. These findings suggest that increased platelet activation may not be the major contributory underlying mechanism by which depression may lead to worse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. Future studies should include positive MDD controls without CKD to confirm our findings.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^114VRLUT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to bleeding risk, the antiplatelet effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs have driven the theory that these drugs may be beneficial to cardiovascular health through a decrease in thrombotic risk. The literature in this realm to date, however, has been inconsistent. While some studies have found SSRIs to decrease the risk of myocardial infarction and overall cardiovascular mortality, others have found no significant differences, even increased risk of thrombotic events, or mixed risk with protection against stroke but not myocardial infarction (MI). Differences in study design (case/control, event definition) and risk factor stratification may account for some of the discrepancies. Once again, depression as an affective disorder adds complexity to past results, as the improvement of mood by SSRIs, or underlying concurrent depression, may be driving cardiovascular associations through lifestyle factors instead of antiplatelet effects. Recently, a large study of 24,155 MI cases and 120,776 controls in a primary healthcare database found significant protective effects against MI in users of SSRIs (adjusted odds ratio 0.86), and reported the first association of trazodone (SARI) being protective for MI (adjusted odds ratio 0.76). This study suggests that at typical low doses of trazodone, where serotonin transport is less inhibited, there could be direct antithrombotic effects via antagonism of the 5‐HT2A receptor, which is known to be expressed and functional on the platelet membrane. In our study, we found a suggestive pattern of association of SARI use (n = 50), all in the direction of platelet reactivity inhibition, with similar or stronger effect sizes observed as with SSRIs (n = 362). This suggests with a larger sample of individuals taking SARIs the associations likely would have reached stringent significance and supports the possibility of multiple distinct influences of serotonin‐influencing medications on platelet reactivity that may ultimately contribute to bleeding and thrombotic risks.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^113xVwNi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternative mechanisms of serotonin‐affecting drugs' platelet inhibitory effect have also been explored. In an in vitro platelet study, the SSRI citalopram was found to inhibit platelet aggregation, adhesion, and thromboxane A2 production in response to both collagen and U46619 through mechanisms other than serotonin transport blockade. In a follow‐up study, two novel mechanisms for citalopram‐induced platelet inhibition were found: inhibition of the calcium and diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor‐1 (CalDAG‐GEFI)–mediated Rap1‐GTP formation, which facilitates fibrinogen crosslinking by turning integrin αIIb‐ßIII into its high affinity state, and competitive antagonism of the FcRϒ‐chain of the GPVI receptor. The concentration of citalopram needed to observe these effects, however, was much higher than what would be seen physiologically, leading the authors to conclude that it is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Still, it is possible that these mechanisms exert small effects in our study results. The CalDAG‐GEFI–mediated formation of GTP‐Rap1 is upregulated by a rise in cytosolic calcium ion, a shared downstream effect of many different platelet agonists. Considering that we observed traits induced by many different agonists to be negatively affected by serotonin‐affecting drugs, including strong platelet agonists such as ristocetin and collagen, it is possible that a broader mechanism, such as reduction in CalDAG‐GEFI–mediated GTP exchange, is also at play. Similarly, multiple statistically significant negative associations with collagen agonism suggests the possibility of competitive antagonism of SSRIs on GPVI. Extrapolation of these studies to our results, however, should be taken with caution as it is most likely, given the difference in strength of results, that most of the effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs on platelets is due to depletion of serotonin stores and attenuated secondary amplification of platelet activation.

### Association of platelet function with depression and its treatment with sertraline in patients with chronic kidney disease: analysis of a randomized trial [^1157SExa]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are independent risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) events, such as heart attack, stroke, and death. MDD is more prevalent among patients with CKD as compared to the general population, such that nearly 25% of CKD patients are affected with MDD. Heightened platelet reactivity and excessive stickiness of endothelial cells to platelets are important potential mechanisms for this excessive CV risk, as supported by studies reporting elevated plasma levels of platelet and endothelial activation markers (i.e. beta-thromboglobulin [β-TG], platelet factor 4 [PF4], P-selectin and E-selectin) and increased platelet aggregability in individuals with CKD, as well as in those with MDD. Limited data also suggest that treatment of MDD with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce platelet aggregation and activation markers, primarily in individuals with coronary artery disease.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^115vdDCe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

While it seems clear that serotonin transporter (SERT)–acting drugs inhibit platelets, research on the clinical significance of such inhibition is much less concordant. There are two primary implications regarding the platelet inhibitory effect of serotonin‐affecting ADs in the clinic. The first is that serotonin‐affecting ADs, most commonly SSRIs, can increase the risk of adverse bleeding. In a recent meta‐analysis of bleeding risk pertaining to SSRI use, SSRIs were associated with a 41% and 36% increase of bleeding in case‐control studies and cohort studies, respectively. This increased risk was associated with concurrent nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug use and found to be mainly gastrointestinal (GI)‐related. However, an odds ratio of 1.16 was observed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a serious adverse bleeding event. It is important to note that many of the studies included in this meta‐analysis were comprised of high‐risk populations, such as surgical patients, who are more prone to bleeds. Additionally, SSRIs have been implicated in higher risk for endoscopic mucosal injuries and GI duodenal perforation when used in combination with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, which may suggest that the increased risk of GI bleeds with SSRI treatment is not entirely antiplatelet in nature, but rather due in part to GI toxicity. Another interesting critique of past studies citing increased risk of bleeding on SSRIs, particularly in the context of ICH, is the extent to which covariates are adjusted for. In a study which adjusted for many covariates, including the concurrent diagnosis of depression, no association was found between ICH and SSRI use, suggesting that depression's link to unfavorable lifestyle factors such as lack of adherence to medical treatment, lack of exercise, poor diet, or increased risk of alcohol and drug use may have confounded past positive association results with ICH in SSRI users.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^112To5Va]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) after stroke — time to effect, dosing, adverse effects, patient preferences, and evidence quality are summarized as follows: Interim analyses showed improvement at day 30 and day 45, but differences were not statistically significant until day 90, and if a significant motor benefit occurs it likely takes at least three months; studies were relatively short (three to six months), making durability of FMA score benefit difficult to assess. Maintenance doses were relatively low (fluoxetine 20 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day) and within safe dosing limits for adults older than 60. Adverse events data were mixed: one review did not report significant differences versus placebo, while another reported higher incidence in the fluoxetine group than placebo of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01), seizure (OR: 1.46), and fracture (OR: 2.34). A rare but serious adverse effect is bleeding when combined with antithrombotic therapy; assessment of risk should be made, particularly if the patient is on an antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or both. More common (at least 10% reported incidence) but less serious side effects include insomnia, anxiety, headache, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and dry mouth. Patient preferences vary; some might already be prescribed an SSRI or be candidates for an antidepressant and might be able to obtain two benefits from one medication, whereas others might wish to avoid an antidepressant due to stigma or might not prefer adding another oral medication; SSRIs are prescription medications but are easily accessible because many providers are familiar with their use. The evidence for this recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low with limitations including small sample size and short duration.

### Inhibition of serotonin reuptake by antidepressants and cerebral microbleeds in the general population [^115SDPNL]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants decrease platelet aggregation. This may cause an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the risk of subclinical microbleeds, which are highly prevalent in middle-aged and elderly people, is unknown. We studied whether serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants increase the frequency of cerebral microbleeds and secondarily whether they lower the presence of ischemic vascular damage.

Methods

Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, information on antidepressant use was obtained from continuously monitored pharmacy records. Brain MRI was available in 4945 participants (55% women, mean age 64 years) between 2005 and 2011. We categorized antidepressants based on affinity for the serotonin transporter: high, intermediate, or low. Microbleeds (presence and location) and ischemic lesions (lacunes, white matter lesions) were rated on MRI. Logistic and linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, depressive symptoms, and cardiovascular risk were used to study the association of antidepressants with microbleeds and ischemic vascular lesions.

Results

Antidepressant use with strong serotonin reuptake inhibition was not associated with microbleed presence (odds ratio compared with nonuse, 1.03; confidence interval, 0.75–1.39) irrespective of microbleed location in the brain. Exclusion of antithrombotic users or persons with cortical infarcts did not change our results. Furthermore, serotonin reuptake inhibition was not related to ischemic vascular brain damage.

Conclusions

In the general population, use of serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants is not related to presence of cerebral microbleeds. This strengthens the idea that the platelet inhibitor effects of antidepressant drugs with affinity for serotonin are minimal and further supports the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for nongastrointestinal bleedings.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (citalopram) [^112iFyGV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Serotonergic Drugs: See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

Triptans

There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome).

CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.

Alcohol - Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking citalopram is not recommended.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) - See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) - Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when citalopram is initiated or discontinued.

### Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111x5nbx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat various psychiatric disorders. However, there are concerns that SSRIs increase the risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies to determine whether SSRI use affects the risk for UGIB. Our analysis included all observational studies that compared UGIB development among patients receiving SSRIs vs no treatment. We calculated pooled odds ratios using random- and fixed-effects models.

Results

A total of 22 studies (6 cohort and 16 case-control studies) involving more than 1,073,000 individuals were included in our meta-analysis. In comparing SSRI users with patients who had not taken SSRIs, the odds for developing UGIB were 1.55-fold higher (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.35–1.78). In subgroup analyses, the association was greatest for patients who received concurrent therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet drugs; we found no significant increase in the risk of developing UGIB among patients receiving concurrent acid-suppressing drugs.

Conclusions

SSRI use was associated with an almost 2-fold increase in the risk of developing UGIB, especially among patients at high risk for GI bleeding (concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or antiplatelet drugs). This risk might be reduced significantly by concomitant use of acid-suppressing drugs.

5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including citalopram tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with citalopram tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of undiagnosed patients treated with citalopram tablets. Prior to initiating treatment with citalopram tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.6 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Can we recommend mirtazapine and bupropion for patients at risk for bleeding? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114isYC5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Mirtazapine and bupropion, which commonly lack serotonin reuptake inhibition, have been recommended as alternatives for patients who are at risk for bleeding. However, the evidence for these recommendations is insufficient.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search, systematic review, and meta-analysis to investigate an evidence-based approach for the bleeding risks of mirtazapine and bupropion. From 1946 to May 2017, a total of 3981 studies were searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Among the studies, two independent reviewers selected studies per predefined eligibility criteria.

Results

A total of five meta-analyses were conducted. Patients taking mirtazapine were at a greater risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01–1.38) than those who did not take antidepressants. No differences were observed in the bleeding risk between mirtazapine and SSRI or between bupropion and SSRI.

Limitations

The number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that it is premature to recommend mirtazapine and bupropion for patients who have a bleeding risk. More studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-ups are warranted.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — fluvoxamine for ambulatory patients: Recommendation 26 states, "Among ambulatory patients with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel recommends fluvoxamine only in the context of a clinical trial. (Knowledge gap)". Section status notes "Section last reviewed and updated 11/8/2021" and "Last literature search conducted 10/31/2021", with the additional note that "There will be no continuous literature search or review for recommendation(s) within this section". Rationale describes that "Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder", that "SSRIs have been shown to have affinity for Sigma-1 receptors" and "pharmacologic agents that act at Sigma-1 receptors have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2", and that "Amongst the SSRIs, fluvoxamine has been shown to have the high affinity for these receptors making it a potential repurposed drug option for the management of COVID-19". Mechanistic considerations add that "SSRIs like fluvoxamine may decrease uptake of serotonin from platelets during thrombosis, resulting in decreased neutrophil recruitment and platelet aggregation, which may be helpful in the early stages of COVID-19". Evidence summary notes, "Our search identified two RCTs that reported on ambulatory patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection", where "Patients in these studies were randomized to fluvoxamine or placebo/usual care", and "Both trials included symptomatic outpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection within seven days".

### Association of fluvoxamine with mortality and symptom resolution among inpatients with COVID-19 in Uganda: a prospective interventional open-label cohort study [^112HpAah]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The benefits of fluvoxamine as a treatment for COVID-19 are believed to stem from several mechanisms. They include antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects via functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), immunomodulatory activity via sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonism and non-S1R pathways (e.g. NF-κB, inflammasomes, TLR4, PPARγ), and mechanisms related to increased plasma melatonin levels, serotonin modulation, and antiplatelet activity. Specifically, before the COVID-19 pandemic, fluvoxamine showed anti-inflammatory properties in murine models of septic shock, which may be mediated by the S1R pathway of cytokine release. Another mechanism through which the beneficial effects of fluvoxamine could be exerted is the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide (ASM) pathway. Inhibition of the ASM/ceramide system (called FIASMA) by specific antidepressants such as fluvoxamine or fluoxetine prevents infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. The reconstitution of ceramides in cells treated with these specific antidepressants restores the infection. Furthermore, inhibition of ASM in endothelial cells and the immune system may also result in anti-inflammatory effects. These data were reinforced in several other studies. First, several observational cohort studies of patients with COVID-19 reported reduced deaths or use of mechanical ventilation in the acute care setting and reduced risk of emergency department or hospital visits in the ambulatory setting among those taking FIASMA antidepressants versus their counterparts. Second, preclinical studies have demonstrated the in vitro efficacy of several SSRI and non-SSRI FIASMA antidepressants against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 in human and nonhuman host cells. Finally, a recent work supported the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant with FIASMA properties, in a K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its in vitro antiviral activity against different variants of concern, including Omicron BA.5.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^112PSaqE]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The validity of our results is also supported by the observed reduction in the occurrence of new post-stroke depression at 6 months with fluoxetine, which is consistent with its known antidepressant effects and the results of the FLAME trial. A previous systematic review of five randomised controlled trials (two of fluoxetine, two of sertraline, and one of escitalopram), including FLAME, in patients with stroke and no depression tested whether SSRIs prevented the development of post-stroke depression. In a pooled analysis, 23 (9·3%) of 248 patients treated with an SSRI developed post-stroke depression compared with 59 (24·4%) of 242 treated with a placebo (OR 0·37 [95% CI 0·22–0·61]; p = 0·001). The rate of depression in the placebo groups of these trials was much higher than that in FOCUS, which might have reflected the characteristics of the patients (as they tended to have had more severe strokes than those enrolled in FOCUS) or the different methods of diagnosing depression. Although this observation is consistent with our findings in terms of the direction (but not the magnitude) of treatment effect, it does not take into account the possible excess risk of adverse effects (such as bone fractures), which might offset any benefits of reducing the frequency of post-stroke depression.

The observed 1·4% absolute excess risk of bone fractures at 6 months with fluoxetine in FOCUS is also consistent with previous reports from large case-control and cohort studies. The magnitude of the increased risk in previous observational studies tended to be greater than in FOCUS, but this difference might be attributable to the inherent confounding by treatment indication in observational studies. The rates of serious adverse reactions to fluoxetine referred to in the summary of product characteristics, which we included as secondary outcomes in this trial (eg, epileptic seizures, falls, hyponatraemia, uncontrolled diabetes, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding), were higher in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group, but the absolute differences were small and not significant. Despite concerns about the effects of fluoxetine on platelet function and interactions with antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, we observed no effect on bleeding or thrombotic adverse events.

### Antiplatelet effects of antidepressant treatment: a randomized comparison between escitalopram and nortriptyline [^115rhixx]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depressive disorders have been identified as independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. The present study (i) compared platelet function of depressed patients with that of healthy controls, (ii) analysed possible aggregability changes during 3 months of treatment with antidepressants, and (iii) sought to assess different effects of escitalopram and nortriptyline on platelet aggregation.

Methods

Blood samples of 91 major depressed patients and 91 healthy controls were analysed with whole blood aggregometry in a case-control setting. Depressed patients were randomized to two groups treated either with escitalopram (n = 47) or nortriptyline (n = 44). Platelet aggregation was studied on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 84 of continuing medication and was determined in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen.

Results

Platelet aggregation induced by ADP was increased among depressive patients compared with that of healthy controls (26%, p = 0.006). With antidepressant treatment, changes in platelet aggregation remained comparable in both groups at early time points (d1 to 21). In contrast, at day 84, patients with antidepressive response revealed significant differences in both medication groups: Patients receiving escitalopram showed a 23% decrease of ADP induced aggregation (p = 0.03) and a 15% decrease of collagen induced aggregation (p = 0.03). With nortriptyline the increase in impedance was reduced by 29% after ADP induction (p = 0.046).

Conclusion

Depressed patients have higher ex vivo platelet aggregation that may contribute to increased cardiovascular morbidity. After three months of antidepressant treatment with either escitalopram or nortriptyline, platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in antidepressant responders, irrespective of the antidepressant medication type.

### Do SSRIs cause gastrointestinal bleeding? [^115BnJUc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) can inhibit uptake, and therefore storage, of serotonin by platelets. This is significant because release of serotonin from platelets augments their aggregation; so use of SSRIs could, in theory, predispose patients to bleeding disorders. Case reports have suggested a link between SSRIs and easy bruising, nosebleeds, menorrhagia, petechial, ocular, small bowel, rectal and cerebral haemorrhages, and a prolonged bleeding time. Also, the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) for all SSRIs include warnings about use in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or concomitant use with drugs known to affect platelet function. Here we review the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of SSRIs.

### Aspirin decreases the risk of depression in older men with high plasma homocysteine [^113DEZtD]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of over 200 genetic epidemiological studies that correlated strokes with tHcy and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism in 60 000 people found that B-vitamin intake (particularly folate) is unlikely to reduce the risk of subsequent strokes in countries where folate supplementation of wheat is mandatory, suggesting that consumption of these vitamins might fail to reduce the health hazards associated with high tHcy if there is no overt vitamin deficiency. Furthermore, any possible cardiovascular benefit of supplementation with B-vitamins might be entirely overridden by the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy (such as aspirin), suggesting that aspirin consumption may be a more helpful way of modifying the cardiovascular risk associated with high tHcy. This might explain our negative findings regarding the use of B-vitamins and risk of depression, even for older men with high tHcy. Indeed, it is possible that current optimistic views about the potential benefits of B-vitamins for the management of depression may lead to its overuse by people who are experiencing relevant symptoms, thus explaining the increased odds of depression that we observed among B-vitamin consumers (that is, prescription bias).

We have previously argued that the use of aspirin could potentially increase the risk of depression in later life because of bleeding and of other medical complications. That argument did not take into account the potential interaction between aspirin use and high tHcy, which is a well-established risk factor for both cardiovascular diseases and depression. At this point, we can only speculate about the mechanisms by which aspirin modifies the risk of depression in older people with high tHcy. Aspirin might counteract the increased adhesive properties of platelets induced by high tHcyor, alternatively, stimulate the release of monoamines that is partly compromised by dysfunction on one-carbon methylation associated with elevated tHcy. Regardless the physiological pathway, the results of this study indicate that older men with high tHcy who use aspirin have lower risk of depression, and suggest that antiplatelet therapy may be an effective preventive or management strategy for these cases. Randomized trials are required to confirm the antidepressant effect of aspirin in older persons with high tHcy. Future trials should test the efficacy of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy to standard antidepressants, as treatment with aspirin alone would be ethically questionable. No such concerns would limit the design of a placebo-controlled trial of aspirin to prevent depressive episodes in older people with high tHcy, particularly because homocysteine-lowering treatment with B-vitamins seems to have questionable impact on novel cardiovascular events and future depression.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and increased bleeding risk: are we missing something? [^116a1Mbo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first line agents to treat clinical depression. Although these medications exhibit a favorable safety profile, there are multiple case reports, registries, and uncontrolled studies suggesting that use of SSRIs might be associated in the increased risk of bleeding events. There is also emerging evidence that these side effects of SSRIs are due to blockade of serotonin reuptake in platelets and subsequent platelet dysfunction.

Methods

The analysis of evidence linking SSRIs with bleeding episodes to define the prevalence, specific clinical characteristics, and estimated risk when SSRIs are used in combination with antiplatelet agents or/and anticoagulants.

Results

There are over 120 MEDLINE-cited peer-reviewed research papers and more than 50000 Web pages devoted to SSRI-related bleeding events.

Conclusion

Independently of the brand, use of SSRIs is indeed associated with increased bleeding risk. Although such complications are rare, their frequency is growing, and physicians should be aware of SSRI-induced hemorrhages, especially in patients with hereditary platelet defects, and those treated with antiplatelet agents. Prospective studies are urgently needed to determine whether SSRIs will yield additional bleeding risks when used long term concomitantly with aspirin or clopidogrel.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel) [^1173BSRs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inducers

Since clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel.

Rifampin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or Esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Opioids

As with other oral P2Y12inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of clopidogrel, presumably because of slowed gastric emptying, resulting in reduced exposure to its metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists.

7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of clopidogrel and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.5 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitro, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.6 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

### Antidepressants: bleeding or thrombosis? [^113zVVVe]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The contribution of depression to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease includes autonomic disturbances, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, carbohydrate craving, and impaired fibrinolysis. There is evidence that serotonergic antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) restore the fibrinolytic profile. Contrary to common belief, such antidepressants do not affect platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate or adrenaline but reduce platelet adhesion to collagen. Since platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI binds to fibrin, it is possible that fibrinolytic properties of serotonergic antidepressants could impair platelet adhesion to collagen. The profibrinolytic and antiplatelet properties of serotonergic antidepressants help explain the increased risk of gastrointestinal, intracranial, and surgical bleeding in patients using these medications. Studies evaluating the impact of antidepressants on thrombotic and cardiovascular risk have yielded contradictory results. Corroborating the hypothesis that serotonergic antidepressants have profibrinolytic and antiplatelet properties, some authors showed that these medications prevent both cardiovascular and thromboembolic events. Others showed an increased risk of ischemic stroke, cardiac events and thromboembolic disease. Silent brain infarction may present in some elders with depressive symptoms, so it is presumed that antidepressants are prescribed for subclinical stroke patients. Another explanation for the increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events reported by some authors in individuals taking antidepressants includes antidepressant side effects such as sedation and weight gain and depression comorbidities such as anxiety, obesity and hyperhomocysteinemia. In conclusion, we suggest that serotonergic antidepressants be considered weak anticoagulants. We also suggest that depressed patients with comorbidities increasing the risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease be recommended to follow a balanced diet and engage in physical activity, such as daily walking.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^114cnVGT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to investigate the effects of depressive symptomology and AD use, respectively, on platelet function traits derived from many different agonist pathways. We show that AD use, particularly medications affecting the serotonergic system, are strongly associated with multiple platelet aggregation traits in our main sample, and that the effect may further synergistically reduce platelet reactivity in those taking aspirin. This suggests that researchers conducting platelet function tests in nearly all contexts should not only collect and utilize information on direct antiplatelet medications, but also consider antidepressant medications with particular attention to those affecting serotonin biology.

Our results are in line with past research that demonstrated that SSRIs inhibit platelet activation and aggregation to a host of agonists, which is likely due to intraplatelet serotonin depletion. Based on our study, these drugs seem to largely impact weaker platelet agonists such as epinephrine, ADP, and the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 in reaching maximal aggregation potentials normally observed. Although consistent results were observed between ADP for Optimul and LTA, the strongest results were observed overall with Optimul assays. This may be due to technical differences in the assays as previously discussed, due to the fact that LTA only tested single agonist concentrations, whereas Optimul provides a picture across concentration‐response dynamics, and that we did not test U46619 with LTA. Interestingly, U46619 is thought to depend on dense granule release, particularly of ADP, in stimulating platelet aggregation, which suggests that serotonin is also implicated, and dense granule release may be attenuated. Additionally, ADP secondary aggregation and secondary slope at low agonist concentration were significantly reduced in the context of serotonin‐affecting antidepressant drugs. This suggests a need for serotonin in secondary amplification and, given that significant positive associations were found with ADP disaggregation, less stable platelet aggregates are also being formed in individuals taking these medications.

### Geriatric trauma management [^112TCcHL]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults — NSAIDs are known to have increased side effects in the older adult; limit the length of NSAID courses and use the lowest effective dose. Avoid NSAIDs in older adults with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), GI bleeding, platelet dysfunction, reduced cardiac output, hypovolemia, hyponatremia, hepatic impairment, or anticoagulation. Traditional NSAIDs reversibly inhibit platelet function and may alter the cardioprotective effects of aspirin, and their use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants decreases platelet function in an additive manner; an increased risk of gastropathy is present, and pharmacologic gastroprotection is indicated. COX-2 selective agents are not associated with platelet dysfunction, but the patient may need gastroprotection if on concurrent low-dose aspirin.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of upper GI bleeding: confusion or confounding? [^113zC26R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent a relatively new class of antidepressants. Several studies have reported bleeding disorders associated with the use of SSRIs, which are considered the result of a decrease in platelet serotonin leading to a defect in platelet aggregation. To what extent the use of SSRIs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is unclear.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search for studies addressing SSRI use and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (UGIB) was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases with a recursive manual reference search up to May 2005. Any observational and interventional studies were systematically reviewed, and critical appraisal was conducted on available studies.

Results

Published clinical evidence on the relationship between SSRI use and gastrointestinal bleeding is limited to observational studies without any clinical trials. Three cohort studies and one case-control study met inclusion criteria. These studies combined different affinity SSRIs in the class and had differing control groups with conflicting conclusions. Both a cohort study and a case-control study investigating the concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or low-dose aspirin found that combined use with an SSRI increased the risk of UGIB.

Conclusions

Only a few epidemiology studies have investigated the association between SSRIs and UGIB. They provide weak evidence to support the hypothesis of a link between SSRIs and UGIB at a population level. Available evidence shows that concurrent use of NSAIDs or aspirin with SSRIs greatly increases the risk of UGIB. The preventive strategy should be considered in those SSRI users at high risk, especially the elderly or those with a history of UGIB and taking nonselective NSAIDs or aspirin.

### Venous thromboembolism risk with antidepressants: driven by disease or drugs? [^116N8yy8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, the significantly increased VTE risk was observed for antidepressant users regardless of whether they also used other psychotropic drugs. In addition, the type of antidepressant did not seem to make a difference because the increased VTE risk was of similar magnitude for users of tricyclic antidepressants (adjusted HR: 1.32), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR: 1.40), and other antidepressants (HR: 1.61), even though these drugs are pharmacologically distinct. These facts could suggest that increased VTE risk may actually be related to the depression itself and not the treatment. This concept is supported by previous reports of depressive symptoms as a risk factor for recurrent VTE, 2 likely through a prothrombotic platelet phenotype, 3 possibly mediated by platelet‐derived microparticles. 4

Risk‐factor associations like the ones discussed in the present study are important to ascertain, but the authors wisely stopped short of suggesting a causative relationship. It difficult to determine whether depression or antidepressant use drove the increased VTE risk or even if another related factor (eg, thrombophilia traits, use of other recreational or illicit drugs, presence of BDNF Val66met polymorphism leading to combined prothrombotic and depressive traits 5) was the major impetus and caused some women to develop VTE, especially because — as the authors point out — the increased VTE risk was seen across several classes of antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which have been reported to inhibit platelet function. 6, 7, 8 This likely relates to the fact that serotonin is a weak platelet agonist but also potentiates stimulation from ADP or thrombin. 8 When the reuptake of serotonin is blocked, it cannot be replaced within the dense granules of the platelet and thus is not available to augment the activation response 9 or to help retain procoagulant proteins (fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and α2‐antiplasmin) on their surface. 10

### Platelets can enhance vascular permeability [^112MaJWH]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Platelets survey blood vessels, searching for endothelial damage and preventing loss of vascular integrity. However, there are circumstances where vascular permeability increases, suggesting that platelets sometimes fail to fulfill their expected function. Human inflammatory arthritis is associated with tissue edema attributed to enhanced permeability of the synovial microvasculature. Murine studies have suggested that such vascular leak facilitates entry of autoantibodies and may thereby promote joint inflammation. Whereas platelets typically help to promote microvascular integrity, we examined the role of platelets in synovial vascular permeability in murine experimental arthritis. Using an in vivo model of autoimmune arthritis, we confirmed the presence of endothelial gaps in inflamed synovium. Surprisingly, permeability in the inflamed joints was abrogated if the platelets were absent. This effect was mediated by platelet serotonin accumulated via the serotonin transporter and could be antagonized using serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. As opposed to the conventional role of platelets to microvascular leakage, this demonstration that platelets are capable of amplifying and maintaining permeability adds to the rapidly growing list of unexpected functions for platelets.

### A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation and activation [^115YuX5K]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical depression is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and confers an increased risk of mortality. Increased platelet reactivity may predispose depressed patients to cardiovascular diseases. The antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to have cardioprotective effects probably via the attenuation of platelet activation independently in addition to treatment of depression itself. However, the characters of the inhibitory effect of SSRIs on platelets remain largely unknown. Here we show that an SSRI, citalopram, specifically inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Citalopram, however, revealed only little inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, U46619, and ionomycin, and failed to inhibit reversible platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate with fibrinogen. Collagen-induced of αIIbβ3 integrin activation in platelets under a static condition was not influenced by citalopram. Citalopram inhibited convulxin-induced platelet aggregation and αIIbβ3 integrin activation. In the experiments with fibrinogen-induced aggregation in elastase-treated platelets, citalopram inhibited only collagen-induced αIIbβ3 activation but not the binding activities between activated αIIbβ3 integrin and fibrinogen. Moreover, citalopram inhibited α-granule and dense granule secretion from platelets in response to collagen, as determined by a reduced expression of P-selectin and adenosine triphosphate release, respectively. In addition, collagen-induced thromboxane A2 release in platelets was attenuated by citalopram pretreatment. These findings might specify the mechanisms of inhibitory effects of citalopram on collagen mediated platelet activation and aggregation, and further support the cardioprotective effect of SSRIs.

Table 4
Significant results for platelet traits passing multiple correction

To focus on specific serotonin inhibitors, we also accounted for P2Y12/ADP receptor inhibitor medication, in addition to age, sex, and aspirin use, in SSRI and SARI groups (Table S7 and Table S8, respectively). SSRI associations with Optimul ADP concentration to reach 20% aggregation and LTA secondary aggregation slope to 0.98 μM were somewhat attenuated below our significance threshold, but other associations remained significant or were even strengthened (Table S7). While associations with SARI use did not pass multiple test correction, there were borderline associations that suggest SARIs may also suppress multiple platelet activation pathways. These included higher ristocetin LTA disaggregation (P < 0.0013), lower LTA ADP aggregation (to 0.98 μM and 1.82 μM, P < 0.0022 and P < 0.0047, respectively), lower P‐selectin percentage positive platelets in response to 20 μM ADP (P < 0.0052), lower WB Multiplate 3.19 cM ADP activation (P < 0.019), lower LTA aggregation to epinephrine (P < 0.022) and collagen (P < 0.025), and lower Optimul aggregation to TRAP‐6 (P < 0.0090), epinephrine (P < 0.027), U46619 (P < 0.035) and collagen (P < 0.050). The borderline associations of SARI with reduced ADP platelet activation were all strengthened after additional adjustment for P2Y12 inhibitor use (Table S8).

We observed fewer associations for norepinephrine‐affecting and NDRI categories. Our norepinephrine‐affecting class included tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, which also affect serotonergic mechanisms, so it is likely that the associations observed are in part due to inhibition of the serotonin transporter. Interestingly, we found one significant NDRI association in the Multiplate platform (ADP velocity; beta = 0.351, P = 4.87E‐04) in a direction that indicates increased platelet reactivity. Table S9 and Table S10 show norepinephrine‐affecting and NDRI results, respectively.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^116bZzy7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Depression is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease morbidity. Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in depressive pathology, contained within platelets, and is a weak activator of platelets. Our study assessed the link between platelet reactivity traits, depression, and antidepressant (AD) use in a large population sample. Our study was conducted in the Framingham Heart Study (n = 3,140), and AD use (n = 563) and aspirin use (n = 681) were noted. Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) survey. Platelet reactivity traits were measured across multiple agonists using five distinct assays. We utilized a linear mixed effects model to test associations between platelet traits and depression, adjusting for age, sex, aspirin use, and AD use. Similarly, we analyzed trait associations with any AD use, serotonin-affecting ADs, and norepinephrine-affecting ADs, respectively. There were strong associations with reduced platelet function and AD use, particularly with serotonin-affecting medications. This included lower Optimul epinephrine maximal aggregation (P = 4.87E-13), higher U46619 half maximal effective concentration (P = 9.09E-11), lower light transmission aggregometry (LTA) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) final aggregation (P = 1.03E-05), and higher LTA ADP disaggregation (P = 2.28E-05). We found similar associations with serotonin-affecting ADs in an aspirin-taking subset of our sample. There were no significant associations between platelet traits and depression. In the largest study yet of AD use and platelet function we show that antidepressants, particularly serotonin-affecting ADs, inhibit platelets. We did not find evidence that depressive symptomatology in the absence of medication is associated with altered platelet function. Our results are consistent with AD use leading to platelet serotonin depletions, decreased stability of platelet aggregates, and overall decreased aggregation to multiple agonists, which may be a mechanism by which ADs increase risk of bleeding and decrease risk of thrombosis.

5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Sertraline HCl Capsules, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Sertraline HCl Capsules or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials with another sertraline HCl product, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with sertraline. Prior to initiating treatment with Sertraline HCl Capsules, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.6 Seizures

Sertraline HCl has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Sertraline HCl Capsules should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.

### Risk of intracranial haemorrhage in antidepressant users with concurrent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: nationwide propensity score matched study [^116w7gzU]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, block platelet uptake, and use of these agents results in bleeding complications.NSAIDs are also known to inhibit normal platelet function. However, a previous population based study did not find a significant association of use of each drug with intracranial haemorrhage. Our study found the additional effect according to the drug-drug interaction based on the population based data. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors work by inhibiting the reuptake of not only serotonin but also norepinephrine. Elevation of norepinephrine concentrations may be associated with an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. A high risk with venlafaxine was reported by De Abajo and Garcia-Rodriguez, who estimated the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. This may be because, as they noted, venlafaxine has a lower affinity for the serotonin receptor than do most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but to compensate for its lower potency in vitro, a threefold to sevenfold greater daily dose is usually prescribed.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population based cohort study focusing on the risk of intracranial haemorrhage associated with the combined use of antidepressants and NSAIDs. Most existing studies have been case-control studies and have focused on abnormal bleeding risk from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This study included all antidepressant prescriptions in Korea during a five year period. We focused on changes in risk due to addition of NSAIDs to antidepressants, which could provide information about drug interaction.

### Venous thromboembolism and escitalopram [^1175XAJw]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently used as a first-line treatment for depression, as they have a favorable side-effect profile. Escitalopram, a new SSRI, is also well-tolerated and serious side effects are rarely associated with its use. There have been several reports that SSRIs might increase bleeding tendency in some patients by affecting platelet function. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports about their relation to thrombosis. In this brief report, we present a case of venous thromboembolism associated with escitalopram in a patient with psychotic depression without any major risk factors for thrombosis. SSRIs might have a dual effect on platelet function. The immediate and early effect of SSRI use on platelets might be an increase be an in tendency for thrombosis, whereas the late effect after repeated dosing might be an increase in tendency to bleed, as suggested by previous literature.

### Don't use two or more medications that are known to… [^112TFdDJ]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Prescribing more than one of these medications concurrently may result in an enhanced risk of bleeding. This heightened risk of bleeding may be mediated through complex pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. It is well established that the combination of anticoagulants and NSAIDs increase the risk of bleeding. A combination of warfarin with either single or dual antiplatelet therapy significantly increases the risk of major bleeding by two- to four-fold, respectively. The most commonly prescribed antidepressant therapeutic class, may decrease platelet serotonin uptake, leading to impaired platelet aggregation, and thereby increased risk of bleeding. Specific to gastrointestinal bleeding, SSRIs may also increase gastric acid secretion.

Bleeding has been observed in association with other antidepressants in some observational studies; however, recent systematic reviews give weight to SSRIs in combination with NSAIDs for increased vigilance for risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients where benefits outweigh the risks of the combination, appropriate education of patient and caregivers and appropriate follow-up monitoring for early detection of any signs and symptoms of bleeding is highly recommended.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing trazodone.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in men receiving trazodone. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

Trazodone should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with trazodone or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage [^111CcPeV]. JAMA Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an effect that is in theory linked to the strength of inhibition of serotonin reuptake of an antidepressant. However, whether antidepressants that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake actually increase the risk for ICH and the effect of concomitant use of antithrombotics are unknown.

Objectives

To assess the risk for ICH associated with the use of SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) among new users of antidepressants and according to the relative affinity of the antidepressant for the serotonin transporter and to assess whether concomitant use of antithrombotics modifies this risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included new users of antidepressants 18 years or older from January 1, 1995, to June 30, 2014. More than 650 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink enrolled patients. with use of a nested case-control approach, each case of a first ICH identified during follow-up was matched with as many as 30 control individuals by age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Follow-up was completed on October 31, 2014.

Interventions

Current use of SSRIs compared with TCAs and strong compared with weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence rate ratios (RRs) of ICH.

Results

Among a cohort of 1 363 990 incident users of antidepressants (36.8% male; 63.2% female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [18.5] years), 3036 cases of ICH were identified during follow-up and matched to 89 702 controls. Current SSRI use was associated with an increased risk for ICH (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.35) relative to TCAs, highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04–1.99), and translating in very few additional events. Similarly, the risk was increased by 25% with strong inhibitors (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54) and highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.90–3.12). Concomitant use of anticoagulants may increase the risk substantially (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.89–3.39).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of SSRIs and more generally of antidepressants with strong inhibition of serotonin reuptake are associated with an increased risk for ICH, particularly in the first 30 days of use and when used concomitantly with oral anticoagulants.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Best practice guidance "is controversial", since "SSRIs can increase bleeding risk but can also potentially lead to a relapse of clinical depression if discontinued". The text also notes that SSRIs "can interact with anesthetic agents, resulting potentially in hypotension, arrhythmias, altered thermoregulation including postoperative shivering, and postoperative confusion".

### Clopidogrel bisulphate (clopidogrel) [^116gH1By]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Omeprazole or esomeprazole

Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel bisulfate with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel bisulfate. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

Coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)

Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel bisulfate with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

However, at high concentrations in vitr o, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

7.4 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use by patients with acute coronary syndromes [^116meFXS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly used to treat anxiety, depression, and other conditions that commonly affect patients with coronary artery disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors inhibit platelet activation and may, therefore, affect outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed of 1254 patients with acute coronary syndromes comparing in-hospital bleeding and cardiac event rates in 158 patients who received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a propensity score-matched group of patients who did not. All patients were treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and almost all also received aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin.

Results

Patients who received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor were significantly more likely to experience any bleeding (37.3% vs 26.6%, OR 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–2.66, P = 0.04) and significantly less likely to experience recurrent myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or asymptomatic cardiac enzyme elevation while in the hospital (7.0% vs 13.9%, OR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.22–0.99, P = 0.04). No differences were observed in death, myocardial infarction during the hospitalization, urgent revascularization, or major bleeding. Bleeding and cardiac events were not affected by antidepressants other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Conclusions

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during a hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome is associated with reduced rates of recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or cardiac enzyme elevation at the expense of increased bleeding in patients receiving maximal conventional antiplatelet medications and heparin. Clinicians should be aware of this association when treating patients with an acute coronary syndrome.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate (paroxetine) [^11572B7V]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine tablets, should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including paroxetine tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine tablets, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine tablets-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor) [^115Yh3nt]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4	Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Effexor XR, may increase the risk of bleeding events, ranging from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, petechiae, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage to life-threatening hemorrhage. Concomitant use of aspirin, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti‑coagulants or other drugs known to affect platelet function may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case‑control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SNRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Effexor XR and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing Effexor XR.

5.5	Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Effexor XR may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including Effexor XR, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

5.6	Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Effexor XR or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Mania or hypomania was reported in Effexor XR treated patients in the premarketing studies in MDD, SAD, and PD (see Table 2). Prior to initiating treatment with Effexor XR, screen for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^1169KFXs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results for depressive symptomology and platelet reactivity were nonsignificant when adjusting for antidepressant use. It has been postulated that 5HT2A platelet expression and serotonin agonism is higher in depression. Platelets express glutamate receptors, and glutamatergic dysfunction in depression may also affect platelet reactivity. Our study did not test serotonin or glutamate as agonists, and may, thus, have missed some direct links. Still, with otherwise fairly comprehensive platelet reactivity phenotyping and largely null findings, it seems unlikely that platelet hyperreactivity is a large factor in depressive comorbidity.

It is important to note that our study comes with limitations. First, although we tested many platelet variables and pathways, it should be acknowledged that in any platelet study assay choices (e.g. agonist concentrations) and preanalytic variables (e.g. tube anticoagulant choice, agonist batch effects, or centrifugation settings) can influence results. In our study we took steps to reduce such effects like dedicated agonist batches across the study, standardized methods, and using few lab personnel. Second, our analysis of AD use is collected cross‐sectionally, and thus, we were unable to direct or account for dose or duration of therapy. Interestingly, however, past research indicates that therapeutic doses of SSRIs maximally inhibit the serotonin transporter and fully exert antiplatelet effects, so this may not be a large confounding factor. Third, we define AD use via self‐report and cannot rule out misreport or noncompliance with medication. Given the nature of depression, and because antidepressants are often prescribed for long periods of time, it is possible that those who report taking ADs are not fully adhering to treatment, which could confound our results. However, given that 99.9% of the Framingham participants with platelet phenotyping physically brought their medication bottles to their exam, it is likely we had excellent coverage of prescriptions, unless some individuals chose not to report AD out of a sense stigmatism. Even if there were such effects, or medication noncompliance, we would expect that would bias toward our null hypothesis and weaken any results. Although our primary analysis population was limited primarily to those of European ancestry, we were able to replicate several of our U46619 Optimul significant associations, despite being restricted by statistical power, in an independent, non‐European cohort (BPRHS), suggesting that our findings may generalize to additional populations. Findings for U46619 and serotonin‐affecting medication within the aspirin strata in BPRHS did not replicate, although the effect direction trend was similar, indicating decreased platelet activation. This may be due to limited power with n = 62 reporting being on aspirin and serotonin‐affecting medications. Reliance on self‐reported aspirin, rather than the sensitive LTA‐AA assay used in FHS, may have also played a role and resulted in some substratum misassignment in the BPRHS replication and bias toward the null hypothesis. Finally, our depression and severe depression variables were derived using the CES‐D survey rather than a clinical diagnosis in medical record, which limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about platelet hyperreactivity and depression such as would be obtained with validated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria being met.

### An association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use and serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112HbXYb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

In vitro studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit platelet aggregation. It is controversial whether use of SSRIs is a cause of clinically important bleeding; results from observational studies have been equivocal.

Methods

A population-based case-control study was conducted in Denmark. The 3652 cases all had a first discharge diagnosis of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB) from 1995 to 2006. Controls (n = 36,502), matched for age and sex, were selected by risk-set sampling. Data on drug exposure and medical history were retrieved from a prescription database and the county's patient register. Confounders were controlled for by conditional logistic regression and the case-crossover design.

Results

The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of UGB among current, recent, and past users of SSRIs was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46–1.92), 1.88 (95% CI, 1.42–2.5), and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07–1.39). The adjusted OR for concurrent use of SSRI and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was 8.0 (95% CI, 4.8–13). The adjusted OR for the concurrent use of NSAID, aspirin, and SSRI was 28 (95% CI, 7.6–103). Of the UGB cases, 377 were current users of SSRI; the adjusted OR for UGB in the case crossover analysis was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.2–3.6). The adjusted OR among users of proton pump inhibitors was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.50–1.82).

Conclusions

Use of SSRI was associated with UGB, consistent with its antiplatelet effects. SSRIs should be prescribed with caution for patients at high risk for UGB.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^114crgun]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant use

AD use was determined by participant self‐report in both cohorts. Participants were advised to bring their medicines to their examination, and these medications were mapped to corresponding Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes. Programming code (Supplemental Text) pattern‐matched drug names to capture all potential ADs. To capture broad and specific effects of ADs, we analyzed associations between platelet reactivity traits and any AD use, serotonin‐affecting AD use, SSRI use, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) use, and norepinephrine‐affecting AD use, respectively. In instances where a participant was on a drug affecting both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, participants were included in both serotonin‐affecting and norepinephrine‐affecting classes. Similarly, participants on multiple ADs were included in all eligible classes. After observing significant associations in the serotonin‐affecting medication classes, we conducted subanalyses with further adjustment for platelet ADP P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12) inhibitor medication use. We focused on the most prevalent medications that specifically target serotonin through different mechanisms: the SSRIs that target serotonin reuptake (n = 362) and the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) that target reuptake and 5HT2A/2C receptors (trazodone n = 49 / nefazodone n = 1).

Blood collection and platelet assays

Briefly, fasting blood collection was taken in the morning and either whole blood or isolated platelet‐rich plasma was used in multiple platelet function testing approaches with varied agonists and concentrations that target specific pathways of activation. Platelet assay methods are described in detail in the Supplemental Text. Figure 1 provides an overview of the assays and Table S1 provides specific details of each assay.

### Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding… [^115YEMSg]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been suspected of increasing the risk of bleeding. We examined the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding with use of antidepressant medication. Methods. tract, and intracranial bleeding. 1, 11 Release of serotonin by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis, and serotonin is taken up from the blood stream by serotonin transporters, similar to those transporting serotonin in the brain. 12 Because platelets are not capable of synthesizing serotonin, depletion of serotonin stores could induce hemorrhagic complications. The older antidepressants, the tricyclic and tetracyclic agents, have differing degrees of selectivity on the serotonin receptor relative to the other monoamine receptors, 13 and some of them may also interfere with hemostatic function. We included clomipramine hydrochloride in the group of SSRIs because of its potent and rather selective blockage of serotonin transport.

13, 17 The group of non-SSRIs included antidepressants with a balanced action on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake mechanisms, 13, 18 while the group of other antidepressants included antidepressants with either a selective inhibitory action on norepinephrine uptake or no action on any reuptake mechanism.
13. Under the assumption of an additive effect between antidepressants and other risk factors for upper GI bleeding, the rate difference was calculated as the difference between the incidence rate of upper GI bleeding among only users of antidepressants and the incidence rate in the background population not exposed to antidepressant medication. Thus, the risk estimates for antidepressant use obtained for this subcohort may actually be more correct than those obtained for the total cohort.

The results indicate a causal relationship between SSRI use and risk of upper GI bleeding, because the increase in risk seemed to be confined to periods of use of SSRIs. Serotonin is thought to play an important role in hemostasis, mainly through an enhancing effect on adenosine diphosphate and thrombin. 22 The SSRIs in therapeutic doses consistently deplete serotonin after several weeks of treatment. 23, 24 Although adverse vascular events have been ascribed to the SSRIs in sporadic cases, studies25–27 of hemostatic function in consecutive patients or healthy volunteers receiving SSRI treatment revealed no abnormalities in platelet aggregation, hematopoiesis, or coagulation profile.
