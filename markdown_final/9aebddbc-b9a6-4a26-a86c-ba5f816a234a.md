## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting a 58-year-old man's hepatitis B serology results and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each serologic marker means and how to interpret the combination. Then, I should verify whether any additional testing is warranted, especially for occult infection or acute infection. Next, I will consider vaccination needs and timing. After that, I need to assess reactivation risk in the context of immunosuppression or planned therapies. Finally, I will outline counseling, documentation, and follow-up, making sure I reconcile any apparent contradictions in guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the serologic pattern and its usual interpretation. The patient is HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative, and total anti-HBc negative, which classically indicates susceptibility to HBV infection with no evidence of current or past infection and no vaccine-induced immunity, assuming the tests are accurate and the window period is not relevant here [^111CBdhz].

> Wait, let me verify whether any additional testing is needed before concluding susceptibility. I should consider whether there is a window period after recent exposure, in which case HBsAg and anti-HBs may be negative while anti-HBc IgM is positive; if acute infection is suspected clinically or by exposure history, I should order anti-HBc IgM and, if indicated, HBV DNA to clarify timing and activity of infection [^111QCSP3] [^112NTRPf]. I also need to check for the possibility of occult HBV infection, which is rare but real; in immunocompromised hosts or when risk is high, HBV DNA testing can be considered even with negative HBsAg, though in an immunocompetent 58-year-old without risk factors, the pretest probability is low and routine DNA testing is not generally indicated [^113TUWr4] [^112Udc6V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vaccination without confirming the current status. With all three markers negative, the patient lacks immunity and should be vaccinated against HBV according to current adult immunization guidance, which recommends universal vaccination for adults aged 19–59 years and allows vaccination for those ≥ 60 years without risk factors as well [^114aJBW4] [^117VTzCt]. I should confirm whether he has any documented prior vaccination; if records are unavailable, vaccinating is appropriate because additional doses are not harmful even if immunity exists, though they are unnecessary in someone clearly immune [^117VTzCt].

> Let me think about the practical vaccination approach and follow-up. A standard 2- or 3-dose HepB series is acceptable; shared clinical decision-making can guide the choice, and in adults a 2-dose Heplisav-B series is an efficient option with high immunogenicity, while a 3-dose Engerix-B or Recombivax HB series remains standard [^notfound]. I should double-check post-vaccination serology timing; for low-risk immunocompetent adults, routine post-vaccination testing is not required, but if performed, anti-HBs should be checked 1–2 months after series completion, with a protective threshold generally considered ≥ 10 mIU/mL, and if the titer is inadequate, additional doses can be given [^113Vf5hB]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or on dialysis? In those settings, post-vaccination testing and higher or additional dosing are recommended, which does not apply to a typical 58-year-old without such conditions [^notfound].

> Next, I should review reactivation risk because this influences whether HBV DNA testing is warranted even with negative serologies. If the patient is immunocompromised or will receive immunosuppressive therapy, especially B-cell–depleting agents like rituximab or high-dose glucocorticoids, guidelines recommend baseline HBV screening with HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs, and prophylactic antiviral therapy is strongly favored for HBsAg-positive patients and conditionally favored for isolated anti-HBc in higher-risk immunosuppressive contexts, with monitoring if prophylaxis is not used [^112sRDeK] [^1139N9mF] [^117PQMd4]. I need to ensure I ask explicitly about planned cancer therapy, biologics, or high-dose steroids before concluding that no further HBV workup is needed [^111XpJG8].

> I will now examine counseling and prevention, since the patient is susceptible. I should counsel on transmission routes and risk reduction, including safe sex practices, avoidance of shared needles, and standard precautions, and I should consider screening for HIV and HCV given shared risk factors and the implications for vaccination response and liver health [^11393JeB] [^1112Bw2z]. Let me verify whether hepatitis A vaccination is indicated; patients with chronic liver disease or additional risk factors should receive HAV vaccine, and in those without liver disease, HAV vaccination can still be offered based on risk and preference, with serologic testing for prior immunity sometimes considered to avoid unnecessary vaccination [^116NW3vx].

> But wait, what if the patient is from a region with high HBV prevalence or has other epidemiologic risks? I should confirm birthplace, parental origin, injection drug use, MSM status, and household or sexual contacts with HBV, because these factors increase prevalence and may influence both screening yield and vaccination urgency, aligning with USPSTF and CDC risk-based screening principles even as adult vaccination moves toward universality [^116mZnBw] [^111CBdhz]. I should also document this assessment to support the indication for vaccination and any future testing decisions.

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls. Rarely, HBsAg assays can miss mutant strains or be falsely negative early in infection, and isolated anti-HBc without HBsAg or anti-HBs can represent occult infection, waning immunity, or a false positive; in a 58-year-old with no risk factors and negative serologies, the likelihood of occult infection is low, but if clinical suspicion is high or immunosuppression is planned, HBV DNA testing can be justified to mitigate reactivation risk [^111DvSXr] [^113wAAku] [^113TUWr4]. I should double-check that I am not over-ordering DNA in a low-prevalence, immunocompetent host, reserving it for scenarios where results would change management [^112Udc6V].

> Final interpretation and plan: The serologic pattern is consistent with HBV susceptibility; there is no evidence of current or past infection and no vaccine-induced immunity. No immediate additional HBV testing is required unless there is clinical suspicion of acute infection, planned immunosuppression, or other risk modifiers. I recommend initiating a HepB vaccination series now, using a 2-dose Heplisav-B regimen or a standard 3-dose series, and documenting vaccination status. I will provide counseling on transmission risk reduction and consider screening for HIV and HCV. If immunosuppressive therapy is planned or if new risk factors emerge, I should reassess for HBV reactivation risk and consider HBV DNA testing and prophylaxis per guideline risk stratification [^114aJBW4] [^117VTzCt] [^112sRDeK] [^1139N9mF].

This 58-year-old man with HBsAg negative, anti-HBs negative, and anti-HBc negative is **susceptible to HBV** [^111CBdhz] and should receive a **standard HBV vaccine series** [^114aJBW4] now. No further HBV testing is needed unless he becomes immunosuppressed [^1129B2UR] or is exposed to HBV. If immunosuppression is planned, **check HBV DNA** [^1139N9mF] before starting and manage per risk-based prophylaxis guidelines [^112sRDeK].

## Interpretation of serologic results

| **Marker** | **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| HBsAg | Negative | No current HBV infection |
| Anti-HBs | Negative | No immunity from vaccination or prior infection |
| Anti-HBc | Negative | No prior HBV exposure |

---

These results indicate **susceptibility to HBV** [^111CBdhz] with no evidence of current or past infection or vaccine-induced immunity.

---

## Clinical implications

### Risk of HBV infection

The patient is **susceptible to HBV infection** [^111CBdhz] and should be vaccinated to prevent future infection.

---

### Need for vaccination

Vaccination is **recommended** for all adults aged 19–59 years [^114aJBW4] and for adults ≥ 60 years with risk factors; those ≥ 60 without risk factors may also be vaccinated [^117VTzCt]. A standard 2- or 3-dose HBV vaccine series is appropriate [^notfound]; post-vaccination anti-HBs testing is not routinely required but can be considered in immunocompromised patients or healthcare workers [^notfound].

---

### Further diagnostic testing

No additional HBV testing is indicated unless the patient becomes immunosuppressed [^113TUWr4] or has a known HBV exposure. In those scenarios, **HBV DNA testing** [^1139N9mF] may be warranted to exclude occult infection [^113wAAku].

---

## Management recommendations

- **Vaccination**: Initiate a standard HBV vaccine series (e.g. Engerix-B or Recombivax HB) [^114aJBW4] as soon as possible.
- **Monitoring**: No routine HBV monitoring is needed after vaccination unless the patient is immunocompromised or has ongoing HBV exposure risk.
- **Patient education**: Counsel on HBV transmission risks and the importance of completing the vaccine series [^11393JeB].

---

## Special considerations

If the patient is immunocompromised or will receive immunosuppressive therapy, **screen for HBV reactivation risk** [^112sRDeK] and consider prophylactic antiviral therapy if indicated [^1139N9mF]. If the patient is exposed to HBV, administer post-exposure prophylaxis with HBIG and a vaccine booster dose [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation and recommendations

| **Serologic marker** | **Result** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HBsAg | Negative | No current infection | Vaccinate |
| Anti-HBs | Negative | No immunity | Vaccinate |
| Anti-HBc | Negative | No prior exposure | Vaccinate |

---

The patient is **susceptible to HBV** [^111CBdhz]; initiate a standard HBV vaccine series [^114aJBW4] and provide education on transmission risks. No further HBV testing is needed unless immunosuppression or exposure occurs [^1129B2UR].

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) provides risk-stratified management and screening directives as follows: "The panel agreed on 4 recommendations". "Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr". "For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis". "For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis". "Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3- month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase". For screening, the panel issued "a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV, given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody; stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115Ukyvf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Core concepts regarding chronic hepatitis B (CHB) phases and monitoring — Immune-tolerant is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive with HBV DNA > 10,000,000 IU/mL and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) defined as < 35 U/L for males and < 25 U/L for females; HBeAg-positive immune active is HBeAg-positive with ALT elevated 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater and HBV DNA > 20,000 IU/mL; HBeAg-negative immune active is HBeAg-negative with ALT elevated 2x ULN or greater and HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL; inactive is HBeAg-negative with normal ALT and HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL; and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative immune clearance has HBV DNA undetectable with ± antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). As persons transition across phases over the lifetime of infection, regular monitoring is essential to identify when a change of management is indicated, including use of antiviral therapy.

### Isolated anti-HBc: the relevance of hepatitis B core antibody – A review of new issues [^113wAAku]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is considered the most sensitive serological marker for history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a subset of anti-HBc carriers, anti-HBc is present in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody-a serological pattern known as "isolated anti-HBc" (IAHBc). IAHBc has been of clinical interest over the past several years, with growing data to suggest its role as a serological marker for occult HBV infection (OBI). This article reviews the clinical significance and association of IAHBc with hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, risk of HBV reactivation during direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV as well as immune suppression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B core-related antigen is also highlighted as an emerging laboratory assay that may identify OBI and predict HCC development in non-cirrhotic patients receiving nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapy.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^117VTzCt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidance

ACIP recommends that adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with risk factors for hepatitis B should receive HepB vaccines, and that adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors for hepatitis B may receive HepB vaccines. In previous HepB vaccine recommendations, providers were advised to administer HepB vaccine to all patients who requested it. The new language for adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors is intended to prompt all providers to offer HepB vaccination to patients in that cohort, rather than wait for a patient to request vaccination, thus shifting the responsibility of initiating the consideration of HepB vaccination from the patient to the provider.

Persons who have completed a HepB vaccination series at any point or who have a history of HBV infection should not receive additional HepB vaccination, although there is no evidence that receiving additional vaccine doses is harmful. However, there are cases where revaccination might be indicated as specified in the 2018 ACIP recommendation (e.g. nonresponder infants born to persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], health care providers, and persons on hemodialysis). Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. Vaccination of persons immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or HepB vaccination does not increase the risk for adverse events. However, in settings in which the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, ** prevaccination testing, which may be performed concomitantly with administration of the first dose of vaccine, might reduce costs by avoiding complete vaccination of persons who are already immune. Prevaccination testing consists of testing for HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). The presence of HBsAg indicates current HBV infection. The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating immunity, either from HepB vaccination after a complete series or after recovery from HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV. Detailed interpretations of serologic markers for HBV infection are available (2). Lack of access to serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially in populations that are difficult to reach. Testing is not a requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of persons recommended to receive the vaccine should continue.

### New and old biomarkers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^114BTGsH]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests to detect the presence and activity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the cornerstones of diagnosis and management. Assays that detect or measure serum levels of HB surface antigen, HB surface antibody, and HB core antibody are used to identify patients with exposure to HBV, whereas other tests provide information on the level of virus replication, presence of specific variants, and presence of virus reservoirs. Newer diagnostic tests, used only in research settings so far, aim to quantify levels of intrahepatic HBV replication. Other tests have been developed to detect HBV infection in resource-limited settings. We review point-of-care tests (essential in global screening efforts), standard diagnostic tests used in routine clinical management, and newer tests that might be used in clinical trials of agents designed to cure HBV infection.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^113jZw59]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

### Predictors of the isolated hepatitis B core antibody pattern in HIV-infected and-uninfected men in the multicenter AIDS cohort study [^1166kCs3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The significance of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is unclear.

Methods

This cohort study included men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort to determine clinical and laboratory predictors of isolated anti-HBc.

Results

A total of 2286 subjects (51% human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected) were followed over 3.9 years. Overall, 16.9% (387) had at least 1 visit with isolated anti-HBc. The isolated anti-HBc pattern was stable 84% of the time, and transitioned to or from a pattern of past infection (anti-HBc and anti-HBs). Isolated anti-HBc was associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.73–2.79) and hepatitis C virus (HCV; OR, 4.21; 95% CI; 2.99–5.91). The HCV association was stronger for chronic HCV infection (OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 5.08–8.99) than for cleared HCV (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.83–5.03). HIV infection, chronic HCV, and cleared HCV infection all remained associated with isolated anti-HBc in multivariable models (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.33–2.29; OR, 6.24; 95% CI, 4.62–8.42; and OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.65–4.66, respectively). Among HIV-infected subjects, highly active antiretroviral therapy was negatively associated (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, .66-.95) with isolated anti-HBc.

Conclusions

Isolated anti-HBc is associated with HIV and HCV coinfection, especially active HCV replication, and most commonly occurs as a transition to or from the pattern of natural immunity (anti-HBc and anti-HBs). The isolated anti-HBc pattern likely represents resolved HBV infection with low or undetected anti-HBs.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^1139N9mF]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Decision Support Tool: HBVr — evaluation begins with establishing baseline serology in at-risk individuals using suggested tests hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and HBV-DNA. Risk-based management recommends, for High Risk, "Recommend antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; for Moderate Risk, "Suggest antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; and for Low Risk, "Suggest monitoring alone over using antiviral prophylaxis (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence)". Glucocorticoid dosing definitions are "Glucocorticoids (prednisone or equivalent): low dose, < 10 mg; moderate dose, 10–20 mg; high dose, > 20 mg".

Assessment of risk — Risk varies by country of origin for non–US-born persons; persons born in countries with a prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 2% or greater account for the majority of cases of new chronic HBV infection in the US. The CDC classifies HBV endemicity levels by prevalence of positive HBsAg (high [8%], moderate [2%-7%], or low [< 2%]). HBV screening should also be offered to other risk groups defined by clinical and behavioral characteristics in which prevalence of positive HBsAg is 2% or greater; persons from such risk groups include persons who have injected drugs in the past or currently, men who have sex with men, persons with HIV, and sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, and household contacts of persons known to be infected with HBV.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.

### Risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation among patients treated with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for hepatitis C virus infection [^114BEEVV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents are the standard of care for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during HCV treatment has been reported, the incidence and clinical outcome remains unclear. The aim of our study is to examine the risk of HBV reactivation in actively infected or previously exposed patients during or after HCV treatment with DAAs.

Methods

Adults with chronic HCV infection previously exposed or actively infected with HBV and treated with DAAs between December 2015 to 2016 were included. Electronic medical records were reviewed for HCV treatment dates, HCV treatment response, DAA used, HBV status, and concurrent HBV treatment. Primary end-point was to determine the risk of HBV reactivation during or up to 3 months after DAA treatment.

Results

We identified 283 patients, and 100% of patients completed HCV treatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. 93% had HCV genotype-1 of whom 91% achieved sustained viral response at 12 weeks posttreatment (SVR-12). In total, 7% had HCV genotype-4 who achieved SVR-12 of 84%. Mean (± SD) age was 59.7 (± 7) years, and 58% were male. A total of 45% of patients had hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative. In total, 55% of patients had a positive HBsAg before HCV DAA treatment. No HBV reactivation was encountered in the (HBcAb) positive HBsAg-negative cohort nor in the (HBsAg) positive group with 95% confidence interval (0–0.023) and (0–0.019), respectively.

Conclusion

In our study of patients with HCV and isolated hepatitis B core or HBsAg positivity, no HCV patients treated with DAA experienced HBV reactivation.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines have demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the past 4 decades (1,2). However, vaccination coverage among adults has been suboptimal, limiting further reduction in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the United States. This Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation expands the indicated age range for universal HepB vaccination to now include adults aged 19–59 years. Removing the risk factor assessment previously recommended to determine vaccine eligibility in this adult age group (2) could increase vaccination coverage and decrease hepatitis B cases.

### Level of hepatitis B (HB) core antibody associates with seroclearance of HBV DNA and HB surface antigen in HB e antigen-seronegative patients [^115KH5bs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although a low level of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) seroclearance, additional biomarkers are needed for more accurate prediction. We investigated whether quantification of antibody against HBV core protein (anti-HBc) can identify patients with undetectable levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg seroclearance among those who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-seronegative.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a community-based cohort of individuals (30–65 years old) in Taiwan who were HBsAg seropositive, anti-HCV negative, and free of cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, recruited from 1991 through 1992, and evaluated every 6–12 months until June 30, 2004. We measured levels of anti-HBc in blood samples from 2500 participants who were seronegative for HBeAg. The first date at which a sample tested negative for HBV DNA or HBsAg, and remained negative in subsequent tests, was designated as the date of spontaneous HBV DNA undetectability or HBsAg seroclearance. We calculated cumulative incidences of HBV DNA undetectability and HBsAg seroclearance; associations between level of anti-HBc and undetectability of HBV DNA or HBsAg seroclearance were estimated by Cox proportional hazard regression. The effects of time on the associations between level of anti-HBc and HBsAg seroclearance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis.

Results

After a 12-year follow-up period, higher proportions of subjects with levels of anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL had undetectable levels of HBV DNA (58%) and HBsAg seroclearance (53%) than subjects with higher levels of anti-HBc (29.6% and 19.8%, respectively) (P < .001). For subjects with levels of HBsAg < 10 2 IU/mL and anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL, the adjusted rate ratio of HBV DNA undetectability was 16.45 (95% CI, 11.15–24.28) and of HBsAg seroclearance was 17.95 (95% CI, 12.49–25.81), compared to subjects with higher levels of HBsAg and anti-HBc. A model that included level of anti-HBc as a parameter identified subjects with HBsAg seroclearance within 10 years with an AUROC of 82%; this value was significantly higher than that from models that include only level of HBV DNA and HBsAg (P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients with chronic HBV infection in Taiwan, we associated levels of anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL with undetectable HBV DNA and HBsAg seroclearance occurred within 10 years; patients who also have levels of HBsAg < 10 2 IU/mL have greater odds. Combining data on levels of HBsAg, HBV DNA, and anti-HBc is able to identify HBeAg-seronegative patients who can achieve HBsAg seroclearance with an AUROC value of 82%.

### Fatal reactivation of hepatitis B post-chemotherapy for lymphoma in a hepatitis B surface antigen-negative, hepatitis B core antibody-positive patient: potential implications for future prophylaxis recommendations [^111KJEcA]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

In the absence of prophylaxis, the reactivation of hepatitis B in oncology patients who are hepatitis B carriers is a well-known and often fatal complication of chemotherapy. The current recommendations in Canada and the United States are that patients who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) receive antiviral prophylaxis prior to chemotherapy. We report a 67-year-old man with B-cell lymphoma who developed hepatitis B reactivation following chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab. Pre-chemotherapy, the patient was negative for HBsAg, positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and weakly positive for hepatitis B surface antibody. Despite treatment with lamivudine, the patient died of fulminant hepatic failure. Our experience indicates that patients who are negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBc are still at risk for reactivation of latent hepatitis B during and after chemotherapy and may be considered for prophylaxis.

### Hepatitis B [^115o6V1S]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

HBV clinical term definitions — per Table 4 — include the following: Chronic hepatitis B is defined as chronic necroinflammatory disease of the liver caused by persistent infection with hepatitis B virus and can be subdivided into HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B. Inactive HBsAg carrier state is persistent HBsAg without evidence of significant, ongoing necroinflammatory disease. Acute exacerbation or flare of hepatitis B is intermittent elevations of aminotransferase activity to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and more than twice the baseline value. Reactivation of hepatitis B is reappearance of active necroinflammatory disease of the liver in a person known to have the inactive HBsAg carrier state or resolved hepatitis B. HBeAg clearance is loss of HBeAg in a person who was previously HBeAg positive. HBeAg seroconversion is loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe in a person who was previously HBeAg positive and anti-HBe negative. HBsAg reversion is reappearance of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative, anti-HBs positive.

### Prevention of hepatitis B in nonresponders to initial hepatitis B virus vaccination [^113YqitR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly successful, 5% to 10% of individuals do not experience a response with an adequate antibody level to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Contributing causes for nonresponse to the vaccine are genetic predisposition, immunosuppression, and certain chronic illnesses. The distinction between true nonresponse (after adequate immunization) and waning anti-HBs levels is important. The latter is not uncommon in populations in areas of the world with low endemicity for HBV infection. Data from subjects with waning anti-HBs levels show that immunologic memory may still protect these individuals against acute HBV infection or may prevent chronic infection with HBV for ≤ 10 years after immunization. Recent reports from Asia and Alaska describe cases of chronic HBV infection 15 years after immunization in subjects who have very low levels of anti-HBs. Thus, nonresponders or those with waning immunity who may be at risk of HBV infection in subsequent years may require a booster dose. Clinical algorithms to reimmunize nonresponders have been described and are discussed in this article. Experimental hepatitis B vaccines have shown some promise in nonresponders but are not commercially available in the United States.

In certain persons, anti-HBc is the only serologic marker detected. Isolated anti-HBc-positivity can be detected following HBV infection in persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned; in populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection with loss of anti-HBs. Some chronically infected persons with isolated anti-HBc-positivity have circulating HBsAg that is not detectable by a laboratory assay. HBV DNA has been detected in < 10% of persons with isolated anti-HBc, although the presence of detectable HBV DNA might fluctuate. These persons are unlikely to transmit infection except under circumstances in which they are the source of a large exposure, such as a blood transfusion. Persons who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive can experience reactivation of infection during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, with reappearance of HBsAg. Infection with a mutant HBV strain can result in positive laboratory tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA, with a negative IgM anti-HBc.

Perinatal HBV infection in a child aged ≤ 24 months is typically asymptomatic although fulminant hepatitis can occur; a positive HBsAg test, positive HBeAg test, or detectable HBV DNA may be considered laboratory evidence of perinatal HBV in an infant born to an HBV-infected mother if timing criteria are met. Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for up to 24 months after birth from passively acquired maternal antibody.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

† Susceptible persons include those who have never been infected with HBV (i.e. total anti-HBc negative) and either did not complete a HepB vaccine series per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations or who are known to be vaccine nonresponders.

Interpretation of Screening Tests

The three main serologic markers used to determine HBV infection status are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) (Table 1). Serologic markers change over typical courses of resolved acute infection and progression to chronic infection (Figure 1).

These findings support the hypothesis that patients with isolated presence of anti-HBc have strong resistance to reinfection and do not need vaccination.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^1154TpDf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B infection — antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring around DMARD initiation are stated as follows: Prophylactic antiviral therapy is strongly recommended over frequent monitoring alone for patients initiating any bDMARD or tsDMARD who are hepatitis B core antibody positive and hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Prophylactic antiviral therapy is strongly recommended over frequent monitoring alone for patients initiating rituximab who are hepatitis B core antibody positive (regardless of hepatitis B surface antigen status). Frequent monitoring alone of viral load and liver enzymes is conditionally recommended over prophylactic antiviral therapy for patients initiating a bDMARD other than rituximab or a tsDMARD who are hepatitis B core antibody positive and hepatitis B surface antigen negative. Patients at risk for hepatitis B reactivation should be comanaged with a hepatologist, and the third recommendation is conditional because it is less certain whether the benefit of prophylactic antiviral therapy outweighs the risks and cost of this treatment in the specified patient population.

Persons with Isolated Core Antibody

Persons with isolated anti-HBc should have their immune status and risk history considered before deciding next steps. Links to performance characteristics on all FDA-approved total anti-HBc assays are available (Supplementary Table 21). The specificity of total anti-HBc tests is 99.8%. However, if a person does not have risk factors, the result might be a false positive; repeat testing with the same assay is warranted to confirm the results. A false-positive isolated core antibody result means the person is susceptible and should be offered HepB vaccine per current ACIP recommendations.

A 2001–2018 national survey found the prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc to be 0.8% (approximately 2.1 million persons). Among patients exposed to HBV, an isolated positive anti-HBc result might be the result of loss of anti-HBs after past resolved infection, occult infection (i.e. HBsAg is negative, but HBV DNA is positive), being in the window period before appearance of anti-HBs, or an HBsAg mutant infection (i.e. an infection that is not picked up by an HBsAg test unable to detect mutants). Patients who are immunosuppressed should be considered at risk for HBV reactivation, and HBV DNA testing is recommended to assess for occult infection. Among infants, an isolated anti-HBc result might be a consequence of passive placental transfer from an HBsAg-positive mother, which is why testing for anti-HBc is not indicated before age 24 months.

Patient Education

Patient education should be conducted in a culturally sensitive, nonstigmatizing manner in the patient's primary language (both written and oral whenever possible). Bilingual, bicultural, and medically trained interpreters should be used when indicated.

Reporting

Acute and chronic cases of HBV infection should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists publishes case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HBV infection. CDC has updated guidance for health departments on viral hepatitis surveillance and case management.

### Concurrence of hepatitis B surface antibodies and surface antigen: implications for postvaccination control of health care workers [^113iWMJx]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2002). Low credibility.

Among 1081 persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, 106 (10%) tested positive for antibodies to surface antigen (anti-HBs) in the same blood sample. Thirty of these persons were studied in detail: seven tested positive for hepatitis B e-antigen, nine were apparently healthy blood donors, and in 14 chronic infection could be demonstrated in follow-up samples. Frozen samples of 14 persons were available for additional quantitative anti-HBs testing using another anti-HBs assay: three showed no anti-HBs reactivity, seven showed borderline anti-HBs levels (1–5 IU/L), and anti-HBs titres ranged from 23 to 66 IU/L in four HBsAg-positive persons, including an apparently healthy blood donor. Thus, after hepatitis B vaccination of medical personnel, presence of anti-HBs may erroneously suggest immunity, while in fact chronic infection with hepatitis B virus is present.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^1129B2UR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In their best practice advice, ACP and CDC recommend testing persons at increased risk for HBV infection with tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. The ACP best practice risk groups align with current testing recommendations except that ACP omits persons with a history of STIs or multiple sex partners (Box 4).

CDC screening guidelines were developed independently from the ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination. The 2018 ACIP recommendations also include recommendations for serologic testing. CDC's screening and testing guidelines cover all persons recommended for serologic testing per ACIP and expand beyond that list (Box 1). When considering prevaccination testing or testing for HBV infection, CDC recommends testing that follows a universal testing approach (Figure 2).

The work group did not evaluate clinical guidance for patients after screening. The most recent expert guidance to reduce the risk for liver damage is that patients with HBV infection should be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (if not already immune); screened for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis D virus (HDV); and assessed for alcohol risk factors, such as with the alcohol screening and brief intervention. Depending on the likely route of transmission, the patient might benefit from STI screening, drug treatment, or harm-reduction counseling. A full list of recommended steps for examination, education, laboratory, serology, and imaging is provided (Table 2).

Additional screening might be recommended for blood donors, newly arrived refugees, and persons initiating cytotoxic or immunosuppressive and additional testing might be recommended for patients on hemodialysis, health care personnel, perinatally exposed infants, and persons involved in exposure events who might warrant postexposure prophylaxis and postvaccination serologic testing. These recommendations are described elsewhere (,–). Providers should follow the most conservative approach when recommendations differ.

### Successful kidney transplantation from a hepatitis B surface antigen-positive donor to an antigen-negative recipient using a novel vaccination regimen [^116bNc7R]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Transplanting a kidney from a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donor to an HBsAg-negative recipient who is naturally immune has been successful in countries endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, in most of these cases, the donors were deceased. We present a report of a successful HBsAg-discordant kidney transplantation in the United States; in this case, a living donor kidney was transplanted to a vaccinated recipient. The wife of a 58-year-old HBsAg-negative man volunteered to donate a kidney to her husband. She had chronic hepatitis B but undetectable HBV DNA. She tested positive for HBsAg and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, but hepatitis B e antigen was undetectable. The recipient failed to develop an antibody response to 3 doses of intramuscular recombinant HBV vaccine given in consecutive months. Immunity was induced by using biweekly intradermal vaccine. However, antibody titer tapered to < 10 mIU/mL over 14 months. An intramuscular booster vaccine resulted in a prolonged anamnestic response, allowing for successful living unrelated donor transplantation. During the 10 years since transplantation, the patient has continued to have normal liver function, with undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA. Antibody titers to HBsAg slowly decreased to 5.8 mIU/mL during the 10 years. Transplant function has been well preserved. This approach to inducing long-term immunity for transplantation merits further study in the United States.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunizations, adults, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to offer vaccination against HBV in adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with the following risk factors for hepatitis B:

|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^11437t6J]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Absence or delayed anti‐HBc reactivity in patients with overt HBV infection has been associated with immunosuppression, HIV co‐infection, insufficient sensitivity of anti‐HBc assays and rare HBcAg variants. None of these conditions applied to the present OBI cases. All isolated anti‐HBs OBI donors were apparently immunocompetent with no evidence of liver disease, medical treatment or known viral co‐infection. Anti‐HBc false negative result was excluded by using three distinct assays, one of which included antigen–antibody complex dissociation pre‐treatment. No specific mutations in BCP/PC, Core and HBx that could alter HBcAg production or anti‐HBc detection were identified, consistent with studies of overt anti‐HBc‐negative HBV infection.

The minority OBI group with isolated anti‐HBs differed from the other two OBI groups by a significantly larger percentage of females, younger age, higher (although still relatively low) levels of viral DNA and anti‐HBs, and higher frequency of HBV vaccination (Table 1). The 72% vaccination rate observed in isolated anti‐HBs OBIs was consistent with the age distribution (median: 24 years [range: 18–54 years]) and the initiation of the Chinese universal HBV vaccination program in 1992. Isolated anti‐HBs OBIs were therefore stratified between 31 vaccinated and 11 unvaccinated with 87% of the former younger than 30 years and 73% of the latter group older than 30 (Tables S1 and Table 2). In addition to age, the 31 vaccinated isolated anti‐HBs OBIs differed in several other aspects: mostly males (68%), higher level of anti‐HBs at index, and more frequent, albeit not significantly, HBV genotype C (Table 2). However, both groups had in common an absence of DNA or anti‐HBc in lookback samples, persistence of isolated anti‐HBs status in follow‐up, and absence or paucity of amino acid substitutions in the Core and S MHR, respectively (Table S1, Figures S2 and S4, and Table 3). Due to the vaccination history of the majority of individuals with isolated anti‐HBs OBI, three main hypotheses were examined to explain the mechanisms underlying this condition: (i) long‐term persistence of OBI status acquired in infancy naturally or from infectious mother or relatives concomitantly or soon after vaccination, (ii) subclinical vaccine breakthrough infection with an HBV escape variant and (iii) unconventional infection acquired post‐vaccination.

### Fatal hepatitis B reactivation in absence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen in a lymphoma patient [^114cW2dA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Reactivations of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in severely immunocompromised patients with serological profiles of past hepatitis B are non-exceptional and potentially severe or fatal events. The preventive and pre-emptive detection of this serological status is compromised in the absence of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), observed in a very small number of cases of HBV infection. Here, we describe the case of a patient with a serological profile indicating a HBV vaccination although the patient did not report previous vaccination, following lymphoma and chemotherapy including rituximab. This patient presented HBV reactivation with appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but without appearance of anti-HBc, suggesting the absence of detectable anti-HBc in this patient at the stage of past infection. Next-generation sequencing provided the complete HBV genome, showing the presence of a mutation in HBsAg associated with immune escape but without the detection of mutations in the core gene previously described as significantly associated with the absence of anti-HBc. Nonetheless, W28* pre-core mutation was found, which was reported to enhance replication capacity in case of weak immune responses and suspected to promote HBV reactivation in association with immune escape mutations. Overall, this case highlights that negativity of anti-HBc cannot definitely rule out past HBV infection and the risk of HBV reactivation in immunocompromised patients in the context of treatment of hemopathies, and that it is difficult to assess such a risk and to prevent or monitor HBV reactivation in patients with past HBV infection but no detectable anti-HBc.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116mZnBw]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — For adolescents and adults at increased risk, screen adolescents and adults at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Grade B. This applies to all asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at increased risk for HBV infection, including those who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection. Screen adolescents and adults at increased risk using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) tests followed by a confirmatory test for initially reactive results. Important risk groups for HBV infection with a prevalence of ≥ 2% that should be screened include persons born in countries and regions with a high prevalence of HBV infection (≥ 2%) such as Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South America; US-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with a high prevalence of HBV infection (≥ 8%); HIV-positive persons; persons with injection drug use; men who have sex with men; and household contacts or sexual partners of persons with HBV infection. Periodically screen persons with continued risk for HBV infection (eg, persons with current injection drug use, men who have sex with men).

### Hepatitis B [^111RHmR6]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B transmission and chronicity risk — HBV is transmitted by perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure, as well as by close person-to-person contact, and HBV can survive outside the body for prolonged periods. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection after acute exposure ranges from 90% in newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers to 25% to 30% in infants and children under 5 and no less than 5% in adults, and immunosuppressed persons are more likely to develop chronic infection after acute infection. In settings such as the United States, the risk of transmitting HBV in daycare centers or schools is extremely low and HBsAg-positive children should not be isolated or prevented from participating in activities including sports. For screening, tests should include HBsAg and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can be utilized as long as those who test positive are further tested for both HBsAg and anti-HBs to differentiate infection from immunity.

### Response to hepatitis B vaccine in HIV-1-positive subjects who test positive for isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen: implications for hepatitis B vaccine strategies [^112FE9zP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive subjects who test positive for isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) should be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine is not certain. Development of an anamnestic response after vaccination would suggest previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in which case vaccination is not necessary.

Methods

Sixty-nine HIV-1-positive subjects who tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) received vaccination with standard hepatitis B vaccine. Twenty-nine subjects (42%) tested positive for anti-HBc, and 40 (58%) tested negative for anti-HBc. An anamnestic response was defined as an anti-HBs titer of ≥ 10 IU/L within 4 weeks of the first vaccination.

Results

The overall anamnestic response rate was 16% and was not significantly different between subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc (24%) and those who tested negative for anti-HBc (10%) before vaccination (P = .18). Approximately 50% of subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc also tested positive for antibody to hepatitis Be antigen (anti-HBe). The anamnestic response rate was higher in subjects who tested positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBe (43%) than in subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc but negative for anti-HBe (7%) (P = .035). After a complete series of vaccinations, HIV-1/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected subjects were less likely to achieve high anti-HBs titers than were subjects infected with HIV-1 alone.

Conclusions

After hepatitis B vaccination, the anamnestic response rate in HIV-1-positive subjects who tested positive for isolated anti-HBc but negative for anti-HBe was low and was comparable to that in subjects who tested negative for anti-HBc. This finding suggests that testing for anti-HBc alone may not be a reliable assessment of protection from HBV infection. HIV-1/HCV coinfection may be associated with impaired responses to hepatitis B vaccine, and evaluation of strategies to improve immunogenicity of the vaccine in such individuals is warranted.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^112B5q2A]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vaccination, screening, and linkage to care can reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, recommendations vary among organizations, and their implementation has been suboptimal. The American College of Physicians' High Value Care Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed this article to present best practice statements for hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care.

Methods

A narrative literature review of clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and intervention studies on hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care published between January 2005 and June 2017 was conducted.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should vaccinate against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults (including pregnant women) at risk for infection due to sexual, percutaneous, or mucosal exposure; health care and public safety workers at risk for blood exposure; adults with chronic liver disease, end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), or HIV infection; travelers to HBV-endemic regions; and adults seeking protection from HBV infection.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk persons, including persons born in countries with 2% or higher HBV prevalence, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, HIV-positive persons, household and sexual contacts of HBV-infected persons, persons requiring immunosuppressive therapy, persons with end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected with hepatitis C virus, persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (≥ 19 IU/L for women and ≥ 30 IU/L for men), incarcerated persons, pregnant women, and infants born to HBV-infected mothers.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should provide or refer all patients identified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest counseling and hepatitis B-directed care.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of antiviral treatment, the benefits of education or behavior change counseling, and the association between improvements in intermediate and clinical outcomes after antiviral therapy.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at high risk for HBV infection (including those at high risk who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection).

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that persons at high risk for infection should be screened for HBV infection. (B recommendation).

### Acute hepatitis B virus infection with simultaneous high HBsAg and high anti-HBs signals in a previously HBV vaccinated HIV-1 positive patient [^117QX5GD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

We present a case of a clinical manifest hepatitis B virus infection and a potentially misleading HBV serological profile in an HIV-1 positive patient despite previous HBV vaccination. The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV booster vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals.

Children and adolescents with HIV — post-HepB vaccination serologic testing and initial screening states that due to the high prevalence of HBV infection, all infants, children, and adolescents with HIV should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (strong, high). If there is no documentation of routine infant/child vaccination for hepatitis B, initial screening with the triple panel consisting of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) will determine infection and immune status and guide clinical management. Anti-HBs titers should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the vaccination series (strong, moderate), and individuals with the isolated anti-HBc serologic profile should also be vaccinated for hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

### Hepatitis A and B immunizations of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^115vXM8J]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

All persons at risk for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, including men who have sex with men, those with multiple heterosexual contacts, abusers of illegal injection drugs, and persons frequently exposed to blood and blood products, are also at high risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. HIV can prolong the duration and increase the level of HAV viremia and augment HAV-related liver abnormalities. HIV also magnifies HBV viremia and the risk of HBV reactivation, chronic active HBV infection, cirrhosis, and death. Because of these concerns, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all HIV-positive/HAV seronegative persons, with 2 standard doses given 6 to 12 months apart. Immune response to hepatitis A vaccines is excellent, even in moderately immune-suppressed individuals. Hepatitis B vaccination is also recommended for all HIV-positive persons lacking prior immunity. However, immune reactivity to hepatitis B vaccines is frequently suboptimal in terms of patients' rate of response, antibody titer, and durability. Relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts (≥ 500/mm3) and low levels of HIV viremia (< 1,000 RNA genome copies/mL plasma) are necessary to ensure adequate hepatitis B vaccine response. Higher hepatitis B vaccine doses, prolongation of the vaccination schedule, or both, as prescribed for many patients with non-HIV-related immune deficiencies, may be considered initially. Revaccination should be instituted if postvaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are < 10 mIU/mL (< 10 IU/L). Nonresponders may also react to a subsequent vaccine course if CD4+ T-cell counts rise to 500/mm3 following institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy; vaccine adjuvant trials are under way. Universal, age-based immunization of all young and middle-aged adults appears to be the most comprehensive way of protecting all populations who are at high risk.

Routine screening prior to CAR T-cell therapy — Laboratory screening should include HIV antibodies (preferably fourth-generation antigen/ antibody combination), hepatitis B virus surface antibody (anti-HBs) and antigen (HBsAg), HBV core Ab (anti-HBc), and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) with reflex nucleic acid testing if positive; Treponema pallidum testing is based on risk factors per institutional guidelines, and patients with positive HBsAg should get baseline HBV DNA.

### Evaluating existing recommendations for hepatitis A and B vaccination [^113n9h4s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines are now widely available throughout the United States, Europe, and most of the rest of the world. A recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1986, followed by hepatitis A vaccine in 1995. Official recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were published for hepatitis B vaccine in 1990, with revisions in 1991, and for hepatitis A vaccine in 1999. Unfortunately, the recommendations are not closely followed, and an insufficient number of persons who are at risk receive these vaccines. In addition, the available recommendations may not cover all who are at risk for infection. This article reviews existing recommendations for the use of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines and offers suggestions for situations in which additional recommendations may be useful. The rationale for revising and expanding the existing recommendations is based on questions raised about the value of risk-based recommendations, data demonstrating increasing rates of hepatitis A and B infections in specific age groups, and the failure to protect 50% of individuals who become infected with vaccine-preventable hepatitis.

Isolated anti‑HBc interpretation — Some persons may test positive for anti‑HBc but not HBsAg or anti‑HBs, and isolated anti‑HBc can reflect different states: it may indicate chronic HBV infection with undetectable HBsAg but detectable HBV DNA (more so in the liver than in serum), it may be a marker of immunity after recovery with an anamnestic response after one dose of HBV vaccine, it may be a false‑positive particularly in low‑prevalence persons with no risk factors, or it may be the only marker during the window phase of acute hepatitis B where anti‑HBc IgM should be positive.

### Can the serological status of anti-HBc alone be considered a sentinel marker for detection of occult HBV infection? [^115mND4F]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Some individuals have "occult" infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), defined as presence of HBV genome in the serum or liver tissue without HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum antibodies against HBV core antigen in isolation ("anti-HBc alone") are a useful marker of "occult" HBV in patients with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. "Anti-HBc alone" was detected in the sera of 119/6,544 (1.8%) asymptomatic outpatients referred to the diagnostic laboratory for routine testing for viral hepatitis, 62/607 (10.2%) drug users, and 42/195 (21.5%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Using three in-house nested-PCR amplification assays to detect HBV preS-S (S), precore-core (C), and Pol viral regions, respectively, "occult" HBV sequences were found in 9 of the 223 sera (4.0%) with "anti-HBc alone". The highest prevalence of "occult" HBV sequences (5.9%) was detected in "anti-HBV alone" sera of individuals referred to the diagnostic laboratory without HCV antibodies. Direct sequencing of all PCR products confirmed the specificity of the PCR reactions and revealed the predominance of HBV genotype D. The data presented in this study suggest that detection of "anti-HBc alone" could reflect unrecognized "occult" HBV infection and that physicians should consider investigating such patients with HBV molecular tests.

### Isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen in human immunodeficiency virus type-1-infected individuals [^114XZDi6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We screened 651 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected subjects for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Of a total of 387 subjects who tested negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, 142 underwent further testing for isolated presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Of these 142 subjects, 60 (42%) tested positive for anti-HBc (isolated anti-HBc). Individuals coinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than were subjects with HIV-1 alone (80% vs. 16%, respectively). Our findings suggest that individuals with HIV-1/HCV coinfection for whom there is no serological evidence for hepatitis B virus when screened with HBsAg and anti-HBs will be positive for anti-HBc in > 75% of cases. A screening strategy that tests only for HBsAg and anti-HBs in HIV-1-infected patients will miss a large number of individuals with isolated anti-HBc.

### Waning-off effect of serum hepatitis B surface antibody amongst Taiwanese university students: 18 years post-implementation of Taiwan's national hepatitis B vaccination programme [^1167xAmQ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its sequelae remain a major health problem for Taiwan. The national hepatitis B (HB) vaccination programme was first launched in 1984 to combat the spread of this infection. This study examined the status of HBV infection amongst students at a Taiwanese university in 2005, 18 years after the implementation of a nation-wide mass HB vaccination programme. In 2005, 5875 new university entrants, who were born during the period 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1988, were subdivided into one of 12 one-year-interval birth-year cohorts. Each student was individually tested for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) status. We observed a declining trend of past exposure to HB infection from 48.7% (1976 birth-year cohort) to 5.2% (1987 birth-year cohort). The prevalence of chronic HB infection also declined from 14.5% (1976 birth-year cohort) to 1.9% (1987 birth-year cohort). The prevalence of persistent HB immunity through (earlier) active vaccination declined from 72% (1984 birth-year cohort) to 41.6% (1987 birth-year cohort). The prevalence of HB infection-naïve individuals increased from 18.2% (1984 birth-year cohort) to 53.1% (1987 birth-year cohort). This study demonstrates that as the implementation of the mass HB vaccination programme in 1984, the incidence of HB infection in Taiwan has declined, although a 'waning-off' effect of serum anti-HBs to low or undetectable levels, which may not provide protection, amongst this student population has arisen, 18 years following the implementation of the nation-wide HB vaccination programme. Such a situation may mean that these individuals may not be effectively protected against future HB infection. A booster dose of HB vaccine, given 18 years following HB vaccination, perhaps even earlier, should be considered.

Vaccinated HCP

For vaccinated HCP (who have written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series) with subsequent documented anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL, testing the source patient for HBsAg is unnecessary. No postexposure prophylaxis for HBV is necessary, regardless of the source patient's HBsAg status (Table 5). TABLE 5 Postexposure management of health care personnel after occupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids, by health care personnel HepB vaccination and response status Abbreviations: anti HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HCP = health care personnel; N/A = not applicable. * Not indicated.
For vaccinated HCP (who have written documentation of a complete HepB vaccine series) without previous anti-HBs testing, the HCP should be tested for anti-HBs and the source patient (if known) should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Testing the source patient and the HCP should occur simultaneously; testing the source patient should not be delayed while waiting for the HCP anti-HBs test results, and likewise, testing the HCP should not be delayed while waiting for the source patient's HBsAg results (Table 5). If the HCP has anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status, the HCP should receive 1 dose of HBIG and be revaccinated as soon as possible after the exposure. HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomical injection site (e.g. separate limb). The HCP should then receive the second 2 doses of HepB vaccine to complete the second series (likely 6 doses total when accounting for the original series) according to the vaccination schedule. So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose. If the HCP has anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL and the source patient is HBsAg-negative, the HCP should receive an additional single HepB vaccine dose, followed by repeat anti-HBs testing 1–2 months later. HCP whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL should undergo revaccination with two more doses (likely 6 doses total when accounting for the original series). So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. If the HCP has anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL at the time of the exposure, no postexposure HBV management is necessary, regardless of the source patient's HBsAg status.
For vaccinated HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after two complete HepB vaccine series, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. If the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has unknown HBsAg status, the HCP should receive 2 doses of HBIG. The first dose should be administered as soon as possible after the exposure, and the second dose should be administered 1 month later. HepB vaccine is not recommended for the exposed HCP who has previously completed two HepB vaccine series. If the source patient is HBsAg-negative, neither HBIG nor HepB vaccine is necessary (Table 5).

Regarding HDV Ab+ patients, one was a non‐Hispanic Black male, aged 68, with a past medical history of HBV and intravenous drug use (IVDU). He had been on HBV treatment but had discontinued it and had not been tested for HDV RNA. The second HDV Ab+, but RNA−, patient was a 52‐year‐old female from the Philippines. She had undergone a deceased donor renal transplant and had a history of chronic hepatitis B. The third HDV Ab+, but RNA−, patient was a 56‐year‐old female from Afghanistan, who had no coinfection with HCV or HIV and no history of substance use. The fourth HDV Ab+, but RNA−, patient was a 50‐year‐old male from China, who had a reactive HCV Ab with undetectable HCV RNA, no coinfection with HIV, and no history of substance use. The fifth HDV Ab+ patient, an 83‐year‐old female from China, could not have her RNA status determined as she was lost to follow‐up. The sixth HDV Ab+, but RNA−, patient was a 53‐year‐old male from China with a history of prior cocaine use. Labs showed the patient had previously cleared HCV infection and was HIV‐negative. The last HDV Ab+, but RNA−, patient was a 53‐year‐old Hispanic female with an unknown country of origin, no coinfection with HCV or HIV, and no history of substance use.

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^115bJNpj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination after HSCT — dose series, immunogenicity, monitoring, and reactivation risk are described as follows: Vaccination with three or four doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is recommended between 6 and 12 months after HSCT, with seroconversion rates in the first year ranging from 64% to 100% and lower among older individuals and those with GVHD. Reactivation after post-transplant immunization in recipients with resolved hepatitis B infection can occur irrespective of anti–hepatitis B surface antibody levels and with a cumulative 3-year risk of 2%. Clinical interpretation states hepatitis B surface antibody titers should be routinely checked 6 months post-immunization, especially for those vaccinated within 12 months of transplant, and that a three-dose series should be repeated for levels below the protective threshold (hepatitis B surface antibody < 10 mIU/mL). In patients with occult hepatitis B infection, viral reactivation can be a late complication after antiviral cessation, with a 2–year cumulative risk of up to 40%.

### Screening for hepatitis A and B antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease [^116NW3vx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is highly prevalent, and hepatitis C is one of the leading causes. Acute hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic hepatitis C can lead to more severe hepatic injury and a higher fatality rate than in patients without hepatitis C. Thus, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that persons with CLD be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV), and the ACIP and the National Institutes of Health recommend vaccination against both HAV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Because coinfection with HAV or HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C or CLD is common, antibody screening prior to hepatitis A or B vaccination can identify patients who are already immune to these viruses and thus do not need to be vaccinated. Selective hepatitis A vaccination (i.e., vaccination of patients who test negative for either HAV antibody immunoglobulin G or total antibodies to HAV) is most cost-effective in areas where the local prevalence of hepatitis A is higher than the national prevalence and in populations with higher background rates of HAV exposure compared with the general population, such as older adults, foreign-born patients, African Americans, and persons with CLD or hepatitis C. Although not usually recommended for healthy adults or those with compensated CLD because of virtually 100% postvaccination seroconversion, serologic testing after hepatitis A vaccination is recommended in patients with decompensated or advanced end-stage liver disease because of the much lower seroconversion rates in these patients. Selective vaccination against HBV in patients with CLD or hepatitis C is also recommended. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is considered the most efficient and reasonably cost-effective method to screen for hepatitis B serologic markers because HBsAg identifies individuals with both acute and chronic HBV infection, and anti-HBs identify those who are immune secondary to vaccination or past infection. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen is needed to further distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to past infection, but it is not recommended as the only screening test for HBV immunity. Postvaccination testing for hepatitis B seroconversion is recommended in all patients with CLD, especially in those with more advanced disease, because the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adults. If patients with CLD are not adequately protected after a standard course of hepatitis B vaccination, a repeat course of vaccination using the standard schedule or an accelerated schedule (days 0, 7, and 21) should be considered.

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the United States suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

### An updated assessment of chronic hepatitis B prevalence among foreign-born persons living in the United States [^112H51ho]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Surveys used in the analysis may not be strictly representative of populations likely to immigrate to the United States. Although we included surveys of "general populations", the demographics (age, sex, education, and economic status) of persons likely to emigrate to the United States vary by country. The limited surveys available precluded development of inclusion criteria based on specific demographics for emigrants from each country. Biases will vary from country to country and depend on the available surveys. Inclusion criteria allowed a broad range of surveys in different populations, settings, and locations. We expected prevalence rates to differ among surveys as a consequence of differences in demographics, locally dominant routes of HBV transmission, history and reach of HBV prevention programs, and other factors. For this reason, RE meta‐analysis was used to calculate a pooled weighted mean seroprevalence for the distribution of seroprevalences reported within each country.

The updated estimates of CHB prevalence among FB in the United States provide information to guide public health policies, set research priorities, and help raise greater awareness of the clinical burden of CHB among FB in the United States. The finding that as many as 1.7M FB with CHB and 2.4M total persons with CHB may be living in the United States highlights the importance of HBV screening, particularly given that > 80% of CHB adults in the United States remain undiagnosed and less than half of those diagnosed receive appropriate care. Recent updated recommendations by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force reaffirm the importance of screening adults and adolescents at increased risk for HBV, including persons born in countries with high prevalence of HBV infection ≥ 2%. However, risk‐based testing for HBV requires accurate assessment of "risk", contributing to suboptimal screening rates. Similar to the evolution of testing for HIV and HCV from risk‐based to universal testing, our findings and others emphasize the case for universal HBV testing to close the gap in missed diagnoses and opportunities for early linkage to care and treatment. We advocate for universal screening with HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody, given the importance of understanding past HBV exposure and potential risk of reactivation, identifying occult HBV infections, linking those with chronic infection to care and treatment for HBV, and assessing need for HBV vaccination, given that only ~25% of U.S. adults aged ≥ 19 years are vaccinated against hepatitis B and remain at risk for acute HBV infection. Universal screening and universal adult immunization for HBV are recommendations currently undergoing consideration by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
