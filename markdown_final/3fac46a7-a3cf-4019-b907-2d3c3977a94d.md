## Question

COPD management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me about COPD management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and severity stratification. Then, I should assess symptoms, exacerbation risk, and comorbidities. Next, I will consider pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments tailored to risk groups. After that, I need to plan follow-up, reassessment, and escalation or de-escalation strategies. Finally, I should review acute exacerbation management, integrated care models, special populations, and cost-effectiveness considerations, ensuring each assertion is grounded in guidelines and high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before anything else, because management hinges on accurate spirometry. I should double-check that post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70, which establishes chronic airflow limitation and the diagnosis of COPD, while also grading airflow severity using FEV1 percent predicted categories (GOLD 1 through 4) for prognostic context and future monitoring needs [^114bjVtx] [^114ca6LT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I map symptoms and risk. I need to assess dyspnea burden with mMRC and/or CAT, quantify exacerbation history (none, one, or two or more per year), and screen for comorbidities and risk factors like smoking, occupational exposures, and indoor air pollution; these factors guide therapy and risk stratification per GOLD's ABE approach, replacing the older ABCD scheme that conflated symptoms and spirometry, so I should be careful to use ABE consistently in follow-up [^1129rUt1] [^113TWLay] [^116bpGsh].

> Wait, let me verify the risk group implications because this dictates pharmacologic choices. Group A typically has few symptoms and no exacerbations, Group B has significant symptoms but low exacerbation risk, Group E reflects exacerbation risk (≥ 1/year), and eosinophil count may help decide ICS use; I should confirm eosinophil thresholds in current GOLD recommendations when considering adding ICS for exacerbation prevention, especially in those with a history of exacerbations or hospitalizations [^1128NkZi] [^113TWLay].

> I will now examine initial pharmacotherapy, and I need to ensure I start simple and escalate based on response. For Group A, a short-acting bronchodilator (SABA or SAMA) as needed is reasonable; for Group B, a single long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or LAMA) is preferred, escalating to LABA+LAMA if symptoms persist; for Group E, dual bronchodilation (LABA+LAMA) is first-line, and ICS should be added if exacerbations persist and blood eosinophils support likelihood of ICS response, while triple therapy is reserved for those who continue to exacerbate despite optimized dual therapy [^113TWLay] [^111ZMHsZ] [^114gzEEk].

> Let me think about inhaler selection and technique because poor technique undermines any regimen. I should confirm device choice matches the patient's dexterity, inspiratory flow, and preference, and I need to reassess technique at every visit; suboptimal inhaler use is a major cause of apparent nonresponse and is emphasized in guideline-directed care updates [^1115tFXv] [^111M1CDJ].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic therapies, and I must not underplay their impact. Smoking cessation is the most effective disease-modifying intervention, so I should arrange counseling and pharmacotherapy; vaccination with influenza, pneumococcal, and pertussis reduces respiratory infections; structured pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity and quality of life across severities; and supported self-management with a written action plan reduces hospitalizations and enhances quality of life; I should also consider vaccination timing and pulmonary rehabilitation referral early, not as an afterthought [^116hLaz9] [^112Wtxyn] [^111wysD3] [^1116cCTQ].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence and the review–adjust loop. After initiating or changing therapy, I should reassess within 3 months, then at least annually, checking symptoms, exacerbation control, inhaler technique, adherence, and non-pharmacologic engagement; if dyspnea persists, escalate bronchodilation (e.g. LABA+LAMA), and if exacerbations continue, add ICS when eosinophil-guided, whereas if the patient on triple therapy is stable without exacerbations for a year, I should consider ICS withdrawal while maintaining dual bronchodilation to mitigate pneumonia risk [^111M1CDJ] [^1128NkZi] [^111ZMHsZ].

> I need to ensure acute exacerbation management is explicit. For outpatient care, short-acting bronchodilators are first-line, systemic corticosteroids shorten recovery and hospital stay and should be limited to about 5 days, and antibiotics are indicated when increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or purulence is present; for inpatient care, I should add oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 88%, use noninvasive ventilation for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, and escalate to ICU-level care as needed; wait, I almost said methylxanthines are standard, but I should correct that — GOLD advises against them due to adverse effects, so I will avoid them outside rare, monitored contexts [^1139DjP8] [^1121mfMb] [^111xYCbJ].

> But wait, what if the patient has multi-morbidity and polypharmacy. I should double-check for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression, diabetes, and lung cancer, and treat each per usual standards because comorbidities drive morbidity and mortality in COPD; to avoid therapeutic overload, I should simplify regimens, align inhaler devices, and coordinate care across specialties using integrated models where feasible [^111CmKKP] [^113ucV56] [^114cTkgx].

> Let me consider integrated care models, since fragmented care worsens outcomes. Multi-component programs with education, action plans, case management, and structured follow-up reduce respiratory-related admissions and ED visits, though heterogeneity in interventions and settings complicates generalization; still, evidence supports IDM for improving disease-specific quality of life and reducing hospitalizations, so I should embed these elements locally with attention to implementation fidelity [^114mM1LD] [^115mCyUN].

> I should confirm how to monitor disease control and progression. Traditional metrics include symptoms, spirometry, and exacerbation frequency, but the clinically important deterioration (CID) composite capturing ≥ 100 mL FEV1 decline, ≥ 4-point SGRQ worsening, or a moderate/severe exacerbation can detect early worsening and predict poorer outcomes; in advanced disease, I need to integrate palliative care early for symptom control, advance care planning, and end-of-life discussions, tailoring to patient goals and trajectory [^114NfPPb] [^115ofE1J] [^116JHoHQ].

> Next, I should review special populations and emerging strategies. In early COPD, prevention and risk-factor modification are key; in frail, elderly patients, I should simplify therapy, prioritize pulmonary rehabilitation, and consider deprescribing; precision approaches using eosinophils and treatable traits may refine ICS use and non-pharmacologic targeting, but I need to acknowledge that evidence is evolving and local implementation must be cautious and iterative [^113T64Ft] [^111hqJFp] [^1114GLAq].

> I will now examine cost-effectiveness and implementation, because resource constraints often determine real-world success. Standardized, guideline-directed management packages that bundle inhaler technique checks, symptom monitoring, pulmonary function testing, education, and smoking cessation are being tested in large pragmatic trials; the DOSE index, incorporating dyspnea, obstruction, smoking, and exacerbations, may help risk-stratify and anticipate healthcare costs, guiding targeted interventions [^1128xESt] [^116zkwzD].

> To synthesize, let me reconsider the care pathway to ensure coherence: confirm diagnosis with post-bronchodilator spirometry, stage airflow limitation, classify into ABE by symptoms and exacerbation risk, start pharmacotherapy aligned to group with device-matched inhalers, layer essential non-pharmacologic interventions, reassess systematically to apply escalation or de-escalation rules, manage exacerbations promptly with evidence-based bundles, and integrate comorbidity care and coordinated programs; this approach aligns with GOLD and contemporary ATS/VA guidance and should be adapted to local resources and patient preferences [^115bpatp] [^111ZMHsZ] [^117VZsY1].

COPD management centers on **spirometry-based diagnosis** and **symptom/exacerbation-driven therapy** [^114bjVtx] [^113TWLay] to reduce dyspnea, improve quality of life, and prevent exacerbations [^113TWLay]. Core elements include smoking cessation, **long-acting bronchodilators** (LABA/LAMA) as foundation therapy [^111ZMHsZ], and escalation to triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) for frequent exacerbators with high eosinophils [^1128NkZi] [^111ZMHsZ]. Non-pharmacologic care — pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, and self-management with action plans — is essential [^112Wtxyn] [^1122Przq] [^1116cCTQ]; comorbidities must be actively managed, and inhaler technique should be checked at every visit [^111CmKKP] [^1115tFXv]. Exacerbations are treated with SABA ± SAMA, short-course systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated [^1139DjP8]; **noninvasive ventilation** is used for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure [^1139DjP8]. Regular follow-up should track symptoms, exacerbations, lung function, and adherence, adjusting therapy as needed [^111M1CDJ].

---

## Diagnosis and assessment

- **Diagnosis**: Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 confirms airflow limitation; spirometry is mandatory [^114bjVtx].

- **Severity grading**: Use post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted (GOLD 1–4) for prognostic context [^114ca6LT].

- **Initial assessment**: Evaluate symptoms (CAT, mMRC), exacerbation history, and comorbidities to guide therapy [^1169puha] [^115bpatp].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| LABA/LAMA | Symptomatic patients (GOLD B) | Strong |
| ICS/LABA/LAMA | Frequent exacerbators (≥ 2/year) with eosinophils ≥ 100/μL | Conditional |
| Triple therapy | Persistent exacerbations on dual therapy | Conditional |
| Roflumilast | Severe COPD with chronic bronchitis and exacerbations | Conditional |
| Macrolides | Frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy | Conditional |

---

- **Individualization**: Tailor to symptoms, exacerbation risk, comorbidities, and patient preference [^1115tFXv].

- **Inhaler technique**: Reassess at every visit to optimize delivery [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Smoking cessation**: Most effective intervention to slow progression [^115pVopx].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life [^117W41p3].

- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines reduce infections [^notfound].

- **Self-management**: Action plans and education reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations [^notfound].

---

## Management of exacerbations

- **Initial therapy**: SABA ± SAMA for rapid relief [^1139DjP8].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: 40 mg prednisone/day for 5 days; improves FEV1 and shortens recovery [^notfound].

- **Antibiotics**: Use when sputum purulence, increased dyspnea, or volume is present [^notfound].

- **Noninvasive ventilation**: For acute hypercapnic respiratory failure [^1139DjP8].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should track **symptoms, exacerbations, lung function, and adherence**, with therapy adjusted accordingly [^111M1CDJ]. Escalate therapy for uncontrolled symptoms or recurrent exacerbations, and consider de-escalation (e.g. ICS withdrawal) when stable without exacerbations for ≥ 1 year [^1128NkZi].

---

## Special considerations

Comorbidities are common and should be identified and treated per standard care [^111CmKKP]. In multimorbidity, **keep regimens simple** to avoid polypharmacy [^113ucV56]. Palliative care should be integrated for advanced disease to manage symptoms and improve quality of life [^115ofE1J].

---

COPD management is a **dynamic, individualized process** that balances pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies to control symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life, with regular reassessment to align therapy with evolving patient needs [^115bpatp].

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111GpoC4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1112fPxo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^114G6Ah7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112CENvL]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Strategies to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can they impact disease progression? [^115aD3ag]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preventing disease progression is a key element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. COPD exacerbations are adverse events that can result in a decline of lung function that can persevere. Therefore, reducing exacerbation frequency has the potential to affect disease progression and improve health status of COPD patients. This narrative review explores monitoring for disease progression in COPD and its potential association with COPD exacerbations.

Recent Findings

Pharmacotherapy can slow down disease progression, but the effect is mediated only in part by reducing exacerbations. While disease progression is continuous, patients with established airflow obstruction in early stages appear more vulnerable to faster declines in lung function. Longitudinal monitoring of lung function and structure is necessary to identify patients with disease progression.

Summary

Pharmacotherapy is an effective option for preventing disease progression. A holistic approach including longitudinal pulmonary function testing, clinical symptoms and imaging may be necessary to detect disease progression for early intervention.

### Is disease stability an attainable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment goal? [^111Y48nz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive airflow obstruction. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, the disease burden remains high; although clinical trials have shown improvements in outcomes such as exacerbations, quality of life, and lung function, improvement may not be attainable for many patients. For patients who do experience improvement, it is challenging to set management goals given the progressive nature of COPD. We therefore propose disease stability as an appropriate and attainable treatment goal. Other disease areas have developed definitions of no disease activity or remission, which provide relevant information for defining and achieving stability for patients with COPD. Disease stability builds on related concepts already defined in COPD, such as clinical control and clinically important deterioration. Current components that could form part of a disease stability definition include exacerbations, health status (including quality of life and symptoms), and lung function. Considerations should be given to intervals over which stability is defined and assessed, appropriate thresholds, and defining a composite. Ensuring a holistic approach, objective measurements, and harmonious, clear communication between patients and physicians can further support establishing disease stability. Here we propose a preliminary definition of disease stability, informed by existing research in COPD. Further research will be needed to validate the framework for use in clinical and research settings. Exploring disease stability as a goal, however, is an opportunity to develop and validate an attainable treatment target to advance the standard of care for patients with COPD.

### Integrated disease management interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114mM1LD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show considerable variation in symptoms, limitations, and well-being; this often complicates medical care. A multi-disciplinary and multi-component programme that addresses different elements of care could improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise tolerance, while reducing the number of exacerbations.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of health-related quality of life (QoL), exercise tolerance, and exacerbation-related outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL for potentially eligible studies. Searches were current as of September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IDM programmes for COPD versus usual care were included. Interventions consisted of multi-disciplinary (two or more healthcare providers) and multi-treatment (two or more components) IDM programmes of at least three months' duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. If required, we contacted study authors to request additional data. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects modelling. We carried out sensitivity analyses for the quality of included studies and performed subgroup analyses based on setting, study design, dominant intervention components, and region.

Main Results

Along with 26 studies included in the 2013 Cochrane Review, we added 26 studies for this update, resulting in 52 studies involving 21,086 participants for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Follow-up periods ranged between 3 and 48 months and were classified as short-term (up to 6 months), medium-term (6 to 15 months), and long-term (longer than 15 months) follow-up. Studies were conducted in 19 different countries. The mean age of included participants was 67 years, and 66% were male. Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings, including primary (n = 15), secondary (n = 22), and tertiary care (n = 5), and combined primary and secondary care (n = 10). Overall, the level of certainty of evidence was moderate to high. We found that IDM probably improves health-related QoL as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at medium-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.16 to -1.63; 18 RCTs, 4321 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A comparable effect was observed at short-term follow-up (MD -3.78, 95% CI -6.29 to -1.28; 16 RCTs, 1788 participants). However, the common effect did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. There was no significant difference between IDM and control for long-term follow-up and for generic QoL. IDM probably also leads to a large improvement in maximum and functional exercise capacity, as measured by six-minute walking distance (6MWD), at medium-term follow-up (MD 44.69, 95% CI 24.01 to 65.37; 13 studies, 2071 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect exceeded the MCID of 35 metres and was even greater at short-term (MD 52.26, 95% CI 32.39 to 72.74; 17 RCTs, 1390 participants) and long-term (MD 48.83, 95% CI 16.37 to 80.49; 6 RCTs, 7288 participants) follow-up. The number of participants with respiratory-related admissions was reduced from 324 per 1000 participants in the control group to 235 per 1000 participants in the IDM group (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; 15 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 4207 participants; high-certainty evidence). Likewise, IDM probably results in a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.93; 9 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 8791 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), a slight reduction in all-cause hospital admissions (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57 to 0.98; 10 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 9030 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and fewer hospital days per person admitted (MD -2.27, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.56; 14 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 3563 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Statistically significant improvement was noted on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale at short- and medium-term follow-up but not at long-term follow-up. No differences between groups were reported for mortality, courses of antibiotics/prednisolone, dyspnoea, and depression and anxiety scores. Subgroup analysis of dominant intervention components and regions of study suggested context- and intervention-specific effects. However, some subgroup analyses were marked by considerable heterogeneity or included few studies. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that IDM probably results in improvement in disease-specific QoL, exercise capacity, hospital admissions, and hospital days per person. Future research should evaluate which combination of IDM components and which intervention duration are most effective for IDM programmes, and should consider contextual determinants of implementation and treatment effect, including process-related outcomes, long-term follow-up, and cost-effectiveness analyses.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^111gcyKU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^1151AXqw]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the disease and its burden to society [^111aWtUn]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multicomponent disease with inflammation at its core, and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It represents a substantial economic and social burden throughout the world. Currently, COPD is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and despite advances in management, mortality is expected to increase in the coming decades, in marked contrast to other chronic diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, where there have been considerable decreases in mortality. On a patient level, the burden of COPD to patients and their families and carers is high, both in terms of health-related quality of life and health status. Health care providers and patients often underestimate the substantial morbidity associated with COPD; the condition is also frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, which further compromises morbidity. Reducing the burden of COPD requires better evaluation and diagnosis, as well as improved management of chronic symptoms. As exacerbations and hospitalizations represent an important driver of the cost and morbidity of COPD, high priority should be given to interventions aimed at delaying the progression of disease, preventing exacerbations, and reducing the risk of comorbidities to alleviate the clinical and economic burden of disease.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^112xkJej]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — aims, assessment, and therapy review: The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk, COPD patients should have an assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors and comorbidities to guide management, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary with further reviews undertaken.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Measuring disease activity in COPD: is clinically important deterioration the answer? [^114NfPPb]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), personalized clinical management is key to optimizing patient outcomes. Important treatment goals include minimizing disease activity and preventing disease progression; however, quantification of these components remains a challenge. Growing evidence suggests that decline over time in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV₁), traditionally the key marker of disease progression, may not be sufficient to fully determine deterioration across COPD populations. In addition, there is a lack of evidence showing that currently available multidimensional COPD indexes improve clinical decision-making, treatment, or patient outcomes. The composite clinically important deterioration (CID) endpoint was developed to assess disease worsening by detecting early deteriorations in lung function (measured by FEV₁), health status (assessed by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and the presence of exacerbations. Post hoc and prospective analyses of clinical trial data have confirmed that the multidimensional composite CID endpoint better predicts poorer medium-term outcomes compared with any single CID component alone, and that it can demonstrate differences in treatment efficacy in short-term trials. Given the widely acknowledged need for an individualized holistic approach to COPD management, monitoring short-term CID has the potential to facilitate early identification of suboptimal treatment responses and patients at risk of increased disease progression. CID monitoring may lead to better-informed clinical management decisions and potentially improved prognosis.

### Measuring disease activity in COPD: is clinically important deterioration the answer? [^115yBATU]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogenous condition with many components to its clinical presentation, including dyspnea, cough (with or without sputum), airflow limitation, reduced exercise capacity/fatigue, weight loss and exacerbations. As these components vary in both their presence and severity, personalization of the assessment and clinical management of COPD is key to optimizing patient outcomes, and is a proposed treatment approach according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report.

The key features of COPD fall into three categories: (i) disease severity, which is the degree of functional impairment such as airflow limitation, hyperinflation and reduced exercise capacity; (ii) disease activity, such as exacerbations; and (iii) disease impact, which considers the patient's perception of their disease. These aspects of COPD are intrinsically linked, with disease activity driving disease progression, which in turn worsens disease severity and increases the impact on the patient (Fig. 1).

The GOLD report describes key treatment goals for the pharmacological management of stable COPD, which include reducing the risk of future COPD exacerbations, thereby minimizing disease activity and preventing disease progression. The ultimate aim of this treatment approach is to reduce the level of disease impact on the patient. However, in both clinical studies and clinical practice, the quantification of disease activity and progression remains a challenge. This is due to both the lack of a clear definition to describe these terms, and a lack of clarity on how best to monitor disease progression.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1174THsp]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Background — global burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that COPD is one of the top three causes of death worldwide and 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for 6% of all deaths globally. COPD represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable and treatable, and the COPD burden is projected to increase in coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^1176u5nN]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### Current concepts in targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pharmacotherapy: making progress towards personalised management [^1177njLN]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disorder that is responsible for substantial and growing morbidity, mortality, and health-care expense worldwide. Of imperative importance to decipher the complexity of COPD is to identify groups of patients with similar clinical characteristics, prognosis, or therapeutic needs, the so-called clinical phenotypes. This strategy is logical for research but might be of little clinical value because clinical phenotypes can overlap in the same patient and the same clinical phenotype could result from different biological mechanisms. With the goal to match assessment with treatment choices, the latest iteration of guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease reorganised treatment objectives into two categories: to improve symptoms (ie, dyspnoea and health status) and to decrease future risk (as predicted by forced expiratory volume in 1 s level and exacerbations history). This change thus moves treatment closer to individualised medicine with available bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet, future treatment options are likely to include targeting endotypes that represent subtypes of patients defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Specific biomarkers of these endotypes would be particularly useful in clinical practice, especially in patients in which clinical phenotype alone is insufficient to identify the underlying endotype. A few series of potential COPD endotypes and biomarkers have been suggested. Empirical knowledge will be gained from proof-of-concept trials in COPD with emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways. In every instance, specific endotype and biomarker efforts will probably be needed for the success of these trials, because the pathways are likely to be operative in only a subset of patients. Network analysis of human diseases offers the possibility to improve understanding of disease pathobiological complexity and to help with the development of new treatment alternatives and, importantly, a reclassification of complex diseases. All these developments should pave the way towards personalised treatment of patients with COPD in the clinic.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: definition, assessment, and prevention [^111hqJFp]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. COPD, however, is a heterogeneous collection of diseases with differing causes, pathogenic mechanisms, and physiological effects. Therefore a comprehensive approach to COPD prevention will need to address the complexity of COPD. Advances in the understanding of the natural history of COPD and the development of strategies to assess COPD in its early stages make prevention a reasonable, if ambitious, goal.

### COPD, a multicomponent disease: implications for management [^1142keuE]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multicomponent disease. These components affect both the lungs and organs outside the lungs (the so-called systemic effects of COPD) and can be of either a structural (including airway remodelling, emphysema, skeletal muscle wasting) or functional nature (inflammation, apoptosis, senescence). Further, these components are interdependent in a closely linked 'vicious cycle'. Accordingly, optimal therapies should therefore aim to address more than one of these components to break such a cycle. This needs to be considered not only in the development of future treatments but also in the current clinical management of patients with COPD. In this paper, evidence that supports the concept that COPD is a multicomponent disease is presented. The effects of currently available therapeutic options, including long-acting anticholinergics and long-acting beta2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid combination therapies, upon each of these components is reviewed. In addition, potential new avenues for drug development and improved patient care are highlighted. By developing a better understanding of how different therapies impact upon the 'vicious cycle' of COPD, treatment regimens can be optimised to provide the greatest benefits to patients.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^1175DeBf]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — problems associated with management — COPD is described as a progressive disease with systemic manifestations and common comorbidities, and optimal management requires a holistic approach with three necessary components: (1) the recognition and treatment of all aspects of the disease, its systemic effects and co-morbidities; (2) the bringing together of all the dimensions of COPD care in a continuum through the lifetime of the patient; and (3) the integration of medical care among healthcare professionals and across healthcare sectors using a patient-centered approach. The comorbidity burden is highlighted: patients with COPD have, on average, 3.7 other chronic medical conditions, compared with 1.8 for patients with other chronic illnesses, and over half of deaths in patients with COPD are from comorbid conditions; the report adds that focusing therapy solely on reversing airway obstruction is suboptimal care and will likely produce suboptimal outcomes.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111wysD3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) self-management — principles and expected effects: Self-management education and coaching by healthcare professionals should be a major component of the Chronic Care Model within the healthcare delivery system. The aim of self-management interventions is to motivate, engage and coach patients to positively adapt health behaviors and develop skills for day-to-day COPD management, and clinicians need to go beyond pure didactic education to help patients adopt sustainable skills. It is important to recognize that patient education alone does not itself change behavior or motivate patients and has had no impact on improving exercise performance or lung function, but it can improve skills, ability to cope with illness, and health status. Implicit in education is provision of self-management support/coaching by healthcare providers to arm patients with knowledge, confidence, and skills, and individualized risk assessment, needs, preferences, and goals should inform the personalized design of the self-management education plan.

### Self-management strategies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a first step toward personalized medicine [^1155UeDH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Self-management has gained increased relevance in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The heterogeneity in self-management interventions has complicated the development of recommendations for clinical practice. In this review, we present the latest findings regarding conceptual definition, effectiveness of self-management interventions and self-management strategies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a first step toward personalized medicine: what, how and to whom?

Recent Findings

Self-management interventions have shown benefits in improving health-related quality of life and reducing hospital admissions. Favorable outcomes can only be achieved if patients have an ultimate goal, that is their desired achievements in their life. In the continuum of care, the components of the self-management program will vary to adapt to the condition of the patient (disease severity, comorbidities) and to factors such as patient motivation, confidence (self-efficacy), access to health care, family and social support. A combination of education, case management and patient-centric action plan has shown the best chance of success.

Summary

The individual patient's needs, own preferences and personal goals should inform the design of any intervention with a behavioral component. A continuous loop process has to be implemented to constantly assess what work and does not work, aiming at achieving the desired outcomes for a given patient.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113TWLay]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological management uses a separate follow-up algorithm based on two key treatable traits — persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of exacerbations — and is designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment or after years of follow-up; these recommendations incorporate evidence from clinical trials and the use of peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for exacerbation prevention.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: on an exponential curve of progress [^111i5vDJ]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

The last 50 years have witnessed major progress in our understanding of the underlying nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and approaches to care. During the last 10 years, however, there has been an explosive expansion of knowledge related to this disorder. Large-scale epidemiologic studies show that COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and will be the fifth leading health burden worldwide by the year 2020. We have also learned that COPD is an inflammatory disorder of small airways, which presents new opportunities for therapy involving interfering with the early components of the inflammatory cascade. Unfortunately, most clinicians fail to perform spirometric screening of at-risk individuals, so most patients first present with COPD during a sudden exacerbation of the disease. Worldwide interest is emerging in promoting earlier diagnosis and finding new pharmacologic interventions to halt the progression of airway and parenchymal damage. In this review, evidence is presented that we are on the upward limb of an exponential curve of progress in managing COPD, which will produce major advances in our ability to recognize and treat this disorder in its earliest stages.

### Management of severe COPD [^115pVopx]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the burden of the disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention. Apart from smoking cessation, no approach or agent affects the rate of decline in lung function and progression of the disease. Especially in the later phase, COPD is a multicomponent disorder, and various integrated intervention strategies are needed as part of the optimum management programme. This seminar describes largely non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving health status and function of disabled patients. Exacerbations become progressively more troublesome as baseline lung function declines, commonly necessitating hospital admission and associated with the development of acute respiratory failure.

### Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beyond the lungs [^1126Svoi]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term that covers many clinical subtypes with clearly different pulmonary and extra-pulmonary characteristics, but with persistent airflow limitation in common. This insight has led to the development of a more personalised approach in bronchodilator therapy, prevention of exacerbations, and advanced treatments (such as non-invasive ventilation and lung volume reduction techniques). However, systemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD also contribute to different clinical phenotypes and warrant an individualised approach as part of integrated disease management. Alterations in bodyweight and composition, from cachexia to obesity, demand specific management. Psychological symptoms are highly prevalent, and thorough diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Moreover, prevention of exacerbations requires interventions beyond the lungs, including treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and management of dyspnoea and anxiety. In this Review, we discuss the management of COPD beyond the respiratory system and propose treatment strategies on the basis of the latest research and best practices.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^112Hnj1C]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

The key target audiences of national and international guidelines

Identifying the key target audience is a critical step in the development of CPGs. The audience is broad, and includes healthcare practitioners with varying levels of specialisation and expertise, as well as non-healthcare professionals. Pulmonologists, general practitioners (GPs), other healthcare professionals, patients, payors and policy-makers are the primary audiences of COPD guidelines.

Although not directly involved in the delivery of patient care, healthcare payors, policy-makers and regulatory agencies also comprise the readership of CPGs. Recommendations that relieve the burden of disease (e.g. reduce the frequency or severity of costly exacerbations) or strategies to encourage early diagnosis in COPD patients can be of considerable benefit to payors. Payors rely on CPGs and robust efficacy evidence in order to make informed decisions on funding and reimbursement policies of specific therapies. Policy-makers also need CPGs to develop adequate prevention strategies and to build pathways of care. Guidelines are heavily regarded by regulatory authorities, which may impact the design of clinical trials. This is of significant importance when regulatory authorities adopt the definition or diagnostic criteria used by a particular guideline when defining the requirements for novel drugs, thereby (and perhaps inadvertently) influencing the design of clinical trials.

Who is involved in the development of CPGs?

Guidelines that are intended for widespread use in clinical practice should include relevant stakeholders at various and appropriate stages of the development process, which may encourage improved implementation and adherence of the recommendations through an increased sense of ownership. Although it may not be appropriate for all stakeholders to take an active role in the development process from the beginning, certain groups may participate in the drafting of recommendations or at the review stages.

Academic or clinical expert involvement in guideline preparation should include GPs, pulmonologists, nurses and physiotherapists where appropriate. As the majority of COPD care is administered by GPs, their involvement in guideline development may drive increased primary care physician-specialist communication and integration, which is crucial in the management of COPD, particularly when patient referral is necessary. Input from nurses, cardiologists, physiotherapists and dieticians may also add value and clinical expertise to guidelines in the pathways of care.

Importantly, guidelines should involve all "end-users", including patients, non-expert practitioners and payors to ensure that the guidelines address the right questions from a family or society perspective. Critically, this may also help to incorporate patient preferences into the guidelines. Increased involvement may encourage patients to play a more active role in their healthcare management.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112xFViT]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

GOLD 2025 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) report methodology — program history, update cycle, search strategy, and review process are specified as follows: The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) program was initiated in 1998; the first report was issued in 2001; complete revisions were prepared in 2006 and 2011; and the GOLD Science Committee was established in 2002 to review research and to post yearly updates. This 2025 GOLD Report is the second update of the 2023-revised report, and the 2023 GOLD Report was the 5th major revision. Updates of the 2017-revised report were made in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; updates of the 2011-revised report were released in January 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Evidence identification used a PubMed search with Committee-defined fields: 1) COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (All Fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-analysis (All Fields) OR 3) articles in the top 20 medical or respiratory journals (available on request) or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; publications not captured by the search could be submitted in English. Each abstract is assigned to two unbiased Committee members, and reviewers answer four specific written questions to assess impact on recommendations and identify modifications; the GOLD Science Committee meets twice yearly to discuss potentially impactful publications, the full Committee reaches a consensus on inclusion or change to the report, and in the absence of consensus disagreements are decided by an open vote of the full Committee.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

American Thoracic Society workshop — integrated care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emphasizes that "COPD, as a chronic, complex illness with multiple systemic effects and co-morbidities, requires an integrated approach for its optimal management", defining integrated care as "a continuum of patient-centered services organized as a care delivery value chain for patients with chronic conditions with the goal of achieving the optimal daily functioning and health status for the individual patient and to achieve and maintain the individual's independence and functioning in the community". The chronic care model "provides a template for integrating care, by encompassing six key components: self- management support, clinical information systems, delivery system redesign, decision support (guidelines), healthcare organization, and community resources". The report notes limitations of disease-specific guidance as "Disease-specific clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) often fall short in patients with multiple morbidities and trying to implement several disease-specific CPGs can pose an onerous treatment burden and increase the risk of adverse drug events", and highlights the evidence gap that "evidence-based literature specifically pertaining to the complex patient with COPD is still early in development". The workshop discussion indicates contextual tailoring, stating "one size will not fit all", and adds a goal "to: (1) highlight the problems associated with the care of the complex patient with COPD".

### Clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of therapeutic interventions [^116UpyQX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function. Based on clinical evidence, the management of COPD should focus on (1) earlier diagnosis; (2) risk reduction through smoking cessation, decreased exposure to inhaled irritants, and immunization against respiratory pathogens; (3) symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation; (4) decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations and improving pulmonary function; and (5) improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and to reduce mortality — including deaths due to lung cancer, other respiratory disease (including COPD), and cardiovascular disease. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines advocate interventions according to the severity of COPD and recommend initiation of maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate disease. However, recent evidence from a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of tiotropium suggests that initiation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy at earlier stages of disease may also provide improvements in lung function and HRQOL. The results of ongoing long-term studies may soon provide evidence that in addition to relieving symptoms and improving patient HRQOL, specific pharmacologic therapies may also alter the clinical course of COPD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1116cCTQ]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — supported self-management: We suggest offering a supported self-management program that includes a written action plan with exacerbation management, smoking cessation, and exercise (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence notes significant improvement in quality of life (QoL) when key components are included, with subgroup analysis in a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs showing even greater QoL improvement in programs with smoking cessation, and another meta-analysis of 10 RCTs showing improved activity and physical function with an exacerbation action plan, exercise training, and COPD education; without these components many studies did not have statistically significant QoL improvement. The evidence also states there was not a significant difference in mortality or rates of worsening of adverse events, including COPD-related hospitalizations; in exercise studies only two had improvement of dyspnea, a meta-analysis of five RCTs found aerobic exercise training had clinical significance on QoL, and no harms were found with supported self-management.

### Outpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: going for the GOLD [^116i4CXh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with a burden of $50 billion in direct health care costs. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines airflow obstruction as spirometry where the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity after bronchodilation is less than 0.70. The guidelines also provided graded recommendations on current therapy for COPD. Treatment can be guided based on severity of disease and severity of symptoms. We review the GOLD guidelines to provide an overview of treatment modalities aimed at improving lung function, reducing hospitalization, and reducing mortality.

### An update on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2017 guidelines with a focus on classification and management of stable COPD [^113ec6q6]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV₁ is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

### Moving towards a treatable traits model of care for the management of obstructive airways diseases [^1114GLAq]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two prevalent chronic airways diseases. Both are complex and heterogeneous. Traditionally, clinical guidelines have advocated a stepwise approach to pharmacotherapy of asthma and COPD, but there is increasing realization that both require a more personalized and precise management approach. To this end, a management strategy based on the so-called Treatable Traits has been proposed. Emerging evidence suggests that this model improves relevant outcomes in patients with chronic airway diseases but further research is needed to guide implementation. This review discusses the challenges, opportunities, and hurdles that its implementation will have to face.

### What have we learned from large drug treatment trials in COPD? [^114YdapF]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Although the development of effective treatments for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been seen as a high priority, the past decade has seen a substantial increase in the number of clinical studies examining different treatments for this disease. Large studies are needed to adequately assess the effectiveness of treatment because of the chronic nature of the disease and the intermittent occurrence of some key outcomes such as exacerbations. Data from randomised controlled trials show that treatment improves exercise performance by increasing lung volume rather than changing expiratory flow. Although assessment of lung function remains the cornerstone of drug assessment, improvements in health status, the number of exacerbations and admissions to hospital are now recognised as important treatment outcomes. Randomised controlled trial data provide the best evidence for treatment efficacy, but results of these studies can be affected by differences in inclusion criteria and patient dropout during the study. Bronchodilator reversibility testing does not reliably define subgroups that will respond to a particular treatment. Carefully done and adequately powered clinical trials continue to inform, not only our views about treatment, but also our understanding of COPD and how it is best assessed and managed. Ensuring that these expensive studies are done objectively to the highest standard is an important goal for the next decade.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^112ntWoN]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal care of the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires an individualized, patient-centered approach that recognizes and treats all aspects of the disease, addresses the systemic effects and comorbidities, and integrates medical care among healthcare professionals and across healthcare sectors. In many ways the integration of medical care for COPD is still in its infancy, and its implementation will undoubtedly represent a paradigm shift in our thinking. This article summarizes the proceedings of a workshop, The Integrated Care of the COPD Patient, which was funded by the American Thoracic Society. This workshop included participants who were chosen because of their expertise in the area as well as their firsthand experience with disease management models. Our summary describes the concepts of integrated care and chronic disease management, details specific components of disease management as they may apply to the patient with COPD, and provides several innovative examples of COPD disease management programs originating from different healthcare systems. It became clear from the discussions and review of the literature that more high-quality research in this area is vital. It is our hope that the information presented here provides a "call to arms" in this regard.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113zhenN]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) non-pharmacological therapy — self-management interventions are supported by systematic reviews reporting improved outcomes, including that interventions for people with COPD are associated with improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a lower probability of respiratory-related hospital admissions, and no excess respiratory-related and all-cause mortality risks, and this strengthens the view that self-management interventions are unlikely to cause harm. Prior reviews noted no effect on all-cause mortality in overall analyses, and independent, well-designed studies (COMET and PIC-COPD) have shown the potential for reduction in mortality from integrated case management with self-management interventions. In contrast, in patients recently discharged from hospital after COPD exacerbation, an RCT found that implementation of a comprehensive 3-month program resulted in nearly two-fold higher rates of COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency visits over 6 months, and these data suggest increased health care service utilization compared with usual care. Across studies, heterogeneity in interventions, application, populations, follow-up times and outcomes makes generalization difficult in real life.

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the worry of developing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well as the effects of the pandemic on the basic functions of society and/or social services pertaining to their health imposes additional stressors to their condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has made routine management and diagnosis of COPD more difficult as a result of reductions in face-to-face consultations, difficulties in performing spirometry, and limitations in traditional pulmonary rehabilitation and home care programs. Patients have also faced shortages of medication.

The dramatic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been accompanied by an enormous number of publications on the virus and its consequences. The statements made in this report (Table 1) use the published Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) approach to data review and should be seen as provisional based on the best assessment of the current evidence, including papers published or available up to the September 11, 2020. As new evidence emerges, this report will be updated at regular intervals, and updates will be posted on the GOLD website.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1126wEPi]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Progress in management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by declining prevalence and expanding therapeutic options: The age-adjusted prevalence has declined since 1999, possibly due to overall population decrease in smoking rates, and COPD is now recognized as a significant public health problem with a greater amount of research being conducted on mechanisms and treatment effectiveness. Pharmacologic therapy is improving with better understanding of the disease process and novel drugs, and non-pharmacologic therapy, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, is becoming increasingly recognized as an effective option; while these treatment methods may not be appropriate for all patients, they allow providers to intervene early with numerous effective treatment options and increasing research and effective management strategies allow optimism that COPD can be managed effectively to provide patients with an improved QoL.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk — lung function trajectories and early-life determinants: Lung function trajectories vary across life, with trajectories above normal linked to healthier aging and those below normal linked to higher disease burden, and spirometry is framed as a global health marker. Reduced maximal attained lung function by spirometry identifies individuals at increased COPD risk, while early-life factors including birthweight and other "childhood disadvantage factors" are key determinants of adult lung function. In three independent longitudinal cohorts, approximately 50% of COPD development was attributed to accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the other 50% to abnormal lung growth and development with normal decline over time.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

### Systematic review of the effects of chronic disease management on quality-of-life in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115HpKqh]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic disease management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may improve quality, outcomes and access to care.

Objective

To investigate effectiveness of chronic disease management programmes on the quality-of-life of people with COPD.

Methods

Medline and Embase (1995–2005) were searched for relevant articles, and reference lists and abstracts were searched for controlled trials of chronic disease management programmes for patients with COPD. Quality-of-life was assessed as an outcome parameter. Two reviewers independently reviewed each paper for methodological quality and extracted the data.

Results

We found 10 randomized-controlled trials comparing chronic disease management with routine care. Patient populations, health-care professionals, intensity, and content of the intervention were heterogeneous. Different instruments were used to assess quality of life. Five out of 10 studies showed statistically significant positive outcomes on one or more domains of the quality of life instruments. Three studies, partly located in primary care, showed positive results.

Conclusions

All chronic disease management projects for people with COPD involving primary care improved quality of life. In most of the studies, aspects of chronic disease management were applied to a limited extent. Quality of randomized-controlled trials was not optimal. More research is needed on chronic disease management programmes in patients with COPD across primary and secondary care.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) self-management education — healthcare utilization outcomes: A Cochrane review of 14 randomized trials found that self-management training reduced the probability of at least one hospital admission compared with usual care with odds ratio (OR), 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47 to 0.89 with a 1-year number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 for individuals with a 51% risk of exacerbation and an NNT of 24 for those with a 13% risk; however, data were insufficient to formulate clear recommendations on the form and contents of COPD self-management programs. A systematic review reported that self-management training as part of a multiple-component disease management intervention can reduce health care use, whereas interventions applying self-management alone are unlikely to show this benefit; studies showing benefits commonly included an action plan for exacerbations and case management.

### Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1123pXx1]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with a substantial economic impact. Recent changes in the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance refined the classification of patients for treatment using a combination of spirometry, assessment of symptoms, and/or frequency of exacerbations. The aim of treatment remains to reduce existing symptoms while decreasing the risk of future adverse health events. Long-acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy due to their proven efficacy. GOLD guidelines recommend combining long-acting bronchodilators with differing mechanisms of action if the control of COPD is insufficient with monotherapy, and recent years have seen growing interest in the additional benefits that combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), typified by tiotropium, with long-acting β₂-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol. Most studies have examined free combinations of currently available LAMAs and LABAs, broadly showing a benefit in terms of lung function and other patient-reported outcomes, although evidence is limited at present. Several once- or twice-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations are under development, most involving newly developed monotherapy components. This review outlines the existing data for LAMA/LABA combinations in the treatment of COPD, summarizes the ongoing trials, and considers the evidence required to inform the role of LAMA/LABA combinations in treatment of this disease.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a profound effect on the patient's health status and decline in lung function; they also impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations is listed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as among the major objectives of COPD management, and it is therefore an important outcome measure when studying any new agent. This article discusses pharmacologic therapy and other measures for preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating and progressive disease that is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, affecting up to 1 in 10 older adults. Common symptoms, including dyspnea, productive cough, chest tightness, and fatigue, can reduce quality of life, the ability to participate in all types of activities, and overall health status in patients. Minimizing the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life should be a key goal for physicians, and modest changes in current practice could make improvements in patients' lives. Here we review chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, its impact on patients, and how to improve symptom management.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^114cTkgx]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Integrated care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — definition, core components, outcomes, and gaps — integrated care is described as the global, patient-focused, and interdisciplinary delivery of high-quality care that addresses the disease, its systemic manifestations, and its comorbidities; it encompasses disease prevention, promotion of a healthy lifestyle, early disease recognition and enhanced case finding, optimization of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy with the help of evidence-based guidelines, self management education, and coordination of hospital and community services, and aims to improve processes and outcomes by making more efficient use of scant healthcare resources. A systematic review concluded that applying the chronic disease model to COPD management resulted in fewer emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and hospital-days, with these positive outcomes realized only in programs that included at least two of advanced access to knowledgeable healthcare providers, self-management education and support including individualized action plans, guideline-based therapy, and a clinical registry system. Comorbidity impacts significantly on COPD progression, healthcare utilization and mortality, single disease guidelines are woefully inadequate in patients with multiple comorbidities, the implementation of integrated care is in its infancy, and more high-quality research is needed.

### Real-world effectiveness study of guideline-directed COPD STANDARDized management in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cluster randomised trial design [^1128xESt]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects the ageing population worldwide. Exacerbations worsen health status and increase health resource use. Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited.

Methods and Analysis

A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

### Effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^112Wtxyn]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary rehabilitation plays a key role in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the American Thoracic Society recently provided a grade of 1A for evidence of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) benefits related to pulmonary rehabilitation, knowledge about the psychological and behavioral processes explaining the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on HRQoL in COPD patients remains limited. This review describes the state of knowledge over the past year concerning HRQoL benefits after pulmonary rehabilitation and suggests avenues for future research.

Recent Findings

HRQoL outcomes related to pulmonary rehabilitation explores five themes: optimizing pulmonary rehabilitation components to improve HRQoL; characterization of a responder phenotype; suitability of pulmonary rehabilitation following acute exacerbations; exploration of psychological and behavioral mechanisms explaining pulmonary rehabilitation benefits; and long-term maintenance of HRQoL benefits after pulmonary rehabilitation.

Summary

Evidence supports the use of pulmonary rehabilitation to improve HRQoL in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. However, it is unclear how pulmonary rehabilitation improves HRQoL and which characteristics confer the greatest HRQoL benefits. Moreover, most studies failed to provide a compelling theoretical rationale for the intervention employed. Future research should focus on improving the understanding of the psychological mechanisms implicated in the adoption and maintenance of healthy behavior.

Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Future perspectives in COPD [^1165tF7z]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is complex. The development of a multidimensional index — such as the BODE index — provides a means of classifying patients with COPD that also correlates with their prognosis. The individual components of the BODE index — body mass index (B), airflow obstruction (O) dyspnoea (D) and exercise capacity (E) — incorporate the pulmonary as well as the systemic effects seen in patients with COPD. Recent research has focussed on examining these impairments (including those of metabolism and inflammation) more carefully, and determining the effects of treatment on both the systemic and physiological aspects of COPD. Ongoing research initiatives by the public and private sector will contribute to our understanding of the disease processes underlying COPD, our understanding of the benefits associated with commonly used pharmacotherapies, as well as laying the foundations for the development of new agents and therapeutic tools. Advances in the use of pharmacotherapy have been mirrored by research to better define the benefits associated with pulmonary rehabilitation. Many questions remain to be answered, but a comprehensive approach is now considered essential to the life-long management of COPD, and will undoubtedly reduce the considerable socio-economic burden of COPD.

Background: This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort on the part of a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations: 1) a strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance; 2) a conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year; 3) a conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year; 4) no recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS is conditionally recommended as an additive therapy; 5) a conditional recommendation against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations; and 6) a conditional recommendation for opioid-based therapy in patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy. Conclusions: The task force made recommendations regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD based on currently available evidence. Additional research in populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials is needed, including studies in patients with COPD 80 years of age and older, those with multiple chronic health conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma.

COPD as part of multi-morbidity should be recognized since an increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi-morbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients; multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events; there is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi-morbidity, but it should be kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease; treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often exposed to.

Applying integrated care concepts to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outlines a systems approach that promotes collaboration across hospital and community services to maintain health and prevent admissions, with patients often managed in the community and referred to specialists when appropriate; a locally agreed-upon integrated care pathway guides this process and collaborative self-management is a key feature. Another application is a patient-centered, holistic approach based on the patient's unique needs, with services coordinated among healthcare providers; in the absence of substantial disease modification, palliative care is an important component of ongoing management, and another dimension is implementing a unified care plan for the multi-morbid patient with COPD.

Evolving COPD guidelines

2011 saw a substantial revision of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD, which has recently been updated. Recommendations for treatment are no longer based primarily on categorization ("staging") by spirometric assessment, but on categorization by existing symptoms (using validated modified Medical Research Council and COPD Assessment Test questionnaires) and risk (based on severity of airflow limitation and history of exacerbations). This approach acknowledges the importance of consideration of both short- and long-term outcomes when making treatment decisions (Figure 1).

### The DOSE index in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evaluating healthcare costs [^116zkwzD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive and debilitating respiratory condition characterized by persistent airflow limitation and respiratory symptoms. Globally, it affects millions of individuals, imposing a significant burden on their physical, emotional, and socioeconomic well-being. COPD's severity is influenced by a complex interaction of factors, including shortness of breath, airflow obstruction, smoking history, and exacerbation frequency ​. Accurately assessing this multifaceted burden is essential for developing effective treatment plans that improve patients' quality of life​ ​.

The DOSE (Dyspnea, Obstruction, Smoking, Exacerbation) index offers a multidimensional approach to evaluating COPD severity This index incorporates four key components, each contributing to a comprehensive assessment ​. Dyspnea, the hallmark symptom of COPD, impacts patients' physical and emotional well-being, with its severity assessed using standardized questionnaires or scales. Airflow obstruction, a central feature of COPD, is measured through spirometry, particularly by evaluating forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Smoking history, both current and past, plays a critical role in understanding disease progression, while the frequency of exacerbations — acute worsening episodes often leading to hospitalizations — provides further insight into disease burden ​.

By integrating these elements, the DOSE index delivers a comprehensive evaluation of COPD severity, allowing clinicians to capture a broader and more accurate picture of each patient's health status​. This holistic perspective facilitates the development of personalized treatment plans that include pharmacological interventions, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lifestyle modifications to meet the individual needs of COPD patients. Additionally, the DOSE index has demonstrated potential as a prognostic tool for predicting disease progression, hospitalization risk, and overall mortality ​.

While other indices, such as the BODE (Body-mass index, Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise) and ADO (Age, Dyspnea, Obstruction) indices, are widely used to assess COPD severity and prognosis, the DOSE index uniquely incorporates exacerbations — a key factor in healthcare cost escalation. Exacerbations, often resulting in hospital admissions, drive significant healthcare expenditures in COPD management. Therefore, understanding the relationship between the DOSE index and healthcare costs is essential for optimizing resource allocation in COPD care​. This study aims to explore whether the DOSE index can serve as a valuable tool for predicting healthcare costs in COPD, in addition to its established role in risk assessment.

End-of-life care in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — research recommendations focus on evaluating communication, education, and symptom management. We recommend studies that demonstrate the impact of palliative care and end-of-life discussions on outcomes in patients with stable COPD; studies of educational approaches and tools to help clinicians better discuss palliative care and end-of-life care with patients with COPD; studies to confirm the importance of symptoms that impact patients with COPD at the end of life; and studies that identify symptoms that occur despite optimized COPD care and require palliation, followed by trials that compare the effects of various treatment options on those symptoms.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up after therapy initiation — following implementation of therapy, patients should be reassessed for attainment of treatment goals and identification of any barriers for successful treatment; following review of the patient's response to treatment initiation, adjustments may be needed. This is guided by the principles of first review and assess, then adjust if necessary, including to review symptoms (dyspnea) and exacerbation risk (previous history, blood eosinophils), assess inhaler technique and adherence and the role of non-pharmacological approaches, and adjust pharmacological treatment including escalation or de-escalation; switching inhaler device or molecules within the same class may be considered as appropriate, and any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side effects.

### Effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme of 8 weeks compared to 12 weeks duration on exercise capacity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PuRe duration): protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^117W41p3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is ranked eighth in causes of disease burden around the world, and is one of the leading causes of death by a non-communicable diseases. Currently, there is no cure for COPD, so management should involve both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions which can prevent decline of physical function and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the key, non-pharmacological component in the management of COPD and has been shown to improve breathlessness, HRQoL and exercise capacity and reduce hospital admissions and length of stay in people with COPD. The duration of PR programmes reported in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) varies greatly, from 4 weeks to 18 months, with the majority of these being between 6 and 12 weeks in duration.PR programmes of 8 weeks duration are recommended in guidelines and statements; however, there is no strong evidence on the optimal duration of PR programmes. The most recent Cochrane review on PR for COPDstated that the optimal duration of PR programmes is unclear as the available evidence was insufficient to determine this.

There have been several trials that have studied the effects of the duration of PR programmes on exercise capacity and HRQoL; however, a systematic review of these RCTswas not able to perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in programme durations and outcome measures, therefore no strong recommendations on programme duration are available. Of the five studies included in the systematic review, two compared a 4-week supervised exercise programme to a 7-week programme in people with COPD, one compared 8 weeks to 20 weeksand two compared 12 weeks to 72 weeks (18 months). While the quality of most of these studies was low, the overall conclusion was that comparatively longer programmes showed slightly better improvements in HRQoL than shorter programmes, while results for differences in exercise capacity were equivocal. Longer PR programmes are more expensive to deliver, and current evidence cannot determine whether longer programmes provide significantly greater benefits for people with COPD in terms of both exercise capacity and HRQoL.
