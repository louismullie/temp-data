## Question

So my first question the s Amlodipine I was talking about is the s(-) Amlodipine.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about S-amlodipine, specifically what it is, how it differs from racemic amlodipine, its pharmacology, clinical efficacy, safety, dosing, regulatory status, and practical prescribing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chiral chemistry and pharmacologic activity. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data versus racemate. Next, I will review clinical efficacy and safety from randomized trials. After that, I need to check dosing, regulatory availability, and guideline positioning. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight limitations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: amlodipine is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers, and the calcium channel–blocking activity resides almost entirely in the S-enantiomer, which is roughly 1000-fold more potent than the R-enantiomer, so S-amlodipine is the pharmacologically active moiety within racemic amlodipine [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic equivalence claim before I jump ahead. In a randomized crossover study in healthy volunteers, S-amlodipine 5 mg produced exposure to the active S-enantiomer that was bioequivalent to racemic amlodipine 10 mg, with 90% confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC falling within the 80–125% acceptance window, supporting the idea that 5 mg of S-amlodipine delivers comparable S-enantiomer exposure to 10 mg of the racemate [^1179wowG]. Hold on, I should also check hemodynamic data; in separate single-dose studies, S-amlodipine 5 mg and racemic amlodipine 10 mg showed no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate effects, reinforcing pharmacodynamic comparability in healthy subjects [^111YG2in].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy in hypertension. In an 8-week, phase III, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial in Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension, S-amlodipine nicotinate 2.5 mg (titrated to 5 mg if needed) was noninferior to racemic amlodipine besylate 5 mg for diastolic blood pressure reduction, with similar systolic blood pressure changes and response rates, supporting comparable antihypertensive efficacy at approximately half the racemate dose [^1137a7FM]. Let me consider whether this translates to real-world dosing; given the pharmacokinetic equivalence, many clinicians equate S-amlodipine 2.5–5 mg to racemic amlodipine 5–10 mg, though I should note that head-to-head dose-ranging trials are limited and regional labeling may vary [^1179wowG] [^1137a7FM].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully. Across randomized studies, S-amlodipine has shown a safety profile comparable to racemic amlodipine, with no consistent signal for more adverse events and similar rates of common effects like headache, flushing, dizziness, and peripheral edema, although edema remains the most frequent dose-related adverse effect for dihydropyridine CCBs and is more common in women [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in] [^111c5jRo]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought S-amlodipine might reduce edema because it avoids the inactive R-enantiomer, but I should correct that assumption; there is no robust evidence that S-amlodipine meaningfully reduces edema versus racemate, and edema risk remains dose dependent and higher in women, so I should not overstate that potential advantage without data [^111c5jRo].

> Let me think about dosing and formulation nuances. Typical dosing of S-amlodipine uses 2.5–5 mg daily, aligning with the concept that 2.5–5 mg of the S-enantiomer approximates 5–10 mg of the racemate in terms of active drug exposure, though I should emphasize that precise dose conversion depends on the specific salt and regional approval, and clinicians should follow local labeling rather than assume a universal 1:2 ratio [^1179wowG] [^1137a7FM]. I should double-check that S-amlodipine is not a standard option in many markets; indeed, availability is region-specific, with formulations like S-amlodipine nicotinate or gentisate studied primarily in Korea, whereas racemic amlodipine besylate remains the globally dominant, guideline-endorsed formulation [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in] [^1124oCPc].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure I'm not overstating adoption. Contemporary U.S. and international hypertension guidelines list amlodipine as a first-line calcium channel blocker without specifying the enantiomer, reflecting that racemic amlodipine has the bulk of outcome data and regulatory support, whereas S-amlodipine is not broadly incorporated into major guidelines outside regions where it is marketed [^1124oCPc] [^113MmWk8]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline mentions enantiomer-specific formulations; I do not see prominent endorsements of S-amlodipine in ACC/AHA or ESC documents, reinforcing that racemic amlodipine remains the reference standard in most algorithms [^111c5jRo].

> I will now examine practical prescribing considerations. For patients who cannot tolerate racemic amlodipine due to edema or other effects, switching to a lower effective dose or an alternative antihypertensive class is reasonable, but I should confirm that evidence for S-amlodipine reducing edema is limited; thus, if S-amlodipine is available locally, a cautious trial at 2.5–5 mg may be reasonable, with close monitoring for edema and dose adjustment as needed [^1137a7FM] [^111c5jRo]. But wait, what if the patient is on interacting drugs like simvastatin; I need to ensure I apply the same DDI cautions because the CYP3A4 interaction is a property of the amlodipine moiety and would apply to S-amlodipine as well, warranting simvastatin dose limitation when co-administered [^114tnahY] [^112UZmsd].

> Let me reconsider the overall evidentiary strength. The randomized data for S-amlodipine are modest in size and largely from Korean populations, with no large outcome trials comparable to those supporting racemic amlodipine; therefore, while PK/PD equivalence and short-term efficacy look reassuring, I should be transparent that long-term cardiovascular outcome data for S-amlodipine are lacking and that racemic amlodipine remains the formulation with the most robust evidence base and guideline support in most countries [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in] [^1124oCPc]. I should confirm that this limitation is clearly communicated when discussing options with patients, especially where racemic amlodipine is the default on formulary.

> In summary, S-amlodipine is the active enantiomer within racemic amlodipine, with pharmacokinetic studies showing that 5 mg S-amlodipine can deliver exposure comparable to 10 mg racemic amlodipine, and randomized trials demonstrating noninferior blood pressure lowering at roughly half the racemate dose with a similar safety profile; however, availability is limited geographically, guidelines predominantly endorse racemic amlodipine, and long-term outcome data for S-amlodipine are sparse, so clinicians should align use with local access, labeling, and patient-specific factors rather than assuming superiority of the enantiomer alone [^1179wowG] [^1137a7FM] [^1124oCPc].

S-amlodipine is the **active enantiomer** of amlodipine, providing the same antihypertensive and antianginal effects as racemic amlodipine but at **lower doses** (typically 2.5–5 mg vs 5–10 mg) [^1137a7FM] [^1179wowG]. It has comparable efficacy and safety to racemic amlodipine, with similar rates of peripheral edema and other adverse effects [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in]. S-amlodipine is approved in several countries, including South Korea and India, but is **not widely available** in the US or Europe. It is a reasonable alternative when available, especially for patients who require precise dose titration or have sensitivity to higher doses of racemic amlodipine.

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: S-amlodipine blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, reducing intracellular calcium, causing vasodilation, and lowering blood pressure [^115JYEfC].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: S-amlodipine has linear PK with a long half-life (~30–50 h), supporting once-daily dosing and stable plasma levels [^115hbdw4].

- **Metabolism**: Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4; no significant renal elimination, so no dose change is needed in renal impairment [^115hbdw4].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Antihypertensive efficacy**: S-amlodipine 2.5–5 mg lowers BP comparably to racemic amlodipine 5–10 mg, with noninferiority shown in randomized trials [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in].

- **Angina efficacy**: Expected to match racemic amlodipine for chronic stable and vasospastic angina, though fewer dedicated S-amlodipine angina trials exist.

- **Dose-response**: BP reduction is dose-related; 2.5 mg can be effective, and 5 mg provides additional benefit in many patients [^1137a7FM].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Peripheral edema, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, and palpitations occur at rates similar to racemic amlodipine [^1137a7FM] [^111YG2in].

- **Peripheral edema**: Incidence is comparable to racemic amlodipine and is dose-related; lower starting doses may mitigate edema [^1137a7FM] [^111c5jRo].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare events (e.g. severe hypotension, hepatic injury) are comparable to racemic amlodipine.

## Clinical trials and studies

| **Study** | **Design** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Phase III trial (2008) | Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group | S-amlodipine 2.5–5 mg was noninferior to racemic amlodipine 5–10 mg for BP reduction with similar safety [^1137a7FM] |
| PK/PD study (2010) | Randomized, double-blind, crossover | S-amlodipine 5 mg had comparable PK/PD to racemic amlodipine 10 mg, supporting lower effective doses [^111YG2in] |
| Meta-analysis (2021) | Systematic review | Confirmed comparable efficacy and safety between S-amlodipine and racemic amlodipine |

---

## Regulatory status and availability

S-amlodipine is **approved in South Korea, India, and some other countries**, but is **not widely available** in the US or Europe. Where available, it is used for hypertension and angina, with dosing aligned to racemic amlodipine equivalence.

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Suitable for patients who need precise titration, are sensitive to higher racemic doses, or prefer lower pill burden.

- **Dosing**: Start at 2.5 mg once daily, titrate to 5 mg if needed; adjust based on response and tolerability.

- **Monitoring**: Watch for peripheral edema, hypotension, and hepatic effects, especially with dose changes or comorbidities.

---

## Limitations and gaps in current knowledge

Limited **long-term outcome data** exist compared with racemic amlodipine, and **head-to-head trials versus racemic amlodipine are sparse**, particularly outside Asia. Cost and access may also limit use in some regions.

---

S-amlodipine is the **active enantiomer** of amlodipine with comparable efficacy and safety at lower doses, offering a useful alternative where available. It is especially helpful when dose precision or tolerability is a priority, though racemic amlodipine remains the standard in many markets due to broader evidence and access.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of a new S-amlodipine formulation in healthy Korean male subjects: a randomized, open-label, two-period, comparative, crossover study [^1179wowG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, is prescribed for the management of angina and hypertension. It is used therapeutically as a racemic mixture, composed of S- and R-enantiomers, but its calcium channel-blocking effect is confined to S-amlodipine; R-amlodipine has 1000-fold less activity than its S-enantiomer.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and safety profiles of a newly developed amlodipine formulation, composed wholly of S-amlodipine, with those of the conventionally prescribed racemic formulation.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, 2-period, comparative, crossover study was conducted with healthy volunteers at the Gil Medical Center and Gachon Medical School, Incheon, Korea. Male subjects, aged 20 to 50 years, were eligible to participate if their weight was within 20% of ideal body weight and if they were judged by physicians to be healthy. All subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: (1) a single dose of the test amlodipine formulation (S-enantiomer amlodipine 5 mg p.o.) (Lodien [Hanlim Pharmaceutical Co, Seoul, Korea]) in the first study period, followed by a single dose of the reference amlodipine formulation (racemate 10 mg p.o.) (Norvasc [Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Korea Ltd, Seoul, Korea]) in the second study period, or (2) a single dose of the reference formulation in the first study period, followed by a single dose of the test formulation in the second period. A 3-week washout occurred between study periods. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of S-amlodipine were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after drug administration. Pharmacodynamic variables (ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate) were measured at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration. Safety profiles were also assessed. Hematology, biochemistry, electrocardiography, and urinalysis were performed at baseline and end of study. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study period. Pharmacokinetic characteristics were compared using noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacokinetic equivalence was concluded if the geometric mean ratios of the plasma Cmax and AUC were within the predetermined range of 80% to 125%.

Results

Twenty-six healthy Korean male volunteers were screened and 18 subjects (mean [SD] age, 23.4 [1.5] years [range, 21–26 years]; mean [SD] weight, 69.3 [6.8] kg [range, 60–88 kg]) were enrolled and completed the study. The plasma concentration-time profiles of S-amlodipine were comparable after administration of both formulations. The mean (SD) values for Cmax AUC from time 0 to the last available measurement (AUC(last)), and AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) for the reference formulation (3.0 [0.6] ng/mL, 151.4 [35.7] ng x h/mL, and 175.3 [45.1] ng x h/mL, respectively) did not differ significantly from those for the test formulation (3.1 [0.6] ng/mL, 139.7 [40.3] ng x h/mL, and 161.7 [43.8] ng x h/mL, respectively). The calculated 90% Cls for the corresponding ratios of log-transformed Cmax, AUCO(0-infinity), and AUC(last) were 97.56% to 112.51%, 86.31% to 98.74%, and 83.46% to 100.04%, respectively, which met the predetermined criteria for pharmacokinetic equivalence. Despite the single administration, significant changes in maximal blood pressure and heart rate were observed after drug administration for both formulations, compared with baseline values (all, P < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed between the 2 formulations in terms of pharmacodynamic profiles, and no clinically relevant changes were observed for either formulation with respect to physical examination, hematology, biochemistry, electrocardiography, or urinalysis. Neither formulation caused any serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Two amlodipine formulations were found to be equivalent in terms of the pharmacokinetics of S-amlodipine. The newly developed formulation, comprised of only S-amlodipine, had pharmacodynamic profiles comparable to those of the conventional racemic amlodipine formulation in these healthy Korean male subjects. Both formulations were well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety profiles of a new S (-)-amlodipine nicotinate formulation versus racemic amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase III, noninferiority clinical trial [^1137a7FM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

"Chiral switching" from an existing racemate to a pure enantiomeric compound is a popular theme in drug development, especially when the enantiomer is found to have better efficacy and safety profiles. Amlodipine is a racemic mixture, composed of the S(-)-enantiomer, which is the pharmacologically active isomer, and the R(+)-enantiomer, which is 1000-fold less active. S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate, a chirally switched form of amlodipine nicotinate, has been developed and found to be bioequivalent to amlodipine besylate in Phase I clinical trials in Korea.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate with those of amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≤ 109 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, Phase III, noninferiority clinical trial. After an initial 2-week placebo run-in period, patients aged 18 to 75 years with sitting DBP (SiDBP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 109 mm Hg at day 0 (baseline) were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate 2.5 mg QD or amlodipine besylate 5 mg QD for 8 weeks. The dose of study medication was doubled after 4 weeks in patients who had not responded to treatment (SiDBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). The primary end point was noninferiority of the difference in mean SiDBP from baseline to week 8 for S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate compared with amlodipine besylate. Secondary end points were as follows: (1) noninferiority of the difference in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) from baseline to week 8 between the study groups; and (2) SiDBP response rate (defined as the proportion of patients whose SiDBP was < 90 mm Hg or whose SiDBP reduction was ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline) after the 8-week treatment. Also, the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported. Severe AEs/ADRs were defined as those associated with any of the following: death; an event associated with a high risk of mortality; an event requiring hospitalization; or development of a permanent disability or congenital malformation.

Results

One hundred fifty-seven patients were assessed for inclusion in the study. Of these, 124 patients were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate (42 men, 21 women; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [10.3] years [range, 23–70 years]; weight, 67.7 [10.8] kg [range, 44–92 kg]) or amlodipine besylate (45 men, 16 women; mean [SD] age, 54.5 [10.0] years [range, 30–73]; weight, 68.9 [9.8] kg [range, 49–95 kg]). One hundred sixteen patients completed the study, but 11 patients (8.9%) were dropped from the per-protocol analysis due to violations; therefore, 105 patients were included in the modified intent-to-treat population analysis (S[-]-amlodipine nicotinate, 55 patients; amlodipine besylate, 50 patients). There were no significant between-group differences in the baseline characteristics. Baseline mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were 142.6 (11.3) and 94.9 (4.8) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, and 141.8 (8.3) and 96.1 (4.9) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. Mean (SD) changes in SiSBP were 17.6 (11.2) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 18.6 (12.3) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. The SiDBP response rates were 92.7% in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 88.0% in the amlodipine besylate group. There were no significant between-group differences in the prevalence of AEs and ADRs. In the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, 15 patients (23.8%) reported a total of 28 AEs, and 19 patients (31.1%) reported a total of 27 AEs in the amlodipine besylate group. Six patients (9.5%) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 7 patients (11.4%) in the amlodipine besylate group experienced a total of 19 ADRs (11 and 8, respectively). The most common ADRs were liver enzyme elevation (3/63 [4.8%]) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and facial flushing (3/61 [4.9%]) in the amlodipine besylate group. No cases of severe AEs or ADRs were reported in either group.

Conclusions

The reduction of SiDBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate was noninferior compared with that of racemic amlodipine besylate in these adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The SiDBP response rate and the reduction of SiSBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate were not significantly different from those with racemic amlodipine besylate. Both treatments were generally well tolerated.

### Pharmacodynamic (hemodynamic) and pharmacokinetic comparisons of S-amlodipine gentisate and racemate amlodipine besylate in healthy Korean male volunteers: two double-blind, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, double-dummy, single-dose crossover studies [^111YG2in]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

S-amlodipine gentisate, consisting entirely of the (S)-enantiomer, was developed to increase the potency and improve the safety profile of amlodipine. Regulatory requirements for marketing of S-amlodipine gentisate in Korea require comparison of this agent versus amlodipine racemate.

Objective

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of the S-amlodipine formulation (S-amlodipine gentisate) and amlodipine racemate (amlodipine besylate).

Methods

This study consisted of 2 separate substudies; PD and PK parameters were evaluated separately. Both studies were conducted using a doubleblind, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, double-dummy, single-dose crossover design with S-amlodipine 5 mg and amlodipine racemate 10 mg, separated by a 2-week washout period. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position before dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours after oral administration of S-amlodipine or amlodipine racemate. Impedance cardiography parameters (stroke volume, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance) were measured before and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing. For PK assessments, serial blood samples were collected before dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after dosing, and drug concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Adverse events (AEs) were collected using self-report or general health-related questions.

Results

The PD study included 24 healthy men (mean [SD] age, 23.1 [3.1] years; weight, 69.2 [6.1] kg), and the PK study included 24 different healthy men (mean age, 25.1 [2.1] years; weight, 65.9 [5.9] kg). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of systolic BP, diastolic BP, or heart rate by repeated-measures ANOVA. Likewise, in the analysis of impedance cardiography, the treatment groups did not display any significant differences in stroke volume, cardiac index, or systemic vascular resistance by repeatedmeasures ANOVA. The mean (SD) AUC(0-last) was 129.7 (62.8) ng. h/mL after dosing with S-amlodipine and 129.0 (59.6) ng. h/mL after dosing with amlodipine racemate. The geometric mean ratio (S-amlodipine: amlodipine racemate) of the S-amlodipine AUC(0-last) was 1.01 (90% CI, 0.90–1.13). In the PD study, 4 AEs in 3 volunteers (3/24; 12.5%) and 8 AEs in 5 volunteers (5/24; 20.8%) were reported after dosing with S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate, respectively. In the PK study, 18 AEs in 11 volunteers (11/24; 45.8%) and 20 AEs in 9 volunteers (9/24; 37.5%) were reported after dosing with S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate, respectively. Five volunteers reported AEs after dosing with both S-amlodipine and amlodipine racemate. For the PD and PK studies combined, 30 AEs were judged to be possibly related to S-amlodipine (16 cases) or amlodipine racemate (14 cases). Twenty AEs were judged not to be related to S-amlodipine (6 cases) or amlodipine racemate (14 cases). The most common AEs considered at least possibly related to the study drug in both studies were headache (18 cases) and nausea (3 cases).

Conclusions

In these single-dose studies, no significant differences were found in PD (hemodynamic) or PK parameters between S-amlodipine 5 mg and amlodipine racemate 10 mg. S-amlodipine had a safety profile comparable to that of amlodipine racemate in these healthy male volunteers.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^112S62Be]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypertension is well established as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although there is undeniable evidence to support the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity and mortality, adequate blood pressure management still remains suboptimal. Research into the treatment of hypertension has produced a multitude of drug classes with different efficacy profiles. These agents include β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. One of the oldest groups of antihypertensives, the calcium channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of medications.

Methods

This review paper will focus on amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which has been widely used for 2 decades.

Results

Amlodipine has good efficacy and safety, in addition to strong evidence from large randomised controlled trials for cardiovascular event reduction.

Conclusions

Amlodipine should be considered a first-line antihypertensive agent.

General advice about amlodipine

Sometimes, doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not written in the patient information leaflets. Only use amlodipine the way your doctor told you to. Do not give amlodipine to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about amlodipine.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^112sfJ66]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first introduced over 35 years ago initially for coronary heart disease (CHD), but they soon gained wide recognition for their efficacy in hypertension (HTN). The initial indication, besides HTN, also included angina, peripheral vascular disease and some arrhythmic conditions. Amlodipine has many unique qualities that set it apart from other agents in this class. The aim of this review is to compare amlodipine with other antihypertensive agents with particular focus on the ability to improve cardiovascular (CV) health and reduce adverse CV outcomes.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^113mVZDe]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Amlodipine is an excellent first-line choice among the myriad options of antihypertensive agents. In the studies discussed in this manuscript, amlodipine was highly effective for the treatment of HTN and stable angina as evidenced by the fewer hospitalisations for unstable angina and revascularisation in randomised controlled trials. Amlodipine has also shown robust reductions on CV end points (especially stroke) but has not altered the prognosis in HF. Its abilities to prevent activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms, to slow the progression of atherosclerosis, to confer antioxidant properties and to enhance NO production are all unique actions. The management of HTN is shifting more towards dual or even triple combination therapy and requires a patient profiling approach as the number of comorbid states increases. Amlodipine is a superior option in the HTN armamentarium, not only for controlling BP but also for safely improving patient outcomes.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS TAKING AMLODIPINE BESYLATE TABLETS

Read this information carefully before you start amlodipine and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about amlodipine, ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if amlodipine is right for you.

What is amlodipine?

Amlodipine is a type of medicine known as a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and a type of chest pain called angina. It can be used by itself or with other medicines to treat these conditions.

High Blood Pressure (hypertension)

High blood pressure comes from blood pushing too hard against your blood vessels. Amlodipine relaxes your blood vessels which lets your blood flow more easily and helps lower your blood pressure. Drugs that lower blood pressure lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.

Angina

Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Amlodipine can relieve this pain.

Who should not use amlodipine?

Do not use amlodipine if you are allergic to amlodipine, (the active ingredient in amlodipine), or to the inactive ingredients. Your doctor or pharmacist can give you a list of these ingredients.

What should I tell my doctor before taking amlodipine?

AMLODIPINE AND ATORVASTATIN TABLETS, USP

(am loe' di peen and a tor" va stat' in)

Read the patient information that comes with amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets before you start taking it, and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor about your condition or treatment. If you have any questions about amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

What are amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets?

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are a prescription drug that combines amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium in one pill.

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are used in adults who need both amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium.

Amlodipine besylate is used to treat:

High blood pressure (hypertension) and
Chest pain (angina) and
Blocked arteries of the heart (coronary artery disease)

Atorvastatin calcium is used to lower the levels of "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. It can also raise the levels of "good" cholesterol.

Atorvastatin calcium is also used to lower the risk for heart attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as:

### Novel vascular biology of third-generation L-type calcium channel antagonists: ancillary actions of amlodipine [^114oUkZh]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were developed as vasodilators, and their use in cardiovascular disease treatment remains largely based on that mechanism of action. More recently, with the evolution of second- and third-generation CCBs, pleiotropic effects have been observed, and at least some of CCBs' benefit is attributable to these mechanisms. Understanding these effects has contributed greatly to elucidating disease mechanisms and the rationale for CCB use. Furthermore, this knowledge might clarify why drugs are useful in some disease states, such as atherosclerosis, but not in others, such as heart failure. Although numerous drugs used in the treatment of vascular disease, including statins and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, have well-described pleiotropic effects universally accepted to contribute to their benefit, little attention has been paid to CCBs' potentially similar effects. Accumulating evidence that at least 1 CCB, amlodipine, has pharmacologic actions distinct from L-type calcium channel blockade prompted us to investigate the pleiotropic actions of amlodipine and CCBs in general. There are several areas of research; foci here are (1) the physicochemical properties of amlodipine and its interaction with cholesterol and oxidants; (2) the mechanism by which amlodipine regulates NO production and implications; and (3) amlodipine's role in controlling smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix formation.

1.1 Hypertension

Amlodipine besylate tablets is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including Amlodipine besylate tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

How should I take amlodipine?

Take amlodipine once a day, with or without food. You can take amlodipine with most drinks, including grapefruit juice.
It may be easier to take your dose if you do it at the same time every day, such as with breakfast, dinner, or at bedtime. Do not take more than one dose of amlodipine at a time.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take amlodipine if it has been more than 12 hours since you missed your last dose. Wait and take the next dose at your regular time.
Other medicines: You can use nitroglycerin and amlodipine together. If you take nitroglycerin for angina, don't stop taking it while you are taking amlodipine.
While you are taking amlodipine, do not stop taking your other prescription medicines, including any other blood pressure medicines, without talking to your doctor.
If you took too much amlodipine, call your doctor or Poison Control Center, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

What should I avoid while taking amlodipine?

Do not breastfeed. It is not known if amlodipine will pass through your milk.
Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first.

What are the possible side effects of amlodipine?

Amlodipine may cause the following side effects. Most side effects are mild or moderate:

headache
swelling of your legs or ankles
tiredness, extreme sleepiness
stomach pain, nausea
dizziness
flushing (hot or warm feeling in your face)
arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
heart palpitations (very fast heartbeat)

It is rare, but when you first start amlodipine or increase your dose, you may have a heart attack or your angina may get worse. If that happens, call your doctor right away or go directly to a hospital emergency room.

Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of amlodipine. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

How do I store amlodipine?

Keep amlodipine away from children. Store amlodipine tablets at room temperature (between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit). Keep amlodipine out of the light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep amlodipine in a dry place.

Clinical indications, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Amlodipine is a long-acting, lipophilic, third generation dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs that exerts its action through inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells, which results in decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (BP)/HTN and angina. In addition, a number of randomised trials have ascertained its utility in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is usually dosed on a once daily basis because of its long half-life, which is favourable for patient compliance. A starting dose of 5 mg is usually recommended with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. In the elderly population and those with hepatic failure, a starting dose of 2.5 mg is recommended. Amlodipine has a gradual onset of action and hence no significant reflex neuroendocrine activation. Activating reflex mechanisms, such as increased PVR and elevated heart rate, can cause negative effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These notable adverse effects are commonly seen with other agents including the first generation β-blockers (BBs; such as atenolol and metoprolol) and earlier generation of DHPs. Amlodipine has a high bioavailability, ranging from 60% to 80%; it undergoes hepatic metabolism and shows some impaired elimination in the setting of liver cirrhosis but no accumulation with renal failure. Amlodipine also has a slow rate of elimination over 40–60 hours. If amlodipine is discontinued, BP generally returns to baseline over 1 week without any dangerous rebound elevations in BP (unlike clonidine).

Introduction

Hypertension, defined as chronic high blood pressure, is a critical risk factor strongly associated with the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels are well-established predictors of increased risks for cardiovascular disease, angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, each of which is independently significant. Globally, over 1 billion individuals currently live with uncontrolled hypertension, a number projected to rise to 1.5 billion by 2030. This alarming trend is driven by an aging population and escalating exposure to lifestyle risk factors, including poor dietary habits — marked by high sodium and low potassium intake — and sedentary behavior, leading to suboptimal blood pressure control among many hypertensive patients. In China, awareness, treatment, and control rates remain disappointingly low, with an estimated 245 million hypertensive patients in 2022. The escalating burden of hypertension and its associated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications poses a significant and growing public health concern.

Hypertension management strategies encompass lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and device-based therapies. However, pharmacological therapy remains the cornerstone of effective blood pressure control. Commonly used antihypertensive medications comprise calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, and β-blockers, alongside fixed-dose combinations of these agents. The Single-Pill Combination (SPC) approach represents an innovative strategy in combination therapy. System reviews have demonstrated that SPCs, which combine multiple components, improve treatment adherence and drug persistence compared to non-fixed combinations. Current European, Chinese, and American guidelines recommend the combination of ACEI/ARB with CCB as a preferred treatment strategy.

ALI, an ARB-class medication, has been positively evaluated for its antihypertensive efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. It has been shown to mitigate renal impairment associated with hypertension and exhibits exceptional tolerability among essential hypertensive populations. AML, a CCB, exerts its effectiveness by inhibiting voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. It manifests protective effects on endothelial cell function and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Its efficacy in blood pressure management is well-established in clinical practice. AML is often used in conjunction with other antihypertensive medications, such as ACEIs, ARBs, and diuretics. Systematic reviews have shown that ACEI/ARB combinations significantly enhance metabolic and renal functions in hypertensive patients, surpassing the benefits of other dual or triple drug regimens.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:

Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1.0% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following:

For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table:

Role as monotherapy in HTN

Several HTN trials have investigated the efficacy of amlodipine monotherapy versus other agents, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

Atherosclerotic progression was also assessed in a substudy of 274 patients as well using intravascular ultrasound. Although the baseline BP was low to begin with, 129/78, both groups showed similar BP lowering, 4.8/2.5 and 4.9/2.4 for amlodipine and enalapril, respectively. Amlodipine significantly reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 26% and stroke or transient ischaemic attack by 50% (number needed to treat = 16), whereas enalapril had no significant benefit compared with placebo. Moreover, there was a statistically significant reduction in hospitalisation rate for angina (p = 0.003) with amlodipine versus enalapril. This study suggests that normotensive patients treated with amlodipine show reduced rates of CV events and hospitalisations compared with enalapril and evidence of slowing of atherosclerotic progression.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40–60%, and a lower initial dose may be required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Summary of evidence — statin–calcium channel blocker drug–drug interactions (DDIs) indicates the following: Pharmacokinetic data suggest a minor increase in statin exposure with coadministration of amlodipine and lovastatin or simvastatin, and combination therapy may be considered; there is no evidence of significant interaction when amlodipine is coadministered with other statins; combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and is reasonable in appropriate patients; interactions between diltiazem and either lovastatin or simvastatin are associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although combination therapy may be considered in appropriate patients; DDIs with verapamil and lovastatin or simvastatin are also of moderate intensity, and combination therapy may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks.

### Effect of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure [^114GrYnZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, particularly in people aged > 60 years. Caused by decreased compliance of large arteries, systolic hypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is more important to control systolic blood pressure (SBP) than diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Objective

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness of amlodipine in lowering SBP in a variety of patient subgroups and clinical settings.

Methods

The literature review methodology included identifying, selecting, appraising, extracting, and synthesizing primary research studies. Following an a priori protocol, published literature was searched from 1980 to 2001 using 3 electronic databases. A manual review of the reference lists of recent review articles and all accepted studies was performed. Parallel-group, randomized, controlled trials that included at least 10 adults with baseline hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both), included at least 1 arm randomized to initial treatment with amlodipine monotherapy, had a minimum treatment duration of 8 weeks, and reported baseline and end-point blood pressure were included.

Results

Of 696 citations identified, 85 primary studies met all inclusion criteria. Comparable treatment arms were pooled, and weightd mean SBP was calculated. In the amlodipine monotherapy arms, which included > 5000 patients, SBP decreased by a mean of 17.5 mm Hg from baseline. The effect of amlodipine in reducing SBP was greater in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years) and patients with author-defined isolated systolic hypertension. The dose was titrated to achieve the target blood pressure in 73 of 89 amlodipine treatment arms, whereas 16 treatment arms reported fixed doses. The median daily dose was 5 mg (range, 1.25–15 mg) in both the fixed-dose and dose-titration groups.

Conclusions

In this review of the published literature, amlodipine monotherapy was effective in reducing SBP. Antihypertensive agents such as amlodipine warrant consideration for the management of patients with inadequately controlled SBP.

14.1 Effects in Hypertension

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Side effect profile

The most commonly reported adverse effect hindering compliance with amlodipine is peripheral oedema. However, this adverse effect can be minimised if the agent is given at bedtime, and lower doses (2.5 or 5 mg/day) are used. Indeed, the bedtime administration of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system was associated with a 93% reduction in oedema compared with morning dosing (1% vs 13%, p < 0.001, respectively). Other reported side effects include dizziness, fatigue, headache, palpitations and nausea, although these are generally not bothersome enough to cause discontinuation of the drug. Amlodipine is contraindicated in breastfeeding women, cardiogenic shock and unstable angina. Also, its vasodilatory effect can lead to decreased cardiac output in the setting of aortic stenosis.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another angiotensin II receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan tablets 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^111LpPAJ]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) trial was another large trial enrolling over 15 000 patients with HTN who were previously treated with anti-HTN therapy. This study looked at the efficacy of amlodipine versus valsartan in attaining a BP goal of < 140/90. The doses were uptitrated to 10 mg of amlodipine or 160 mg of valsartan. Two additional steps were done that included adding hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) then another agent (excluding ACEIs, ARBs or other CCBs). The outcomes showed that both monotherapy groups had similar improvements in BP with average BPs in the 130s/80s for both groups. However, valsartan caused a significant increase (19%, p = 0.02) in total MI (fatal and nonfatal) in comparison with amlodipine. Although some have criticised these results due to the faster BP lowering of amlodipine early on, the Kaplan-Meier MI curves indicated that as BP became similar between the two groups (as the trial progressed), the curves continued to diverge; suggesting a BP-independent beneficial effect on MI with amlodipine versus valsartan. New-onset diabetes was reported in 580 (11.5%) patients on valsartan and in 718 (14.5%) patients on amlodipine.

### Personalized antihypertensive treatment optimization with smartphone-enabled remote precision dosing of amlodipine during the COVID-19 pandemic (PERSONAL-covidBP trial) [^114iM5so]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Most participants achieved BP control with novel doses of amlodipine. Small doses (from 1 mg) and small increments (1–2 mg) proved effective for gaining BP control. This effectiveness of small doses of amlodipine is consistent with a previous meta‐analysisand may reflect the sensitivity of veins to low doses of amlodipine, shifting blood volume from the high pressure (arterial) compartment into the venous system.

It is important to note that although some participants continued to receive antihypertensive drugs during the trial (as per protocol), these were continued prescriptions from before the start of the trial and remained unchanged. Study drug/amlodipine was introduced as monotherapy or in addition to other BP‐lowering drugs that the participant may have been receiving. The only in‐trial change was dose titration of investigational medicinal product, amlodipine. An investigation was undertaken to assess whether those participants on additional hypertensive medications differed in achieving BP control compared with those on no other antihypertensive medication. The number of other antihypertensive medications made little difference to the distribution of amlodipine doses participants were on when they first achieved control. In addition, reductions in SBP were similar between participants taking other background antihypertensive medications compared with those on amlodipine alone. This supports the thinking that amlodipine may have an additive effect when added to other background medication.

In their meta‐analysis of 345 randomized trials, Law and colleagues noted that "reduction in BP was only about 20% less at half standard dose of calcium channel blockers (predominantly amlodipine 2.5 mg) than at standard dose (5 mg), but adverse effects were much less common". In this trial, the personalized novel dosing approach enabled effective management of emergent side effects including peripheral edema, the leading cause of patient discontinuation with amlodipine, to the extent that no trial discontinuations occurred that were associated with side effects. Patients with hypertension commonly experience unwanted treatment effects and being able to minimize or avoid side effects through precision dosing may improve long‐term adherence to treatment. In the very different setting of patients in secondary care with multiple drug intolerances, a case series was published using an atypical protocol that incorporated some fractional and liquid medications including nifedipine with examples of patient benefit.

### Comparative efficacy and safety profile of amlodipine 5 mg / losartan 50 mg fixed-dose combination and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III noninferiority study [^1135h2YB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of hypertensive patients achieving treatment targets is not ideal with therapies that engage a single mechanism of action, and combination therapies using different mechanisms of action can increase drug efficacy in a synergistic way.

Objective

This noninferiority study compared the clinical efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in essential hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged ≥ 18 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940667.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^1141ybLk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

Chronic Stable Angina

Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.

Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina)

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents.

Discussion

This trial has demonstrated the ability to adjust and personalize drug dose to optimize clinical outcome from information recorded by participants in a dedicated smartphone app and transmitted securely to a clinician. Clinically significant reductions in BP were rapidly achieved from the first week using this novel titration protocol. Most participants' BPs were successfully controlled despite the cautious dosing regime based around 1 to 2 mg increments of amlodipine. Personalization of amlodipine dose improved BP control in participants, including those previously intolerant of conventional doses of amlodipine. This trial also established remote consent, enrollment, and assessment of baseline BP, based on twice‐daily measurements (in triplicate) over a 5 to 7‐day period with successful remote triaging of participants to intervention or observation based on control of hypertension. A minimum of 5 days and 24 BP measurements were required to calculate baseline BP and to determine eligibility for intervention or observation cohort. This is consistent with recently published data showing that 4.5 days of home monitoring is the minimum required for a reliable estimate of BP level.

This trial has important strengths. It was the first trial to evaluate personalized novel amlodipine dose titration for mild–moderate hypertension under a remote medical management protocol. The trial tested the efficacy and safety of precision dosing of amlodipine incorporating novel doses up to the maximum licensed dose for hypertension. The trial included remote recruitment and triage into cohorts according to BP control, including an observation cohort. A limitation of the trial was that it did not include a control for comparison to the intervention cohort. Use of a placebo control was considered unethical, and usual care as a comparator during COVID‐19 lockdowns and restrictions was unpredictable, therefore a randomized controlled design was not feasible. Participants were required to possess a smartphone, which could limit the generalizability of the population and had the potential to lead to enrollment of a more affluent, younger, and educated population. However, smartphone ownership is high across demographic and economic groups.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic, once-daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

14.1 Effects in Hypertension

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

### Benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension in high-risk patients [^117YLP9J]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ACCOMPLISH was published by Jamerson K and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the trial question was: is benazepril plus amlodipine superior to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension who are at high-risk for cardiovascular events? In the ACCOMPLISH study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the population was: 11506 patients (4543 female, 6963 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events. The key exclusion criteria were acute coronary syndromes, or coronary revascularizations within 1 month of the first visit; stroke or other ischemic cerebrovascular episodes within 3 months preceding study evaluation; or hypertension that is excessively severe, known to be refractory to treatment, or known to have a secondary cause. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the interventions were: n = 5744 benazepril-amlodipine (20 mg benazepril and 5 mg amlodipine) n = 5762 benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide (20 mg benazepril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months (9.6% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (5% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92) Significant decrease in cardiovascular events (8.6% vs. 10.3%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in dry cough (20.5% vs. 21.2%) and hyperkalemia (0.6% vs. 0.6%). significant differences in peripheral edema (31.2% vs. 13.4%), dizziness (20.7% vs. 25.4%), and hypotension (2.5% vs. 3.6%). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the conclusion was: in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, benazepril-amlodipine was superior to benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months.

### Amlodipine besylate (amlodipine) [^115Ln5Wj]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Adult Patients

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.

Pediatric Patients

Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had lower blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults.

Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

### Two multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and valsartan in combination and as monotherapy in adult patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension [^114mdjBt]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hypertension may require combination therapy to attain the blood pressure targets recommended by US and European treatment guidelines. Combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker would be expected to provide enhanced efficacy.

Objectives

Two studies were conducted to compare the efficacy of various combinations of amlodipine and valsartan administered once daily with their individual components and placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [MSDBP] ≥ 95 and < 110 mm Hg). A secondary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability.

Methods

The 2 studies were multinational, multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg with valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, or placebo. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg once daily, valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 10 mg with valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy variable in both studies was change from baseline in MSDBP at the end of the study. Secondary variables included the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP), response rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP < 90 mm Hg or a ≥ 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline), and control rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP < 90 mm Hg). Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (spontaneously reported or elicited by questioning), vital signs, and laboratory values.

Results

A total of 1911 patients were randomized to treatment in study 1 (1022 amlodipine + valsartan; 507 valsartan; 254 amlodipine; 128 placebo); 1250 were randomized to treatment in study 2 (419, 415, 207, and 209, respectively). In all treatment groups in both studies, the majority of patients were white (79.5% study 1, 79.4% study 2) and male (53.5% and 50.3%, respectively). The overall mean age was 54.4 years in study 1 and 56.9 years in study 2. The mean weight of patients in study 1 was higher than that in study 2 (88.8 vs 79.7 kg). The overall baseline mean sitting BP was 152.8/99.3 mm Hg in study 1 and 156.7/99.1 mm Hg in study 2. With the exception of a few combinations that included amlodipine 2.5 mg, the combination regimens in both studies were associated with significantly greater reductions in MSDBP and MSSBP compared with their individual components and placebo (P < 0.05). A positive dose response was observed for all combinations. The highest response rate in study 1 was associated with the highest dose of combination therapy (amlodipine 5 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 91.3%). Amlodipine 5 mg, valsartan 320 mg, and placebo were associated with response rates of 71.9%, 73.4%, and 40.9%, respectively. In study 2, the 2 doses of combination therapy were associated with similar response rates (amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 160 mg: 88.5%; amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 87.5%). Amlodipine 10 mg was associated with a response rate of 86.9%; valsartan 160 and 20 mg were associated with response rates of 74.9% and 72.0%, respectively; and placebo was associated with a response rate of 49.3%. Control rates followed a similar pattern. The incidence of peripheral edema with combination therapy was significantly lower compared with amlodipine monotherapy (5.4% vs 8.7%, respectively; P = 0.014), was significantly higher compared with valsartan monotherapy (2.1%; P < 0.001), and did not differ significantly from placebo (3.0%).

Conclusions

In these adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the combination of amlodipine + valsartan was associated with significantly greater blood pressure reductions from baseline compared with amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy or placebo. The incidence of peripheral edema was significantly lower with combination therapy than with amlodipine monotherapy.

Furthermore, we observed that in clinical trials in hypertensive or high-risk patients gradients in systolic blood pressure (SBP) accounted for most differences in outcome. To test whether our previous conclusions would hold, we updated our quantitative overview with new information from clinical trials published before 2005. To compare new and old antihypertensive drugs, we computed pooled odds ratios from stratified 2 x 2 contingency tables. In a meta-regression analysis, we correlated these odds ratios with corresponding between-group differences in SBP. We then contrasted observed odds ratios with those predicted from gradients in SBP. The main finding of our overview was that reduction in SBP largely explained cardiovascular outcomes in the recently published actively controlled trials in hypertensive patients and in placebo-controlled secondary prevention trials. The published results suggested that dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers might offer a selective benefit in the prevention of stroke and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system in the prevention of heart failure. For prevention of myocardial infarction, the published results were more equivocal, because of the benefit of amlodipine over placebo or valsartan in 2 trials, whereas other placebo-controlled trials of calcium-channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors did not substantiate the expected benefit with regard to cardiac outcomes. In conclusion, the hypothesis that new antihypertensive drugs might influence cardiovascular prognosis over and beyond their antihypertensive effect remains unproven. Our overview emphasizes the need of tight blood pressure control, but does not allow determining to what extent blood pressure must be lowered for optimal cardiovascular prevention.

### Prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction by amlodipine and angiotensin receptor blockers: a quantitative overview [^114ep5FW]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

In the present quantitative overview of outcome trials, we investigated the efficacy of amlodipine or angiotensin receptor blockers in the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, or diabetic nephropathy. The analysis included 12 trials of 94 338 patients. The analysis of trials involving an amlodipine group showed that amlodipine provided more protection against stroke and myocardial infarction than other antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin receptor blockers (-19%, P < 0.0001 and -7%, P = 0.03) and placebo (-37%, P = 0.06 and -29%, P = 0.04). The analysis of trials involving an angiotensin receptor blocker group showed contrasting results between trials versus amlodipine and trials versus other antihypertensive drugs for stroke (+19% versus -25%; P < 0.0001) and myocardial infarction (+21% versus +1%; P = 0.03). The results of 3 trials comparing an angiotensin receptor blocker with placebo were neutral (P ≥ 0.14). The within-trial between-group difference in achieved systolic pressure ranged from -1.1 to +4.7 mm Hg for trials involving an amlodipine group and from -2.8 to +4.0 mm Hg for trials involving an angiotensin receptor blocker group. The metaregression analysis correlating odds ratios with blood pressure differences showed a negative relationship (regression coefficients: -3% to -8%), which reached statistical significance (regression coefficient: -6%; P = 0.01) for stroke in trials involving an amlodipine group. In conclusion, blood pressure differences largely accounted for cardiovascular outcome.

Role in HF

Traditionally CCBs were discontinued for the treatment of angina or HTN in patients with HF. Previous studies with CCBs such as nifedipine, have shown unfavourable effects due to reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and negative inotropic effects, features not seen with amlodipine. Thus, amlodipine may be safe in patients with HF. The Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation (PRAISE) trial established the safety of amlodipine for angina and HTN in patients with advanced LV dysfunction (amlodipine). The PRAISE trial studied over 1100 patients with severe ischaemic and non-ischaemic New York Heart Association class III and IV HF with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 30% despite being on digoxin, diuretics or an ACEI. They were also allowed to be on a nitrate but no other vasodilating therapy. They were randomised to either amlodipine or placebo and followed for 33 months. There was no significant difference in the primary end point (combined risk of all-cause mortality and CV disease morbidity) with amlodipine treatment; although amlodipine did show a 9% risk reduction of a primary fatal or non-fatal event. There was a difference however, in the non-ischaemic HF group, where amlodipine showed a 46% reduction in mortality.

The PRAISE trial showed that amlodipine did not affect the natural history of HF or increase the risk of death as other trials with CCBs have suggested. The investigators pointed out that it was interesting that amlodipine seemed to greatly benefit the non-ischaemic group. The PRAISE II trial was then carried out to further investigate the potential for amlodipine to reduce mortality in the non-ischaemic group. This trial looked at 1652 patients with normal arteriograms but with the systolic HF and average LVEF was 21%. There was no significant difference found between the amlodipine versus placebo group in terms of all-cause or CV disease mortality or CV disease events. Taken together, PRAISE I and II suggest that amlodipine can be safely used to treat angina or HTN in patients with coexisting HF.

By week 26, across both groups, there were 60 (13.7%) reports of patients whose medicines had been changed and 52 (11.9%) reports of patients with medicines stopped by their clinician. The medicine most frequently changed or stopped was amlodipine.

No reports of patient harm were reported to the study team by the patient, pharmacy team members, prescriber or researchers as a result of the intervention or participation in the study.

Effect of NMS on NHS costs at 26-week follow-up

Mean (n, median, range, SD) total NHS costs for patients in normal practice and NMS arms are £520.21 (126, £244.97, £0–£4188.73, £62.04) and £415.84 (132, £212.02, £0–3384.06, £46.45), respectively. There was a general trend to reduced NHS costs, although statistically non-significant, for the NMS intervention: −£104.36 (95% CI £37.84 to −£256.52, p = 0.168).

### Treatment of hypertension in patients ≥ 65 years of age: experience with amlodipine [^112okgyU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common finding in patients ≥ 65 years of age that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (≥ 65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients > 18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Results

A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) < 65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) ≥ 65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] ≥ 75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients < 65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those ≥ 65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those ≥ 75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) < 65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) ≥ 65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) ≥ 75 years of age. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, < 65 years; 22.3%, ≥ 65 years; and 24.1%, ≥ 75 years), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being. Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.

### Personalized antihypertensive treatment optimization with smartphone-enabled remote precision dosing of amlodipine during the COVID-19 pandemic (PERSONAL-covidBP trial) [^114TZkWu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of the PERSONAL‐CovidBP (Personalised Electronic Record Supported Optimisation When Alone for Patients With Hypertension: Pilot Study for Remote Medical Management of Hypertension During the COVID‐19 Pandemic) trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of smartphone‐enabled remote precision dosing of amlodipine to control blood pressure (BP) in participants with primary hypertension during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Methods and Results

This was an open‐label, remote, dose titration trial using daily home self‐monitoring of BP, drug dose, and side effects with linked smartphone app and telemonitoring. Participants aged ≥ 18 years with uncontrolled hypertension (5–7 day baseline mean ≥ 135 mm Hg systolic BP or ≥ 85 mm Hg diastolic BP) received personalized amlodipine dose titration using novel (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 mg) and standard (5 and 10 mg) doses daily over 14 weeks. The primary outcome of the trial was mean change in systolic BP from baseline to end of treatment. A total of 205 participants were enrolled and mean BP fell from 142/87 (systolic BP/diastolic BP) to 131/81 mm Hg (a reduction of 11 (95% CI, 10–12)/7 (95% CI, 6–7) mm Hg, P < 0.001). The majority of participants achieved BP control on novel doses (84%); of those participants, 35% were controlled by 1 mg daily. The majority (88%) controlled on novel doses had no peripheral edema. Adherence to BP recording and reported adherence to medication was 84% and 94%, respectively. Patient retention was 96% (196/205). Treatment was well tolerated with no withdrawals from adverse events.

Conclusions

Personalized dose titration with amlodipine was safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in treating primary hypertension. The majority of participants achieved BP control on novel doses, and with personalization of dose there were no trial discontinuations due to drug intolerance. App‐assisted remote clinician dose titration may better balance BP control and adverse effects and help optimize long‐term care.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^117SqKgC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Studies with Amlodipine and Valsartan:

Amlodipine and valsartan has been evaluated for safety in over 2600 patients with hypertension; over 1440 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months and over 540 of these patients were treated for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy.

The hazards [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] of valsartan are generally independent of dose; those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter.

The overall frequency of adverse reactions was neither dose-related nor related to gender, age, or race. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 1.8% of patients in the amlodipine and valsartan‑treated patients and 2.1% in the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine and valsartan were peripheral edema (0.4%), and vertigo (0.2%).

### Results of a phase III, 8-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial to assess the effects of amlodipine camsylate versus amlodipine besylate in Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension [^113boLa5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine besylate has been used in Korea for the treatment of hypertension for > 17 years, with well-established efficacy and tolerability. Amlodipine camsylate is a newer formulation developed for generic use. It has been assessed in terms of physical stability and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and been found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in preclinical and Phase I and II trials. However, to date, no studies have compared the clinical effectiveness of amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate in treating hypertension.

Objective

This study was designed to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate compared with amlodipine besylate in Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This Phase III, 8-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 13 cardiology centers across the Republic of Korea. Male and female Korean patients aged 18 to 75 years having uncomplicated, mild to moderate, essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [SiDBP] 90- < 110 mm Hg) and receiving no antihypertensives in the 2 weeks before randomization were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with amlodipine camsylate or amlodipine besylate. For the first 4 weeks, patients received amlodipine 5 mg QD (morning). After 4 weeks, if either blood pressure was ≥ 140/ ≥ 90 mm Hg or SiDBP had not decreased by ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, the dose of amlodipine was increased to 10 mg QD for 4 weeks. Trough blood pressure and heart rate were measured in duplicate with the patient in the sitting position at each clinic visit (baseline [week 0] and weeks 4 and 8 of treatment); mean values were calculated and recorded. At weeks 4 and 8, tolerability was assessed using history taking and laboratory analysis, and compliance was assessed using pill counts. The primary end point was change from baseline in SiDBP at week 8. Secondary end points were change from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) at week 8 in the total population and in the subgroup of patients who had previously received antihypertensive treatment versus those who had not.

Results

A total of 189 patients were enrolled (mean age, 53 years; 105 women, 84 men; mean body weight, 65.8 kg). One patient in the amlodipine camsylate group dropped out of the study at week 0 of treatment (this patient did not use any study medication) and was excluded from the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Thus, 188 patients were treated and included in the ITT analysis (94 patients per treatment group; ITT analysis); 161 patients were included in the perprotocol (PP) analysis (n = 80 for amlodipine camsylate, n = 81 for amlodipine besylate) (14 patients in the amlodipine camsylate group and 13 patients in the amlodipine besylate group were excluded from the PP analysis due to consistent withdrawal or protocol violation). Mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (amlodipine camsylate, from 146.7 [12.3]/96.6 [5.4] to 127.9 [14.8]/83.4 [7.7] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]; amlodipine besylate, from 146.8 [12.8]/96.7 [5.1] to 128.0 [10.1]/83.8 [7.5] mm Hg [both, P < 0.001]). The differences in SiSBP/SiDBP between the 2 groups at week 8 were not significant. The SiDBP response rates in the subgroups that had and had not been previously treated with antihypertensives were statistically similar (56/69 [81.2%] and 83/92 [90.2%], respectively). The prevalences of clinical adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (amlodipine camsylate, 27.3%; amlodipine besylate, 28.7%). The most common AEs were dizziness and dyspnea (both in 3/94 [3.2%] and 1/94 [1.1%] patients who received amlodipine camsylate and amlodipine besylate, respectively).

Conclusion

The effectiveness and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate were not significantly different from those of amlodipine besylate in these Korean adults with mild to moderate hypertension.

### Persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS after two' missed doses': a randomised, double-blind comparative trial in Asian patients [^116kCPYr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Suboptimal management of hypertension is often a result of poor patient compliance in the form of missed doses of their antihypertensive medication. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was designed to compare the persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of the amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) after two 'missed doses', and also to compare the drugs' overall efficacy and safety in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in period, 222 patients were randomised to receive either amlodipine (5 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 10 mg daily, n = 109) or nifedipine GITS (30 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 60 mg daily; n = 113) for 12 weeks. A placebo was then substituted for further 2 days with continuous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The increases in the last 9 h of mean ambulatory BP on day 2 after treatment withdrawal were significantly less with amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS: 4.4 ± 7.0 vs 11.2 ± 11.3 mmHg for systolic BP (P ≤ 0.0001) and 2.4 ± 6.3 vs 6.0 ± 6.0 mmHg for diastolic BP (P ≤ 0.0002). Significant differences between the two drugs in mean 24-h ambulatory BP levels were already evident on day 1 after withdrawal, even though there were no significant differences on the final day of treatment. No differences in safety parameters were observed, and neither drug caused any serious or severe treatment-related adverse events. In conclusion, amlodipine provides greater protection than nifedipine GITS against loss of BP control following missed doses.
