## Question

Hyperplastic polyp follow up recommendations colonoscopy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyperplastic polyp follow-up recommendations after colonoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline colonoscopy quality assumptions that underpin all recommendations. Then, I should verify how hyperplastic polyps are defined and categorized by size and location. Next, I will examine the evidence-based intervals for small hyperplastic polyps, followed by the rationale and intervals for large hyperplastic polyps. After that, I need to check special scenarios such as serrated polyposis syndrome and mixed pathology. Finally, I will consider modifiers like patient age, life expectancy, and documentation, and close with practical counseling points and a concise summary of intervals.

> Let me first confirm the quality prerequisites because all surveillance intervals hinge on a high-quality index colonoscopy; I need to ensure cecal intubation, adequate preparation to detect lesions larger than 5 mm, and complete polypectomy with verification, and I should double-check that the adenoma detection rate benchmarks are met, as these factors materially affect miss rates and downstream risk stratification [^117DLjeU] [^113vgUak] [^112SJbsV].

> Now, I should define hyperplastic polyps precisely; wait, let me verify the size threshold that changes risk and the location distinctions that matter clinically. Hyperplastic polyps are non-neoplastic serrated mucosal lesions, and the key risk inflection occurs at 10 mm, with location stratification into rectosigmoid versus proximal colon because proximal lesions may carry different implications even when small; importantly, the US Multi-Society Task Force notes that individuals with only hyperplastic polyps less than 10 mm are considered to have had a normal colonoscopy for risk stratification purposes, which frames the 10-year interval recommendation [^113d7uCN] [^113D5muz].

> For small hyperplastic polyps, I will now examine the evidence for a 10-year interval; hold on, I should verify whether this applies uniformly across rectosigmoid and proximal locations. The Task Force gives a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence for ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps less than 10 mm in the rectum or sigmoid to return to routine screening in 10 years, and a weak recommendation with very low-quality evidence for the same threshold in the proximal colon, reflecting uncertainty about metachronous risk in isolated proximal hyperplastic polyps without synchronous adenomas; practically, many clinicians still apply a 10-year interval unless other risk features are present, and the AGA aligns with deferring repeat colonoscopy for 10 years when only small distal hyperplastic polyps are found [^113D5muz] [^111QU8cx] [^116i4a5A].

> But wait, what if the hyperplastic polyp is 10 mm or larger; I need to check the rationale for shortening the interval. Large serrated polyps, including hyperplastic polyps 10 mm or greater, are associated with increased risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia, so the Task Force recommends repeat colonoscopy in 3 to 5 years, favoring 3 years when there is concern about pathologist differentiation between sessile serrated polyp and hyperplastic polyp, suboptimal preparation, or uncertain completeness of excision, and favoring 5 years when those concerns are low and resection is confident; I should confirm that this is a weak recommendation with very low-quality evidence, which supports shared decision-making and documentation of rationale [^115hZApA] [^114puPMx] [^1119F1t1].

> Next, I should review special scenarios; let me consider serrated polyposis syndrome and mixed pathology because these change management entirely. If there are more than 20 cumulative hyperplastic polyps of any size, that meets World Health Organization criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome and mandates individualized, more intensive surveillance rather than standard intervals; similarly, if hyperplastic polyps coexist with conventional adenomas, the adenoma risk stratification typically governs the interval, often overriding the otherwise benign nature of small hyperplastic polyps [^114puPMx] [^112vrGs4].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-specific modifiers; hold on, I should verify how age and life expectancy influence surveillance decisions. In older adults with limited life expectancy, the absolute yield of surveillance colonoscopy is low, and overuse is common; decisions should incorporate estimated life expectancy and comorbidity, with consideration to stop or defer surveillance when benefit is unlikely, while maintaining a 10-year interval for average-risk patients with normal exams or only small hyperplastic polyps when life expectancy is substantial [^114dXQtu] [^116i4a5A].

> Documentation and quality feedback are critical; I should double-check that size is verified with photo comparison to an open snare or forceps and that pathology is explicitly recorded, because misclassification between hyperplastic polyp and sessile serrated polyp can alter intervals. The Task Force emphasizes photo documentation for polyps 10 mm or larger and recommends reporting hyperplastic polyps 10 mm or greater distinctly from other serrated lesions to support accurate surveillance planning and future risk assessment [^112SJbsV] [^114MJnoA].

> Let me synthesize the practical counseling points; I should confirm that patients understand why a 10-year interval is acceptable after small hyperplastic polyps and why a 3 to 5 year interval is prudent for large hyperplastic polyps. Emphasize that small hyperplastic polyps are non-neoplastic and confer no meaningful increase in colorectal cancer risk, whereas large serrated polyps warrant closer follow-up due to associations with advanced neoplasia; reinforce that these intervals assume high-quality baseline colonoscopy and complete polypectomy, and that new findings or evolving risk may prompt interval adjustments [^113D5muz] [^115hZApA] [^116MoFGr].

> Finally, I should summarize the intervals succinctly and verify alignment with guidelines; for ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps less than 10 mm anywhere in the colon removed at a high-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 10 years, with stronger evidence for rectosigmoid and weaker evidence for proximal colon; for any hyperplastic polyp 10 mm or larger, repeat colonoscopy in 3 to 5 years, favoring 3 years when diagnostic uncertainty, suboptimal preparation, or uncertain excision exist, and 5 years when those concerns are minimal; and if more than 20 cumulative hyperplastic polyps are present, manage as serrated polyposis syndrome with individualized surveillance [^113D5muz] [^115hZApA] [^114puPMx].

---

For hyperplastic polyps, follow-up depends on **size and location**: if ≤ 20 polyps < 10 mm are found anywhere in the colon, **repeat colonoscopy in 10 years** [^113D5muz] [^111QU8cx]; if any hyperplastic polyp is ≥ 10 mm, **repeat in 3–5 years** [^115hZApA] [^114qJfgk]. These intervals assume a high-quality colonoscopy with complete polypectomy and adequate bowel prep [^116MoFGr] [^113vgUak]; shorter intervals are warranted if there is diagnostic uncertainty, poor prep, or incomplete excision [^1119F1t1]. More than 20 hyperplastic polyps suggest serrated polyposis syndrome [^114puPMx], which requires individualized management.

---

## Risk stratification based on polyp size and location

Hyperplastic polyps are generally benign, but **size and location matter** for risk and follow-up [^113D5muz]:

| **Polyp size and location** | **Recommended follow-up interval** |
|-|-|
| ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps < 10 mm anywhere in the colon | 10 years [^113D5muz] [^111QU8cx] |
| Any hyperplastic polyp ≥ 10 mm | 3–5 years [^115hZApA] [^114qJfgk] |
| > 20 hyperplastic polyps (serrated polyposis syndrome) | Individualized management [^114puPMx] |

---

## Detailed follow-up recommendations

### Hyperplastic polyps < 10 mm

For ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps < 10 mm anywhere in the colon, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF) recommends **repeat colonoscopy in 10 years** [^113D5muz] [^111QU8cx]. This reflects their low malignant potential and minimal effect on colorectal cancer risk [^113vgUak].

---

### Hyperplastic polyps ≥ 10 mm

For any hyperplastic polyp ≥ 10 mm, the USMSTF recommends **repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years** [^115hZApA] [^114qJfgk]. Larger hyperplastic polyps may carry a higher risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia, justifying closer surveillance [^notfound].

---

### Multiple hyperplastic polyps (serrated polyposis syndrome)

More than 20 hyperplastic polyps suggest serrated polyposis syndrome, which confers a higher colorectal cancer risk and requires **individualized management** [^114puPMx].

---

## Factors influencing follow-up intervals

Several factors can **modify the standard intervals**:

- **Colonoscopy quality**: High-quality colonoscopy with complete polypectomy, adequate bowel preparation, and complete visualization of the colon is essential [^113vgUak] [^116MoFGr].
- **Pathologist consistency**: Uncertainty in distinguishing hyperplastic polyps from sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) may warrant shorter intervals [^115hZApA] [^1119F1t1].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and life expectancy should be considered when determining follow-up intervals [^114dXQtu].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

Evidence supporting these recommendations includes studies showing that patients with hyperplastic polyps have a **low risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia**, especially when polyps are < 10 mm [^111QU8cx]. Larger hyperplastic polyps (≥ 10 mm) are associated with a slightly increased risk, justifying shorter follow-up intervals [^112SJbsV].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of follow-up colonoscopy

### Benefits

Benefits include **early detection** of new polyps or colorectal cancer, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes, and **risk reduction** through removal of precancerous lesions, lowering colorectal cancer incidence and mortality [^1137Kjgu].

---

### Risks

Risks include **procedure-related complications** — such as bleeding, perforation, and infection — and **patient burden** from anxiety, time, and financial costs associated with repeat colonoscopies.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Patient-specific factors should guide follow-up intervals, including **age and comorbidities**, where older patients or those with significant comorbidities may benefit from less frequent surveillance [^114dXQtu], and **patient preferences**, where shared decision-making should incorporate patient values and preferences regarding follow-up intervals [^114k8C4D].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps < 10 mm**: Repeat colonoscopy in 10 years [^113D5muz] [^111QU8cx].
- **Any hyperplastic polyp ≥ 10 mm**: Repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years [^115hZApA] [^114qJfgk].
- **> 20 hyperplastic polyps (serrated polyposis syndrome)**: Individualized management [^114qJfgk].

---

Hyperplastic polyps are generally benign, and follow-up intervals depend on **polyp size and number**. Small hyperplastic polyps (< 10 mm) require minimal follow-up, whereas larger polyps (≥ 10 mm) or multiple polyps may necessitate closer surveillance [^114puPMx].

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy — conclusions and interval guidance note that for patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, a 7- to 10-year, rather than a 5- to 10-year follow-up recommendation is described, and patients, primary care physicians, and colonoscopists will need to engage in shared decision making regarding whether to lengthen the follow-up interval. The conclusions state that CRC incidence and mortality are decreasing secondary to improvements in risk factor exposure, screening, treatment, and perhaps exposure to surveillance among patients with polyps, and that some patients with polyps appear to have persistently increased risk for CRC and may have increased risk for advanced neoplasia on follow-up. Evidence to support best practices for surveillance colonoscopy has strengthened and has helped to support close follow-up for some groups, as well as less intensive follow-up for others, and surveillance colonoscopy to attempt to reduce CRC risk is clinically rational and recommended.

US Multi-Society Task Force update — post-polypectomy surveillance risk stratification states that evidence after normal colonoscopy has strengthened the recommendation to defer repeat screening for at least 10 years and that polyp features guide intervals. Patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower-than-average risk for incident and fatal CRC and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, whereas individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population CRC risk; emerging data support less frequent surveillance among those with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm. A combination of serrated lesions and conventional adenomas appears to confer higher risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia, and 2 studies suggest surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce incident CRC among high-risk patients, although more data are needed to prove incremental benefits for incidence and mortality reduction.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer — scope and risk framework for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy notes that colonoscopy is used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, evaluation, and surveillance, and colonoscopists are expected to provide follow-up recommendations; follow-up after normal colonoscopy among age-eligible individuals and post-polypectomy among individuals with polyps are common scenarios needing guidance. Risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia is associated with prior colonoscopy findings; after high-quality colonoscopy, patients with no neoplasia are at the lowest risk, and polyp findings are used to risk-stratify by histology, number, location, and size. The stated aim is to review newly available evidence and update recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy with or without polypectomy.

Surveillance colonoscopy after removal of adenoma — impact varies by risk features. Surveillance after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce incident colorectal cancer (CRC), but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). After removal of adenoma with low-risk features (such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm), the incremental impact on incident and fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). In a UK cohort of 11,944 patients with intermediate-risk adenoma, defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years follow-up 42% did not receive surveillance, and exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with a 43%–48% relative reduction in incident CRC risk (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40–0.80; and HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.84).

Colorectal cancer surveillance after colonoscopy — Section 1 PICO questions specify comparisons and outcomes related to follow-up intervals. In patients with normal colonoscopy, repeat colonoscopy at 10 y versus earlier surveillance and no repeat colonoscopy versus colonoscopy at 10 y or earlier are evaluated with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. For patients with 1–2 small (< 10 mm) nonadvanced adenomas, the questions ask whether surveillance is preferred to no surveillance and whether surveillance at 5 y is preferred to surveillance at 10 y. For sessile serrated adenoma/polyp, comparisons evaluate surveillance at 3 y versus surveillance at 5 or 10 y when size ≥ 10 mm and/or with dysplasia and when size < 10 mm with no dysplasia. For advanced adenoma and for patients with any advanced neoplasia defined as adenoma with ≥ 10 mm, villous histology, and/or high-grade dysplasia, the questions compare surveillance at 3 y versus at 5 or 10 y. Additional comparisons ask whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to 5 or 10 y in patients with adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size and in those with adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia.

US Multi‑Society Task Force — hyperplastic polyps (HPs) surveillance after colonoscopy: For patients with ≤ 20 hyperplastic polyps (HPs) < 10 mm in size in the rectum or sigmoid colon removed at a high‑quality examination, repeat colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in 10 years (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For patients with ≤ 20 HPs < 10 mm in size proximal to the sigmoid colon removed at a high‑quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 10 years (Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The Task Force notes no published studies on risk for metachronous advanced neoplasia or large serrated polyps among isolated proximal HPs < 10 mm without synchronous conventional adenoma and cites a cohort where among 698 patients with HPs and no concurrent conventional adenomas, high‑risk adenoma at follow‑up was 3.7% (26 of 698) and large serrated polyp was 1.6% (11 of 698); if distinguishing sessile serrated polyp (SSP) from HP is uncertain, clinicians may choose to follow SSP recommendations for isolated proximal HPs < 10 mm.

Terms, definitions, and colonoscopy quality assumptions — normal colonoscopy refers to a colonoscopy where no adenoma, sessile serrated adenoma/polyp or sessile serrated polyp (SSP), hyperplastic polyp (HP) ≥ 10 mm, traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), or CRC was found, and individuals with only HP < 10 mm are considered to have had a normal colonoscopy; low-risk adenoma refers to having 1–2 tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, each < 10 mm in size; advanced neoplasia is defined as an adenoma ≥ 10 mm, adenoma with tubulovillous or villous histology, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or presence of invasive cancer; in this report, "high-risk adenoma" refers to patients with advanced neoplasia or ≥ 3 adenomas, and because of evolving evidence about serrated lesions, SSPs and HPs are not included in definitions of low-risk adenoma, high-risk adenoma, and advanced neoplasia; uncertainty exists as to whether HPs ≥ 10 mm are associated with increased risk, and recommendations utilize specific findings such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm rather than summary categories.

### Colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy and colorectal cancer resection [^113dhZej]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

This article describes a joint update of guidelines by the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer delineating evidence-based surveillance recommendations for patients after polypectomy and colorectal cancer resection. Although there are some qualifying conditions, the following general guidelines apply: after colonoscopic polypectomy, patients with hyperplastic polyps should be considered to have normal colonoscopies, and subsequent colonoscopy is recommended at 10 years. Patients with one or two small (less than 1 cm) tubular adenomas, including those with only low-grade dysplasia, should have their next colonoscopy in five to 10 years. Patients with three to 10 adenomas, any adenoma 1 cm or larger, or any adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia should have their next colonoscopy in three years. Following curative resection of colorectal cancer, patients should undergo a colonoscopy at one year, with subsequent follow-up intervals determined by the results of this examination. Adoption of these guidelines will have a dramatic impact on the quality of care provided to patients after a colorectal cancer diagnosis, will assist in shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening, and will ultimately decrease suffering and death related to colorectal cancer.

Large serrated lesions (SSP or HP) ≥ 10 mm — For patients with SSP ≥ 10 mm at a high-quality examination, repeat colonoscopy in 3 years (Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with HP ≥ 10 mm, repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years, with a 3-year follow-up interval favored if there is concern about pathologist consistency in distinguishing SSPs from HPs, quality of bowel preparation, or complete polyp excision, whereas a 5-year interval is favored if such concerns are low; the Task Force recommends photo documentation verifying polyp size relative to an open forceps or open snare of known size. Supporting context includes that 47% of SSPs 10–20 mm had evidence of incomplete resection and that the Task Force recommends 3-year follow-up for individuals with SSPs ≥ 10 mm in size, and 3- to 5-year follow-up for individuals with HP ≥ 10 mm.

Surveillance colonoscopy after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce risk for incident CRC, but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain. In a UK cohort of patients with intermediate-risk adenomas defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years, 42% did not receive surveillance; exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with reduced incident CRC (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72 and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37–0.74). Risk for incident CRC was independently associated with increasing age, adenoma ≥ 20 mm in size, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, proximal adenoma, incomplete baseline examination, and poor bowel preparation. In a higher-risk subgroup, absolute incident CRC was 2.8% with vs 3.3% without surveillance (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.75), whereas among those not meeting higher-risk criteria it was 0.7% vs 1.1% with a nonstatistically significant reduction (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20–1.43); mortality was not assessed.

Serrated polyp (SSP) and small adenoma surveillance — follow-up intervals are specified as follows: For SSPs, follow-up in < 10 years is supported, specifically 5–10 years for 1–2 SSPs < 10 mm, 3–5 years for 3–4 SSPs < 10 mm, and 3 years for 5–10 SSPs, SSP ≥ 10 mm, or SSP with dysplasia. For adenomas, 7–10 years rather than 5–10 years follow-up is recommended after removal of 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm in size, and we have recommended 3- to 5-year follow-up for individuals with 3–4 small adenomas.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American cancer society [^112v1FMQ]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Adenomatous polyps are the most common neoplastic findings discovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or who have a diagnostic work-up for symptoms. It was common practice in the 1970s for these patients to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new adenomas and missed synchronous adenomas. As a result of the National Polyp Study report in 1993, which showed clearly in a randomized design that the first postpolypectomy examination could be deferred for 3 years, guidelines published by a gastrointestinal consortium in 1997 recommended that the first follow-up surveillance take place 3 years after polypectomy for most patients. In 2003 these guidelines were updated and colonoscopy was recommended as the only follow-up examination, stratification at baseline into low risk and higher risk for subsequent adenomas was suggested. The 1997 and 2003 guidelines dealt with both screening and surveillance. However, it has become increasingly clear that postpolypectomy surveillance is now a large part of endoscopic practice, draining resources from screening and diagnosis. In addition, surveys have shown that a large proportion of endoscopists are conducting surveillance examinations at shorter intervals than recommended in the guidelines. In the present report, a careful analytic approach was designed to address all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be stratified more definitely at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower risk or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either 3 or more adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, villous features, or an adenoma 1 cm or larger in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have 1 or 2 small (< 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up evaluation in 5–10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up evaluation, as for average-risk people. There have been recent studies that have reported a significant number of missed cancers by colonoscopy. However, high-quality baseline colonoscopy with excellent patient preparation and adequate withdrawal time should minimize this and reduce clinicians concerns. These guidelines were developed jointly by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society to provide a broader consensus and thereby increase the use of the recommendations by endoscopists. The adoption of these guidelines nationally can have a dramatic impact on shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening. It has been shown that the first screening colonoscopy and polypectomy produces the greatest effects on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps.

Colonoscopy quality assumptions — high quality is defined based on colonoscopist performance and examination-specific characteristics, including adequate adenoma detection rate (ADR), examination complete to cecum, attention to complete polypectomy, and adequate bowel preparation to reliably detect lesions > 5 mm; benchmarks for ADR (ADR > 30% in men; > 20% in women), proportion of examinations with adequate preparation (> 85%), and proportion of examinations complete to cecum (> 95%) should be universally and routinely monitored as colonoscopy quality metrics in practice; given the importance of polyp size for informing surveillance intervals, documentation of a polyp ≥ 10 mm within a report should be accompanied by an endoscopic photo of the polyp with comparison to an open snare or open biopsy forceps, and such documentation is important for HPs because small size (< 10 mm) is associated with well documented low risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia.

### Further defining the 2012 multi-society task force guidelines for surveillance of high-risk adenomas: is a 3-year interval needed for all patients? [^112QAnZo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Goals

We set out to determine whether variation from this 3-year follow-up interval was associated with the finding of subsequent high-risk adenoma (HRA).

Background

HRAs include the following: (1) an adenoma measuring ≥ 10mm, (2) ≥ 3 adenomas found during a single procedure, and (3) an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous architecture. The current Multi-Society Task Force guideline for timing of surveillance colonoscopy after removal of a HRA is 3 years.

Study

In 2016, we analyzed 495 patients who had a HRA removed during a 2008 colonoscopy. We compared the frequency of finding another HRA at follow-up intervals. We used the current guidelines as our referent group and performed logistical regression to identify whether any patient characteristics, procedural factors, or type of HRA predicted the development of HRAs on follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

Individuals who followed-up at a median of 4.5 years did not have more HRA on follow-up compared with those who followed-up at 3 years (25.2% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.062). These groups had similar baseline characteristics. Older individuals, male gender, having a history of polyps, and piecemeal resection of an HRA predicted future HRAs. The removal of ≥ 3 adenomas in 2008 as well as a combination of multiple, large, and advanced polyps showed a higher risk of future HRAs.

Conclusions

The 2012 Multi-Society Task Force recommendation of 3-year follow-up after removal of HRAs may not apply to all patients. We showed that a combination of patient demographics, procedural factors, and pathology best determines the surveillance colonoscopy interval.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — surveillance intervals after colonoscopy — patients harboring advanced precancerous lesions should have a follow-up colonoscopy ≤ 3 years after the index examination. In contrast, average-risk patients who undergo a high-quality colonoscopy negative for precancerous polyps or with only small distal hyperplastic polyps have a very low risk of future neoplasia and should not be rescreened for 10 years. There is also increasing evidence that patients with 1–2 small adenomas (and especially 1–2 diminutive adenomas) are not at significantly elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and endoscopists should consider assigning a 10-year follow-up interval for this group as well.

### Outcomes at follow-up of negative colonoscopy in average risk population: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sDtgw]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We carried out a systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to a predefined protocol (PROSPERO register: CRD42019127842). Reporting follows the PRISMA and MOOSE statements.

Data sources and searches

We searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for eligible studies from inception to 14 June 2019. Search terms and their combinations used in the search strategy included colon, neoplasm, adenoma, polyp, follow-up, repeat, colonoscopy, and endoscopic examination. The search strategy is detailed in supplementary appendix 1. We searched the reference lists of identified publications for additional relevant studies and also scanned reference lists of related articles and guidelines.

Study selection

Published studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the outcome of a follow-up colonoscopy in participants at average risk for colorectal cancer with a negative previous colonoscopy (no adenomas). The target population consisted of people who were asymptomatic at presentation for the follow-up colonoscopy with "screening" as the only indication. However, mixed populations, including people with family history or an indication for colonoscopy due to symptoms at the time of the follow-up colonoscopy, were also eligible. Studies assessing tandem, back-to-back, or early repeat colonoscopies were not eligible. The review was restricted to original articles published in the English language. The first author screened full text articles for eligibility, and ambiguities were resolved by discussion among all authors.

Other risk factors for metachronous neoplasia — Smoking may be associated with risk for recurrent conventional adenoma as well as serrated polyps, and environmental factors such as rural vs urban residence may contribute to risk for cancer after advanced adenoma removal. Metabolic syndrome and obesity have been reported by a number of studies to be associated with increased risk for recurrent neoplasia. Race does not appear to modify risk for recurrent adenoma and metachronous advanced neoplasia; a retrospective cohort of 246 whites and 203 black patients with at least 1 surveillance colonoscopy found similar rates of recurrent adenoma and advanced neoplasia, and a cohort from the Polyp Prevention Trial comparing 1668 white and 153 black patients found no difference in rates. Having a flat adenoma may increase risk for recurrent neoplasia, but more data are needed to support differential management. Diet might modify risk, but evidence to support its impact is limited; one study found no clear association between fruit and vegetable intake and risk for adenoma recurrence.

Piecemeal resection follow-up — For patients with piecemeal resection of adenoma or SSP > 20 mm, repeat colonoscopy in 6 months (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). A meta-analysis of 33 studies found recurrent neoplasia was 20% for piecemeal vs just 3% for en bloc EMR; in the subgroup with EMR of polyps 10–20 mm, piecemeal resection was associated with an 18% risk, similar to the 19% rate observed for polyps 20–30 mm and > 30 mm, and incomplete resection was more common with piecemeal (20%) vs en bloc resection (8.4%). For polyps ≥ 20 mm resected piecemeal, the Task Force recommended first surveillance colonoscopy at approximately 6 months, second surveillance 1 year from first surveillance, and third surveillance 3 years from the second surveillance.

### Follow up of patients with colorectal polyps: are the BSG guidelines being adhered to? [^114tzpsy]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The publication of the BSG guidelines in 2002 provided a framework for the follow up of patients with colorectal polyps. The aim of the present study was to determine whether they had, or were being correctly adhered to in a moderately sized District General Hospital.

Method

A total of 598 patients were on the waiting list for colonoscopy at Airedale General Hospital (AGH) in February 2005. Of these, 203 were being followed up as a result of the previous finding of a polyp.

Results

Only 14.8% of patients had been or were being followed up according to the BSG guidelines. The majority of the 85.2% of patients who did not comply with follow up did so as a result of over investigation. Seventy-eight per cent of the low-risk group and 55% of the intermediate-risk group had been colonoscoped, or were waiting to have colonoscopy, too soon or too frequently according to the BSG guidelines. Twenty-four patients with hyperplastic polyps were being followed up incorrectly, as were 17 patients discovered to have a polyp pathology on flexible sigmoidoscopy. It was established that 131 extra colonoscopies had been, or were planned to be performed unnecessarily.

Conclusion

These data have major implications with regard to patient safety, service provision and cost to the NHS.

### Colonoscopy quality measures and adherence to follow-up guidelines among endoscopists participating in a U.S. endoscopy registry [^113Cj2qB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Colonoscopy screening can substantially reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Colonoscopies may achieve maximum benefit when they are performed with high quality and accompanied by follow-up recommendations that adhere to clinical guidelines. This study aimed to determine to what extent endoscopists met targets for colonoscopy quality from 2016 through 2019 (the most recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic).

Methods

We examined measures of colonoscopy quality and recommended follow-up intervals in the GI Quality Improvement Consortium, a large nationwide endoscopy registry. The analysis included > 2.5 million outpatient screening colonoscopies in average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years.

Results

At least 90% of endoscopists met performance targets for adequate bowel preparation, cecal intubation rate, and adenoma detection rate. However, nonadherence to guidelines for follow-up intervals was common. For patients with no colonoscopy findings, 12.0% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 5 years instead of the guideline-recommended 10 years. For patients with 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas, 13.5% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 3 years instead of the guideline-recommended 5 to 10 years. For patients with small sessile serrated polyps, 30.7% received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≤ 3 years instead of the guideline-recommended 5 years. Some patients with higher risk findings received a follow-up interval recommendation of ≥ 5 years instead of the guideline-recommended 3 years, including 18.2% of patients with advanced serrated lesions.

Conclusions

Additional attention may be needed to achieve more consistent adherence to guidelines for colonoscopy follow-up recommendations.

### Are physicians doing too much colonoscopy? A national survey of colorectal surveillance after polypectomy [^113j3Mbi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing use of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance of colorectal adenomas after polypectomy has given rise to concerns about the availability of endoscopic resources in the United States. Guidelines recommend surveillance after polypectomy at 3 to 5 years for a small adenoma, and follow-up is not advised for hyperplastic polyps. The intensity of physicians' surveillance is largely unstudied.

Objective

To survey practicing gastroenterologists and general surgeons about their perceived need for the frequency of surveillance after polypectomy, to compare survey responses to practice guidelines, and to identify factors influencing their recommendations for surveillance.

Design

Survey study conducted by the National Cancer Institute.

Setting

A nationally representative study of physicians in the United States.

Participants

349 gastroenterologists and 316 general surgeons.

Measurements

Questionnaires mailed in 1999 and 2000 assessed physicians' recommendations for surveillance after polypectomy in asymptomatic, average-risk patients.

Results

Response rates were 83%. Among gastroenterologists (317 of 349) and surgeons (125 of 316) who perform screening colonoscopy, 24% (95% CI, 19.3% to 28.7%) of gastroenterologists and 54% (CI, 44.9% to 62.5%) of surgeons recommend surveillance for a hyperplastic polyp. For a small adenoma, most physicians recommended surveillance colonoscopy and more than 50% recommended examinations every 3 years or more often. Physicians indicated that published evidence was very influential in their practice (83% [CI, 78.8% to 87.2%] of gastroenterologists and 78% [CI, 72.5% to 86.8%] of surgeons). By contrast, only half of respondents reported that guidelines were very influential.

Limitations

The study was based on physicians' self-reported practice patterns. Results may overestimate or underestimate the performance of surveillance colonoscopy.

Conclusions

Some surveillance colonoscopy seems to be inappropriately performed and in excess of guidelines, particularly for hyperplastic polyps and low-risk lesions such as a small adenoma. These results suggest unnecessary demand for endoscopic resources.

### Association of life expectancy with surveillance colonoscopy findings and follow-up recommendations in older adults [^114dXQtu]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Surveillance after prior colon polyps is the most frequent indication for colonoscopy in older adults. However, to our knowledge, the current use of surveillance colonoscopy, clinical outcomes, and follow-up recommendations in association with life expectancy, factoring in both age and comorbidities, have not been studied.

Objective

To evaluate the association of estimated life expectancy with surveillance colonoscopy findings and follow-up recommendations among older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This registry-based cohort study used data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry (NHCR) linked with Medicare claims data and included adults in the NHCR who were older than 65 years, underwent colonoscopy for surveillance after prior polyps between April 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, and had full Medicare Parts A and B coverage and no Medicare managed care plan enrollment in the year prior to colonoscopy. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to March 2021.

Exposures

Life expectancy (< 5 years, 5 to < 10 years, or ≥ 10 years), estimated using a validated prediction model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were clinical findings of colon polyps or colorectal cancer (CRC) and recommendations for future colonoscopy.

Results

Among 9831 adults included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 73.2 (5.0) years and 5285 (53.8%) were male. A total of 5649 patients (57.5%) had an estimated life expectancy of 10 or more years, 3443 (35.0%) of 5 to less than 10 years, and 739 (7.5%) of less than 5 years. Overall, 791 patients (8.0%) had advanced polyps (768 [7.8%]) or CRC (23 [0.2%]). Among the 5281 patients with available recommendations (53.7%), 4588 (86.9%) were recommended to return for future colonoscopy. Those with longer life expectancy or more advanced clinical findings were more likely to be told to return. For example, among patients with no polyps or only small hyperplastic polyps, 132 of 227 (58.1%) with life expectancy of less than 5 years were told to return for future surveillance colonoscopy vs 940 of 1257 (74.8%) with life expectancy of 5 to less than 10 years and 2163 of 2272 (95.2%) with life expectancy of 10 years or more (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, the likelihood of finding advanced polyps and CRC on surveillance colonoscopy was low regardless of life expectancy. Despite this observation, 58.1% of older adults with less than 5 years' life expectancy were recommended to return for future surveillance colonoscopy. These data may help refine decision-making about pursuing or stopping surveillance colonoscopy in older adults with a history of polyps.

### Outcomes at follow-up of negative colonoscopy in average risk population: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iJoNG]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Furthermore, people with poorer bowel preparation at index colonoscopy, who are expected to have higher miss rates, may be more likely to be recommended to undergo follow-up colonoscopies after shorter time intervals than people with better bowel preparation. The same may apply to people deemed to be at higher risk of developing colorectal neoplasms for other reasons, such as lifestyle related risk factors. The potential over-representation of such people at higher risk in the short interval group compared with the longer interval groups may also contribute to both the high prevalence of any neoplasm in the interval group of one to five years and the apparently modest increase in prevalence with increasing length of intervals between colonoscopies. Nevertheless, despite these likely selection processes, the increase in prevalence of any neoplasm from 17.2% to 27.1% between the one to five year and the five to 10 year interval groups in the studies in which most participants had screening as an indication are compatible with the assumed 2% incidence per year.

The estimated yield of approximately 3% of advanced neoplasms and the very low prevalences of cancer over the first 10 years constitute evidence encouraging people without symptoms who are at average risk, as well as their physicians, to adhere to the full recommended 10 years between the colonoscopies. Moreover, the annual transition rate from non-advanced to advanced adenomas was previously estimated to be around 4%, which suggests that most of the advanced lesions detected at follow-up did not develop de novo but were probably missed at index colonoscopies. Some of the advanced neoplasms detected may also be related to biological factors leading to rapid progression. Incomplete removal or accelerated polyp formation may also contribute to explaining the substantial increase in the prevalence of advanced neoplasms beyond 10 years. However, given that the summary estimate (and median value) for prevalence of any advanced neoplasm was more than doubled, thereby reaching a prevalence similar to first time screening, it is plausible to assume that a part of these findings truly represents new lesions that developed via the adenomatous polyps pathway.

### Compliance with follow-up guidelines after high-risk colorectal polyp removal: a population-based study [^111bzPm4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

After high-risk colorectal adenoma removal, colorectal cancer risk remains higher than that in the general population. Depending on polyp characteristics, a 3-month or 3-year follow-up colonoscopy is recommended, and clear follow-up instructions must be given to the patient. Our primary aim was to evaluate compliance with French follow-up recommendations. Second, we evaluated the impact of how the information was given and if patients actually underwent their control colonoscopy according to the instructions given.

Methods

We collected data from the Burgundy polyp population-based registry and medical records from the endoscopy centers of the area. Between June 30, 2014 and July 1, 2015, 405 patients were included in this study.

Results

Written follow-up instructions were provided to 345 patients (85.2%), and 184 of them (53.3%) complied with guidelines. For 29.9% the interval to follow-up colonoscopy was longer than recommended, and for 6.4% the interval was shorter. Among the 303 patients who had clear follow-up instructions, 42.2% had their control colonoscopy and 83.6% respected the stipulated interval. Follow-up instructions were found in the colonoscopy report in at least 49% of cases.

Conclusions

Compliance with follow-up guidelines was poor: Inappropriate intervals were often longer than recommended. Patients with written follow-up instructions and those who underwent follow-up colonoscopy mostly followed these instructions. Ensuring compliance with guidelines and giving written instructions to patients should be primary goals to achieve effective follow-up. Gastroenterologist training should be improved in this way.

### Overuse of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^111h8Vbz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ongoing efforts to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates have raised concerns that these exams may be overused, thereby subjecting patients to unnecessary risks and wasting healthcare resources.

Objective

Our aim was to measure overuse of screening and surveillance colonoscopies among average-risk adults, and to identify correlates of overuse.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Our approach was a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data for patients 50–65 years old with no personal history of CRC or colorectal adenomas with an incident CRC screening colonoscopy from 2001 to 2010 within a multispecialty physician group practice.

Main Outcome Measures

We measured time to next screening or surveillance colonoscopy and predictors of overuse (exam performed more than one year earlier than guideline recommended intervals) of colonoscopies.

Key Results

We identified 1,429 adults who had an incident colonoscopy between 2001 and 2010, and they underwent an additional 871 screening or surveillance colonoscopies during a median follow-up of 6 years. Most follow-up screening colonoscopies (88%) and many surveillance colonoscopies (49%) repeated during the study represented overuse. Time to next colonoscopy after incident screening varied by exam findings (no polyp: median 6.9 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 5.1–10.0; hyperplastic polyp: 5.7 years, IQR: 4.9–9.7; low-risk adenoma: 5.1 years, IQR: 3.3–6.3; high-risk adenoma: 2.9 years, IQR: 2.0–3.4, p < 0.001). In logistic regression models of colonoscopy overuse, an endoscopist recommendation for early follow-up was strongly associated with overuse of screening colonoscopy (OR 6.27, 95% CI: 3.15–12.50) and surveillance colonoscopy (OR 13.47, 95% CI 6.61–27.46). In a multilevel logistic regression model, variation in the overuse of screening colonoscopy was significantly associated with the endoscopist performing the previous exam.

Conclusions

Overuse of screening and surveillance exams are common and should be monitored by healthcare systems. Variations in endoscopist recommendations represent targets for interventions to reduce overuse.

Follow-up colonoscopies

Of the 610 patients harboring adenomatous polyps, 156 (25.6%) had at least 1 documented follow-up colonoscopy performed at our institution within the 14 years of follow up (2008–2021). This first follow-up colonoscopy was performed after a mean of 2.9 ± 2.3 years. Follow-up timing ranged from a few months (typically 6 months) to 9 years. A minority of patients had their first follow up after a few months, and those were to follow-up on piecemeal resections of large polyps (≥ 2 cm) as recommended by guidelines. The most common indication for those subsequent colonoscopies was surveillance of colonic polyps (74.4%). Other indications included change in bowel habits (7.7%), abdominal pain (7.1%), rectal bleeding (3.8%), and anemia/positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (3.2%). The remaining follow-up colonoscopies were for abnormal lab results or abnormal non-specific abdominal imaging. Forty-seven percent of patients who underwent a follow-up colonoscopy had new adenomatous polyps.

Perform subsequent colonoscopies at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. Decide on intervals between colonoscopies in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals if neoplastic polyps are detected. Do not use these intervals in patients with Lynch syndrome.

### Increased incidence of colorectal adenomas in follow-up evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed hyperplastic polyps [^112n2fhE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although adenomatous polyps have been established clearly as precursor lesions for most cases of colorectal cancer, the role, if any, of hyperplastic polyps remains uncertain. The aim of the current study was to determine whether a patient with an index finding of hyperplastic polyp on colonoscopy is at increased risk for adenomatous polyps.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the records of a single surgeon's colonoscopic experience over a 20-year period (June 1973 to December 1994). Patients found to have hyperplastic lesions on index colonoscopy were compared with those who had "clean" index colonoscopies. The two groups were compared for the subsequent diagnosis of adenomatous polyps on follow-up colonoscopies. Those with cancer or adenomas at index colonoscopy or in their history were excluded. We used Cox proportional hazard modeling with subsequent adenoma or cancer diagnosis at follow-up colonoscopy as the outcome, controlling for age and gender.

Results

We identified 42 patients for whom hyperplastic polyps were the only colorectal neoplasms found on the index examination, in contrast to 362 control patients who had a "clean" index examination. In this cohort study, patients found to have only hyperplastic polyps on initial examination had a rate of subsequent adenoma diagnoses (42%) twice that of patients with a clean initial colonoscopy (21%). Mean follow-up time was 4.3 years. The relative rate ratio was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.2–3.4).

Conclusions

This study suggests that patients found to have hyperplastic polyps on initial colonoscopic examination may have twice the risk of adenomas on follow-up colonoscopy, as compared with those who have clean initial examinations. If this finding is borne out in larger prospective studies, surveillance strategies may need to be modified accordingly.

### Endoscopic versus histological characterisation of polyps during screening colonoscopy [^113WxGo6]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Background

As screening colonoscopy becomes more widespread, the costs for histopathological assessment of resected polyps are rising correspondingly. Reference centres have published highly accurate results for endoscopic polyp classification. Therefore, it has been proposed that, for smaller polyps, the differential diagnosis that guides follow-up recommendations could be based on endoscopy alone.

Objective

The aim was to prospectively assess whether the high accuracy for endoscopic polyp diagnosis as reported by reference centres can be reproduced in routine screening colonoscopy.

Design

Ten experienced private practice endoscopists had initial training in pit patterns. Then they assessed all polyps detected during 1069 screening colonoscopies. Patients (46% men; mean age 63 years) were randomly assigned to colonoscopy with conventional or latest generation HDTV instruments. The main outcome measure was diagnostic accuracy of in vivo polyp assessment (adenomatous vs hyperplastic). Secondary outcome measures were differences between endoscopes and reliability of image-based follow-up recommendations; a blinded post hoc analysis of polyp photographs was also performed.

Results

675 polyps were assessed (461 adenomatous, 214 hyperplastic). Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of in vivo diagnoses were 76.6%, 78.1% and 73.4%; size of adenomas and endoscope withdrawal time significantly influenced accuracy. Image-based recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance were correct in only 69.5% of cases. Post hoc analysis of polyp photographs did not improve accuracy.

Conclusions

In everyday practice, endoscopic classification of polyp type is not accurate enough to abandon histopathological assessment and use of latest generation colonoscopes does not improve this. Image-based surveillance recommendations after polypectomy would consequently not meet guideline requirements.

### Surveillance after positive and negative colonoscopy examinations: issues, yields, and use [^112MUkch]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

As colorectal cancer screening gains acceptance by the public, the use of colonoscopy will increase. The frequency of surveillance examinations after detection of an adenoma is one of the largest contributors to the cost of colorectal cancer screening. Ten years after the publication of the landmark National Polyp Study, the issue of when to perform surveillance examinations and how often to expect advanced findings remains acute. Current guidelines for surveillance vary across specialty organizations. Individuals with advanced adenomas are at increased risk for recurrent advanced adenomas. The impact of multiple nonadvanced adenomas or a single nonadvanced adenoma on subsequent risk of an advanced adenoma or cancer is less clear. Still less is known about findings on repeat examinations after an initial negative examination, whether after colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The yield after a negative examination is an important consideration in determining the recommended interval for screening colonoscopy. For example, the data supporting a 10-yr interval for screening colonoscopy is only indirect. What little we do know about the yield after negative examinations comes from selected, nonrepresentative populations. Of concern, evidence from several polyp prevention trials demonstrates higher yields for subsequent cancer than would be expected, despite a relatively high use of surveillance procedures in follow-up. Further population-based research on the frequency of use and yield of surveillance examinations is needed. Studies that examine the need and the needed timing of subsequent surveillance are essential to containing costs for screening as well as to informing the public better about what endoscopic screening can and cannot accomplish.

### Adherence to post-polypectomy surveillance guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ta8G8]. Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major worldwide cause of cancer-related mortality. Colonoscopy programs based on guideline-recommended surveillance intervals have been put in place to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CRC. We were interested to evaluate clinical practice adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance intervals, the potential extent of early repeat colonoscopies, and causes of nonadherence to guideline recommendations.

Methods

We performed a literature search for articles reporting on guideline adherence for surveillance colonoscopies. Exclusion criteria included inflammatory bowel disease and hereditary CRC syndrome cohorts. Primary outcome was correct interval assignment in patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Groups were assessed for adherence according to their respective guideline recommendations (North American or European).

Results

16 studies were included in the analysis. The mean colonoscopy surveillance interval adherence rate was 48.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.3–60.4). For North American guidelines, surveillance interval assignments were adherent to guideline recommendations in 44.7% (95%CI 24.2–66.3) of patients after detection of low risk lesions and in 54.6% (95%CI 41.4–67.4) after detection of high risk lesions. For European guidelines, surveillance interval assignments were adherent to recommendations in 24.4% (95%CI 1.1–63.4) of patients after detection of low risk lesions and in 73.6% (95%CI 35.5–98.8) after detection of high risk lesions.

Conclusions

The worldwide adherence to surveillance colonoscopy guidelines was low, with more than 50% of patients undergoing repeat colonoscopies either too early or too late. Early repeat colonoscopies occurred with the highest frequency for patients in whom only hyperplastic polyps or low risk adenomas were found.

### Colonoscopy follow-up: U.S. multi-society task force on… [^116ARgFg]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

- Finding polyps larger than 10 mm, between five and 10 sessile serrated polyps or adenomas, polyps with dysplasia, or traditional serrated adenomas confers high risk, and repeat colonoscopy is recommended in three years. From the AFP Editors. Adequate Study The task force defines an adequate study as a high-quality colonoscopy, which requires bowel preparation sufficient to visualize all polyps larger than 5 mm, examination to the cecum, and complete excision of all polyps found. Physicians who perform high-quality colonoscopies should detect adenomas in more than 30% of men and 20% of women who are screened. Normal Colonoscopy A normal colonoscopy report can include hyperplastic polyps less than 10 mm in diameter, but no other findings. A single normal colonoscopy denotes a lifetime CRC mortality risk 68% lower than the general population. Although there is no direct evidence of benefit, the group recommends a 10-year follow-up after a normal study.

SESSILE SERRATED POLYPS The neoplasia risk after finding sessile serrated polyps appears to be less than for tubular adenomas. When sessile serrated polyps are at least 10 mm in diameter or have dysplasia, risk appears to be high and a three-year follow-up is recommended. Without these features, follow-up depends on the number of lesions. For one to two polyps, a five- to 10-year follow-up colonoscopy is recommended. This interval is three to five years with three to four sessile serrated polyps and three years with five to 10 polyps. TRADITIONAL SERRATED ADENOMAS Traditional serrated adenomas confer a higher neoplasia risk than tubular adenomas, so a three-year follow-up colonoscopy is recommended when they are found. HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS Hyperplastic polyps smaller than 10 mm do not increase risk and can be part of a normal colonoscopy.

A three- to five-year follow-up colonoscopy is recommended for a hyperplastic polyp 10 mm or larger because any large serrated polyp increases risk of neoplasia. Finding more than 20 hyperplastic polyps suggests a serrated polyposis syndrome, which indicates higher risk requiring individualized follow-up. Fewer than 20 hyperplastic polyps smaller than 10 mm indicates a low risk for neoplasia.

### When is the right time to repeat colonoscopy? [^115L6c1K]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Post-polypectomy and post-cancer resection surveillance are the most common indications for performing colonoscopy. What do the new guidelines recommend for post-polypectomy surveillance. Essentially, they place patients into one of three groups: no-risk, low-risk, or high-risk for developing colorectal neoplasia, based on the results of their initial screening colonoscopy. Patients in the no-risk group may have small rectal hyperplastic polyps and should have a repeat colonoscopy in 10 years. Patients in the low-risk group have one or two small adenomas that are smaller than 1 cm and have no or only low-grade dysplasia; they should have a repeat colonoscopy in five to 10 years. Patients in the high-risk group have three or more adenomas or polyps 1 cm or larger, or high-grade dysplasia, and should have a repeat colonoscopy in three years. What do the new guidelines recommend for surveillance after colorectal cancer resection.

The initial endoscopic evaluation should be complete and thorough. If an obstructing lesion prevents a high-quality clearing colonoscopy, one should be performed three to six months after resection. Subsequent colonoscopies should occur one, three, and five years from the resection, unless findings warrant an earlier examination. In patients with rectal cancer, local endoscopic examinations every three to six months for two to three years after the resection are important to evaluate for metachro-nous disease. 5, 6 Current evidence suggests that this may be the result of incomplete polyp removal, missed lesions, and rapidly evolving cancers. The gastroenterolo-gist must assess the quality of the baseline colonoscopy and make recommendations to the patient and primary care physician.

Physicians should use these new guidelines to determine when to repeat colonoscopy. No studies have shown a benefit to repeat colonoscopy sooner than guideline recommendations. The fact remains that the first screening colonoscopy is the most effective in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps. 7 These guidelines likely will continue to evolve for two reasons. First, new follow-up data on patients who have adenomas and cancer continue to be presented. Studies that were released after these guidelines continue to support the current risk-stratification classification.
