## Question

What clinical signs and symptoms suggest a pseudoaneurysm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms that suggest a pseudoaneurysm across anatomical sites and scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology and how it predicts bedside findings. Then, I should outline the universal features that recur regardless of location. Next, I will consider location-specific manifestations in peripheral, visceral, central, and cardiac territories. After that, I need to review complication-driven syndromes like rupture, compression, thromboembolism, and infection. Then, I should account for asymptomatic or incidental presentations and surveillance contexts. Finally, I will synthesize the key physical examination clues that should raise suspicion and prompt imaging, making sure I verify each point against guideline-level or corroborative sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological foundation that drives the clinical picture. A pseudoaneurysm is a contained arterial wall rupture in which blood exits through a defect and is confined by surrounding soft tissues and a reactive fibrous capsule rather than native arterial layers; this direct arterial communication predicts a pulsatile mass, progressive enlargement from ongoing arterial pressure, and a higher propensity to rupture compared with true aneurysms, so I need to ensure I keep those three behaviors front-of-mind when interpreting symptoms and signs.

> Wait, let me verify the universal features that appear across locations before getting granular by site. The most consistent clinical clue is a soft, expansile pulsatile mass, typically synchronous with the cardiac cycle and sometimes tender if expanding or irritated, with many reports emphasizing this as the dominant presenting feature spanning the foot to the groin to the wrist, though tenderness and pain vary with size and expansion rate [^112hN6QQ] [^111JtYjZ]. Localized pain and swelling often reflect capsular distension, adjacent nerve irritation, or venous compression, and a perivascular hematoma may be visible or palpable, which is why distinguishing a hematoma with transmitted pulsation from a truly expansile lesion matters at the bedside [^111JtYjZ] [^114kJPfj] [^116FK9Th]. Hold on, I should also verify timing — presentation can be delayed days to years after the inciting trauma or procedure, so late-onset pain, mass, or bleeding after a seemingly distant event should still trigger suspicion for a pseudoaneurysm [^114TpTHE] [^116qRpu5].

> Next, I will examine peripheral artery locations, because the anatomic neighborhood dictates symptomatology. In the femoral territory, patients may present with a groin pulsatile mass, pain, and importantly edema or even deep vein thrombosis from ipsilateral venous compression, which should prompt me to consider early surgical consultation rather than thrombin injection if there is significant venous compromise or inflammation from compression-related thrombosis [^112EZQge] [^116SwS4Z] [^114kJPfj]. For radial artery pseudoaneurysms, I need to check for hand or digital ischemia from thromboembolism or compression and look for focal pulsatility on exam, remembering that distal neurologic symptoms can accompany mass effect in the confined spaces of the hand and wrist [^112WeEFn] [^112QJKKi]. For popliteal lesions, I should consider a posterior knee pulsatile mass with possible distal ischemia, while also recalling that, unlike other sites, rupture is comparatively uncommon, so limb ischemia from thrombosis or embolization tends to dominate the presentation [^notfound]. Dorsalis pedis pseudoaneurysms classically present as a dorsal foot pulsatile mass with pressure-related discomfort, and given the superficial location, they are often readily appreciable on inspection and palpation [^112hN6QQ] [^1124x4mm].

> I will now consider visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, where symptoms often reflect bleeding into adjacent structures or parenchyma. Renal pseudoaneurysm classically presents with gross hematuria and flank pain after trauma or intervention, although I should double-check that angiography or repeat imaging is obtained when hematuria recurs despite initially negative studies because delayed radiographic manifestation is well documented [^114TpTHE] [^117DLDYB]. Hepatic and splenic artery pseudoaneurysms can present with abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding such as hematemesis or melena, or hemodynamic instability; importantly, SVS guidelines recommend repair of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms urgently and splenic artery pseudoaneurysms of any size in appropriate candidates due to the high rupture risk, which reinforces why even vague abdominal symptoms in a high-risk context warrant expedited imaging and management [^111JtYjZ] [^1139viyP]. But wait, I should verify that the literature on peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms also underscores GI bleeding, sentinel drain bleeding, and late rebleeding as common clinical scenarios, which it does, emphasizing the need to act at the first warning bleed rather than wait for massive hemorrhage [^112y2Qjy] [^1131PcGL] [^117Xnr7U].

> Hold on, I should review central and cardiac territories because their symptom profiles can be life-threatening or deceptively nonspecific. Aortic pseudoaneurysm may present with chest or back pain, cough, hoarseness, dysphagia, or even signs of venous congestion such as facial swelling, and if retroperitoneal bleeding occurs, cutaneous ecchymoses like Cullen's or Grey Turner's signs can appear late; the clinical spectrum spans incidental findings to catastrophic rupture, so a high index of suspicion is critical after trauma or surgery [^114wzk2T] [^116qRpu5]. Carotid pseudoaneurysm can present as a neck pulsatile mass or with neurologic deficits from thromboembolism, though asymptomatic presentations are not uncommon, which means I need to check for subtle cranial or focal neurologic signs in addition to inspecting the neck [^1141aPsL] [^116BoSN3]. Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm often manifests with hemoptysis or respiratory symptoms from airway compression or rupture, which should prompt urgent imaging and interventional consultation given the bleeding risk in the thoracic cavity [^111mNtwL]. For ventricular pseudoaneurysms, I should consider chest pain, dyspnea, arrhythmias, and heart failure symptoms, while remembering their notorious rupture propensity and thus the need for rapid cardiothoracic evaluation when suspected after myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery [^113RTYeH] [^113p9PuC].

> Next, I should review complication-driven syndromes, because many patients present with sequelae rather than the pseudoaneurysm itself. Rupture can produce acute hemorrhagic shock with hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, altered mentation, or a preceding sentinel bleed from a drain or tract in postoperative patients, and I need to act on sentinel bleeding immediately rather than observe, given its strong association with impending major hemorrhage in pancreaticobiliary contexts [^111JtYjZ] [^1131PcGL] [^117Xnr7U]. Compression syndromes include venous outflow obstruction with limb swelling or DVT and, in the pelvis or retroperitoneum, even ureteral obstruction causing hydronephrosis and acute kidney injury, so I should examine for edema patterns and consider proximal mass effect when DVT coexists with a pulsatile mass [^114kJPfj] [^112EZQge] [^116SwS4Z]. Thromboembolism from intra-saccular thrombus may cause distal ischemia with pallor, coolness, pain, and pulse deficits, particularly in small caliber or end-artery territories like the hand, warranting an urgent vascular assessment [^112QJKKi]. Infection-related or mycotic pseudoaneurysms may present with fever, chills, leukocytosis, purulent drainage, or sepsis superimposed on local pseudoaneurysm signs, so I should confirm systemic signs and tailor management toward both source control and reconstruction when infection is present [^114Buwdi] [^111zsW54] [^1178KkAZ].

> I need to ensure I also account for asymptomatic and incidental presentations so I do not over-rely on dramatic findings. Small or stable pseudoaneurysms can be entirely asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging or during surveillance after interventions, while some carotid and cardiac lesions may be found without overt symptoms, which means careful imaging review and targeted questioning are essential once a lesion is detected [^113RTYeH] [^1141aPsL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that quiescence equals safety, because SVS guidance emphasizes that visceral pseudoaneurysms, particularly hepatic and splenic, may remain silent until rupture and therefore warrant repair when identified in appropriate surgical candidates, even if asymptomatic [^1154TPWy] [^1139viyP]. I should also double-check post-procedural and transplant surveillance contexts, where color Doppler ultrasound is recommended for suspected access-related or transplant-related pseudoaneurysms, and where increased awareness by interventionalists improves timely detection after catheterization [^113uHeho] [^117YKNeQ] [^111K3jGF].

> Finally, I will synthesize the bedside examination features that should heighten suspicion and trigger confirmatory imaging. On palpation, an expansile pulsation that increases in all directions with each heartbeat, sometimes with a palpable thrill, differentiates pseudoaneurysm from a simple hematoma's transmitted pulsation; focal tenderness suggests expansion or impending complications, and I need to check for distal pulse changes or neurologic deficits that point to compression or embolization downstream [^116FK9Th] [^112hN6QQ]. On auscultation, a bruit directly over the mass indicates turbulent flow through a narrow neck and supports an arterial communication, which should push me toward urgent duplex ultrasound to look for characteristic to-and-fro flow and the yin-yang color pattern if the clinical setting allows safe imaging before intervention [^112WeEFn] [^111ATFVa]. I should also verify hemodynamic stability and look for systemic bleeding signs, remembering late cutaneous ecchymoses like Cullen's and Grey Turner's as potential markers of retroperitoneal hemorrhage in the right clinical context, and I must not delay escalation of care if any red flags for rupture or critical ischemia are present [^116qRpu5] [^111JtYjZ].

Pseudoaneurysms present with a **pulsatile mass** and **bruit/thrill** at the site of arterial injury or intervention [^112hN6QQ], often with localized pain, swelling, and erythema [^112WeEFn]. Neurologic deficits or ischemic symptoms may occur from compression or embolization [^111JtYjZ], and rupture can cause sudden severe pain, hypotension, or shock [^1154TPWy]. Diagnosis is confirmed by **ultrasound** with a "yin-yang" sign and "to-and-fro" flow [^111ATFVa], or by CT/MR angiography [^114jTYQp] [^1145Csxs].

---

## Localized clinical signs

- **Pulsatile mass**: A hallmark finding, often palpable and pulsatile, typically located at the site of arterial injury or intervention [^114jTYQp] [^112hN6QQ].

- **Bruit or thrill**: Auscultation or palpation may reveal a bruit or thrill due to turbulent blood flow within the pseudoaneurysm sac [^117YKNeQ].

- **Localized pain and swelling**: Patients frequently report localized pain, swelling, and erythema at the affected site [^111yhRJD] [^112WeEFn].

- **Expanding hematoma**: Rapidly expanding hematoma may be observed, particularly in acute or traumatic cases [^114jTYQp].

---

## Neurological and ischemic symptoms

Neurological deficits may result from compression of adjacent nerves and include **numbness, tingling, or weakness** [^112WeEFn]. Ischemic symptoms may arise from embolization or compression of adjacent arteries, leading to **limb or digital ischemia** [^111JtYjZ].

---

## Systemic symptoms and complications

Rupture may cause sudden severe pain, hypotension, or shock [^111JtYjZ] and can lead to **life-threatening hemorrhage** [^1154TPWy]. Infection can develop, presenting with **fever, chills**, and localized signs of infection [^111zsW54].

---

## Imaging findings

Ultrasound demonstrates the "yin-yang" sign on color Doppler, a characteristic finding indicating turbulent bidirectional flow within the pseudoaneurysm sac [^111ATFVa] [^1124x4mm]. CT/MRI angiography provides detailed anatomical information, confirming the **diagnosis** and guiding **treatment planning** [^114jTYQp].

### Acute pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery after repeated trauma in full-contact karate practice [^111JtYjZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the deep femoral artery are infrequently encountered in sports medical literature. We present the case of a male who, after practicing full-contact karate, experienced pain and edema in the right thigh. Ultrasound results and arteriography revealed a pseudoaneurysm in a branch of the deep femoral artery. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the deep femoral artery are typically secondary to endovascular interventions or mycotic infections in injecting drug users. Most pseudoaneurysms appear asymptomatically as a pulsatile mass. However, clinical signs of compression, such as pain or neurological or venous symptoms, may occur. If the aneurysm bursts, hypovolemic shock may ensue.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery on the hand secondary to stabbing [^112WeEFn]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery is extremely rare and usually occurs secondary to trauma, interventional procedures, and infections. Symptoms arise from mass effects by the pseudoaneurysm, digital ischemia, or nerve suppression. B-mode and color Doppler ultrasonography are the primary diagnostic tools. The pathognomonic ultrasound sign of a pseudoaneurysm is the turbulent flow, referred to as the "ying-yang" sign. Treatment options include bandages, ultrasound probe compression, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection, covered stents, and surgical ligation. Here, we present the case of a 28-year-old woman who developed a radial artery pseudoaneurysm following a stabbing injury in her hand and discuss the radiological and treatment options.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the dorsalis pedis artery: Case report and literature review [^112hN6QQ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms of the dorsalis pedis artery are rare vascular entities usually caused by traumatic injury or iatrogenic intervention, producing a focal soft pulsatile tissue mass in the dorsal foot. Gradual expansion of the fibrous capsule can produce secondary physical signs through the pressure exerted on surrounding structures. We report the case of a 57-year-old male with an idiopathic pseudoaneurysm of the dorsalis pedis artery. A focused history found a low-grade blunt trauma to the dorsal foot that had occurred 2 years previously.

The diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm was confirmed by ultrasound examinations and computed tomography angiograms. The pseudoaneurysm was treated with resection, and a short reversed great saphenous vein interposition graft was placed. He recovered well after surgery and remained free of symptoms 18 months postoperatively. The literature review of this uncommon vascular pathologic entity and the diagnosis and management are discussed.

### Hybrid treatment of an unusual traumatic aortic arch rupture with pseudoaneurysm: A case report [^114wzk2T]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Blunt traumatic aortic injury is a rare, highly fatal deceleration injury. While its symptoms are obvious, the signs may not be. The injury is usually located in the aortic isthmus (54–65%) and is rare in the ascending aorta at the proximal end of the innominate artery (10–20%), aortic arch, and descending aorta. If an aortic aneurysm is missed or early expansion is not obvious, it becomes difficult to detect, increasing the likelihood of accidental death. Patients without symptoms may be diagnosed by accident during examinations or due to chest and back pain, superior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, dysphagia, cough, hemoptysis, and other symptoms. These symptoms often indicate tumor body enlargement and disease progression. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, timely surgical repair should be performed.

### Current treatment methods for postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms [^112nCjc8]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms are a recognized complication of arterial catheterization. Until recently, the standard method of treatment has been surgical. The past decade has seen the introduction of several minimally invasive techniques that have largely replaced surgical treatment of pseudoaneurysms. The most commonly used methods are ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous injection of thrombin into the pseudoaneurysm. This review article describes all the methods available for the treatment of postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms, presents results from the largest published series, and discusses the relative merits of each technique.

### Delayed radiographic manifestation of renal pseudoaneurysms after blunt trauma [^114TpTHE]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms may cause recurrent hematuria after blunt renal trauma. We report on an 18-year-old patient with radiographic manifestation of a pseudoaneurysm 41 days after blunt renal trauma. Initial and follow-up imaging for recurrent hematuria, including angiography, showed no signs of pseudoaneurysm or active bleeding. This case illustrates that gross hematuria, as a typical symptom of pseudoaneurysm, may be present initially in the absence of radiographic signs. Repeat angiography should be taken into consideration if recurrent bleeding persists.

### Bilateral external iliac artery pseudoaneurysms causing urinary obstruction and acute renal failure [^114kJPfj]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute severe bilateral testicular pain radiating to the back. The pain initiated during the night, awakening the patient and prompting medical attention. He described the pain as sharp and continuous, radiating to his lower back bilaterally with no worsening or alleviating factors. The patient had no history of trauma, underlying medical conditions, regular medications, or previous surgical procedures. Abnormal urinary symptoms were also ruled out.

On admission, he was hypotensive (100/60 mmHg) with normal heart rate and normal neurological status. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration, pale mucous membranes, and cool extremities. Peripheral pulse was symmetric in the lower and upper limbs. No heart murmurs, signs of pulmonary congestion, or pleural effusion were observed. On abdominal palpation, a lower abdominal mass was noted with mild discomfort. No signs of acute peritonitis were present. Testicular examination was unremarkable.

Anemia (hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit of 24%) and acute renal failure (creatinine of 2.8 g/dL, normal blood urea with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL/min/1.73 m²) were observed. Testicular tumor markers were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a retroperitoneal mass causing bilateral ureterohydronephrosis. All imaging studies were normal.

Even in the setting of acute renal failure, contrast-enhanced multiaxial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was deemed necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis. It revealed bilateral external iliac artery pseudoaneurysms.

### Iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the peroneal artery [^117Twfwk]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

An elderly patient who presented with acute lower limb ischemia was managed through thromboembolectomy. This procedure led to the revascularization of the lower limb but resulted in an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the peroneal artery. Subsequent endovascular treatment was successful, and the patient made a good recovery.

### Treatment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysm with percutaneous thrombin injection [^114jB3ku]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm formation of the femoral artery is a well-known complication following catheter-based vascular procedures. Ultrasound-guided compression or surgical correction are commonly used for its repair. We describe a new method of treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm is visualized by contralateral angiography and thrombosed with a percutaneous thrombin injection while the distal vessel is isolated with a brief balloon inflation. Fluoroscopically guided percutaneous thrombin injection is a promising, minimally invasive technique for the treatment of iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm, especially in patients with compromised distal circulation.

### Endovascular treatment of bilateral carotid artery pseudoaneurysms after blunt carotid injury [^116BoSN3]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The detection of blunt carotid artery injuries has improved due to more aggressive screening protocols. Initial treatment depends on multiple factors; however, controversy exists regarding the treatment of pseudoaneurysmal degeneration, especially in this age of endovascular treatment options. Treatment options include anticoagulation, open surgical repair, and endovascular repair. We report a rare case of bilateral carotid artery pseudoaneurysm degeneration after bilateral carotid artery dissection caused by blunt trauma.

### Spinal pseudoaneurysms mimicking an osteogenic tumor: A case report [^112nEjYy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Aneurysms are localized swellings in the walls of an artery, usually due to a weak spot. They can be true, involving all three vessel walls, or pseudoaneurysms, where an opening in one of the vessel walls allows blood to leak through its wall, subsequently contained by scar tissue or the adventitia itself. Pseudoaneurysms can mimic bone tumors or soft-tissue sarcomas. They are more common in patients aged 20 to 60 years, similar to those with sarcomas and tumors. The exact mechanism and causation of pseudoaneurysm are not well understood. However, it is suggested that they result from gradual growth due to constant arterial pressure and the development of a reactive fibrous capsule. They typically occur after penetrating injury, blunt trauma, or an endovascular procedure.

Differentiating between pseudoaneurysms and osteogenic tumors clinically is challenging because they share similar signs and symptoms. They also present similarly on a CT scan, both appearing as a lesion or a mass. Furthermore, CT scans show bony erosions that further support the overlap between pseudoaneurysms and osteogenic tumors. This overlap might prompt further investigation and medical intervention, such as aspiration or tissue biopsy, potentially leading to morbidity and even mortality. Therefore, these medical decisions rely heavily on a multidisciplinary team approach.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the brachial artery in an infant due to vaccination: a case report [^1145Csxs]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm can be diagnosed via Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, DSA, and magnetic resonance angiography. Doppler ultrasonography can reveal the presence of blood flow or thrombi within the pseudoaneurysm, the size of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm, the integrity of adjacent vessels, and the presence of loculations. Moreover, it is a useful modality during patient follow-up after treatment because it is rapid, convenient, and inexpensive. Computed tomography angiography and DSA can depict the vasculature in different ways, but an intravascular contrast medium is required. Magnetic resonance angiography is also a preferred method for diagnostic evaluations of pediatric vascular diseases due to its high image resolution, lack of arterial invasion, and absence of radiation exposure. However, it is comparatively expensive and inconvenient.

Pseudoaneurysm treatments include conservative measures, sonographically guided compression, embolization, and open surgery. Sonographically guided compression was introduced in 1991 and involves the placement of an ultrasound probe directly over the neck of the pseudoaneurysm in conjunction with the application of prolonged compression, thereby producing vascular stasis within the lumen and promoting thrombosis. Although it is noninvasive and its success rate is approximately 90%, the procedure is often painful for patients and uncomfortable for operators, time-consuming, and occasionally unsuccessful. Sonographically guided thrombin injection was used extensively after its introduction in 1997 because of its high success rate.

### Surgery versus non-surgical treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms [^115QwR2V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, while others require definitive treatment. Surgery is considered the gold-standard treatment, although it is not without risk in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Less invasive treatment options, such as Duplex ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous thrombin injection, are available; however, evidence of their efficacy is limited.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms resulting from endovascular procedures, specifically assessing less invasive treatment options such as ultrasound-guided compression or percutaneous thrombin injection.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group's Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005 (last searched October 12, 2005). Additional searches were also made of bibliographies of papers found through these searches and by handsearching relevant journals.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing two treatments for femoral pseudoaneurysms following vascular interventional procedures were considered for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two studies were included in the analysis: ultrasound-guided application of a mechanical device (FemoStop) versus blind application; ultrasound-guided compression versus percutaneous thrombin injection. Data were extracted independently by both authors.

Maturation defects and early failure

K-DOQI guidelines establish the criteria for dialysis suitability (six rule) of VA: vein diameter ⩾ 6 mm, blood flow rate ⩾600 mL/min, and vessel depth 6 cm. In the FFBI trial, a flow rate variable from 300 to 800 mL/min measured on the outgoing vein's first linear tract is considered normal. The Haemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study Group defines haemodialysis's suitability as a condition where the vein's minimum diameter is ⩾4 mm and/or the blood flow rate is ⩾500 mL/min. When both these criteria are satisfied, the probability of good suitability is > 95% of cases. When none of these criteria are reached, the dialysis suitability is only 33%.

In primary failure, CD/PWD sampling reveals an obstructive thrombosis of the anastomosis and efferent vein without a perfusional signal, whereas the tributary artery keeps a high resistance triphasic spectral pattern.

Radial artery stenosis can become evident during the maturation period of a distal radio cephalic AVF when blood flow demand increases due to the drop in resistances. Thus, the stress tests (reactive hyperaemia, Allen test) must accurately evaluate the radial artery's flow rate variations before AVF creation.

An explosive acceleration (PSV > 2.5–3.5 m/s) in the peri-anastomotic segment during the maturation period reveals an inflow or outflow stenosis if the brachial artery flow rate does not increase. Collateral vein development in this phase and an inadequate outgoing vein dilatation indicates outflow stenosis.

### Pseudoaneurysms occurring as a result of fractures giving rise to the appearance of pseudotumors: a short series [^112aafNN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms are focal enlargements of the vascular lumen due to partial or complete disruption of the arterial wall. These are an uncommon complication of fractures. The presence of a pseudoaneurysm adjacent to a fracture fragment can cause a pressure effect. This pressure not only impairs fracture healing but sometimes can erode the adjacent bone, producing the appearance of a pseudotumor. We present two such cases and discuss the management of these patients.

### One aneurysm and two pseudoaneurysms, same patient [^112c3gd5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular pseudoaneurysms are rare pathological entities that mainly arise in the context of myocardial infarction or post-cardiac surgery. The clinical presentation is usually non-specific, and at times, patients are asymptomatic. Mortality is high, even with timely surgical intervention. The authors present a case of postoperative recurrence of a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm superimposed on an ischemic true aneurysm.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: A management-based classification system [^116BZh1A]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Rebleeding after embolisation can occur early or late, highlighting the potential need for definitive surgery. Early failure may result from technical problems, such as failure to cannulate or localize the bleeding, or complications during the procedure, including arterial perforation or dissection by the catheter. Despite initial successful embolisation, a significant proportion of patients experienced rebleeding at a later date. Given that the initiating events of the pseudoaneurysm — pancreatic enzymes, local inflammation, or anastomotic leaks — are not addressed by embolisation, these factors likely contribute to late rebleeding.

While some studies specifically reported 12- or 24-hour rebleeding rates, there was significant variation in reporting, making it challenging to differentiate between a rebleeding episode and primary failure. When rebleeding was documented, only a few studies provided details about the timing of the bleed and the original presentation or associated pathology. However, overall data indicate that the risk of rebleeding exists days and even months after an initially successful embolisation.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^116fPAuU]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms (PA) are contained disruptions of the vascular wall, leading to turbulent blood flow and hematoma formation. Unlike true aneurysms, PAs are contained by only one or two of the three normal arterial wall layers, typically the adventitia alone. Arterial damage leading to the formation of PAs may be caused by trauma, inflammation, infection, or iatrogenic sources. PAs secondary to trauma may be related to either blunt or penetrating arterial trauma. While many PAs may be asymptomatic, they can present with swelling, pain, or mass effect. Due to the weakened arterial walls, PAs have a high risk of growth and rupture, which can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage and mortality, necessitating urgent treatment.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: A management-based classification system [^1131PcGL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The overall reported success rates of embolization are high, but this often includes multiple embolizations as well as prolonged supportive treatment. As a single procedure, embolization alone has a substantial failure rate. The primary failure rate in the studies reviewed ranged from 0 to 50%, with a rebleeding rate of 0–38%. Overall, this translates into a total failure rate of between 6 and 55%, with half of the studies (median of all studies) having a failure rate of greater than 23%. Of the combined 262 patients embolized or stented in all reviewed studies, 51 required a secondary procedure (either re-embolization or surgery).

Although embolization was used as first-line treatment in most of the recent studies, surgery still remains an important treatment modality, especially in the setting of a hemodynamically compromised patient or when angiographic management fails. The low operation rates in some studies suggest that hemodynamically compromised patients may still be treated radiologically at first. For this to work optimally, the initial radiological intervention should be carried out in an angio-theatre suite, so if it fails, immediate surgical intervention is possible. Other indications for surgery included situations where access to the bleeding vessel was impossible radiologically and when there was failed visualization or failed embolization of the bleeding vessel for definitive management of the underlying cause or for other coexisting abdominal pathologies. The indications and outcomes of operative management in the studies reviewed are summarized in the findings.

### Ultrasound evaluation of access complications: Thrombosis, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and infections [^115w2mLr]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Ultrasound criteria of critical stenosis

High-resolution sonography defines the severity of the stenosis based on different criteria.

- **Morphological or geometric stenosis**: Artery stenosis is considered 'critical' when narrowing causes a significant reduction of downstream flow rate. This occurs when a 60%–75% reduction of the artery diameter occurs. Vein stenosis is critical if the diameter in the narrowing point is 200/250 cm/s in the tributary artery or > 300–400 cm/s in the outgoing vein or graft.

- **PSV-ratio between stenosis and normal vein**: The ratio between the stenosis peak velocity and upstream peak velocity is an indirect parameter of trans-stenotic gradient pressure.

### Femoral pseudoaneurysm in drug addicts — excision without revascularization is a viable option [^1178KkAZ]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to present a series of patients presenting with femoral pseudoaneurysm. Seventeen patients who presented with a femoral pseudoaneurysm during a one-year period were included. Parenteral drug abuse was identified as the most common etiological factor. The femoral artery was most commonly involved at its bifurcation.

Sixteen patients (94%) underwent excision of the pseudoaneurysm with ligation of the vessel and debridement without any revascularization, while one patient (6%) underwent reverse saphenous grafting after excision and ligation of vessels. Four amputations (23%) were performed, including three (17%) major limb amputations — one above-knee and two below-knee amputations. Additionally, four patients (23%) developed intermittent claudication.

In conclusion, excision of the pseudoaneurysm with ligation of vessels and wide debridement without immediate revascularization in infected pseudoaneurysms is a safe and effective treatment.

### Iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms — a review of current methods of diagnosis and treatment [^117YKNeQ]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The common femoral artery is frequently used as arterial access for various radiological and cardiological procedures. Pseudoaneurysm formation, the primary arterial complication of femoral artery catheterization, is diagnosed using color Doppler ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection has replaced ultrasound-guided compression as the first-line treatment. The practical aspects of thrombin injection, including the technique and types of thrombin available, are discussed, along with other treatment options. Awareness of pseudoaneurysm formation and the available treatments enables prompt diagnosis and successful management.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism: A case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery [^113cprxn]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Cavernous pseudoaneurysm is a rare cause of high-flow priapism. Diagnosis can be established through patient history, specialist examination, color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and DSA. Patients with cavernous pseudoaneurysm often present with a history of perineal trauma and incomplete persistent penile erection upon specialist examination.

- **Color Doppler ultrasound**: This can accurately assess the size of the cavernous pseudoaneurysm, rupture of the injured artery, and distal blood flow velocity. This information is valuable in selecting treatment options and predicting the prognosis for cavernous pseudoaneurysm.

- **MRI**: It can effectively depict the complex pathological changes and hemoglobin alterations that occur following cavernous hemorrhage. With its high spatial resolution, MRI plays a crucial role in assessing the severity of cavernous pseudoaneurysm.

- **DSA**: It is not only the gold standard for diagnosing cavernous pseudoaneurysm but also serves as a technique for guiding super-selective arterial embolization.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: A management-based classification system [^116XJXa7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Managing peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms is complex and challenging. Advances in imaging technology and interventional radiology have had an enormous impact on both the diagnosis and the treatment of this condition. Pseudoaneurysms can arise in a number of different clinical settings but are mostly associated with pancreatitis and pancreatobiliary surgery.

The high mortality associated with this condition is initially due to uncontrolled torrential bleeding. If the patient survives this initial phase, there is a risk of rebleeding, which can occur from days to years after the initial presentation. The additional late mortality may be substantial if patients are not managed appropriately during their initial presentation. Treatment strategies should be based on the mechanisms that lead to the formation of pseudoaneurysms and the ongoing pathophysiological processes that result in rebleeding.

Currently, the best method of assessing a relatively stable patient is a computerized tomography (CT) angiogram with or without a formal angiogram. This usually provides an accurate diagnosis but also allows, if required, radiological intervention by embolization of the feeding vessel or the pseudoaneurysm itself. If visceral ischemia distal to the pseudoaneurysm is a concern, a stent may be placed. Patients with hemodynamic instability may need immediate surgical intervention, although this can be fraught with danger even in experienced hands.

There are no data on definitive long-term management strategies for this condition. This is partly due to its low rate of occurrence but a lack of comprehensive studies remains a significant barrier.

### Very late rupture of a post-traumatic abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm [^116qRpu5]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysms remain a rare yet severe complication of aortic injuries and may present many years later. Clinical presentations vary, from the traditional aneurysmal symptoms of abdominal and/or back pain with or without a pulsatile mass to a fatal rupture. We present the case of a 42-year-old man with a history of blunt abdominal trauma 14 years ago. He presented with symptoms of non-specific lower abdominal pain and a recent history of straining due to constipation. Clinical examination revealed umbilical bruising, consistent with Cullen's sign, and extensive postsacral bruising. This case highlights some of the atypical manifestations of aneurysmal rupture and the importance of early recognition and management.

### Single-center experience on endovascular repair of noninfected extracranial internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms [^1141aPsL]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In the period ranging from 2006 to 2010, five endovascular interventions for carotid pseudoaneurysm (four post-carotid endarterectomy [post-CEA] and one posttraumatic), without signs of infection, were carried out. All patients were neurologically asymptomatic. A covered stent was used in four cases. The fifth patient, undergoing a third endovascular procedure following a re-do open surgical repair of a post-CEA pseudoaneurysm, was treated with a bare stent. The technical success rate was 100%. A type 1 endoleak at the end of the procedure was observed in one patient, but it disappeared before discharge. No perioperative neurologic events occurred. At the most recent mean follow-up of 24 months, all patients are alive, without neurologic symptoms, and all have maintained patency of the internal carotid artery and are pseudoaneurysm-free.

### Emergency endovascular management of peripheral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms - a review [^114Ucgft]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Endovascular management of peripheral artery aneurysms requires careful consideration of factors affecting the outcome, especially in terms of stent placement. The first report of popliteal aneurysm stenting was by Marin et al, demonstrating the use of a Palmaz stent covered with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Subsequent reports confirmed its effectiveness in treating popliteal aneurysms, with results comparable to open techniques. In a recent meta-analysis, it was noted that the endovascular technique offers similar medium-term benefits as open repair. Only one randomized controlled trial has reported comparable long-term results for endovascular versus open repair.

The position of the endograft behind the knee complicates the situation due to potential issues with knee joint flexion, potentially leading to stent kinking, blockage, or fracture. However, careful endograft design and placement can mitigate this problem to an extent. Similar concerns arise for patients with femoral aneurysms undergoing endovascular stenting due to hip joint movement.

Our prior reports have demonstrated the successful use of this technique in managing popliteal artery aneurysm, even in "hostile leg" situations. Further studies are warranted before adopting this approach as a treatment of first choice.

- **Popliteal artery aneurysm**: Visualized in Figure 1.
- **Complete exclusion of popliteal aneurysm**: Achieved following endovascular stenting as shown in Figure 2.

Further research is essential to solidify this approach as a viable first-line treatment.

### Successful management of a delayed-presented and complicated right ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a case report and literature review [^113RTYeH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

In these cases, therapeutic options include surgical interventions, reconstructive patch implantations, and medical treatments. These should be selected based on the severity of the symptoms and the pseudoaneurysm's anatomic features.

The clinical presentation of pseudoaneurysms can vary, ranging from asymptomatic cases to symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and arrhythmia. This variability often creates diagnostic challenges. It is crucial to differentiate these ventricular outpouchings to evaluate and treat them effectively. Accurate diagnosis, supported by advanced imaging techniques, plays a significant role in determining the optimal approach, whether surgical or conservative. RV pseudoaneurysms are extremely rare compared to left ventricular pseudoaneurysms. Throughout the cardiac cycle, pseudoaneurysms expand outward in response to increased ventricular pressure. Due to their lack of myocardial tissue, they are very prone to potentially catastrophic rupture, underscoring the critical need for prompt identification and surgical intervention. Therefore, rapid and precise diagnosis is essential for effectively managing these intricate cardiac conditions. However, as seen in this study, the presentation with RV failure symptoms can suggest pseudoaneurysms. This is concluded by Yeo et al. who confirmed that 48% of these lesions are discovered incidentally without any obvious clinical presentation.

Considering the management of RV pseudoaneurysm, there is no consensus, and guidelines have not mentioned the definite therapeutic approach. However, considering the lack of definitive treatment options, continuous evaluation and tailored management strategies remain essential for patient care.

### Ultrasound evaluation of access complications: Thrombosis, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and infections [^114SwkG1]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Early and late thrombosis occurs in relation to fistula implantation. Early thrombosis is a postoperative complication and occurs within the first 24 hours or the first week after fistula implantation. Common causes include technical mistakes, hypotension, hypercoagulability, kinking and torsion of the vein, compression due to a postoperative hematoma, prolonged vascular spasm, and involuntary compression of the anastomosis during the night. Thrombosis generally affects the anastomosis chamber and the draining vein. The artery is rarely involved unless atherosclerotic, iatrogenic, or inflammatory parietal damage promotes an inflow defect (Figure 5).

- **AVF thrombosis**:
	- (a) Brachio-cephalic graft showing occlusive clot (*) in the cephalic vein.
	- (b) Distal radio-cephalic fistula with acute non-occlusive thrombosis of anastomosis and outgoing vein.
	- (c) Acute obstructive thrombosis (< 24 hours) (*) of the cephalic vein in mature AVF. Wall calcifications (arrows) are also evident.

The vein or prosthesis may appear obstructed by hypo-hyperechoic material. The thrombus can be occlusive if the clot completely obstructs the blood flow or non-occlusive if blood flow is still evident around the clot on color Doppler. Acute and occlusive thrombosis is characterized by acute pain and the disappearance of thrill. It is an emergency requiring immediate percutaneous declotting to preserve vascular access.

Chronic thrombosis involves an older clot over 1–2 months, which becomes hardened and scars the vein. This process causes the vein to narrow significantly, hindering the free flow of blood through the vessel. The spectral curve is absent in chronic thrombosis.

### Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the aortic arch with purulent pericardial effusion [^114Buwdi]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old woman presented with dyspnea on exertion and a diminished left radial pulse compared to the right. She exhibited signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade. A computed tomographic (CT) angiogram of the chest revealed an aortic arch pseudoaneurysm along the lesser curvature and a large pericardial effusion with the density of blood. Upon pericardiotomy, a nonhemorrhagic thick purulent effusion caused by Streptococcus milleri was discovered in the pericardial space. The aortic arch was replaced with a rifampin-soaked Dacron tube graft while the patient was under hypothermic circulatory arrest.

### Ultrasound evaluation of access complications: Thrombosis, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and infections [^116FK9Th]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

The outgoing vein's wall injuries due to repeated cannulation can cause aneurysm, haematoma, and pseudoaneurysm formation. An aneurysm is a fusiform or saccular dilation of the vessel involving all three layers of its wall. Haematomas and pseudoaneurysms, on the other hand, are post-traumatic blood collections.

A haematoma is located outside the vessel and does not have any continuity with the lumen. In contrast, a pseudoaneurysm or false aneurysm is a perivascular collection. Unlike a haematoma, it maintains continuity with the vessel lumen through a breach or collar, and unlike an aneurysm, it lacks its own wall. Instead, it is delimited by reactive fibrous tissue covered by endothelium. The risk of rupture is higher for false aneurysms compared to true aneurysms of comparable size due to inadequate support of the saccular wall. As a result, false aneurysms generally require treatment. Aneurysm, haematoma, and pseudoaneurysm can involve the draining vein, prosthesis, and, rarely, the tributary artery. Factors that contribute to their formation include anticoagulant drugs, repeated buttonhole punctures (particularly in prostheses), blind venepuncture, and venous hypertension due to venous stenosis.

Seroma is an unusual complication of prosthetic arteriovenous grafts. It occurs in 2%–4% of cases within the first month after the graft's placement due to transudation of sterile and clear serum from connective tissue surrounding the prosthesis. It remains confined as a collection by a non-secretory fibrous pseudo-membrane and is typically located close to the arterial anastomosis.

### Pulmonary artery and intercostal artery pseudoaneurysms after penetrating injury [^111mNtwL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Traumatic pulmonary artery and intercostal artery pseudoaneurysms are rare pathologies that can occur following a penetrating injury. Most times, only one pseudoaneurysm needs to be addressed. Options for management include simple observation, endovascular intervention with coiling, embolization, and stenting, as well as surgical intervention ranging from ligation to pneumonectomy. We present the case of a 20-year-old man who developed multiple pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms and an intercostal artery pseudoaneurysm after sustaining a single gunshot wound to the chest. After multiple episodes of bleeding from several pseudoaneurysms, the patient ultimately required a pneumonectomy.

### Endovascular embolization of post-tonsillectomy pseudoaneurysm in adults [^112ordC7]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

The decision to use glue as an embolizing material for the post-tonsillectomy pseudoaneurysm requires careful consideration of the following points:

- **Large parent arteries and blood flow**: For large parent arteries of the pseudoaneurysm with high blood flow velocity, coils should first be deployed distally, followed by NBCA glue injection proximally. This reduces blood flow, promoting glue polymerization and solidification, while protecting distal branches from infiltration.

- **Stopping glue injection**: Once the glue fills the pseudoaneurysm and refluxes proximally, stop the injection. If the glue reaches the microcatheter tip, wait about one minute before withdrawing to allow solidification and secure bonding to the vessel wall. This prevents displacement of the glue to other branches of the external carotid artery or the internal carotid artery during microcatheter removal.

- **Dilution of glue**: The glue should not be overly diluted, as this can extend its coagulation time, increasing the risk of it being carried by blood flow into the peripheral capillary beds and causing tissue necrosis.

Additionally, great care should be taken with arteries that may have anastomoses with intracranial arterial branches, such as the ascending pharyngeal artery, the middle meningeal artery originating from the internal maxillary artery, and the angular artery.

This study has several limitations. The first limitation is the small patient sample. Because conservative measures and surgical hemostasis are the superior option in the treatment of PTH, a small number of patients can be included in our study. Another limitation was no control group was included.

### Renal pseudoaneurysm: an overview [^117DLDYB]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Renal pseudoaneurysm is a rare vascular lesion that arises when an arterial injury within the kidney leads to contained hemorrhage. The associated hematoma forms outside the arterial wall and is typically surrounded by a layer of fibrous inflammatory tissue and blood clot. These lesions are unstable and their rupture can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. Renal pseudoaneurysm has been reported to occur in various clinical scenarios, including after renal trauma, surgery, and percutaneous procedures, as well as inflammatory and neoplastic processes within the kidney.

Endovascular selective angioembolization is the mainstay of treatment, although surgery might be indicated when hemostasis and repair of the arterial wall defect are required. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided embolization is an additional option for patients with unfavorable vascular anatomy or who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to the use of intravenous contrast agents. Some evidence suggests that these lesions can regress without intervention, although observation alone is not recommended as a management strategy in the vast majority of patients, owing to the high risk of rupture.

Evaluation and management of patients with renal pseudoaneurysm must take into account each individual's circumstances, due to the difficulty of accurately predicting the probability of spontaneous resolution or rupture.

### Endovascular repair of spontaneous popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm [^111ZgNwp]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Popliteal artery pseudoaneurysms are rare and typically associated with local trauma, such as orthopedic surgery or expansile bone lesions in the popliteal fossa. This study describes a case involving a 24-year-old man with a popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm. A comprehensive evaluation showed no history of trauma, invasive procedures, vasculitis, or any other likely cause of the pseudoaneurysm. However, given that the patient practices running, it is possible that minor trauma, unnoticed by the patient, was a contributing factor.

### Ultrasound evaluation of access complications: Thrombosis, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and infections [^115wPoJR]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Based on the outcomes, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) complications can be classified as early and late events. Primary patency is the most favorable clinical outcome in which the AVF provides an adequate flow for hemodialysis without any intervention. Assisted primary patency is the time interval between vascular access (VA) creation and the first occlusion (thrombosis-free VA survival) or patency measurement, including operative or endovascular interventions to maintain the VA.

Secondary patency is the access survival until abandonment, which is the time interval from access placement to abandonment, including all interventions to re-establish the hemodialysis suitability. Immediate failure of AVF occurs when the blood flow rate in the fistula circuit is inadequate due to poor vessel conditions or surgical errors.

Primary failure is the permanent AVF failure before it is suitable for hemodialysis. It occurs within three months of AVF implantation due to insufficient inflow or inappropriate remodeling of the incoming artery or outgoing vein. Secondary failure is the permanent failure and subsequent abandonment of an AVF that has reached dialysis suitability criteria.

### Treatment of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms using ultrasound-guided thrombin injection [^114noD3o]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, a complication of femoral arterial puncture, are increasing in frequency with the proliferation of endovascular interventions. Historically, pseudoaneurysms have been treated by open surgical repair and, more recently, by ultrasound-guided compression. However, ultrasound-guided compression is painful and has a relatively low success rate of 51% to 73%. Since 1991, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection has become a treatment option. During the injection of thrombin into a pseudoaneurysm, immediate thrombosis can be demonstrated within seconds. The entire procedure can be accomplished within 5 minutes, is simple to learn, and can be performed safely on an outpatient basis.

### Iliac pseudoaneurysm, only a manifestation with more causes: A case report [^113PTrDR]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

A pseudoaneurysm results from a disruption in the continuity of the arterial wall. It forms a sac that communicates with the vessel lumen, surrounded by compressed, surrounding tissues, rather than by the artery wall from which the lesion arises. Various causes can predispose an individual to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm, including trauma, surgical procedures, and anticoagulation. In our patient, another significant risk factor for the development of a pseudoaneurysm is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which can lead to vascular complications.

The mechanisms responsible for the genesis of pseudoaneurysms in our patient are unknown. However, clinicians should be aware, when evaluating such patients, that ADPKD may present a range of systemic cardiovascular manifestations.

Pseudoaneurysms are a relatively rare presentation in the pediatric emergency department that carry considerable implications. Ultrasonography is commonly employed to identify pseudoaneurysms and distinguish them from true aneurysms. Reports of detecting pseudoaneurysms by point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) are abundant in adults, yet scant in children. We present a multi-institutional 8-case series of POCUS used in pediatric patients to identify pseudoaneurysms in six different anatomic locations.

### Interventional radiology in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of pseudoaneurysms [^111yhRJD]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Arterial wall disruption, as a consequence of inflammation/infection, trauma (penetrating or blunt), or iatrogenic causes, may result in pseudoaneurysm formation. Currently, iatrogenic causes are increasing as a result of the growth of endovascular intervention. The frequency of other causes also seems to be increasing, but this may simply be the result of increased diagnosis by better imaging techniques, such as multidetector contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Clinically, pseudoaneurysms may be silent, may present with local or systemic signs, or can rupture with catastrophic consequences. Open surgical repair, previously the mainstay of treatment, has largely been replaced by image-guided occlusion methods.

Based on an experience of over 100 pseudoaneurysms, treatments at various anatomical sites, imaging modalities used for accurate diagnosis, changing therapeutic options for pseudoaneurysm management, approved embolization agents, and clinical follow-up requirements to ensure adequate treatment will be discussed. Image-guided direct percutaneous and endovascular embolization of pseudoaneurysms are established treatment options with favorable success rates and minimal morbidity. The pendulum has now swung from invasive surgical repair of pseudoaneurysms to that of image-guided interventional radiology.

### Follow-up of a self-resolving renal pseudoaneurysm using contrast-enhanced power Doppler ultrasonography [^116HpuAX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

It has been standard practice to embolize a pseudoaneurysm caused by penetrating trauma whenever it is found, even in the absence of overt symptoms. This is a case report of a renal pseudoaneurysm (RPA) caused by a stab wound, which was safely monitored and followed using color Doppler ultrasonography.

On day 1, angiography showed a pseudoaneurysm of the renal artery in the parenchyma, and ultrasonography showed blood flow into the pseudoaneurysm. Although abnormal blood flow into the kidney was seen, there appeared to be no leakage of blood from the pseudoaneurysm. The abnormal flow disappeared on day 12, and the area of the pseudoaneurysm became unclear from day 13.

This report suggests the possibility that an RPA caused by a stab wound could be an indication for conservative therapy under the following conditions: the RPA is detected initially, close monitoring using a color Doppler ultrasound is possible, there is no leakage of blood from the right subclavian artery, and there is a 2-week period of observation.

### Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm after treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy: A case report [^111ATFVa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). High credibility.

Angiography remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP). Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and MRI can also be used to assist in the diagnosis. The increased cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) incidence rate and improvements in doctors' understanding have improved the diagnosis of CSP. However, UAP is extremely rare after the treatment of CSP. Ultrasound is one of the simplest and most important methods to diagnose UAP.

In general, on grayscale ultrasonography, a pseudoaneurysm has a characteristic sonographic appearance consisting of a pulsating anechoic or hypoechoic well-defined cystic structure, with or without an associated pelvic hematoma or free fluid. On color Doppler, the pseudoaneurysm systolic and diastolic flow creates a characteristic "to-and-fro" pattern, classically described as the "Yin-Yang" sign; it is caused by changes in pressure in the pseudoaneurysm and the blood vessel during the cardiac cycle. However, in practice, it is difficult to show the neck because the uterine artery is very small. In the grayscale image, UAP may have sonographic manifestations similar to those of CSP, cystic changes in uterine fibroids, Nessler's cyst of the cervix, and cysts of the uterine muscle wall, showing a complete hypoechoic area or liquid dark area. Therefore, color Doppler should be used to identify cystic structures in clinical practice.

Meanwhile, a pseudoaneurysm should be distinguished from a uterine arteriovenous fistula (UAVF). In the case of a UAVF, color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) can show that blood in the artery enters the vein directly and continuously, with a high-velocity and low-resistance artery spectrum.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^114jkVtE]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

This study was limited by retrospectively collected data with a small number of available patients. Follow-up data was therefore limited to available recorded information. Trauma patients are typically transported to the nearest hospital after an event and, in many cases, choose to follow up with other physicians or health care institutions, limiting the availability of information.

For the purpose of ensuring a traumatic etiology, pseudoaneurysms (PAs) treated more than three months post-trauma were excluded. However, this approach may have conservatively eliminated PAs with further delayed presentations. Additionally, seven patients in this study underwent surgical intervention near the subsequently treated PA site, prior to interventional radiology (IR) PA embolization. Three of these cases were performed over a day apart, potentially confounding the etiology of true traumatic PAs with potentially iatrogenic PAs.

Finally, as mentioned previously, the trauma patient cohort typically has significant injuries relating to the overall trauma, which may confound the clinical outcomes relating to PA treatment in isolation. Further randomized controlled data on the endovascular management of traumatic PAs will be crucial in better understanding the clinical course of traumatic PAs.

### Endovascular embolization of post-tonsillectomy pseudoaneurysm in adults [^111kAsa9]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

Post-tonsillectomy pseudoaneurysm in adults can result in uncontrollable hemorrhage, potentially threatening life. Our study indicates that when surgical hemostasis or conservative treatments prove refractory, endovascular embolization presents an effective, feasible, and safe alternative option. NBCA glue may be considered the preferred embolic material; however, careful attention must be given to the critical techniques involved in its application.

- **Surgical hemostasis**: This is the superior option in the treatment of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH) when conservative measures prove ineffective. Research indicates that surgical hemostasis may sometimes be ineffective.

- **Endovascular embolization**: This is a promising treatment option that offers several advantages. First, it provides both diagnostic imaging and therapeutic embolization. Second, superselective embolization enables precise occlusion of the bleeding vessel while preserving surrounding arteries. Third, it is minimally invasive, resulting in reduced trauma and faster recovery. Fourth, empirical embolization can be performed even with negative angiography results.

However, endovascular embolization for PTH has not yet received significant attention from otolaryngologists worldwide. In our study, Patient 1 underwent interventional embolization after experiencing five episodes of bleeding over seven days following surgical hemostasis. Patient 2 experienced cardiac arrest due to significant hemorrhage and underwent endovascular embolization only after four episodes of bleeding. Patient 3 experienced rebleeding five times within a short period.

### Radial artery pseudoaneurysm [^112QJKKi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: To review the causes, clinical course, and management of patients with catheter-associated radial artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA).

- **Methods**: We reviewed all patients diagnosed with radial artery PSA resulting from arterial line placement or radial artery access for cardiac procedures from 2010 to 2015.

- **Results**: We identified 11 cases: 5 caused by arterial lines and 6 by cardiac procedures. The diagnosis was confirmed by duplex ultrasound in all cases; PSA size ranged from less than 1 cm to 5 cm in diameter. Spontaneous thrombosis, over a mean of 27 days, occurred in 4 patients; each PSA was smaller than 3 cm. Surgery was performed in 7 patients with excision of the stalk and repair of the artery as the most common procedure. Only one case was performed emergently for acute carpal tunnel syndrome. Complications occurring due to either the PSA or the treatment were recorded in 5 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Spontaneous thrombosis may occur in smaller lesions over a few weeks. When required, surgery to evacuate the hematoma and repair the artery was effective in all cases.

- **Type of study/level of evidence**: Therapeutic IV.

### Fortuitous detection of pseudoaneurysm by three-phase bone scan [^113K9Uh3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We report the diagnosis of an unsuspected pseudoaneurysm in the lower extremity when a three-phase bone scan was used to evaluate a presumed malignancy. We confirmed the diagnosis with duplex ultrasonography and angiography. Although the primary diagnostic modality for the detection of pseudoaneurysm remains duplex sonography, the nuclear medicine practitioner should be vigilant for the characteristic presentation of a pseudoaneurysm on a three-phase bone scan. This includes an area of increased radiotracer activity on blood-flow and blood-pool images that becomes a photopenic area on delayed images. This also underscores the need to consider benign vascular lesions in the differential diagnosis of abnormal three-phase bone scans for presumed tumors.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: A management-based classification system [^117Xnr7U]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms can arise in a number of different clinical settings, but they are mostly associated with pancreatitis and pancreatobiliary surgery. The aim of this study is to review the literature and propose a management classification system based on the pathophysiological processes and the exact anatomical site of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature from 1995 to 2012 was performed. Articles describing peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms in the context of pancreatitis or major hepatic or pancreatic surgery with more than ten patients were included. Seventeen eligible studies were identified and reviewed.

- **Results**: The demographic characteristics of the patients in all studies were similar, with a predominance of males and a mean age of 55 years. The overall mortality rate varied greatly among the studies, ranging from 0 to 60%. Embolization was the first line of management in the majority of the studies, with surgery reserved for failed embolization or for hemodynamically unstable cases. Embolization of the hepatic artery or its branches was associated with high rates of morbidity (56%) and hepatic failure (19%). More recent studies show that stents are increasingly used for vessels that cannot be embolized safely. Late bleeding, a major cause of mortality and morbidity, is generally underreported. The proposed classification system is based on three factors: (1) the type of artery from which the pseudoaneurysm arises, (2) whether communication with the gastrointestinal tract is present.

### Asymptomatic large extracapsular renal pseudoaneurysm following kidney transplant biopsy [^116VSsbZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Vascular complications after kidney biopsy include hematomas, arteriovenous fistulas, and pseudoaneurysms. Ultrasonography is a useful tool for the diagnosis of these complications, and color Doppler scan is effective at distinguishing among them. We describe a transplant patient who underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy in whom echography performed after biopsy showed a pulsatile hypoechoic perinephric mass of 4.4 cm. This collection illuminated with color Doppler and connected to the transplant. Color Doppler scanning of the mass showed high-velocity turbulent flow within the cavity and a jet of blood from an intrarenal segmental artery. A typical pattern biphasic flow ("to-and-fro" waveform) at the pseudoaneurysm neck on color Doppler confirmed the diagnosis of postbiopsy pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms usually are asymptomatic, but when they cause clinical signs or risk rupture, interventional treatment is required. Supraselective coil embolization of the artery feeding the pseudoaneurysm was performed successfully in our patient. Pseudoaneurysm can mimic renal cysts on gray-scale ultrasound. We suggest that Doppler sonography be performed in cystic areas detected after biopsy to exclude pseudoaneurysm.

### Open and endovascular treatment for pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery [^111hEkSY]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery are rare, with a natural history characterized by a tendency to rupture, leading to a high mortality rate. Compared with classic surgical techniques (open), the possibility of endovascular treatment has increased in recent years.

- **Results**: We report the cases of two patients with a pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery. Each case was successfully treated in a different way: open and endovascular surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Despite the advantages, such as less risk for the patient, and good results obtained with endovascular surgery, this cannot completely replace open surgery. The choice of the most appropriate therapeutic option for pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery depends on the state of the patient and the characteristics of the lesion. Open and endovascular surgical techniques are complementary, not mutually exclusive, techniques.

### Imaging of vascular pseudoaneurysms in the thorax and abdomen [^114jTYQp]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

This review article illustrates a spectrum of arterial pseudoaneurysms that may occur in various locations throughout the thoracoabdominal region. It discusses the common etiologies and typical clinical presentations of arterial pseudoaneurysms, as well as the imaging modalities employed in their diagnosis and potential treatment options.

- **Objective**: The goal of this review article is to familiarize radiologists with the diagnosis of thoracoabdominal arterial pseudoaneurysms, the prompt identification and treatment of which are crucial in this patient population.

- **Conclusion**: A thorough understanding of the etiologies, imaging characteristics, and clinical implications of pseudoaneurysms can help optimize the identification and management of this spectrum of disease.

### Endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms [^112imS8E]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). High credibility.

We present a comprehensive case study on the endovascular management of traumatic pseudoaneurysms (PAs), detailing various PA locations within the viscera and extremities. Our technical and clinical success rates were 85.7% and 71.4%, respectively, aligning with previously reported mixed etiology/type and organ-specific series in the literature. Importantly, our cohort experienced no severe, life-threatening, or disabling complications from treatment, and there were no significant morbidities or mortalities secondary to endovascular treatment or PA re-bleeding.

- **Endovascular vs. surgical management**: Endovascular treatment of PAs is increasingly favored over surgical management. Prior studies have demonstrated benefits of endovascular procedures such as shorter procedural times, reduced blood loss, decreased transfusion requirements, and shorter hospital stays for both true aneurysms and PAs. These studies have also reported no significant differences between surgery and endovascular treatment concerning technical or clinical success, major complication rates, or overall survival.

- **Advantages of endovascular management**: Additional research highlights the advantages of endovascular management, including a lower risk profile compared to traditional surgical approaches and the ability to precisely localize PAs and assess collateral vasculature. Recent randomized controlled data further support the efficacy of prophylactic splenic artery embolization after high-risk splenic trauma, demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of splenic PAs.

### Pseudoaneurysm inside of a true aneurysm [^116CKyn3]. Journal of cardiothoracic surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In cases where a pseudoaneurysm forms inside a true aneurysm, the risk of rupture increases significantly. This condition often follows a myocardial infarction (MI) and is particularly concerning when it affects the left ventricular (LV) region. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery is frequently involved. Diagnosis relies heavily on imaging techniques, with an electrocardiogram (ECG) playing a vital role in identifying abnormalities associated with the aneurysmal changes.

Timely identification and management are crucial to prevent complications. Treatment strategies may vary, depending on the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's overall health status. Advances in surgical interventions have improved outcomes significantly, though ongoing monitoring post-surgery is essential to ensure patient safety.

### Flow reduction-aided thrombin injection for complex femoral pseudoaneurysms: Case series and review of the literature [^1115JAm7]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral pseudoaneurysms are a known complication of vascular access procedures. Complex lesions, those with short, wide necks or other complex arrangements, would conventionally require open repair, but we believe that even these lesions could be managed with an endovascular approach.

- **Methods**: Four patients with complex pseudoaneurysms were offered an open repair or thrombin injection with the use of flow-reducing balloons.

- **Results**: In our series of four patients with complex pseudoaneurysms, all were safely treated with percutaneous thrombin injection in conjunction with endovascular flow reduction. All patients recovered from their procedures without incident and are free from recurrence at follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Flow reduction-aided thrombin injection may have particular utility in complex femoral pseudoaneurysms, especially in a patient population that may not tolerate open repair. High-risk lesions may merit special consideration for this technique, and further study is warranted.

### Role of Doppler ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemodialysis arteriovenous access maturation and influencing factors [^117BnKRW]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease patients are simultaneously prothrombotic and prone to bleeding due to impaired coagulation. To avoid or minimize bleeding and hematoma formation, patients who have already started hemodialysis (HD) should not undergo surgery within the first 24 hours after hemodialysis. This delay is recommended to allow platelet function recovery and the elimination of heparin used to prevent blood clotting in the HD circuit. The use of antiplatelet drugs in the preoperative and postoperative period, as well as anticoagulation during surgery, remains controversial.

Serious incisional bleeding, large hematoma, and pseudoaneurysm are rare and could be caused by a technical error during surgery. A disruption of anastomosis may occur in the event of an excessive blood pressure increase. Therefore, close intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of blood pressure is recommended.

There are many reasons for hematoma formation after surgery: overuse of antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulants, inadequate hemostasis at the end of the operation, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, hemorrhagic diathesis, and misdiagnosed outflow stenosis. Hematoma in the early postoperative period should be distinguished from a pseudoaneurysm, which is a non-clotted hematoma communicating with the vessel caused by leakage at an anastomotic site. A pseudoaneurysm typically appears as an echolucent sac that is pulsatile in B-mode, with a swirling flow pattern using color Doppler (CD) study, and a characteristic "to-and-from" flow pattern on spectral waveform.

### A mycotic common iliac artery pseudoaneurysm of indeterminate etiology [^111zsW54]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

We present the unusual case of a mycotic right common iliac artery pseudoaneurysm caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) of indeterminate etiology in a healthy 57-year-old man with no risk factors for infection, trauma, or malignancy. The patient initially presented with worsening subacute right lower quadrant pain and was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the right common iliac artery. Given concern for rupture on a computed tomography angiogram (CTA), he underwent exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm with a covered stent. At the time of presentation, he had no signs or symptoms of infection. However, the patient developed fever, chills, and worsening right lower quadrant pain 13 days after the index operation and was found to have leukocytosis, blood cultures positive for MSSA, and progressive soft-tissue changes involving the right common iliac artery on CTA consistent with infection. He was definitively treated with stent explantation, aggressive debridement and replacement with an in situ cryopreserved bypass, and short-term suppressive antibiotic therapy.

### Pseudoaneurysm inside of a true aneurysm [^113p9PuC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms and true aneurysms are two possible complications of myocardial infarction. However, while pseudoaneurysms require urgent surgical resection, true aneurysms can often be managed medically, making accurate diagnosis imperative.

The authors describe a case of a delayed rupture of a true aneurysm that was contained and gave rise to a pseudoaneurysm inside of a true aneurysm. The echocardiography allowed for differential diagnosis, enabling a timely surgical intervention that resulted in the patient's full recovery.

### Imaging appearances and endovascular management of uncommon pseudoaneurysms [^115FgPwC]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms are uncommon, and their etiology is varied. They occur in numerous anatomical locations and present with a multitude of clinical presentations, sometimes life-threatening. This review describes the causes, sites, and presentations of uncommon pseudoaneurysms, as well as illustrating their diagnostic appearances and endovascular management.

### Successful management of a delayed-presented and complicated right ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a case report and literature review [^115zDLds]. Journal of cardiothoracic surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiac ventricular outpouchings can present as congenital or acquired abnormalities, primarily appearing as diverticula, aneurysms, herniations, or pseudoaneurysms. Each type has distinct effects on the cardiac wall and contractility, influencing its imaging characteristics and clinical significance. This study discusses the history, diagnosis, and therapeutic progression of the right ventricle (RV) associated with signs and symptoms of RV failure in a young man. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report documenting this combination. Notably, the clinical condition showed a dramatic response to surgical treatment, with symptom resolution occurring in nearly three to six months.

- **Cardiac diverticula and aneurysms**: Involve all three layers of the cardiac wall but differ in their contraction patterns. Diverticula contract in sync with the ventricular wall, whereas aneurysms do not. Myocardial tissue in both diverticula and aneurysms reduces the risk of free-wall rupture. Diverticula are typically congenital, while aneurysms may develop post-trauma.

- **Right ventricular pseudoaneurysms**: Occur when the ventricular wall ruptures but is contained by nearby anatomical structures such as the pericardium and fibrotic tissue, lacking myocardial tissue. This makes them particularly vulnerable to rupture, so prompt diagnosis and intervention are crucial. Pseudoaneurysms often present with a narrow neck between the ventricular chamber and the paraventricular space.

### Nonsurgical management of ruptured pseudoaneurysm in patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic diseases [^113BWar1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The rupture of a pseudoaneurysm is an unusual complication that can occur following surgical and interventional treatments in patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic diseases. It manifests abruptly and often results in a lethal outcome. This study retrospectively analyzes cases of pseudoaneurysm rupture to provide guidance for appropriate therapeutic planning.

- **Methods**: Between 1985 and 1998, ruptures of pseudoaneurysms were observed in 14 out of 910 patients with hepatobiliary pancreatic diseases. This included six cases post-pancreaticoduodenectomy, three post-hepatic resection, two post-hepatopancreaticoduodenectomy, two post-percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, and one post-gastrojejunostomy. Thirteen of these patients underwent emergency angiography followed by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or infusion therapies. Of these, one patient required surgical hemostasis following incomplete hemostasis with TAE. The other patient, who did not undergo emergency angiography, received initial surgical hemostasis.

- **Results**: TAE achieved successful hemostasis in 11 out of 13 patients (85%), while the remaining two experienced incomplete hemostasis. One of these patients required a laparotomy but succumbed to multiple organ failure (MOF) six days post-surgical hemostasis. The other patient died one day after undergoing emergency angiography. Out of the 11 patients who achieved complete hemostasis via TAE, ten were subsequently discharged. However, one patient died due to liver failure and/or MOF. Additionally, the patient who underwent an initial laparotomy without angiography died of MOF 43 days post-operation.

### Endovascular embolisation of an iatrogenic superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysm using liquid embolic [^114zoTmL]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms of the superficial temporal artery (STA) are rarely reported consequences of surgical interventions. They carry a high rupture risk, necessitating expedient management. Both surgical resection and endovascular intervention are available management options. We present the case of a patient with a pseudoaneurysm of the STA, managed by a combination of endovascular embolisation using liquid embolic, followed by surgical resection.

### Peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms: A management-based classification system [^112y2Qjy]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms may rupture into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), the peritoneal cavity, the pancreatic duct, or a pseudocyst. Bleeding into the GIT can occur directly or indirectly. The latter is often due to haemosuccus pancreaticus or haemobilia, where patients present with haematemesis, haematochezia, or melaena. Those with extensive retroperitoneal haematoma, but without bleeding into the GIT, may present with pain only. In the studies reviewed, gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common presentation overall. In postoperative patients, intra-abdominal bleeding was the most common presentation, reflecting the underlying pathophysiology. On the other hand, in patients with pancreatitis, pain was the most prominent presenting symptom.

The onset of fresh bleeding from a drain following pancreatic surgery is an ominous sign suggestive of intra-abdominal bleeding, including from a pseudoaneurysm. It is known as a sentinel bleed. Initial minor bleeding may be followed by more catastrophic blood loss, and this occurs in up to 90% of cases. The importance of a sentinel bleed was first highlighted by Sato et al, who described it in all ten patients in their study with massive bleeding following pancreatectomy. More recent studies also suggested that this is frequently a warning sign of imminent and massive haemorrhage after pancreaticobiliary surgery. Early angiography is recommended as this may allow intervention while the patient is still haemodynamically stable.

### Spontaneous pseudoaneurysm of the hand [^116kpwLv]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm of the hand is rare, with few cases reported in the literature. These cases are usually related to trauma. Early treatment is recommended once a pseudoaneurysm has been diagnosed. We report the surgical treatment of spontaneous pseudoaneurysm of the hand in a patient who was undergoing anticoagulant therapy.

### Ipsilateral femoral vein compression: A contraindication to thrombin injection of femoral pseudoaneurysms [^112EZQge]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The development of a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm occurs in 0.6% to 3.2% of interventional procedures. Nonsurgical treatment has consisted of ultrasound scan-directed compression and, more recently, direct thrombin injection into the pseudoaneurysm cavity to achieve thrombosis. Reported complications after thrombin injection are rare. We report two cases of femoral venous compression associated with pseudoaneurysm injection and review the literature.

A 76-year-old man and an 86-year-old man both underwent thrombin injection of pseudoaneurysms compressing the ipsilateral common femoral vein. Both patients were diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis and subsequently needed surgical exploration for repair of the pseudoaneurysm and release of the venous compression. At exploration, both were found to have significant inflammation surrounding the femoral vessels, which made vessel exposure challenging. Because of the venous outflow obstruction involved in femoral pseudoaneurysms with secondary venous compression and the surgical difficulty caused by surrounding inflammation, avoidance of thrombin injection in favor of early surgical intervention is suggested.

### Emergency endovascular management of peripheral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms - a review [^115eyiPt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Popliteal aneurysms are the most common peripheral artery aneurysms, followed by femoral artery aneurysms. Patients with popliteal artery aneurysms have a 70% risk of concurrent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Similarly, patients with AAA have a 3.1% risk of developing a popliteal aneurysm. Bilateral popliteal artery aneurysms occur in 50–70% of cases. Patients usually present with critical limb ischemia due to aneurysm thrombosis. Rupture of popliteal aneurysms is uncommon.

Femoral aneurysms are asymptomatic in 30–40% of patients at initial presentation. Approximately one-third present with local symptoms such as groin pain or a groin mass. Among patients with femoral aneurysms, 10–65% experience complications at initial presentation, including chronic thrombosis with claudication, acute thrombosis with limb ischemia, and rupture. Distal embolization is less common. Most patients with femoral aneurysms have multiple aneurysms, with a 51–92% incidence of associated aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease. Peripheral arterial aneurysms predominantly affect males. Common risk factors include smoking, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

Historically, aneurysms have been repaired through open techniques. However, over the last two decades, endovascular stenting has increasingly been used for managing aneurysmal and stenotic arterial conditions, particularly in the aorta. Various randomized controlled trials and comparative studies have demonstrated an early reduction in postoperative morbidity and mortality with endovascular approaches.

### Iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysm and secondary ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis: An indication for early surgical exploration [^116SwS4Z]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysm formation often complicates transfemoral interventional procedures. Nonsurgical treatment consists of femoral compression and thrombin injection under ultrasound guidance. We report a case of a 74-year-old man diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm following coronary angiography. Duplex ultrasound revealed deep vein thrombosis of the ipsilateral common femoral vein. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection was unsuccessfully performed, and the patient subsequently underwent surgical exploration for repair of the pseudoaneurysm and release of the venous compression. The increased local inflammation, due to the thrombosis, added to the surgical difficulties. We conclude that early surgical intervention should be considered as a primary strategy in patients with femoral pseudoaneurysms and deep vein thrombosis secondary to femoral compression.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the common digital artery with magnetic resonance imaging and surgical findings [^111UGLKy]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Pseudoaneurysms are rare and most commonly caused by blunt trauma. Taking a clinical history and conducting an examination are very helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis. In addition, imaging methods are very useful in distinguishing a pseudoaneurysm from soft-tissue tumors. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing the development of possible complications. The treatment approach varies according to the localization and size of the lesion and the presence of complications. We present a case — with imaging and surgical findings — of a pseudoaneurysm in a 27-year-old male in the second web interval following a penetrating trauma.
