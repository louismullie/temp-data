## Question

PSA elevated probability after radical prostatectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage an elevated PSA after radical prostatectomy, including definitions, thresholds, timing, risk stratification, imaging, and salvage strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify PSA persistence versus biochemical recurrence. Then, I should verify the optimal timing and thresholds for declaring persistence or recurrence. Next, I will examine how preoperative PSA and PSA kinetics modify risk. After that, I need to review imaging indications, especially PSMA-PET, and when to deploy it. Then, I will appraise salvage radiation timing and the role of ADT. Finally, I should integrate competing risks, life expectancy, and guideline-concordant follow-up to avoid overtreatment while capturing those who benefit from early salvage therapy.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. PSA persistence is when PSA never becomes undetectable after surgery, whereas biochemical recurrence is when PSA was undetectable and then becomes detectable and rises on at least two determinations or exceeds a defined threshold. NCCN uses a trigger of PSA greater than 0.1 ng/mL, while AUA/ASTRO define BCR as PSA 0.2 ng/mL or higher on two separate tests, which I should keep distinct in my mind to avoid misclassification [^114VK2Qr] [^111wG7MG] [^1169k9Cf].

> Wait, let me verify the timing issue because premature labeling of persistence can drive overtreatment. I initially thought the first postoperative PSA at 6 weeks would suffice, but hold on, I should verify clearance kinetics. Contemporary cohorts show that assessing PSA at or beyond 3 months reduces overtreatment, particularly in men with higher preoperative PSA, because some who appear to have persistence at 6–8 weeks will reach undetectable levels if observed longer, and earlier treatment in that subgroup has been associated with worse outcomes in some analyses, likely due to residual circulating PSA rather than true persistence [^112Qsksb] [^112E7pwJ] [^113TWAq1].

> Next, I should review thresholds and confirm which cut points best predict meaningful progression. The most widely used surgical BCR definition remains PSA 0.2 ng/mL or higher on two occasions, but I need to check whether a higher threshold improves specificity; indeed, PSA 0.4 ng/mL or higher with a subsequent increase correlates more strongly with systemic progression and may better identify durable failure, though using 0.2 ng/mL remains standard in many trials and guidelines, so I should frame counseling around both conventions [^1144LCRU] [^1155gkFZ] [^1169k9Cf].

> I will now examine how preoperative PSA modifies the interpretation of persistence. Patients with pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL are more likely to have an apparent persistent PSA at 6–8 weeks, yet paradoxically, when observed longer, a higher proportion will normalize, and those who do not normalize still have a worse prognosis with increasing persistent PSA portending higher all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. This reinforces waiting at least 3 months before declaring persistence and initiating salvage therapy in the absence of high-risk features [^112Qsksb] [^112E7pwJ] [^113TWAq1].

> Let me consider PSA kinetics because doubling time refines risk beyond a single value. Short PSADT, typically less than 6–12 months, is consistently associated with higher risks of metastasis and prostate cancer death, and should prompt earlier salvage consideration once a rising trend is confirmed; conversely, long PSADT, especially beyond a year, often reflects indolent disease where observation may be reasonable in appropriately selected patients [^115SWZnu] [^116f1Vbr] [^111cLVct].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize ultrasensitive PSA in practice. Ultrasensitive assays can detect values below 0.1 ng/mL and may help earlier risk stratification, but I need to ensure I don't overcall recurrence; guidelines advise confirming a rising trend before acting on low-level detections, and while a nadir less than 0.01 ng/mL is associated with excellent relapse-free survival, values of 0.02–0.04 ng/mL carry higher early relapse risk and may warrant closer surveillance or earlier salvage in high-risk patients [^114DiRKF] [^112m52VL] [^113VQrGN].

> Next, I should review imaging because the yield is PSA dependent and mis-timing scans wastes resources. Conventional imaging has low yield at low PSA, with bone scan positivity under 5% when PSA is below 7–10 ng/mL, so routine bone or CT imaging in asymptomatic, low-PSA BCR is not recommended. PSMA-PET has far superior detection and its positivity rises with PSA, roughly 33% below 0.2 ng/mL, 45% at 0.2–0.49 ng/mL, 59% at 0.5–0.99 ng/mL, 75% at 1.0–1.99 ng/mL, and 95% at 2.0 ng/mL or higher, so I should align PET with both PSA level and the clinical intent to deliver salvage local therapy or metastasis-directed treatment [^111HrcAJ] [^113AucSo] [^1151yvCE].

> I need to ensure salvage radiation timing is optimized because effectiveness declines as PSA rises. Multiple guidelines converge on treating at the lowest PSA feasible, ideally at or below 0.5 ng/mL, with stronger outcomes when delivered at or below 0.2–0.25 ng/mL in appropriate candidates. Importantly, waiting until PSA exceeds 0.25 ng/mL has been associated with higher all-cause mortality in observational cohorts, so I should avoid unnecessary delays once a confirmed rising PSA is documented [^111noPDT] [^116cnXQc] [^113dscPP].

> Let me think about who benefits from adding ADT to salvage radiation, and I should double-check the thresholds. ADT should be added when high-risk features are present, such as PSA 0.7 ng/mL or higher, Grade Group 4–5, PSADT 6 months or less, seminal vesicle invasion, or persistent detectable PSA; RTOG 9601 supports ADT with higher post-prostatectomy PSA, and pooled analyses suggest potential benefit even at lower thresholds like 0.35 ng/mL in selected patients, though uncertainty remains and shared decision-making is essential [^112YCDe3] [^114sZVHb].

> But wait, what if the patient has low-risk BCR features and substantial competing mortality. I should confirm that not all BCR warrants immediate therapy; men with long PSADT, low-grade disease, late recurrence, and limited life expectancy often have higher risks of death from other causes than from prostate cancer, so observation with interval PSA monitoring is appropriate, and treatment decisions should explicitly incorporate life expectancy and comorbidity to avoid overtreatment [^1149co5P] [^1113dLNj] [^116cDNHp].

> Next, I should review how to integrate molecular and clinical risk tools to individualize decisions. Genomic classifiers such as Decipher can refine estimates of metastasis and mortality beyond clinical features, and validated postoperative nomograms incorporating PSA, grade, stage, margins, nodes, and time to recurrence improve prognostic accuracy. These tools should be used alongside PSA kinetics and patient preferences to guide the intensity and timing of salvage therapy [^117LCT6n] [^1134Cjmb] [^111YfpPr].

> I will now examine follow-up cadence and when surveillance can be safely de-intensified. After achieving an undetectable PSA, annual PSA for the first 5 years and then every 6–12 months thereafter is reasonable [^notfound], with longer intervals in low-risk patients. Data suggest that men who remain undetectable at 10–20 years have very low risks of late recurrence and cancer death, supporting the option to discontinue PSA testing after a decade or two in carefully selected long-term survivors [^112TgQtG] [^116NrpBB].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm surgical success and baseline risk with pathology. Second, avoid declaring persistence before 3 months and interpret early detectable values cautiously, especially if pre-RP PSA was high. Third, once BCR is confirmed, calculate PSADT and apply risk stratification. Fourth, obtain PSMA-PET when PSA is around 0.5 ng/mL or higher, or earlier if high-risk features and local therapy are contemplated. Fifth, offer salvage radiation at the lowest feasible PSA, adding ADT for high-risk features. Sixth, individualize using nomograms and molecular tests, and reserve observation for low-risk BCR with limited life expectancy, documenting shared decision-making throughout [^114VK2Qr] [^111noPDT] [^113AucSo].

After radical prostatectomy, the probability of PSA elevation (biochemical recurrence) is **20–40% at 10 years** [^112qQhPs] and **30–50% at 15 years**, with about 10–20% experiencing persistent PSA after surgery [^1116r2gr]. Risk is higher with adverse pathologic features (Gleason ≥ 8, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement) [^115Z3n6z] and rises with higher preoperative PSA [^115gSMB3]. Early recurrence (< 2 years) carries a **threefold higher risk of metastasis and death** than late recurrence [^115SWZnu] [^1149co5P]. Most recurrences are local and amenable to salvage radiotherapy, especially when PSA is ≤ 0.5 ng/mL [^111noPDT]; however, about 30–40% will progress despite salvage therapy, underscoring the need for close surveillance and individualized management [^notfound].

---

## Definitions and thresholds for PSA elevation

- **Biochemical recurrence (BCR)**: PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL on two separate measurements [^1169k9Cf] after initial undetectable PSA [^114VK2Qr].
- **Persistent PSA**: PSA remains detectable (≥ 0.1 ng/mL) without falling to undetectable levels after surgery [^113Egkmo].
- **Ultrasensitive PSA**: Detects levels as low as 0.01 ng/mL; values ≥ 0.05 ng/mL are associated with higher recurrence risk [^116Lsxx6].

---

## Incidence and probability of PSA elevation

Incidence and probability vary by study and follow-up: at 10 years, BCR occurs in **20–40%** [^112qQhPs] and at 15 years in **30–50%**; persistent PSA after surgery is seen in **10–20%** [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for PSA elevation

Several factors increase the likelihood of PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy:

| **Risk factor** | **Impact on psa elevation** |
|-|-|
| High preoperative PSA (> 10 ng/mL) | Increased risk of BCR and persistent PSA [^111YfpPr] |
| High Gleason score (≥ 8) | Higher recurrence risk [^115Z3n6z] |
| Positive surgical margins | Increased risk of local recurrence [^notfound] |
| Seminal vesicle invasion | Higher recurrence risk [^115Z3n6z] |
| Lymph node involvement | Increased risk of systemic recurrence [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical significance of PSA elevation

- **Metastatic progression**: PSA elevation often precedes clinical metastasis by years [^115SWZnu]; risk increases with shorter PSA doubling time (PSADT) [^111cLVct].
- **Mortality**: Early recurrence (< 2 years) is associated with higher metastasis and mortality [^1149co5P].
- **Quality of life**: PSA elevation causes anxiety and impacts quality of life, influencing treatment decisions [^115Hjubv].

---

## Management strategies

- **Observation**: For low-risk patients with slow PSADT and no adverse features [^116f1Vbr].
- **Salvage radiotherapy**: Effective at low PSA levels (≤ 0.5 ng/mL) [^111noPDT]; outcomes diminish with higher PSA [^113dscPP].
- **Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)**: Combined with salvage radiotherapy for high-risk features (Gleason ≥ 8, PSADT ≤ 6 months) [^112YCDe3].
- **Imaging**: PSMA PET/CT is recommended for PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL to localize recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Prognosis varies with PSADT: **PSADT < 6 months** confers high risk of metastasis and death, whereas **PSADT > 12 months** indicates low risk and supports observation [^116f1Vbr]. Time to recurrence also matters: **early recurrence (< 2 years)** carries a worse prognosis than late recurrence (> 5 years) [^1149co5P]. Pathological features — higher Gleason score, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node involvement — are associated with worse outcomes [^115Z3n6z].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes include **metastasis**, which develops in approximately 34% of patients with biochemical recurrence [^115SWZnu], and **mortality**, with median time from metastasis to death of about 5 years [^115SWZnu]. Survival is significantly better with **early salvage radiotherapy** at low PSA levels [^111noPDT].

---

The probability of PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy is **20–40% at 10 years** and **30–50% at 15 years**, with risk modulated by pathologic features and preoperative PSA. Early, low-PSA salvage radiotherapy improves outcomes, and management should be individualized based on PSADT, pathologic risk, and patient factors [^113Db5dJ] [^111noPDT] [^115jVUjp].

### Nomogram predicting the probability of early recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer [^1133WG22]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We developed a nomogram predicting the probability of early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy because early recurrence predisposes to distant metastasis and prostate cancer related mortality. Identifying patients at risk for early recurrence may improve prognosis as early institution of adjuvant therapy may reduce the risk of progression.

Materials and Methods

From January 1992 to December 2005, 2,911 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Cox regression models addressing biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy were used to identify significant predictors. Age, prostate specific antigen, pathological Gleason sum, surgical margin, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node invasion were considered. A nomogram predicting the probability of biochemical recurrence-free survival within 2 years after radical prostatectomy was developed. Data from an independent center were used for external validation (2,875).

Results

In both cohorts combined during the first 2 years 11.0% (639) of all patients experienced relapse which accounted for 58.5% of all observed biochemical recurrence. In the development cohort except for age all covariates represented significant predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Pathological Gleason sum 7 or greater, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node invasion were the most powerful predictors of biochemical recurrence. The accuracy (c-index) of the nomogram predicting biochemical recurrence-free survival within 2 years after radical prostatectomy was 0.82 in the external validation cohort.

Conclusions

Two-thirds of all instances of relapse occur during the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy. Those patients can be highly accurately identified with our nomogram. They might benefit the most from adjuvant treatment and could be the ideal candidates for adjuvant treatment trials.

Nomograms — nomograms are predictive instruments that combine relevant prognostic variables to individualize estimates and inform management; tables give the probability (95% CI) that a patient with a certain clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA will have a cancer of each pathologic stage; nomograms can inform treatment decision-making for active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, neurovascular bundle preservation or omission of pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, or external beam RT (EBRT); biochemical progression-free survival (PFS) can be reassessed postoperatively using age, diagnostic serum PSA, and pathologic grade and stage; potential success of adjuvant or post-recurrence RT after unsuccessful radical prostatectomy can be assessed using a nomogram; none of the current models predicts with perfect accuracy and only some predict metastasis and cancer-specific death; many patients with PSA recurrence will not live long enough to develop distant metastases or die from prostate cancer, and those with a short PSA doubling time (PSADT) are at greatest risk of death, so PSADT may be a more useful measure of risk of death; the NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends using NCCN risk groups to begin treatment discussions for clinically localized prostate cancer and using nomograms to provide additional and more individualized information.

AUA/ASTRO/SUO guideline — treatment decision-making at suspected biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) states that clinicians should inform patients that salvage radiation for a detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RP is more effective when given at lower levels of PSA (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For patients with a detectable PSA after RP in whom salvage radiation therapy (RT) is being considered, clinicians should provide salvage radiation when the PSA is ≤ 0.5 ng/mL (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For patients with a detectable PSA after RP who are at high risk for clinical progression, clinicians may offer salvage radiation when PSA values are < 0.2 ng/mL (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

1 INTRODUCTION

The primary goal in the treatment of any cancer is the prevention of disease‐specific mortality (DSM). Metastatic disease is difficult to treat and usually incurable, resulting in DSM unless the patient dies of intercurrent disease or fatal accident. 1, 2, 3, 4 Practically, cancer does not necessarily have to be totally eradicated by the primary intervention; rather the goal is to significantly delay progression to metastatic disease and, therefore, DSM. To accomplish this goal, patients at risk for disease progression must be identified before it occurs.

Depending on the risk of disease progression, a number of primary interventions may be available for patients. For men with prostate cancer at low risk of disease progression, active surveillance rather than immediate definitive treatment may be appropriate. Radical prostatectomy (RP), on the contrary, is a standard treatment for men with localized prostate cancer at intermediate or high risk of disease progression and a life expectancy of at least 10 years. 4 Traditionally, postsurgical factors such as prostate‐specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and pathological stage have been used to provide prognostic information regarding the risk of DSM post‐RP. For these factors, rising PSA (i.e. biochemical recurrence [BCR]) has primarily been used as a surrogate for DSM to accommodate for the long natural history of prostate cancer and the inherent difficulties associated with following patients for extended time periods. 5 Although all patients with prostate cancer who experience DSM exhibit a rising PSA, the correlation between the two is actually fairly weak. 6 For example, a recently published post‐RP cohort of men with prostate cancer and a median follow‐up time of 23.9 years found that 36% had rising PSA, but only 8% had died from their disease. 7

### Is it possible to compare PSA recurrence-free survival after surgery and radiotherapy using revised ASTRO criterion – "nadir + 2"? [^111F8dtk]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The new American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus definition of biochemical failure after radiotherapy for prostate cancer is defined as a prostate-specific antigen level at or greater than the absolute nadir PSA level plus 2 ng/mL. Because this definition inevitably will be used to compare cancer control rates after radiotherapy to those after surgery, this study examined the effect of this comparison.

Methods

We reviewed the data from 2570 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy from 1985 to 2004. Biochemical failure was defined as any measurable PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or greater. We evaluated how the nadir+2 definition affected the failure rate when applied to this series.

Results

The actuarial 5, 10, and 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival probability with failure defined as a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or more and a PSA level of 2 ng/mL or more was 88.6%, 81.2%, and 78.1% and 94.6%, 89.4%, and 84.3%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The median time to biochemical progression was 2.8 years for the greater than 0.2 ng/mL definition and 7.9 years for the 2 ng/mL or more definition. The nadir+2 definition systematically overestimated the biochemical recurrence-free survival, even after stratifying patients into standard prognostic risk groups, especially in men who developed local recurrence.

Conclusions

When applied to a mature series of surgically treated patients with localized prostate cancer, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology "nadir+2" definition resulted in a systematic delay in the determination of biochemical failure. Because patients in this series who experienced a detectable PSA level took more than 5 years to progress to a PSA level of 2 ng/mL or greater, the 5-year biochemical control rates with the definition of 0.2 ng/mL or more should be compared with the 10-year biochemical control rates using the nadir+2 definition.

### The natural history of a delayed detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy [^112qQhPs]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is an effective form of definitive treatment for men with clinically localized prostate cancer. However, 20–40% of men may experience biochemical recurrence within 10 years. A detectable postoperative serum PSA is thought to represent treatment failure, and some men may undergo salvage therapy. However, biochemical recurrence (BCR) is increasingly recognized to have a variable course with only about a third of patients progressing to metastatic disease. As such, the risks and benefits of salvage treatment must be weighed by providers and patients, in an effort to prevent clinical progression while avoiding the costs and morbidity of unnecessary treatment.

Previously, we reported on the long-term oncological outcomes of an immediately detectable (< 6 months) PSA after RP, and found that the risk of development of metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall survival (OM) were associated with PSA persistence. In this study, we aim to better characterize the natural history of patients with a delayed detectable serum PSA after RP (≥ 6 months) using an ultrasensitive PSA cut point (0.03 ng/ml), a more contemporary value. We compare the immediate and delayed detectable PSA, and undetectable PSA groups to elucidate outcomes differences in these three distinct groups.

### Can we stop prostate specific antigen testing 10 years after radical prostatectomy? [^112TgQtG]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The risk of biochemical recurrence is inversely related to the relapse-free interval after radical prostatectomy. We examined predictors of late biochemical recurrence, and the relationship between timing of biochemical recurrence and long-term survival outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Of 10,609 men treated with radical prostatectomy 1,684 had biochemical recurrence. We examined predictors of late biochemical recurrence (more than 10 years after radical prostatectomy), and calculated metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates from the time of biochemical recurrence. In the subset of 1,583 men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years we calculated actuarial metastasis-free and cancer specific survival estimates at 20 years after radical prostatectomy.

Results

Of the biochemical recurrence studied 77.0%, 16.6%, 4.9% and 1.5% occurred at 5 or less, greater than 5 to 10, greater than 10 to 15 and more than 15 years postoperatively. Late recurrence was associated with more favorable pathological features, as well as higher metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates. For men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years the actuarial probability of biochemical recurrence and metastasis at 20 years varied by stage and grade, with no metastases in patients with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less. A single patient with an undetectable prostate specific antigen at 10 years died of prostate cancer within 20 years after radical prostatectomy.

Conclusions

Men with an undetectable prostate specific antigen for more than 10 years have a low risk of subsequent biochemical recurrence, with correspondingly lower rates of metastasis and death. These patients should be counseled that their risk of subsequent cancer related morbidity and mortality is low. Furthermore, these results suggest that annual prostate specific antigen testing may be safely discontinued after 10 years for men with a prostatectomy Gleason score 6 or less and/or limited life expectancy.

### Salvage therapy for prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline part I: introduction and treatment decision-making at the time of suspected biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^111FvCDu]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

High-risk features in biochemical recurrence (BCR) after prostatectomy to be considered for patient counseling and management include Grade Group 4–5, Stage pT3b-4, Surgical margin status, Node-positive disease, Short PSADT, Short interval from primary therapy to PSA recurrence (including persistent detectable PSA after prostatectomy), Higher post-prostatectomy PSA, Genomic classifier risk, and PET imaging findings; the Panel notes that the presence of positive surgical margins has been associated both with an increased likelihood of BCR as well as a lower risk of disease progression after salvage radiation and also recognizes that the above does not represent an exhaustive list of relevant prognostic variables.

### Prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy [^112BNSof]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Today, more men than ever before are being followed after radical prostatectomy. Prognosis and follow-up should be based on the pathologic specimen. Measurable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after surgery defines failure, with time to detectable PSA and rate of PSA rise being useful prognostic factors. The natural history of untreated biochemical failure is protracted, a fact to be considered in discussions of adjuvant treatment. Early in disease recurrence, imaging studies to locate residual disease rarely are useful clinically. Both adjuvant and salvage radiation to the prostate bed have benefits and risks, but neither is superior in overall prostate cancer survival. The timing of hormone therapy remains largely empiric. The promise of effective cytotoxic chemotherapy still is greater than its actual benefits, although novel cytostatic agents are being developed. The future management of this disease will improve with better molecular definition of risk and therapeutic response.

### Salvage therapy for prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline part I: introduction and treatment decision-making at the time of suspected biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^115jVUjp]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Salvage therapy for prostate cancer — post-prostatectomy patients with detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and risk stratification: for patients with a detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy (RP) who are at high risk for clinical progression, clinicians may offer salvage radiation when PSA values are < 0.2 ng/mL (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C); clinicians may obtain ultrasensitive PSA following RP in patients who are at high risk of recurrence and in whom salvage RT would be considered, and for patients who do not meet the AUA definition of biochemical recurrence after RP (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL) yet have a detectable ultrasensitive PSA, clinicians should confirm a rising trend in PSA before proceeding with therapy. Clinicians should inform patients that salvage radiation after RP poses inherent risks to urinary control, erectile function, and bowel function, and these risks must be considered along with patient life expectancy, comorbidities, and preferences to facilitate shared decision-making. Clinicians should use prognostic factors such as PSA doubling time (PSADT), Gleason Grade Group, pathologic stage, surgical margin status, validated post-prostatectomy genomic classifier and/or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging results to counsel patients with a detectable PSA about their risk of clinical progression (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116b6Jpm]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### Mortality risk for docetaxel-treated, high-grade prostate cancer with low PSA levels: a meta-analysis [^116BuvPy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the addition of docetaxel to standard of care (SOC) therapy with radiation and testosterone suppression or radical prostatectomy associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer–specific and all-cause deaths in patients with high-grade, nonmetastatic prostate cancer with low prostate-specific antigen levels?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (145 participants with prostate cancer), adding docetaxel to SOC treatment in patients who were in otherwise good health was associated with a significant reduction in death due to prostate cancer.

Meaning

The poor prognosis of patients with high-grade prostate cancer and low levels of prostate-specific antigen levels may be improved with the addition of docetaxel to SOC treatment.

### Impact of persistent PSA after salvage radical prostatectomy: a multicenter study [^113QiGsc]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and objective

Persistent prostatic specific antigen (PSA) represents a poor prognostic factor for recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP). However, the impact of persistent PSA on oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing salvage RP is unknown. To investigate the impact of persistent PSA after salvage RP on long-term oncologic outcomes.

Material and methods

Patients who underwent salvage RP for recurrent prostate cancer between 2000 and 2021 were identified from twelve high-volume centers. Only patients with available PSA after salvage RP were included. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the effect of persistent PSA on biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis and any death after salvage RP. Persistent PSA was defined as a PSA-value ≥ 0.1 ng/ml, at first PSA-measurement after salvage RP.

Results

Overall, 580 patients were identified. Of those, 42% (n = 242) harbored persistent PSA. Median follow-up after salvage RP was 38 months, median time to salvage RP was 64 months and median time to first PSA after salvage RP was 2.2 months. At 84 months after salvage RP, BCR-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival was 6.6 vs. 59%, 71 vs. 88% and 77 vs. 94% for patients with persistent vs. undetectable PSA after salvage RP (all p < 0.01). In multivariable Cox models persistent PSA was an independent predictor for BCR (HR: 5.47, p < 0.001) and death (HR: 3.07, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Persistent PSA is common after salvage RP and represents an independent predictor for worse oncologic outcomes. Patients undergoing salvage RP should be closely monitored after surgery to identify those with persistent PSA.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk [^117XGNz6]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How long should prostate-specific antigen (PSA) be monitored following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (PC) to accurately document a persistent PSA, and does an increasing level portend a worse prognosis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 43 298 patients with PC, among patients with a persistent PSA level but not those with an undetectable PSA level, a pre–radical prostatectomy (RP) PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less was significantly associated with reduced all-cause and PC-specific mortality risk, which can be explained by a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less who could have reached an undetectable PSA level if additional time for PSA assessment occurred before initiating post-RP therapy for a presumed persistent PSA.

Meaning

PSA level should be assessed for at least 3 months postoperatively to minimize overtreatment, and a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis.

### Preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels vary according to the topographical distribution of prostate cancer in prostatectomy specimens [^1129ns4z]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether the spatial distribution of prostate cancer (PCa) influences the concentration of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Methods

An observational prospective study was performed in 775 consecutive men with preoperative PSA levels ≤ 20 ng/mL who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined PCa. We evaluated prostate specimens using a cMDX-based map model of the prostate and determined the prostate volume, number of cancer foci, relative tumor volume, Gleason score, zone of origin, localization, and pathologic stage after stratification according to PSA levels categorized into 3 groups: < 4 ng/mL, 4–10 ng/mL, and 10.1–20 ng/mL. The distribution of 5254 PCa foci was analyzed after stratification according to PSA levels and visualized on heat maps. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the odds ratios of PSA levels for the presence of PCa in 16 regions.

Results

PCa with PSA < 4 ng/mL was predominantly localized to the apical part and the peripheral zone of the prostate. PCa with a PSA level 10.1–20 ng/mL (16.4% of cases) was observed more frequently in the anterior part and the base of the prostate than PCa with a PSA level < 4 or 4–10 ng/mL (6% and 10%, respectively).

Conclusion

Preoperative PSA levels vary according to the spatial distribution of PCa in radical prostatectomy specimens. The probability of anterior PCa is increased with higher PSA serum levels. Regions of interest harboring the PCa can be defined according to preoperative PSA and prostate volume. These findings are useful to optimize the focal therapy or to adjust the radiation fields.

### Incidence and prognostic implications of prostate-specific antigen persistence and relapse after radical prostatectomy: population-based study [^1116r2gr]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a common treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide, with approximately 3000 RPs performed in Sweden and 80 000–90 000 RPs performed each year in the United States. There is a substantial risk of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence or relapse, and in previous studies there has been a large range in the proportion of relapse, from 5% to 30% for PSA persistence and 20%-50% for PSA relapse.

Most studies on incidence and prognostic implications of PSA persistence and relapse have been based on data from tertiary referral centers of excellence, and these results are unlikely to be representative of all men in the population who undergo RP. Many of these studies lacked detailed data on additional treatment and life expectancy.

Given the high number of men who undergo RP, the large range in incidence of PSA persistence and relapse, and the often very long disease trajectory after RP and relapse, there is a need for population-based studies that take life expectancy and risk of death from other causes into account.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and prognostic implications of PSA persistence and relapse after RP in a large population-based cohort including data on subsequent treatment, time to relapse, and life expectancy based on age and comorbidity.

### Biochemical recurrence and risk of mortality following radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy [^116f1Vbr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The most sensitive biomarker for prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy is serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). However, the evidence on the association of biochemical recurrence (BCR) (ie, PSA rise after treatment with curative intent) with prostate cancer survival is limited. Patients with rising PSA after radical prostatectomy or primary radiotherapy have different risks of subsequent symptomatic metastatic disease based on various parameters, including the PSA levels. Moreover, the high variability in reported effect sizes of BCR suggests that only certain patient subgroups with BCR might be at an increased risk of mortality. In a recent systematic review of the literature, Van den Broeck et alfound that higher International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Gleason Grade Group (GG), shorter time from treatment to recurrence, and shorter PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) are associated with prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) in patients with BCR. Based on these findings, the EAU guidelines suggest to stratify patients with BCR into EAU low-risk BCR (for radical prostatectomy: PSA-DT of more than 1 year and pathological GG of less than 4; for radiotherapy: time to BCR of more than 18 months and biopsy GG of less than 4) or EAU high-risk BCR (for radical prostatectomy: PSA-DT of less than 1 year or pathological GG 4 to 5; for radiotherapy: interval to biochemical failure of less than 18 months or biopsy GG 4 to 5). Subsequently, Tilki et aland Pak et alexternally validated the proposed risk stratification for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, suggesting that patients who are low risk may not require an immediate intervention at time of BCR.

The retrospective nature of most studies included in the systematic review by Van den Broeck et al, the heterogeneity in BCR definitions, number of PSA measurement, different calculations of PSA and PSA-DT, limit the quality of the evidence, and precluded further strong recommendations. By leveraging a large-scale, population-based Swedish database containing comprehensive information on treatment modalities, PSA testing, and survival outcomes, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association of BCR and its current risk stratification with PCSM.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk [^112E7pwJ]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, a counterintuitive association was observed between a significantly lower ACM risk and PCSM risk in patients with a persistent PSA assessed at a median of 2.17 months post-RP and a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less, and this significant association remained after adjustment for prostate gland volume and was observed in the validation cohort for PCSM risk. To find a reason for the more favorable prognosis in patients with a higher pre-RP PSA level, we hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less assessed for a persistent PSA at the conventional 1.5-month to 2.0-month time point post-RP could have reached an undetectable PSA level if further PSA assessment was performed before initiating post-RP therapy for a presumed persistent PSA. The evidence to support this hypothesis is shown in Table 1. First, patients with a pre-PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less had earlier PSA assessments following RP, which could have prompted physicians to initiate post-RP therapy sooner, given the presumed persistent PSA and the known pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL. This was substantiated by the more frequent and shorter median time to post-RP RT plus ADT use or ADT use during the first year following RP in patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less. Moreover, these median treatment times after RP were shorter than the median times to an undetectable PSA in patients observed for 6 months after RP and shorter by a greater amount in patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less.

### Ultrasensitive serum prostate specific antigen nadir accurately predicts the risk of early relapse after radical prostatectomy [^113VQrGN]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ultrasensitive prostate specific antigen (PSA) assays allow a lower limit of detection (less than 0.01 ng/ml) than standard PSA assays. In this study we examined the ability of ultrasensitive PSA nadir to predict relapse after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Materials and Methods

A total of 906 men treated with RP were followed with PSA measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Of the 906 men 545 (60%) with a PSA nadir of less than 0.01 ng/ml or at least 3 followup ultrasensitive PSA measurements underwent analysis and stratification by PSA nadir. Biochemical relapse was defined as 2 consecutive increasing post-nadir PSA measurements of 0.1 ng/ml or greater. The ability of ultrasensitive PSA nadir to predict relapse was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.

Results

At a mean followup of 3.1 years 54 of 545 men (9.9%) experienced biochemical relapse with a mean time to relapse of 25.2 months. Relapse rates in men with a PSA nadir of less than 0.01 (423), 0.01 (75), 0.02 (19) and 0.04 or greater ng/ml (28) were 4%, 12%, 16% and 89%, respectively. Men with a nadir of less than 0.01 ng/ml had a significantly lower relapse rate than men with a nadir of 0.01 (p < 0.01), 0.02 (p < 0.025) or 0.04 or greater ng/ml (p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a nadir of 0.01 (p < 0.05), 0.02 (p < 0.05) and 0.04 or greater ng/ml (p < 0.01) independently predicted an increased risk of biochemical relapse compared to a nadir of less than 0.01 ng/ml.

Conclusions

Ultrasensitive PSA nadir accurately predicts the risk of early biochemical relapse following RP. Men who achieve a nadir of less than 0.01 ng/ml have a low likelihood of early relapse. Higher nadir points may identify candidates for early adjuvant or salvage therapies.

Prostate cancer — risk stratification for clinically localized disease: The NCCN scheme uses a minimum of stage, Gleason grade, and PSA to assign patients to risk groups; these risk groups are used to select options that should be considered and to predict the probability of biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy, and they have been published widely and validated, providing a better basis for treatment recommendations than clinical stage alone. Newer risk classification schemes and tools (imaging, gene expression biomarkers, germline testing) have been shown to outperform NCCN risk groups and improve risk stratification; these tools should not be ordered reflexively and are recommended only when they will have the ability to change management (for example, active surveillance vs. radical treatment). Improved risk stratification can better identify patients who may derive greater or lesser absolute benefit from a given treatment.

The practical implementation of the nomogram in clinical practice to guide adjuvant or salvage treatment is an essential consideration for its real-world applicability. Clinicians interested in utilizing the nomogram as a decision-making tool would benefit from additional clarification on its implementation. Firstly, it is important to provide guidance on how to use the nomogram in a clinical setting. This includes outlining the specific variables and inputs required for accurate predictions. Clear instructions on data collection, such as the recommended imaging modalities or laboratory tests, would facilitate the practical application of the nomogram. Furthermore, discussing the interpretation of the nomogram's results is crucial. Clinicians need to understand the threshold or cutoff values associated with different treatment recommendations. Guidance on the level of confidence or uncertainty in the predictions would also assist clinicians in evaluating the nomogram's reliability. In addition to implementation and interpretation, the authors should consider discussing the potential benefits and limitations of integrating the nomogram into clinical practice. Highlighting the advantages, such as its ability to provide individualized risk assessment and guide treatment decisions, would emphasize its utility. However, it is equally important to address any limitations, such as the nomogram's reliance on specific patient populations or potential biases in the development of the model.

Conclusions Several clinical parameters help predict the outcomes of men with PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy.

### Prediction of biochemical recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy [^1157KYCe]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, we suggested a new nomogram that demonstrated good accuracy of BCR prediction for patients after LRP. The most crucial post-operative parameter to be evaluated is PSA, which is anticipated to be undetectable in 6 weeks following RP. A high probability of local recurrence or metastasis is indicated by an elevated PSA level following RP. The patient is given the status of BCR, which was a signal of cancer progression at a visual undetectable level, if the post-operative PSA level reaches 0.2 ng/mL. Numerous studies have been done on the connection between PSA nadir and BCR following RP. According to a retrospective analysis, men with PSA ≥ 0.01 ng/mL after RP had a lower chance of developing BCRFS after five years, dropping from 92.4 to 56.8%. PSA persistence after RP was linked to higher BCR and overall mortality in a research by Matsumoto et al. which included 582 patients. These outcomes are consistent with the findings of the current investigation. In comparison to the present analysis, where BCR was detected in 105 patients, several studies have described patients who underwent prostatectomy with a 5-year BCR-free survival rate ranging from 74 to 87% and a median PSA recurrence time of 2.6 years, which also higher compared to our study. Moreover, multivariable analysis identified unfavorable factor to BCRFS which are high initial serum PSA (> 20), ISUP Gleason grade group ≥ 3, positive margin status and seminal vesicle invasion using for develop a nomogram to predict BCR. Consistent with previous literature, patients with pathologically organ-confined cancer exhibited consistently low hazard rates over the follow-up period, emphasizing the significance of extended surveillance and timely intervention in individuals who undergo radical prostatectomy. Furthermore, positive surgical margins (PSM) have been shown to have a detrimental impact on postoperative functional outcomes (PFP) following radical prostatectomy (RP), emphasizing the need to minimize PSM rates for improved cancer control outcomes, despite the growing prevalence of organ-confined disease resulting from enhanced screening strategies. Similar conclusions have been reported regarding the nomogram in previous studies.

Therefore, the data in the current study provide the only available evidence to support initiating sRT after RP at a PSA level that is ≤ 0.25 ng/mL. This observation is clinically significant given that delivering sRT at PSA levels exceeding 0.25 ng/mL is associated with a higher ACM-risk.

### Interim prostate-specific antigen: predicting for biochemical failure during salvage radiation therapy after prostatectomy [^111hPVNB]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 30% of men with localized prostate cancer will develop detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after a radical prostatectomy, and two-thirds of these men will develop metastatic prostate cancer if left untreated. Several randomized clinical trials (eg, SWOG 8794, German ARO 9602, and EORTC 22911), have demonstrated that adjuvant radiation therapy within 6 months of surgery improves biochemical failure–free survival by 20% to 25%. Whether to give adjuvant radiation therapy versus observation with salvage treatment at the time of biochemical relapse remains an area of controversy and is being investigated by several randomized trials.

The recently completed RAVES trial showed similar freedom from biochemical failure rates between adjuvant radiation therapy and observation with salvage treatment, but the protocol defined level set for noninferiority was not achieved. Observation with salvage treatment did spare approximately half of men from pelvic radiation therapy and is associated with significantly lower levels of genitourinary toxicity.

Salvage radiation therapy after a rise in PSA after a radical prostatectomy offers a second chance at a cure, with salvage radiation therapy resulting in long-term biochemical control rates of approximately 50%. Current American Urological Association and European Association of Urology guidelines support prostate bed radiation therapy as a standard treatment for patients with a rising PSA after a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

There are known prognostic factors and nomograms that predict for failure after salvage radiation therapy. Patients who biochemically recur after salvage radiation therapy are likely to have undetected microscopic disease beyond the prostate bed. However, even patients with poor prognostic factors have a chance of biochemical control, making it difficult to determine who should not be offered salvage radiation therapy.

Restaging with a Gallium prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan at the time of biochemical relapse improves the chances of detecting macroscopic tumor compared with conventional imaging. However, despite the increased sensitivity of PSMA PET imaging, at ultralow PSA levels, macroscopic disease often cannot be detected. Schmidt-Hegemann et al have shown that with PSA values < 0.2 ng/mL, detection rates with PSMA PET are only 33.3%. Most patients are considered for salvage postprostatectomy radiation therapy with a PSA level < 0.2 ng/mL. The efficacy of salvage radiation therapy in an era of ultrasensitive PSA readings has been demonstrated when salvage radiation therapy is delivered at low PSA values, with improved 5-year biochemical relapse–free survival when this occurs.

### A risk-adjusted definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^112giY1W]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To determine whether a variable definition of biochemical recurrence (BCR) based on clincopathologic features facilitates early identification of patients likely to suffer from disease progression. The definition of BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) bears important implications for patient counseling and management; however, there remains a significant debate regarding the appropriate definition.

Methods

The study cohort consisted of 3619 men who underwent RP for localized prostate cancer from 1989 to 2007, with data abstracted from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry. Patients were stratified into three risk groups according to Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical (CAPRA-S) score. Three single threshold PSA cut-points for BCR were evaluated (PSA ≥ 0.05, ≥ 0.2 and ≥ 0.4ngml(-1)) as well as a variable cut-point defined by risk group. After reaching the cut-points, patients were followed for further PSA progression.

Results

The proportion of patients with BCR differed by cut-point and risk group, ranging from 7 to 37% (low risk), 22 to 58% (intermediate risk) and 60 to 86% (high risk). The positive-predictive value (PPV) for predicting further PSA progression was 49% for the PSA ≥ 0.05ngml(-1), 62% for the PSA ≥ 0.2ngml(-1), 65% for the PSA ≥ 0.4ngml(-1) and 68% for the risk-adjusted definition. Five-year progression-free survival was 39% for the risk-adjusted definition compared with 45–52% for the other definitions of BCR.

Conclusions

These data suggest that a variable definition of BCR determined by clinicopathologic risk may improve the identification of early recurrence after RP without increasing the overdiagnosis of BCR. By using a risk-adjusted BCR definition, clinicians can better predict future PSA progression and more appropriately counsel patients regarding salvage therapies.

### Standardizing the definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy-what prostate specific antigen cut point best predicts a durable increase and subsequent systemic progression? [^1155gkFZ]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple definitions of biochemical recurrence for prostate cancer exist after radical prostatectomy, and variation continues in prostate cancer outcome reporting and secondary treatment initiation. We reviewed long-term prostatectomy outcomes to assess the most appropriate prostate specific antigen cut point that predicts future disease progression.

Materials and Methods

We identified 13,512 patients with cT1–2N0M0 prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1987 and 2010. Single prostate specific antigen cut points of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 ng/ml or greater, as well as confirmatory prostate specific antigen value definitions of 0.2 ng/ml or greater followed by prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml and 0.4 ng/ml or greater followed by prostate specific antigen greater than 0.4 ng/ml were tested. Continued prostate specific antigen increase after a designated cut point definition was estimated using cumulative incidence. The strength of association between biochemical recurrence definitions and subsequent systemic progression were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models and the O'Quigley event based R(2) test.

Results

At a median postoperative followup of 9.1 years (IQR 4.9–14.3) a detectable prostate specific antigen developed in 5,041 patients and systemic progression developed in 512. After reaching the prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 ng/ml, the percentage of patients experiencing a continued prostate specific antigen increase over 5 years was 61%, 67% and 74%, respectively, plateauing at 0.4 ng/ml. The strongest association between biochemical recurrence and systemic progression occurred using a single prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.4 ng/ml or greater (HR 36, R(2) 0.92).

Conclusions

A prostate specific antigen cut point of 0.4 ng/ml or greater reflects the threshold at which a prostate specific antigen increase becomes durable and shows the strongest correlation with subsequent systemic progression. Consideration should be given to using a prostate specific antigen of 0.4 ng/ml or greater as the standard biochemical recurrence definition after radical prostatectomy.

### Prostate specific antigen testing after radical prostatectomy-can we stop at 20 years? [^116NrpBB]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the clinical features and outcomes associated with delayed biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, specifically among men with more than 20 years of followup.

Materials and Methods

A total of 16,720 men underwent radical prostatectomy and 2,699 experienced biochemical recurrence. We determined predictors of delayed biochemical recurrence as well as metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates for recurrence at various time points after radical prostatectomy. We performed subset analysis of the 732 men with 20 or more years of recurrence-free followup. Cumulative incidence curves for metastasis and prostate cancer death were calculated and stratified by biochemical recurrence time points.

Results

Predictors of delayed biochemical recurrence included elevated prostate specific antigen at radical prostatectomy, higher clinical and pathological stage, and positive surgical margins. Delayed biochemical recurrence was associated with favorable cumulative incidence curves for metastasis and prostate cancer death compared to early biochemical recurrence. Among the 732 men with undetectable prostate specific antigen at 20 years biochemical recurrence developed in 17 (2.3%), metastatic disease developed in a single patient and none died of prostate cancer. The actuarial probability of biochemical recurrence among men with undetectable prostate specific antigen at 20 years increased with adverse pathological features.

Conclusions

Men with delayed biochemical recurrence have favorable clinical features and improved survival. Men with undetectable prostate specific antigen 20 years after radical prostatectomy had a low rate of recurrence and no deaths from prostate cancer. This suggests that 20 years is a reasonable time to discontinue prostate specific antigen testing.

### Salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy [^1152N5C8]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Salvage radiotherapy may potentially cure patients with disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy, but previous evidence has suggested that it is ineffective in patients at the highest risk of metastatic disease progression.

Objective

To delineate patients who may benefit from salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer recurrence by identifying variables associated with a durable response.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective review of a cohort of 501 patients at 5 US academic tertiary referral centers who received salvage radiotherapy between June 1987 and November 2002 for detectable and increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after radical prostatectomy.

Main Outcome Measure

Disease progression after salvage radiotherapy, defined as a serum PSA value ≥ 0.1 ng/mL above the postradiotherapy PSA nadir confirmed by a second PSA measurement that was higher than the first by any amount, by a continued increase in PSA level after treatment, or by the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy after treatment.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 45 months, 250 patients (50%) experienced disease progression after treatment, 49 (10%) developed distant metastases, 20 (4%) died from prostate cancer, and 21 (4%) died from other or unknown causes. The 4-year progression-free probability (PFP) was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40%-50%). By multivariable analysis, predictors of progression were Gleason score of 8 to 10 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7–4.1; P < .001), preradiotherapy PSA level greater than 2.0 ng/mL (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7–3.2; P < .001), negative surgical margins (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.5; P < .001), PSA doubling time (PSADT) of 10 months or less (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.2; p = 0.001), and seminal vesicle invasion (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.9; p = 0.02). Patients with no adverse features had a 4-year PFP of 77% (95% CI, 64%-91%). When treatment was given for early recurrence (PSA level ≤ 2.0 ng/mL), patients with Gleason scores of 4 to 7 and a rapid PSADT had a 4-year PFP of 64% (95% CI, 51%-76%) and of 22% (95% CI, 6%-38%) when the surgical margins were positive and negative, respectively. Patients with Gleason scores of 8 to 10, positive margins, and receiving early salvage radiotherapy had a 4-year PFP of 81% (95% CI, 57%-100%) when the PSADT was longer than 10 months and of 37% (95% CI, 16%-58%) when the PSADT was 10 months or less.

Conclusions

Gleason score, preradiotherapy PSA level, surgical margins, PSADT, and seminal vesicle invasion are prognostic variables for a durable response to salvage radiotherapy. Selected patients with high-grade disease and/or a rapid PSADT who were previously thought to be destined to develop progressive metastatic disease may achieve a durable response to salvage radiotherapy.

### Nomogram predicting prostate cancer-specific mortality for men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^111cLVct]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The natural history of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-defined biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa) after definitive local therapy is highly variable. Validated prediction models for PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) in this population are needed for treatment decision-making and clinical trial design.

Objective

To develop and validate a nomogram to predict the probability of PCSM from the time of BCR among men with rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Between 1987 and 2011, 2254 men treated by radical prostatectomy at one of five high-volume hospitals experienced BCR, defined as three successive PSA rises (final value > 0.2 ng/ml), single PSA > 0.4 ng/ml, or use of secondary therapy administered for detectable PSA > 0.1 ng/ml. Clinical information and follow-up data were modeled using competing-risk regression analysis to predict PCSM from the time of BCR.

Intervention

Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and subsequent PCa BCR.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

PCSM.

Results and Limitations

The 10-yr PCSM and mortality from competing causes was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16–21%) and 17% (95% CI 14–19%), respectively. A nomogram predicting PCSM for all patients had an internally validated concordance index of 0.774. Inclusion of PSA doubling time (PSADT) in a nomogram based on standard parameters modestly improved predictive accuracy (concordance index 0.763 vs 0.754). Significant parameters in the models were preoperative PSA, pathological Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, time to PCa BCR, PSA level at PCa BCR, and PSADT (all p < 0.05).

Conclusions

We constructed and validated a nomogram to predict the risk of PCSM at 10 yr among men with PCa BCR after radical prostatectomy. The nomogram may be used for patient counseling and the design of clinical trials for PCa.

Patient Summary

For men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy, we have developed a model to predict the long-term risk of death from prostate cancer.

### Incidence and prognostic implications of prostate-specific antigen persistence and relapse after radical prostatectomy: population-based study [^1113dLNj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk of death after PSA persistence and relapse

The 10-year risk of PCa death ranged from 12% (95% CI = 10% to 13%) in men with PSA persistence to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.8% to 2.9%) in men with low-risk relapse, whereas the risk of death from other causes ranged from 11% (95% CI = 9.0% to 12%) to 16% (95% CI = 14% to 19%), respectively (Figure 3). In men with high-risk PSA relapse, risk of PCa death was higher (21%) after a relapse within 2 years compared with a relapse after 2–5 years (8.9%). No man in our study with a relapse more than 5 years after RP died of PCa during follow-up (Figure 4).

Stacked cumulative incidence proportion of death from prostate cancer and other causes in in 758 men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence and 1455 men who experienced PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy stratified by relapse risk groups (high-risk and low-risk) and life expectancy (computed from age and comorbidity).

Figure 4.
Stacked cumulative incidence proportion of death from prostate cancer and other causes in 1455 men who experienced relapse after radical prostatectomy (RP) stratified according to the time to relapse from RP. PSA = prostate-specific antigen.

Sensitivity analysis using a higher PSA cutoff

Among men who had PSA relapse based on the definition of 2 PSA values above 0.10 ng/mL, 756 (52%) also met the criteria for relapse using the stricter definition of 2 PSA values above 0.20 ng/mL. Using the 0.20 ng/mL definition, treatment patterns and the risk of PCa death after relapse were consistent with those observed using the 0.10 ng/mL definition (Figure S4).

### Long-term outcome of detectable PSA levels after radical prostatectomy [^1127Kcq9]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Detectable prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA) following radical prostatectomy (RP) are believed to represent treatment failure. In this retrospective review, we characterize long-term PSA outcomes following RP (n = 204) in a non-referral hospital performed between 1984 and 1994. With an average follow-up of 10 y, 90 (44%) patients developed a PSA recurrence: 15 (17%) died of prostate cancer despite hormonal intervention, 39 (43%) responded to hormonal therapy with stable remission and 36 (40%) were observed without intervention. Following RP many patients may have a detectable PSA that does not require treatment. PSA doubling time (< 12 months) was the best predictor of disease progression.

### The contemporary management of prostate cancer [^111HrcAJ]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Relapse after radical treatment

The PSA level that defines biochemical failure depends on the primary treatment. After radical prostatectomy, the PSA level that best predicts metastases is > 0.4 ng/mL, but the most widely accepted definition of biochemical relapse is PSA > 0.2 ng/mL or two consecutive rises. After radiotherapy, the definition of PSA failure is an increase > 2 ng/mL above nadir (the lowest PSA after treatment). The yield of conventional imaging is low in asymptomatic patients. The probability of a positive result on a bone scan is < 5% at a PSA level < 7 ng/mL. Therefore, conventional imaging is not recommended for restaging. PSMA‐PET CT has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and rates of detection for failures in the prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, and the whole body.

A positive scan depends on the PSA level: 33% at < 0.2 ng/mL, 45% at 0.2–0.49 ng/mL, 59% at 0.5–0.99 ng/mL, 75% at 1.0–1.99 ng/mL, and 95% at 2 ng/mL. This can help localize the site of recurrence/metastases and lead to a change in the proposed plan of treatment.

The natural history of relapsed disease is long, and life expectancy and quality of life are important parameters to consider when deciding whether to pursue local treatment. Indeed, while biochemical relapse‐based end points are prognostic, these are not surrogate end points for OS. Local treatments include salvage prostatectomy, cryoablation, high‐intensity focused ultrasound, re‐irradiation with external‐beam or brachytherapy, which can provide temporary biochemical control in most patients but have important morbidity considerations. For this reason, local recurrence after radiotherapy should be confirmed by imaging (MRI and/or PET PSMA) and biopsy if imaging is suspicious for local recurrence. ADT is usually initiated on development of symptoms or metastases or with a PSA doubling time less than six months. Delayed and intermittent ADT is preferred for most patients because early ADT does not improve survival. Enzalutamide in combination with ADT improves MFS compared with ADT alone for high‐risk biochemical recurrences with a PSA doubling time less than nine months, whereas enzalutamide monotherapy may be an option for those struggling with adverse effects of ADT.

### Defining prostate specific antigen progression after radical prostatectomy: what is the most appropriate cut point? [^115SFsfc]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The most appropriate definition of biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy is uncertain. We analyzed the effect of using various prostate specific antigen (PSA) end point definitions for defining biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy and attempted to determine the best PSA cut point to use. Aspects of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) definition of biochemical failure after radiation therapy are also analyzed in our radical prostatectomy cases.

Materials and Methods

A total of 2,782 men with clinically localized prostate cancer (cT1-T2) who had undergone radical prostatectomy between 1987 and 1993 were reviewed. All patients had regular PSA determinations from surgery through followup. Analysis was limited to patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment within 90 days of radical prostatectomy. Biochemical, PSA progression-free percent after radical prostatectomy was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method using several PSA cut points, including 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 ng./ml. or greater, as well as 0.4 ng./ml. or greater and increasing. Progression-free percent was also assessed using the ASTRO definition, which is 3 increases in PSA. To determine which PSA level was most appropriate to define progression after radical prostatectomy, the percentage of patients with a continued PSA increase after reaching each cut point was determined. The relationship between the maximum PSA within 3 years of surgery and subsequent development of clinical disease was also assessed.

Results

Progression-free percent was dependent on the PSA cut point used. Biochemical progression-free percentages for cut points 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 ng./ml. or greater were 62%, 72%, 76% and 78% at 5 years, and 43%, 54%, 59% and 61% at 10 years, respectively. A subsequent increase in PSA was noted in 49%, 62% and 72% of patients who had PSA 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 ng./ml., respectively. Subsequent clinical progression (local or systemic) was directly related to the maximum PSA attained within 3 years of radical prostatectomy (p = 0.0001). Progression-free percent for definitions requiring multiple increases in PSA were dependent on when the event was said to occur. Backdating of events at or before the first PSA (ASTRO definition) resulted in poorer, short-term progression-free percent (78% at 5 years), with little apparent likelihood of long-term failure (78% at 10 years). Coding the event at the last PSA increase when all event criteria had been met resulted in more realistic progression-free percent estimates (85% at 5 and 59% at 10 years).

Conclusions

Biochemical, PSA progression rates vary markedly depending on the method used to define PSA failure. Methods that require multiple increasing PSA values, for example the ASTRO definition, give misleading results, especially if the event time is backdated. Standards for defining PSA progression would allow more consistent and comparable progression estimates after radical prostatectomy. PSA 0.4 ng./ml. or greater may be the most appropriate cut point to use since a significant number of patients with lower PSA do not have a continued increase in it.

### Optimal definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy depends on pathologic risk factors: identifying candidates for early salvage therapy [^116Lsxx6]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) thresholds (< 0.2 ng/ml) below currently accepted biochemical recurrence (BCR) definitions for patients treated with radical prostatectomy may be useful in the identification of candidates for early salvage therapy with improved outcome; however, the practice risks overtreatment, as the risk of subsequent PSA progression may be low.

Objective

To analyze 14 BCR definitions for their association with subsequent PSA and treatment progression among subgroups of patients at varying risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The subsequent risk of PSA and treatment progression after BCR based on 14 BCR definitions (six standard definitions and eight definitions requiring one or more successive PSA rises ≤ 0.1 ng/ml) was analyzed according to various clinicopathologic risk criteria among 2348 patients with a detectable PSA ≥ 0.03 ng/ml at least 6 wk after radical prostatectomy.

Intervention

Radical prostatectomy.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Probability of subsequent PSA progression after BCR, defined as a PSA rise > 0.1 ng/ml above BCR PSA, initiation of secondary treatment, or clinical progression.

Results and Limitations

Using standard BCR definitions, the risk of PSA progression was > 70%, regardless of clinicopathologic features. A single PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml was associated with PSA progression in only 30–55% of patients but ranged from 18–25% to 73–88% for patients without and with adverse pathologic features, respectively. Based on discrimination and calibration analysis, the optimal BCR definition for patients with 5-yr progression-free probability of < 50%, 50–75%, 76–90%, and > 90% was a single PSA ≥ 0.05 ng/ml, two or more rising PSAs ≥ 0.05 ng/ml, PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml and rising, and PSA ≥ 0.4 ng/ml and rising.

Conclusions

BCR definitions below currently accepted PSA thresholds appear to be valid for selecting patients with adverse clinicopathologic risk factors for secondary therapy. This information may be useful in selecting for early salvage radiotherapy to improve clinical outcome.

### The use of early postoperative prostate-specific antigen to stratify risk in patients with positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy [^112oeNPf]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although radical prostatectomy provides excellent control for localized prostate cancer, pathologic examination of approximately one-third of specimens will reveal positive surgical margins (PSM). Numerous studies report that the presence of PSM adversely affects cancer specific outcomes and considerably increases the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). However, the optimum management of patients with PSM remains controversial.

Evidence from randomized trials suggests that immediate radiotherapy after the surgery, rather than watchful waiting, is more appropriate for the patient with pathologically advanced disease because it can improve cancer-specific and overall survival. Despite the fact that the most contemporary guidelines do not uniformly recommend adjuvant therapy for patients with adverse pathologic characteristics at radical prostatectomy, it has been shown that in daily clinical practice the patients with PSM were significantly more likely to receive immediate adjuvant treatment.

But not all of the patients with PSM develop BCR and the policy of adjuvant radiotherapy could result in considerable over-treatment. Therefore correct identification of those patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant management is of paramount importance. However, attempts to improve early staging after the surgery already hint at several difficulties. The ability of imaging modalities remains limited. The impact of PSM-associated variables (location, focality, length and Gleason score at the margin) on clinical decision making was not clearly established yet. Even routine use of frozen section on all cases has not fulfilled its expectation to provide effective control of surgical margin status.

Postoperative PSA measurements are generally performed 3 months after the surgery, although a significant decline in PSA may be detectable much earlier. Results from several studies indicate that intensive monitoring of PSA changes early after radical prostatectomy may provide clinically useful information, which facilitates identification of surgical failure. Moreover, recently introduced ultrasensitive PSA detection techniques are offering a new insight into the changes in serum PSA at very low concentration. It has been demonstrated that after a properly performed radical prostatectomy, measurable PSA is most likely attributed to the presence of active prostate cancer cells rather than to retained benign prostatic tissue. It is therefore conceivable, that real candidates for immediate adjuvant therapy, who have active prostate cancer cells remaining in the body after the surgery, should present with higher postoperative serum PSA in a comparison to individuals with incorrect diagnosis of PSM.

This hypothesis prompted us to evaluate the ability of early postoperative ultrasensitive PSA levels to reduce the overtreatment rate by further stratification of potential candidates for immediate adjuvant radiotherapy.

### Prostate-specific antigen level at the time of salvage therapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and the risk of death [^113dscPP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

Both the performance characteristics of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography and insurance approval improves with increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level causing some physicians to delay post-radical prostatectomy salvage radiation therapy (sRT) after PSA failure. Yet, it is unknown for men with at most one high-risk factor (ie, pT3/4 or prostatectomy [p] Gleason score 8–10) whether a PSA level exists above which initiating sRT is associated with increased all-cause mortality (ACM)-risk and was investigated.

METHODS

Using a multinational database of 25,551 patients with pT2–4N0 or NXM0 prostate cancer, multivariable Cox regression analysis evaluated whether an association with a significant increase in ACM-risk existed when sRT was delivered above a prespecified PSA level beginning at 0.10 ng/mL and in 0.05 increments up to 0.50 ng/mL versus at or below that level. The model was adjusted for age at and year of radical prostatectomy, established prostate cancer prognostic factors, institution, and the time-dependent use of androgen deprivation therapy.

RESULTS

After a median follow-up of 6.00 years, patients who received sRT at a PSA level > 0.25 ng/mL had a significantly higher ACM-risk (AHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.00; p = 0.008) compared with men who received sRT when the PSA was ≤ 0.25 mg/mL. This elevated ACM-risk remained significant for all PSA cutpoints up to 0.50 ng/mL but was not significant at PSA cutpoint values below 0.25 ng/mL.

CONCLUSION

Among patients with at most one high-risk factor, initiating sRT above a PSA level of 0.25 ng/mL was associated with increased ACM-risk.

### When to consider a PSMA PET scan after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiation for prostate cancer… [^1151yvCE]. ASCO Daily News (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points:

- There is no consensus as to the optimal prostate-specific antigen level at which to consider obtaining a prostate-specific membrane antigen PET scan after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiation.
- At present, we recommend seeking a PSMA PET scan for most patients at PSA 0. 5 to
0. 9 ng/mL; for patients eligible to receive metastasis-directed therapy, we recommend considering PSMA PET at PSA 0. 2 to
0. 5 ng/mL, with special consideration if PSA doubling time < 3 months. BCR is defined as a PSA ≥ 0. 2 ng/mL at least twice after RP per the American Urological Association, or as a PSA ≥
2. 0 ng/mL above a PSA nadir post–primary salvage radiation per the Phoenix definition. 3, 4 In patients with rising PSA after both RP and salvage radiation, there is no consensus definition of BCR. Because there should be no residual prostate tissue, the American Urological Association definition of PSA ≥ 0. 2 can be used.

PSMA PET Scan Recommendation for Most Patients Detection rates of prostate cancer on a PSMA PET scan increase with higher PSA values. In a prospective single-arm trial of 635 men with BCR after radical prostatectomy, primary radiation, or both who underwent Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET, the overall detection rate was 75% at a median PSA of 2. 1 ng/mL. 5 Detection rates were 38%, 57%, 84%, 86%, and 97%. 5 Improved detection rates with higher PSA levels were similar to those reported in another single-cohort study. 6 Detection rates in patients who underwent both radical prostatectomy and salvage radiation were not shown in both studies. After radical prostatectomy and salvage radiation, a PSA of 0. 5 to
0.

9 ng/mL is a reasonable range for which to obtain a PSMA PET scan, as a majority of patients will have detectable disease, and oligometastatic disease suitable for MDT can be identified.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline (2023) [^116cDNHp]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Biochemical recurrence without metastatic disease after exhaustion of local treatment options — clinicians should inform patients with PSA recurrence after exhaustion of local therapy regarding the risk of developing metastatic disease and follow such patients with serial PSA measurements and clinical evaluation. Clinicians may consider radiographic assessments based on overall PSA and PSA kinetics. (Clinical Principle) In the hormone-sensitive setting, PSA recurrence almost always precedes clinical detection of metastases. For patients with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy, International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade group 4/5 (Gleason ≥ 8) or PSADT ≤ 1 year were considered high-risk for development of metastases and death, and for patients with PSA recurrence after prostate radiation, those with biopsy ISUP grade group 4/5 (Gleason ≥ 8) and/or those with ≤ 18 months to PSA failure are at highest risk; patients who do not meet one of the criteria above are considered lower risk of developing clinical metastases.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk [^112DdUeK]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

A persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PC) is associated with a worse prognosis compared with achieving an undetectable PSA level. While 1.5 to 2.0 months following RP is considered an acceptable interval to assess for persistent PSA, it may be too short to allow for clearance of the PSA from the serum, particularly at higher pre-RP PSA levels. If true, then patients with a higher compared with a lower pre-RP level could have a more favorable prognosis than would be expected and may experience overtreatment when offered post-RP therapy for presumed persistent PSA before the time when an undetectable PSA level could be reached. In addition, it is unknown whether an increasing persistent PSA level portends a worse prognosis Therefore, we used 2 academic center databases to test and validate whether a persistent PSA assessed at approximately 2 months post-RP in patients with pre-RP PSA value greater than 20 ng/mL (to convert to ug/L, multiply by 1) compared with 20 ng/mL or less would be significantly associated with a lower PC-specific mortality (PCSM) risk and all-cause mortality (ACM) risk. We also investigated whether an increasing persistent PSA level would be significantly associated with a higher PCSM and ACM risk. For both questions, we adjusted for known PC prognostic factors, age at RP, year of RP, and the time-dependent use of post-RP therapy, including radiation therapy (RT) and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

### Biochemical recurrence without PSA progression characterizes a subset of patients after radical prostatectomy. prostate-specific antigen [^111jxix8]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize a subset of patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy but with little, if any, subsequent rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and no clinical progression during long-term follow-up.

Methods

Of a series of 600 patients, 158 with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy were examined. We identified a subset with measurable serum PSA levels during long-term follow-up, but with very low PSA velocity and no clinical recurrence. Serum PSA was measured with the ultrasensitive TOSOH assay with a PSA recurrence defined as a serum PSA of 0.07 ng/mL or greater.

Results

We identified 14 patients (8.8% of biochemical recurrences) with a detectable serum PSA level after radical prostatectomy yet without clinical or PSA progression at a mean follow-up after radical prostatectomy of 10.3 years. The mean time to PSA recurrence was 5.8 years, and the mean PSA velocity after recurrence was 0.028 ng/mL/yr. No clinical or pathologic features were found that could be used to identify this subset of patients.

Conclusions

A subset of patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy will not exhibit a progressive rise in serum PSA or clinical progression at 10 years follow-up. This suggests that serum PSA kinetics should be observed after biochemical recurrence before adjuvant hormonal therapy or radiotherapy.

### Assessing and treating patients with increasing prostate specific antigen following radical prostatectomy [^113ZxfFs]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

In patients who undergo local treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer evidence of increasing serum prostate specific antigen usually antedates the development of clinically evident metastasis by many years. Prostate specific antigen is used to guide subsequent salvage strategies, such as postoperative radiotherapy, androgen ablation or active surveillance with delayed intervention. We discuss options for management in patients who have increasing prostate specific antigen after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and Methods

The current status of treatment approaches was reviewed to provide an update on frequently used management strategies.

Results

Increasing prostate specific antigen values of 0.2 to 0.4 ng/ml are used to indicate recurrent disease after surgery. Restaging is recommended to determine whether metastatic disease can be detected, although many patients with low prostate specific antigen values will have no detectable metastases. Local therapy should be used for select patients in the absence of metastases but the results are most satisfactory for relatively slowly increasing prostate specific antigen with values below 1.0 ng/ml and lower Gleason score neoplasms because these tumors are more likely to have localized recurrences.

Conclusions

Current knowledge about patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy is primarily related to their natural history. Although approximately 70% of these patients are unlikely to die of the disease, they remain at risk for the development of metastasis and disease related morbidity. Currently no general consensus exists regarding standard systemic treatment approaches for these patients and inclusion in clinical trials remains the most important priority.

### Parameters for treatment decisions for salvage radiation therapy [^112BjXP1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the most common primary treatment for prostate cancer. About 40% of those with high-risk pathologic features, such as a positive margin or seminal vesicle involvement, will develop biochemical failure at some point in the future. Radiotherapy (RT), with or without concurrent androgen deprivation, has been used liberally in the management of men with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RP, based mostly on relatively small retrospective series. Factors such as the prostatectomy Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, absolute pre-RT PSA level, and pre-RT PSA doubling time are emerging as important determinants of outcome after RT. These factors should be used as a guide to the options of local therapy alone (RT), local therapy plus systemic therapy (typically androgen deprivation therapy), and systemic therapy alone.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk [^113TWAq1]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Some results deserve further discussion. First, the shorter distribution of times to an undetectable PSA in observed patients with PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less may be explained by the shorter time intervals from RP to PSA assessments in patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL. Second, higher PCSM estimates 8 years after RP were observed in patients who did not receive post-RP therapy and had a persistent PSA post-RP and a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less, which should have led to a worse prognosis in patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL but the opposite was observed. This reversal of outcome may be explained by a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less who were going to achieve an undetectable PSA if observed for a longer period before initiating post-RP therapy. Third, as noted in Table 3, there was a significant association between an increased PCSM risk and ACM risk in patients with a persistent PSA compared with undetectable PSA after RP when the pre-RP PSA was 20 ng/mL or less but not when the pre-RP PSA was greater than 20 ng/mL, where only PCSM risk was significantly increased and to a lesser extent compared with patients with a pre-RP PSA of 20 ng/mL or less, with aHRs of 3.47 (95% CI, 1.54–7.85) vs 6.67 (95% CI, 3.67–12.15), respectively. The smaller increase in the aHR for PCSM risk is consistent with a higher proportion of patients with a persistent PSA and a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less who may have achieved an undetectable PSA given longer follow-up before initiating post-RP therapy for presumed persistent PSA. Given the smaller aHR for PCSM risk, translation into a significant increase in ACM risk may not have been possible given the competing risks for mortality in this patient population. Finally, the time-dependent use of RT following RP in patients with an undetectable PSA level was associated with a significantly reduced ACM risk but not PCSM risk. An explanation for this result could be the selection of healthier patients for adjuvant RT, and given the undetectable PSA level, many of these patients may have been cured following RP and were not at risk for PCSM but lived longer based on better overall health.

### Undetectable ultrasensitive PSA after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer predicts relapse-free survival [^1148oMVM]. British Journal of Cancer (2000). Low credibility.

Radical retropubic prostatectomy is considered by many centres to be the treatment of choice for men aged less than 70 years with localized prostate cancer. A rise in serum prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy occurs in 10–40% of cases. This study evaluates the usefulness of novel ultrasensitive PSA assays in the early detection of biochemical relapse. 200 patients of mean age 61. 2 years underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. Levels ≤ 0.01 ng ml-1 were considered undetectable. Mean pre-operative prostate-specific antigen was 13.3 ng ml-1. Biochemical relapse was defined as 3 consecutive rises. The 2-year biochemical disease-free survival for the 134 patients with evaluable prostate-specific antigen nadir data was 61.1% (95% CI: 51.6–70.6%). Only 2 patients with an undetectable prostate-specific antigen after radical retropubic prostatectomy biochemically relapsed (3%), compared to 47 relapses out of 61 patients (75%) who did not reach this level. Cox multivariate analysis confirms prostate-specific antigen nadir ≤ 0.01 ng ml-1 to be a superb independent variable predicting a favourable biochemical disease-free survival (P < 0.0001). Early diagnosis of biochemical relapse is feasible with sensitive prostate-specific antigen assays. These assays more accurately measure the prostate-specific antigen nadir, which is an excellent predictor of biochemical disease-free survival. Thus, sensitive prostate-specific antigen assays offer accurate prognostic information and expedite decision-making regarding the use of salvage prostate-bed radiotherapy or hormone therapy.

Only 2 patients with an undetectable prostate-specific antigen after radical retropubic prostatectomy biochemically relapsed (3%), compared to 47 relapses out of 61 patients (75%) who did not reach this level. Cox multivariate analysis confirms prostate-specific antigen nadir ≤ 0.01 ng ml–1 to be a superb independent variable predicting a favourable biochemical disease-free survival (P < 0.0001). Early diagnosis of biochemical relapse is feasible with sensitive prostate-specific antigen assays. These assays more accurately measure the prostate-specific antigen nadir, which is an excellent predictor of biochemical disease-free survival. Thus, sensitive prostate-specific antigen assays offer accurate prognostic information and expedite decision-making regarding the use of salvage prostate-bed radiotherapy or hormone therapy. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign

### The use of early postoperative prostate-specific antigen to stratify risk in patients with positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy [^1124gHrM]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is well recognized that the presence of positive surgical margins (PSM) after radical prostatectomy (RP) adversely affects cancer specific outcomes and recent evidence from randomized trials supports the use of adjuvant radiotherapy in these cases. However, not all of the patients with PSM develop disease recurrence and the policy of adjuvant radiation could result in considerable over-treatment. We investigated the ability of early postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) and PSA decline rates to stratify the risk of disease progression during the first weeks after the surgery thereby allowing adequate time for planning eventual adjuvant therapy.

Methods

We studied 116 consecutive patients with the finding of PSM after RP for localized prostate cancer between 2001 and 2012. No patients were treated with radiation or hormonal therapy. An intensive postoperative PSA monitoring using ultrasensitive assay started first at day 14 after the surgery, then at day 30, 60, 90 and 180, and subsequently in 3 monthly intervals. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) presented the failure of surgical treatment and it was defined as PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml. The ability of PSA decline parameters to predict BCR was assessed using Cox regression model and area under the curve (AUC) calculation.

Results

Overall 55 (47%) patients experienced BCR during median follow-up of 31.4 months (range 6–69). Preoperative PSA, pathologic Gleason sum and pathologic grade failed to reveal any association with observation of BCR. Postoperative PSA levels achieved significant predictive accuracy already on day 30 (AUC 0.74). PSA > 0.073 ng/ml at day 30 increased significantly the risk of BCR (HR 4.35, p < 0.001). Predictive accuracy was significantly exceeded on day 60 (AUC 0.84; p < 0.001), while further enhancements on day 90 (AUC 0.84) and 180 (AUC 0.91) were not significant.

Conclusions

The level of ultrasensitive PSA yields valuable information about the prostatectomy outcome already at the first month after the surgery and should aid risk stratification in patients with PSM. Patients not likely to experience subsequent disease progression may be spared the toxicity of immediate adjuvant radiotherapy.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy: Patients with BCR fall into three groups, including those with persistent PSA, those with PSA recurrence defined by increases on two or more subsequent laboratory determinations after an initially undetectable PSA, and those with persistent but low PSA from slow metabolism or benign tissue. Consensus has not defined a threshold PSA level that is truly "undetectable". Group 3 does not require further evaluation until PSA increases, whereas groups 1 and 2 require a workup that includes evaluation for distant metastases.

### Prostate-specific antigen level at the time of salvage therapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and the risk of death [^111r4k7f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several points deserve further consideration. First, although PSMA-PET has been shown to change the RT management of men in post-RP salvage setting, prospectively acquired randomized evidence as to whether these changes in management affect cancer control outcomes is not yet available but is being addressed in a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). The specific question being addressed in that RCT is whether information provided by the PSMA-PET versus conventional imaging post-RP and obtained when the PSA level is > 0.10 ng/mL can improve PSA failure-free survival at 5 years because of changes in management based solely on the PSMA-PET findings. This study is important because the random assignment should provide balance in both known and unknown prognostic factors across imaging arms, and moreover, the results will enable us to discern whether management changes on the basis of the PSMA-PET scan affect a relevant cancer control end point. Second, in the current study in addition to adjusting for age and known PC prognostic factors, we also adjusted for the time-dependent use and duration of ADT. This is particularly important given that the use of ADT and its duration in the post-RP setting has been shown in two prospective randomized trials, to be associated with the reduction of metastasis-free survival and in addition prolongation in overall survival in one study. Third, during the conduct of the study, there were advances in the postoperative PSA assay to ultrasensitive, variability in Gleason Score assignment even among experienced pathologists and improvements in survival in patients with PC. Therefore, we added the year of RP as a covariate to the model to adjust for changes that happened over the study period, at least in part, if not fully such as improved survival in patients with PC due to treatment advances and/or biologic evolution as well as reclassification of the Gleason scores from 6 to 7 or higher after the changes in the Gleason grading system adopted in 2005 by the International Society of Urologic Pathology. These factors would lead to a reduced risk of ACM later in the study as compared with earlier, and this is reflected in the adjustment for increasing year of RP in the model where the AHR of 0.97 was significant reflecting a 3% reduction in ACM-risk with each advancing year when the RP was performed. Although the use of the ultrasensitive PSA after RP began during the conduct of the study, our finding of an increased ACM-risk when initiating sRT at a PSA cutpoint > 0.25 ng/mL versus 0.25 ng/mL or less should not have been affected by the ultrasensitive PSA assay that measure PSA levels as low as 0.01 ng/mL given that the PSA levels that were measurable at the start of our study were 0.20 ng/mL or higher. Fourth, in the Radiotherapy and Androgen deprivation after local surgery-RT randomized trialwhich could not establish superiority of adjuvant to early post-RP sRT with respect to disease-free survival, the median (IQR) PSA level at the start of early sRT was 0.20 ng/mL [0.10–0.30] meaning that 50% of the men enrolled on that study had sRT initiated at a PSA level ≤ 0.20 ng/mL. Our results are consistent with this finding in that in our patient population where men could have at most one high-risk factor (ie, pGleason score 8–10 or pT3/4), we found no significant difference in ACM-risk for the use of aRT compared with sRT delivered when the PSA level was ≤ 0.25 ng/mL. Finally, although only a prospective RCT enrolling patients with at least one high-risk factor and randomly assigning them to initiating sRT when the PSA level after RP is > 0.25 ng/mL versus ≤ 0.25 ng/mL can establish causality between delivering sRT when the PSA level is > 0.25 ng/mL and an increased ACM-risk, such a trial is currently not ongoing or planned.

### Biochemical recurrence and risk of mortality following radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy [^116qRZ3r]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, we validated EAU-BCR risk grouping and confirmed that male patients with low-risk BCR after radical prostatectomy might consider undergoing immediate salvage treatment. However, we found that while the probability of BCR was significantly higher after radical prostatectomy, the risk of dying from prostate cancer was higher after radiotherapy. This difference between the number of patients with defined disease recurrence and the risk for PCSM highlights 3 main concepts. First, BCR, as currently defined, is not a reliable estimator for PCSM and should not be used to compare treatment modalities. Second, patients with low-risk BCR, as per EAU definition, after radiotherapy have a relatively high risk of prostate cancer death, indicating the need for more stringent criteria. Third, risk stratification of patients with BCR is pivotal to guide salvage treatment decisions, reduce overtreatment, and limit the number of staging tests in the event of PSA elevations after primary treatment.

### Incidence and prognostic implications of prostate-specific antigen persistence and relapse after radical prostatectomy: population-based study [^1149co5P]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

PSA doubling time and time to relapse

Several different algorithms are in use to calculate PSA doubling time, and they all require multiple PSA values. In contrast, time to relapse is easy to determine, and this was a strong predictor of risk of PCa death in our study. Men with early relapse (< 2 years) had a substantially higher risk of PCa death compared with men with late relapse (> 5 years), especially within the high-risk relapse group.

Life expectancy and risk of death from other causes

Men with PSA persistence had similar risk of death of PCa and of other causes, whereas men with high-risk relapse had a 2-fold higher risk of death from other causes than from PCa and men with a low-risk relapse had an 8-fold higher risk of death from other causes. The difference varied according to life expectancy. Given the substantial risk of death from other causes and risk of adverse of treatment for both radiotherapy and ADT, treatment decisions at PSA persistence or relapse should also account for life expectancy in order to avoid overtreatment of men who have little to gain from intervention. Therefore, treatment at date of PSA relapse is rarely warranted in men with low-risk relapse, a relapse a long time after surgery, and/or a short life expectancy.

Generalizability

We argue that the results on incidence and prognostic implications of PSA persistence and relapse after RP from our population-based study of men who underwent RP are likely to be representative also for other countries in which similar treatment guidelines are implemented.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in this large population-based study it was estimated that one-third of men who underwent RP would have PSA persistence or relapse within 10 years from RP. There was a wide range in risk of PCa death after persistence or relapse according to cancer characteristics and time to relapse. Additionally, the risk of death from other causes was substantial. These factors, along with life expectancy, should inform treatment decisions for men with PSA persistence or relapse.

Characterization of Persistent PSA, Time to an Undetectable PSA, and Distribution and Timing of Post-RP Therapies by Pre-RP PSA Level

Of 30 461 patients included in the discovery cohort, the median (IQR) age was 64 (59–68) years; of 12 837 patients included in the validation cohort, the median (IQR) age was 59 (54–64) years. As shown in Table 1, of the 30 461 patients in the discovery cohort, 1418 (4.7%) were observed to have a persistent PSA (0.10 ng/mL or greater) at a median (IQR) time from RP to first PSA assessment of 2.17 (1.45–3.02) months. In the validation cohort, 320 (2.5%) had persistent PSA, and 850 (6.6%) died at a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.00 (2.00–12.00) years. As shown in Table 1, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less with a persistent PSA at initial assessment (446 of 3189 [14.0%] vs 972 of 27 272 [3.6%]; P < .001) and a higher median (IQR) persistent PSA level (0.65 [0.22–2.04] ng/mL vs 0.30 [0.12–1.00] ng/mL; P < .001). Among patients with a PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less, the post-RP PSA values were assessed sooner, with a first assessment following RP at a median (IQR) of 2.00 (1.41–2.99) months and 2.23 (1.45–3.06) months, respectively, and a second assessment at 2.25 (0.79–3.99) months and 2.30 (0.92–4.01) months later. There was more frequent and a shorter median time to post-RP RT plus ADT or ADT use in patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL (244 of 446 [54.7%] at a median [IQR] of 2.68 [1.51–4.40] months) vs 20 ng/mL or less (338 of 972 [34.8%] at a median [IQR] of 3.30 [2.00–5.39] months). These median treatment times were shorter than the median (IQR) times to an undetectable PSA level in patients observed for 6 months after RP (median [IQR] of 2.96 [1.84–3.29] months vs 3.37 [2.35–4.09] months, respectively). Also, there was a smaller proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or less and a persistent PSA post-RP who did not receive post-RP therapy (39 of 446 [8.7%] vs 192 of 972 [19.8%]). However, a higher proportion were observed to experience PCSM, with 8-year adjusted estimates of 13.1% (95% CI, 3.1–47.0) and 5.2% (95% CI, 2.0–13.2), respectively.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — prognostic factors for outcomes after salvage radiation: A large retrospective review of 501 patients who received radiation for detectable and increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy found predictors of progression to include Gleason score 8 to 10, pre-EBRT PSA level > 2 ng/mL, seminal vesicle invasion, negative surgical margins, and PSA doubling time (PSADT) ≤ 10 months. Prediction of systemic disease versus local recurrence for individual patients using clinical and pathologic criteria has proven unfeasible, and adjuvant or post-recurrence EBRT is both therapeutic and diagnostic because a PSA response indicates local persistence/recurrence.

### The relative importance of anatomic and PSA factors to outcomes after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer [^111QheT3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We report on how anatomic pathology observations and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) observations made before and just after radical prostatectomy relate to subsequent outcomes in men with prostate cancer. Our study patients consisted of more than 200 men who underwent radical prostatectomy and who had a mean follow-up of more than 6 years. We found that there were 2 categories of failures after surgery — one consisting of an eventual elevated PSA level and the other consisting of an early death from progressive tumor — and that these 2 failures related differently to PSA and anatomic pathology observations made at the time of prostatectomy. Whereas preoperative and postoperative levels of PSA related most closely to PSA failure, Gleason grade 5 and the percentage carcinoma related most closely to early death. Our results suggest how men could be sorted into 3 prognostic categories after surgery: one with high hazard for early death, a second with low hazard for early death but with high probability for eventual elevated PSA level, and a third with overall good prognosis.

### PSA progression following radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy: new standards in the new millennium [^111xpJfs]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression following radical treatments of clinically localized prostate cancer is a common problem facing both the patient and the urologist. Not all patients with relapsing disease have an equal risk of death due to prostate cancer. After surgery, biochemical failure can be defined as persisting detectable levels of PSA after radical prostatectomy or a PSA rise after a period of normalization. On the other hand, definitions of PSA progression after radiation therapy vary and no clear consensus can be found. This review of the recent international literature updates the knowledge about the diagnostic procedures used in relapsing patients. Predictors of progression are precised leading to a better patient selection, based on currently available tables and nomograms. Indeed, identification of high risk patients may allow a more appropriate treatment decision. After radical treatment, the analysis of time to recurrence, PSA doubling time, PSA kinetics combined to modern imaging techniques such as 111In capromab penditide scan may allow a better identification of the recurrence site. Thus, an optimal treatment strategy may be envisaged such as local irradiation, salvage surgery, hormone therapy or combinations for which indications and results are provided. Alternative options such as cryotherapy still need further investigation. At last, the use of artificial neural networks will certainly enhance the selection of patients submitted to radical treatments as well as the selection of relapsing patients to allow a more appropriate adjuvant therapy.

### Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure [^115Hjubv]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

BCR is the most clinically used endpoint for identification of treatment failure. Approximately 15% to 53% of patients undergoing primary curative therapy will develop BCR. BCR often precedes clinically detectable recurrence by years. It does not necessarily translate directly into PCa morbidity and mortality, nor does it always reflect the desired endpoint. Furthermore, it has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint, in that interventions that have been shown to alter the PSA level have not been shown to also alter survival. The utility of PSA level as a surrogate endpoint is brought into question by the knowledge that the overall survival rate of patients at 10 years is similar in patients with and without BCR, and that in a significant proportion of men, the only evidence of disease during their lifetime will be a detectable PSA level. The likelihood of developing BCR post-therapy can be predicted by using multiple clinical and pathologic variables. With the development of nomograms that incorporate several markers, the accuracy of prediction has improved. Until recently, the natural history of BCR post-RRP has not been well understood. Pound et al showed the heterogenous and prolonged natural history of BCR. In this large series of men with BCR following RRP, only 34% of men developed metastatic disease. The median time from development of BCR to identification of metastases was 8 years, and the median time from the development of metastatic disease to death was just under 5 years. These data highlight the extremely variable and potentially indolent nature of BCR. The risk of metastatic disease following BCR has been relatively well defined and relates to PSADT and time to PSA recurrence. It generally is accepted that a PSADT of less than 6 to 10 months and a time to PSA recurrence of less than 1 to 2 years relates to a higher risk of developing metastatic disease. Local recurrence, however, remains poorly understood with respect to its true incidence, clinical significance, and natural history. The significance of BCR post-RT remains unclear due to the lack of data on its natural history. Attempts have been made to identify patients at high risk for metastatic progression by looking at time to PSA recurrence and PSADT. A PSADT of less than 6 to 12 months and a time to PSA recurrence of less than 12 months reflects a higher risk of developing metastatic disease. Accurate risk stratification by means of an algorithm similar to that produced by Pound et al has not been performed on a large cohort, thus making risk assessment for an individual patient difficult. The major dilemma for clinicians in the management of BCR is the identification of the site of disease recurrence, which ultimately guides therapy decisions. Clinicopathologic features allow for risk stratification for recurrence, and multiple investigations have attempted to localize the site of recurrence. Time to biochemical progression, Gleason score, and PSADT are predictive of the probability and time to development of metastatic disease, and allow for stratification of patients into different risk groups (see Table 2). TRUS, CT, PET, and DRE all have limited utility in the identification of local recurrence. ProstaScint and MRI have demonstrated encouraging initial results: however, they require further investigation. Bone scintigraphy is of little value for the initial investigation of BCR. In patients with a PSA level of less than 10 ng/mL, the risk of having a positive bone scan is less than 1% and, until the PSA level rises above 40 ng/mL, the risk of having a positive bone scan is less than 5%. Therefore, bone scintigraphy should be reserved for patients with a PSA level greater than 10 to 20 ng/mL or patients with a rapidly rising PSA level. Using new MRI sequences, there is some evidence that MRI is better for the detection of bony metastatic disease; however, this technique requires further investigation. BCR causes anxiety for the patient and the treating doctor, because the best way to manage patients with PSA-only progression is unknown. Currently, there are no validated treatment recommendations for the management of BCR. The information in this review provides the framework for assignment of patients into clinical trials based on different risk categories. Patients at high risk for metastatic progression could be identified early and thus entered into appropriate clinical trials for systemic therapies. Similarly, patients with a low risk of progression could be placed into observation protocols, potentially sparing them from exhaustive and inappropriate investigations.

### Pattern of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure dictates the probability of a positive bone scan in patients with an increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy [^111PXaJW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Physicians often order periodic bone scans (BS) to check for metastases in patients with an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA; biochemical recurrence [BCR]) after radical prostatectomy (RP), but most scans are negative. We studied patient characteristics to build a predictive model for a positive scan.

Patients and Methods

From our prostate cancer database we identified all patients with detectable PSA after RP. We analyzed the following features at the time of each bone scan for association with a positive BS: preoperative PSA, time to BCR, pathologic findings of the RP, PSA before the BS (trigger PSA), PSA kinetics (PSA doubling time, PSA slope, and PSA velocity), and time from BCR to BS. The results were incorporated into a predictive model.

Results

There were 414 BS performed in 239 patients with BCR and no history of androgen deprivation therapy. Only 60 (14.5%) were positive for metastases. In univariate analysis, preoperative PSA (P = 0.04), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.02), PSA velocity (P < .001), and trigger PSA (P < .001) predicted a positive BS. In multivariate analysis, only PSA slope (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; p = 0.03), PSA velocity (OR, 0.93; p = 0.003), and trigger PSA (OR, 1.022; P < .001) predicted a positive BS. A nomogram for predicting the bone scan result was constructed with an overfit-corrected concordance index of 0.93.

Conclusion

Trigger PSA, PSA velocity, and slope were associated with a positive BS. A highly discriminating nomogram can be used to select patients according to their risk for a positive scan. Omitting scans in low-risk patients could reduce substantially the number of scans ordered.

### Defining the ideal cutpoint for determining PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy. prostate-specific antigen [^115rGyZ5]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the ideal cutpoint for defining prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP). Although various cutpoints have been used, a recent study suggested that 0.4 ng/mL may be the most appropriate.

Methods

A retrospective survey of 358 men undergoing RP at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1991 and 2001 was undertaken. The 3-year and 5-year risk of PSA recurrence was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses using various cutpoints of postoperative PSA to define recurrence: greater than 0.1, greater than 0.2, greater than 0.3, greater than 0.4, and greater than 0.5 ng/mL. The 1 and 3-year risk of PSA progression after a detectable PSA level (PSA rising to a higher cutpoint) was evaluated for each definition of PSA recurrence using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the clinical variables that were significant independent predictors of PSA recurrence at each cutpoint.

Results

For patients with a detectable postoperative PSA value from 0.11 to 0.2 ng/mL, the 1 and 3-year risk of PSA progression was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46% to 82%) and 93% (95% CI 74% to 99%), respectively. For patients with a PSA value from 0.21 to 0.3 ng/mL, the 1 and 3-year risk of PSA progression was 86% (95% CI 69% to 97%) and 100% (95% CI 87% to 100%), respectively. The use of higher PSA cutpoints to define recurrence resulted in a lower 5-year risk of PSA recurrence. The 5-year risk of PSA recurrence using a greater than 0.1 ng/mL cutpoint resulted in a 43% (95% CI 36% to 50%) risk of recurrence compared with only 23% (95% CI 18% to 30%) for a greater than 0.5 ng/mL cutpoint. In multivariate analysis, PSA and biopsy Gleason score were significant independent predictors of biochemical recurrence, regardless of the definition of PSA recurrence used (P ≤ 0.002).

Conclusions

PSA and biopsy Gleason score were significant predictors of biochemical failure, regardless of the definition of failure used. However, the definition of PSA recurrence dramatically affected the perceived success of therapy. Patients with a postoperative PSA value greater than 0.2 ng/mL are at very high risk of developing an additional rise in PSA. On the basis of this finding, a PSA value greater than 0.2 ng/mL is an appropriate cutpoint to define PSA recurrence after RP.

### Is there a role for chemotherapy in prostate cancer? [^113hrGBa]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

POSSIBLE ROLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY FOR LOCALISED PROSTATE CANCER

Mr Smith is a healthy 55-year-old male with a strong family history of prostate cancer. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum test was included as part of his annual medical examination. The PSA value was elevated at 22 μ g l −1 (normal: < 4 μ g l −1). Rectal ultrasound revealed a bulky nodular prostate staged clinically as T2b and subsequent biopsy showed a Gleason score of 4+4/10. Bone and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were negative for metastatic disease. After discussion with an urologist and a radiation oncologist, Mr Smith decided to proceed with radical prostatectomy. After searching the internet, he asks his doctors if use of hormones and/or chemotherapy would decrease the risk of recurrent disease.

Clinical and pathologic features including the serum level of PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage can be used to estimate the probability that a patient will develop recurrent disease after radical local therapy with surgery or radiation. These factors have been incorporated into nomograms. Using the Partin nomograms, Mr Smith has a risk of capsular penetration of about 28%, seminal vesicle involvement of 33% and lymph node involvement of 36%. He also has a substantial probability of positive margins after radical prostatectomy. According to the Kattan nomogram, Mr Smith has only a 20% (∓10%) probability of remaining free of disease at 5 years following radical prostatectomy. High rates of relapse are due both to local failure and to systemic failure secondary to the presence of micrometastatic disease. Thus, Mr Smith's question about adjuvant therapy is appropriate.

The goals of adjuvant therapy are to destroy residual local and micrometastatic disease, while tumour burden is low and patient performance status is good with the intent of curing the patient of the cancer. When adjuvant therapy is given before the primary treatment, it is referred to as neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant treatment might also decrease the incidence of positive margins in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and thereby increase local control.

### Defining biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a proposal for a standardized definition [^1144LCRU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) defined biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer is widely used for reporting the outcome of radical prostatectomy (RP). A standardized BCR definition is lacking, and overall progression-free probability and risk of subsequent metastatic disease progression may vary greatly depending on the PSA criterion used. Ten definitions of BCR were evaluated to identify the one that best explains metastatic progression.

Methods

Of 3,125 patients who underwent RP at our institution since 1985, 75 developed distant metastasis during a median follow-up of 49 months. To predict metastasis progression, we modeled the clinical information using multivariable Cox regression analysis. BCR was included in the model as a time-dependent covariate, and separate models were developed for each definition. A goodness-of-fit (R2) statistic was used to determine the Cox model (and thereby the BCR definition) that best explained metastatic progression.

Results

The 10-year progression-free probability ranged from 63% to 79%, depending on the BCR definition. The model containing BCR defined as a PSA of at least 0.4 ng/mL followed by another increase best explained metastatic progression (R2 = 0.21). This definition was also associated with a high probability of subsequent secondary therapy, continued PSA progression, and rapid PSA doubling time.

Conclusion

BCR defined as a PSA value of at least 0.4 ng/mL followed by another increase best explains the development of distant metastasis among 10 candidate definitions, after controlling for clinical variables and the use of secondary therapy. On the basis of this evidence, we propose that this definition be adopted as the standard for reporting the outcome of RP.

### Is radical prostatectomy the "gold standard" for localized prostate cancer? [^114hweCd]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent literature and compare the outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy (RT). The probability of cure is similar after either RP or RT. The likelihood of significant treatment complications is probably higher after RP compared with RT. Preservation of erectile function is at least as good or better with RT compared with RP. Urinary continence is more likely to be preserved after RT compared with RP. Each treatment results in distinct patterns of adverse changes in quality of life that are worsened by factors including obesity, large prostate size, high prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and older age.

### Prostate-specific antigen level at the time of salvage therapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and the risk of death [^111ptW6p]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we found that initiating sRT after RP when the PSA level exceeded 0.25 ng/mL as opposed to earlier was associated with a significant increase in ACM-risk. The clinical relevance of this finding is that some physicians are waiting until the PSA level exceeds 0.25 ng/mL in the post-RP setting to obtain a PSMA-PET scan and then initiate salvage treatment for two reasons. First, the performance characteristics of PSMA-PET improves with increasing PSA levels, thus minimizing false-positive and false-negative findings. Second, many insurers will not reimburse a PSMA PET scan until the PSA level exceeds a prespecified PSA threshold that is insurance specific. The results of the current study provide evidence to support that by waiting to initiate sRT after PSA failure may place some patients at increased ACM-risk.

### The prostatic specific antigen era is alive and well: prostatic specific antigen and biochemical progression following radical prostatectomy [^115gSMB3]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to predict the presence of prostate cancer on biopsy, pathological stage, and biochemical progression following primary therapy. A recent study found only a weak association between PSA and tumor volume in the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen and concluded that the PSA era is over. We examined the association between PSA and clinical progression in men undergoing RP.

Materials and Methods

The study population consisted of 2,312 men treated with RP between 1992 and 2004 by a single surgeon. We evaluated the association between preoperative PSA and biochemical progression on multivariate analysis.

Results

Men with higher preoperative PSA concentrations had higher grade cancers in the biopsy and RP specimen, and more adverse pathological features. After adjusting for the clinical covariates of age, race, grade, stage, and year of surgery, preoperative PSA was significantly associated with the risk of biochemical progression. When only men with PSA less than 10 ng/ml were examined, PSA remained a significant predictor of biochemical progression on multivariate analysis (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44, p < 0.001). For each 2-point increase in PSA, the risk of biochemical progression increased approximately 2-fold.

Conclusions

Preoperative PSA was significantly associated with high grade disease and adverse pathological findings. After adjusting for clinical covariates, PSA was significantly associated with the risk of biochemical progression, even in men with PSA less than 10 ng/ml. Despite multiple limitations, PSA remains the best prostate cancer tumor marker available.

### Definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy does not substantially impact prognostic factor estimates [^111v6PXZ]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Biochemical recurrence serves as a surrogate end point after radical prostatectomy. Many definitions of biochemical recurrence are currently used in the research literature. We examined various definitions in a large clinical cohort to explore whether estimation differs by definition.

Materials and Methods

The cohort included 5,473 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 1985 to 2007 at our cancer center. Separate analysis was done with 12 definitions of biochemical recurrence used in published studies. Cox regression was done to estimate HRs for established predictors. Predictive accuracy was determined using the concordance index.

Results

Depending on the definition the recurrence-free probability was 86% to 91% at 3 years and 81% to 87% at 5 years. HRs tended to be smaller for the most inclusive definitions but were fairly similar across all definitions. The univariate HR was 2.1 to 2.4 for log prostate specific antigen, 2.4 to 2.6 for clinical stage T2b vs T2a or less and 9.8 to 15 for biopsy Gleason grade 8 or greater vs 6 or less. Multivariate HRs were more homogeneous across the definitions. The concordance index was 0.79 to 0.83 and 0.83 to 0.87 for the preoperative and postoperative nomograms, respectively.

Conclusions

Estimates of risk ratios and predictive accuracy are generally robust to the biochemical recurrence definition. For clinical research, groups using different definitions will come to similar conclusions on prognostic factors. The definition should be factored into studies comparing overall recurrence probabilities.

### Predicting the outcome of salvage radiation therapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy [^115Tk1Ry]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

An increasing serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is the initial sign of recurrent prostate cancer among patients treated with radical prostatectomy. Salvage radiation therapy (SRT) may eradicate locally recurrent cancer, but studies to distinguish local from systemic recurrence lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. We developed a nomogram to predict the probability of cancer control at 6 years after SRT for PSA-defined recurrence.

Patients and Methods

Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, we constructed a model to predict the probability of disease progression after SRT in a multi-institutional cohort of 1,540 patients.

Results

The 6-year progression-free probability was 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) overall. Forty-eight percent (95% CI, 40% to 56%) of patients treated with SRT alone at PSA levels of 0.50 ng/mL or lower were disease free at 6 years, including 41% (95% CI, 31% to 51%) who also had a PSA doubling time of 10 months or less or poorly differentiated (Gleason grade 8 to 10) cancer. Significant variables in the model were PSA level before SRT (P < .001), prostatectomy Gleason grade (P < .001), PSA doubling time (P < .001), surgical margins (P < .001), androgen-deprivation therapy before or during SRT (P < .001), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019). The resultant nomogram was internally validated and had a concordance index of 0.69.

Conclusion

Nearly half of patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy have a long-term PSA response to SRT when treatment is administered at the earliest sign of recurrence. The nomogram we developed predicts the outcome of SRT and should prove valuable for medical decision making for patients with a rising PSA level.

### Persistent prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and mortality risk [^112Qsksb]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Whether the conventional 1.5-month to 2.0-month time interval following radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PC) is sufficient to accurately document a persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remains unanswered.

Objective

To evaluate the time necessary to accurately document a persistent PSA level after RP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study evaluated whether a significant interaction existed between (1) a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less and (2) persistent PSA vs undetectable PSA after RP on PC-specific mortality (PCSM) risk and all-cause mortality (ACM) risk, adjusting for known PC prognostic factors, age at RP, year of RP, and the time-dependent use of post-RP radiation therapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Whether an increasing persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis was also investigated. Patients with T1N0M0 to T3N0M0 PC treated with RP between 1992 and 2020 at 2 academic centers were included. Follow-up data were collected until November 2023. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to January 2025.

Exposure

RP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of ACM and PCSM risk.

Results

Of 30 461 patients included in the discovery cohort, the median (IQR) age was 64 (59–68) years; of 12 837 patients included in the validation cohort, the median (IQR) age was 59 (54–64) years. Compared with patients with undetectable PSA, among patients with persistent PSA, a pre-RP PSA level greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less was significantly associated with reduced ACM risk (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51–0.91; p = 0.01; P for interaction < .001) and PCSM risk (aHR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25–0.66; P < .001; P for interaction = .02). This result remained after adjustment for prostate volume and was confirmed in the validation cohort for PCSM risk and may represent a higher proportion of patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL vs 20 ng/mL or less who could have reached an undetectable PSA level if additional time for PSA assessment occurred before initiating post-RP therapy for presumed persistent PSA. Notably, there was more frequent and a shorter median time to post-RP RT plus ADT or ADT use in patients with a pre-RP PSA greater than 20 ng/mL (244 of 446 [54.7%] at a median [IQR] of 2.68 [1.51–4.40] months) vs 20 ng/mL or less (338 of 972 [34.8%] at a median [IQR] of 3.30 [2.00–5.39] months). These treatment times were shorter than the times to an undetectable PSA in observed patients (median [IQR] of 2.96 [1.84–3.29] months vs 3.37 [2.35–4.09] months, respectively). Increasing persistent PSA level was associated with an increased ACM risk (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04–1.24; p = 0.004) and PCSM risk (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12–1.45; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

PSA level assessed for at least 3 months after RP may minimize overtreatment, and in this study, a higher persistent PSA level was associated with a worse prognosis.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117LCT6n]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Tumor multigene molecular testing — the panel strongly advocates for use of life expectancy estimation, nomograms, and clinical parameters such as PSA density as foundations for augmented clinical decision-making; although risk groups, life expectancy estimates, and nomograms help inform decisions, prognostic multigene molecular testing can have a role because several tissue-based molecular assays have been developed to improve decision-making in newly diagnosed patients considering active surveillance and in treated patients considering adjuvant therapy or treatment for recurrence; uncertainty about risk can be reduced if such assays provide accurate and reproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond NCCN risk groups and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms; retrospective case cohort studies have shown these assays provide prognostic information independent of NCCN or CAPRA risk groups, including likelihoods of death with conservative management, biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or EBRT, and adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy.

### The use of early postoperative prostate-specific antigen to stratify risk in patients with positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy [^116rpnJA]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

With removal of all the prostate cancer tissue, the serum PSA should rapidly decline to zero, or at least very close to zero within 2 to 6 weeks following radical prostatectomy. However, general recommendation advises to perform the first PSA check at 3 months after the surgery, although a significant decline in PSA and even the PSA nadir may be reached a few weeks prior to this point. These results prompted us to investigate the PSA kinetics early after the surgery, starting with the first measurement at day 14. Our data demonstrate that PSA at day 14 is not offering valuable prognostic information regarding the outcome of the surgery. However, as time from surgery increased, the predictive power of ultrasensitive PSA measurements increased. For example, the calculated AUR for day 30 and day 60 were 74% and 84%, respectively. Serum PSA at early moments after the surgery may be influenced by the clearance of PSA, which was produced by the tissue of ablated prostate. This is compatible with our finding that preoperative PSA correlated only with postoperative PSA at day 14 and at day 30.

It has been shown that retained benign prostatic elements are an unlikely source of elevated PSA levels in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. In a study of Godoy et al. only 0.3% out of 331 men with low-risk prostate cancer had developed a measurable PSA level after radical prostatectomy. Odisho et al. have reviewed 274 patients with benign glandular tissue at the surgical margin after radical prostatectomy. They concluded that this finding was not associated with postoperative elevation of PSA. Thus, it seems that the only significant source of PSA after radical prostatectomy may be retained malignant cells and PSA kinetics early after the surgery are key to identification of patients with prostate cancer who have received failed prior therapy. In a series of Hong et al. there were 106 (27.6%) subjects who had a positive surgical margin after radical prostatectomy. Among these men, 45 patients, who showed undetectable ultrasensitive PSA nadir (PSA < 0.001 ng/ml) during the postoperative follow-up, demonstrated a significantly higher rate of 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival compared with 61 men who did not (94.1% vs 57.1%, P < 0.001). In line with these results we observed that only 1 of 16 patients who reached PSA ≤ 0.01 ng/ml at the first month after the surgery experienced BCR during the follow-up.

### Adverse pathologic findings in immediate radical prostatectomy… [^1159UeDJ]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Radical prostatectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures The proportions of men found to have at least Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 disease and other adverse pathologic features were compared by risk group. Log-binomial regression calculated relative risk of adverse pathologic findings in the LVIR cohort compared with VLR and LR cohorts. Analyses were repeated in subgroups of the LVIR population who otherwise met criteria for VLR and LR disease. Restriction of LVIR men to additional criteria did not significantly affect results. There were no preoperative clinical or pathologic criteria that could identify a subgroup of the LVIR population with rates of adverse pathologic findings comparable with those of the VLR and LR cohorts. PSAD was a significant predictor of adverse pathologic findings, but Gleason score had the largest effect.

For the LVIR group, clinical and pathologic factors were compared among men who did and did not have adverse pathologic findings. To identify clinically useful cut points for risk stratification, we calculated the rates of adverse pathologic findings based on various thresholds of PSA level, PSA density, and cancer volume at diagnosis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of adverse pathologic findings. Akaike information criterion was evaluated for each model. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software. Stratified analyses of PSA level and PSAD revealed a consistent 2-fold difference in rate of adverse pathologic findings regardless of selected cutoffs. Detailed stratification by cancer volume revealed no statistically significant thresholds to aid in further risk stratification.

Univariable analyses of adverse pathologic findings revealed associations with PSA level, PSAD, and year of surgery for LVIR patients. Multivariable analysis of the overall cohort showed Gleason score exerted the largest effect.

### Incidence and prognostic implications of prostate-specific antigen persistence and relapse after radical prostatectomy: population-based study [^113Db5dJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a wide range in incidence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence and relapse after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to describe incidence and prognostic implications of PSA persistence and relapse.

Methods

Register-based cohort study in Sweden of men diagnosed with PCa between 2007 and 2020 who underwent RP. Risks were estimated using competing risk cumulative incidence curves. Treatment after persistence or relapse and risk of PCa death and other causes were stratified according to persistence, European Association of Urology relapse risk groups, time to relapse, and life expectancy based on age and comorbidities.

Results

Among 10700 men, the 10-year risk of PSA persistence or relapse after RP was 34% (95% confidence interval = 32% to 35%). Within 12months of persistence/relapse, 75% of men with persistence, high-risk relapse, or early relapse (< 2years) received treatment. The 10-year risk of PCa death ranged from 12% for men with persistence to 2% in men with low-risk relapse, whereas death from other causes ranged from 11% to 16%. Risk of PCa death was 8.5% after early relapse (< 2years) and 1.4% after late relapse (> 5years).

Conclusions

This population-based study estimated that one-third of men would have PSA persistence or relapse within 10years from RP. There was a wide range in risk of death from PCa according to cancer characteristics and time to relapse. Risk of death from other causes was substantial. These factors, along with life expectancy, should inform treatment decisions for men with persistence or relapse.

### Predictive and prognostic models in radical prostatectomy candidates: a critical analysis of the literature [^113Mzcj1]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Numerous predictive and prognostic tools have recently been developed for risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) patients who are candidates for or have been treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).

Objective

To critically review the currently available predictive and prognostic tools for RP patients and to describe the criteria that should be applied in selecting the most accurate and appropriate tool for a given clinical scenario.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of the literature was performed using the Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Relevant reports published between 1996 and January 2010 identified using the keywords prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, predictive tools, predictive models, and nomograms were critically reviewed and summarised.

Evidence Synthesis

We identified 16 predictive and 22 prognostic validated tools that address a variety of end points related to RP. The majority of tools are prediction models, while a few consist of risk-stratification schemes. Regardless of their format, the tools can be distinguished as preoperative or postoperative. Preoperative tools focus on either predicting pathologic tumour characteristics or assessing the probability of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. Postoperative tools focus on cancer control outcomes (BCR, metastatic progression, PCa-specific mortality [PCSM], overall mortality). Finally, a novel category of tools focuses on functional outcomes. Prediction tools have shown better performance in outcome prediction than the opinions of expert clinicians. The use of these tools in clinical decision-making provides more accurate and highly reproducible estimates of the outcome of interest. Efforts are still needed to improve the available tools' accuracy and to provide more evidence to further justify their routine use in clinical practice. In addition, prediction tools should be externally validated in independent cohorts before they are applied to different patient populations.

Conclusions

Predictive and prognostic tools represent valuable aids that are meant to consistently and accurately provide most evidence-based estimates of the end points of interest. More accurate, flexible, and easily accessible tools are needed to simplify the practical task of prediction.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^113AucSo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to management of biochemical recurrence, evaluation, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to decide on the imaging in patients with rising PSA after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging (either initial PSA undetectable with a subsequent rise or PSA never nadirs to undetectable) based on the goal of therapy and the potential use of salvage local therapies, as both disease states indicate potentially undetected, residual local, locoregional, or micrometastatic disease and imaging options are not distinct or different between these scenarios. Do not obtain additional next-generation imaging in patients ineligible for or unwilling to receive salvage local or regional therapy.

### Salvage radiotherapy for men with isolated rising PSA or locally palpable recurrence after radical prostatectomy: do outcomes differ? [^116mspaq]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare, in a retrospective analysis, the outcome of salvage external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for isolated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation or palpable local recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Methods

We evaluated 102 men who underwent EBRT from 1993 to 1999, 60 for a rising PSA level alone and 42 for palpable local disease after RP. Biochemical disease-free survival and overall survival were calculated. Prognostic factors were evaluated to determine associations with biochemical disease-free survival.

Results

The 5-year rate of biochemical disease-free survival, local control, freedom from distant metastasis, and overall survival for all 102 patients was 38%, 94%, 87%, and 88%, respectively. All palpable disease resolved completely after salvage EBRT. The greatest 5-year rate of biochemical control (69%) was obtained in patients with a pre-EBRT PSA level of 0.5 ng/mL or less. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly better for those who underwent salvage EBRT for a rising PSA level than for those with palpable recurrence (96% versus 78%, P = 0.02). A low pre-EBRT PSA level and a less than 2-year interval from RP to EBRT were independent predictors of biochemical failure. Five patients (5%) experienced chronic grade 3 or 4 RT-related toxicity.

Conclusions

Salvage EBRT provides excellent local control of recurrent disease after RP. Salvage EBRT before the development of palpable local disease may confer a survival benefit and decrease the risk of metastasis, and durable biochemical control was achieved best in those whose pre-EBRT PSA level was 0.5 ng/mL or less. Early referral and careful patient selection is vital for salvage EBRT to be of optimal benefit.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115NpJqX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Post-radical prostatectomy management — selection for adjuvant/early treatment: Some patients have detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after surgery due to benign tissue and have low stable PSAs with very low risk of progression; serial PSA measurements can help stratify risk. Adjuvant radiation with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can be given to patients with PSA persistence or adverse pathologic features who do not have lymph node metastases. Positive surgical margins are unfavorable, especially if diffuse (> 10-mm margin involvement or ≥ 3 sites of positivity) or associated with persistent serum PSA, and monitoring after prostatectomy is appropriate with consideration of early external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA > 0.1 ng/mL. For decision-making, the Panel recommends use of nomograms plus clinical, pathologic, and molecular factors (including Decipher) to individualize treatment discussion.

### Impact of early salvage radiation therapy in patients with persistently elevated or rising prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy [^111XGq4p]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Salvage radiation therapy (SRT) is a recommended treatment option for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP). However, its effectiveness may be limited to specific categories of patients.

Objective

We aimed to identify the optimal candidates for early SRT after RP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The study included 925 node-negative patients treated with SRT after RP at seven institutions. Patients received SRT for either prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rising, or PSA persistence after RP that was defined as PSA level ≥ 0.1 ng/ml at 1 mo after surgery. All patients received local radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicle bed.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome measured was distant metastasis after SRT. Regression tree analysis was used to develop a risk-stratification tool. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and nonparametric curve fitting methods were used to explore the relationship between PSA level at SRT and the probability of metastasis-free survival at 8 yr.

Results and Limitations

At a median follow-up of 8.0 yr, 130 patients developed distant metastasis. At multivariable analysis, pre-SRT PSA level was significantly associated with distant metastasis (hazard ratio: 1.06, p < 0.0001). However, when patients were stratified into five risk groups using regression tree analysis (area under the curve: 85%), early SRT administration provided better metastasis-free survival in three groups only: (1) low risk: undetectable PSA after RP, Gleason score ≤ 7, and tumour stage ≥ pT3b, (2) intermediate risk: undetectable PSA after RP with Gleason score ≥ 8, (3) high risk: PSA persistence after RP with Gleason score ≤ 7.

Conclusions

We developed an accurate risk stratification tool to facilitate the individualised recommendation for early SRT based on prostate cancer characteristics. Early SRT proved to be beneficial only in selected groups of patients who are more likely to be affected by clinically significant but not yet systemic recurrence at the time of salvage treatment administration.

Patient Summary

In patients affected by prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, the early administration of salvage radiation therapy is beneficial only for selected subgroups of patients. In this study, these groups of patients were identified.

### Salvage therapy for prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline part I: introduction and treatment decision-making at the time of suspected biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^112m52VL]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Salvage therapy for prostate cancer — management of detectable ultrasensitive PSA below the BCR threshold: For patients who do not meet the AUA definition of BCR after RP (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL) yet have a detectable ultrasensitive PSA, clinicians should confirm a rising trend in PSA before proceeding with therapy (Expert Opinion). If using ultrasensitive PSA, the Panel recommends verifying a rising trend — either two consecutive rises with PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/mL or consecutive rises at any PSA level — because while higher detectable values are associated with greater risk of ultimately progressing to a PSA of 0.2 ng/mL or above, there is no distinct cutoff that clearly dichotomizes groups.

### Postoperative nomogram predicting the 10-year probability of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy [^115Z3n6z]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

A postoperative nomogram for prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) has been independently validated as accurate and discriminating. We have updated the nomogram by extending the predictions to 10 years after RP and have enabled the nomogram predictions to be adjusted for the disease-free interval that a patient has maintained after RP.

Methods

Cox regression analysis was used to model the clinical information for 1,881 patients who underwent RP for clinically-localized prostate cancer by two high-volume surgeons. The model was externally validated separately on two independent cohorts of 1,782 patients and 1,357 patients, respectively. Disease progression was defined as a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical progression, radiotherapy more than 12 months postoperatively, or initiation of systemic therapy.

Results

The 10-year progression-free probability for the modeling set was 79% (95% CI, 75% to 82%). Significant variables in the multivariable model included PSA (P = 0.002), primary (P < .0001) and secondary Gleason grade (P = 0.0006), extracapsular extension (P < .0001), positive surgical margins (P = 0.028), seminal vesicle invasion (P < .0001), lymph node involvement (P = 0.030), treatment year (P = 0.008), and adjuvant radiotherapy (P = 0.046). The concordance index of the nomogram when applied to the independent validation sets was 0.81 and 0.79.

Conclusion

We have developed and validated as a robust predictive model an enhanced postoperative nomogram for prostate cancer recurrence after RP. Unique to predictive models, the nomogram predictions can be adjusted for the disease-free interval that a patient has achieved after RP.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113nSgd3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — definitions and treatment triggers after radical prostatectomy — PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as when PSA does not fall to undetectable levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable PSA after RP with a subsequent detectable PSA that increases on ≥ 2 determinations (PSA recurrence) or increases to PSA > 0.1 ng/mL. Trials indicating noninferiority compared with adjuvant RT after RP have used a PSA threshold of 0.1 or 0.2 ng/mL to trigger treatment; imaging and treatment at lower PSA levels may be appropriate in patients at high risk for progression based on pretreatment risk factors, pathologic parameters, timing of recurrence, and genomic classifier (GC) score, among other factors.

Salvage therapy for prostate cancer — biochemical recurrence (BCR) population and imaging prerequisites are defined for evidence review. BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) was defined as a detectable or rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥ 0.2 ng/mL on 2 separate determinations, and patients with a persistent detectable PSA after RP were included. For patients treated with radiotherapy (RT), BCR used the Phoenix criteria (≥ 2 ng/mL rise in PSA over nadir) with no evidence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging.

PSA thresholds for selecting ADT with salvage RT — based on RTOG 9601 data, the Panel recommends offering ADT to patients being treated with salvage RT who have a higher post-prostatectomy PSA, including a PSA of ≥ 0.7 ng/mL. An analysis of NRG/RTOG 0534 SPPORT points toward a potential alternative PSA threshold of 0.35 ng/mL, and the page notes uncertainty about the use of concurrent ADT with salvage radiation in patients with PSA values < 0.7 ng/mL.
