## Question

Which is the role of Amoxicillin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of amoxicillin, including its indications, dosing, stewardship, and use in special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify labeled indications and common off-label uses. Next, I will examine first-line roles by syndrome and when to add clavulanate. After that, I need to check dosing principles, including high-dose strategies and duration. I will then review stewardship considerations and resistance patterns. Finally, I should confirm safety, contraindications, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis of amoxicillin's clinical role anchored in guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and mechanism. Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic aminopenicillin in the beta-lactam class that exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis during active multiplication, with activity against many gram-positive and select gram-negative organisms; resistance commonly arises via beta-lactamase production, which is why clavulanate is paired when beta-lactamase producers are likely [^1147fiDd] [^117Gw3hA] [^113Wjyhn].

> I need to verify the labeled indications to anchor scope. The FDA labeling includes treatment of infections of the ear, nose, and throat; genitourinary tract; skin and skin structure; and lower respiratory tract due to susceptible organisms, as well as H. pylori eradication in combination regimens and acute uncomplicated gonorrhea. Off-label uses include Lyme disease, infective endocarditis prophylaxis, and others, which I should keep in mind but treat with local epidemiology and guideline context [^111iRNrt] [^116cKGGG] [^111pSMEu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about first-line status without checking syndromes. For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults, contemporary guidelines recommend amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line for 5–7 days in most patients, with amoxicillin-clavulanate favored when resistance risk is higher or disease is more severe; high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is reserved for specific high-risk scenarios such as recent antibiotics, daycare exposure, older age, or immunocompromise, and randomized data suggest minimal incremental benefit from higher amoxicillin content beyond standard-dose combinations, reinforcing judicious dosing [^116tfRog] [^116F9atb] [^1144RLHo] [^1111sSY3] [^113pi1at].

> For pediatric acute bacterial sinusitis, I should confirm that amoxicillin remains first-line when resistance is not suspected, with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate used for moderate-to-severe disease, younger age, daycare exposure, or recent antibiotics. This aligns with AAP guidance and supports stewardship by reserving broader therapy for those at higher risk of resistant pneumococcus or H. influenzae [^111oMZyr] [^115VLjBL].

> Next, I should review acute otitis media. Let me verify that amoxicillin is first-line for most children when antibiotics are indicated, with amoxicillin-clavulanate used when there has been recent amoxicillin exposure, concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or treatment failure. This balances efficacy, cost, taste, and spectrum while acknowledging beta-lactamase coverage needs in select cases [^113UpHvh] [^116ujukL] [^115Sosyg].

> I will now examine community-acquired pneumonia. For otherwise healthy adults without comorbidities or resistance risk factors, amoxicillin is a recommended first-line outpatient option. In children, amoxicillin is first-line for mild-to-moderate CAP, and recent randomized data show that lower-dose amoxicillin for 3 days can be noninferior to higher-dose for 7 days for retreatment outcomes, though severity, setting, and prior antibiotics should guide dose and duration decisions. Observational data also suggest no mortality disadvantage to narrow-spectrum amoxicillin versus broader co-amoxiclav in hospitalized CAP, supporting stewardship-aligned choices where appropriate [^113g1GAS] [^115h6tNF] [^115fvY6X] [^115iRYAH] [^115u89gu].

> For group A streptococcal pharyngitis, I should confirm that penicillin or amoxicillin remains first-line due to lack of resistance, low cost, and narrow spectrum. Amoxicillin is often preferred for adherence with once-daily dosing in some regimens, and guideline updates continue to endorse these agents as treatment of choice [^116eLGvN].

> Let me consider H. pylori eradication. Amoxicillin is a core component of multiple evidence-based regimens, including bismuth or vonoprazan-based quadruple therapies and certain dual therapies. Notably, amoxicillin resistance remains uncommon, which preserves its role as a backbone agent in empiric regimens when chosen appropriately based on prior macrolide exposure and local resistance patterns [^116YCjLM] [^115sUkyy] [^111w3Hjo].

> For skin and soft tissue infections, I should double-check that amoxicillin is appropriate for mild infections due to streptococci when beta-lactamase producers are not suspected, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanate is preferred for animal bites and other polymicrobial wounds requiring anaerobic coverage. Dosing should continue until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution, with typical adult regimens ranging from 250–500 mg two to three times daily for mild disease and higher doses for severe presentations [^113xR7bA] [^114krV2U] [^111b9jki].

> Now, I need to ensure dosing principles are clear. High-dose amoxicillin strategies are used to overcome pneumococcal penicillin nonsusceptibility, particularly in pediatric otitis media and sinusitis, with 80–90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component commonly recommended in high-resistance settings; however, I should confirm that exceeding adult-equivalent totals can be problematic in heavier children, and observational data suggest many older children receive suboptimal mg/kg dosing, highlighting the need to apply pediatric high-dose principles rather than simply capping at adult totals [^115VLjBL] [^117Rf8Ae].

> Wait, let me verify duration guidance where it is controversial. In adult ABRS, 5–7 days is recommended for most, with longer courses reserved for severe disease or persistent symptoms. In pediatric CAP, 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for retreatment, but severity, setting, and prior antibiotics matter, so I should avoid overgeneralizing to all severities or settings [^116tfRog] [^115fvY6X].

> I should confirm stewardship anchors. Amoxicillin's narrow spectrum and low resistance pressure make it a preferred Access agent when the clinical syndrome and likely pathogens align. Conversely, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be reserved for beta-lactamase risk or specific syndromes, and overuse of multidrug regimens, particularly legacy sequential or concomitant H. pylori therapies, conflicts with modern stewardship principles and should be avoided outside susceptibility-guided contexts [^115ZzQTE] [^113Wjyhn] [^112YQ1jz].

> Next, I should review resistance patterns that shape empiric choices. Amoxicillin resistance among respiratory pathogens varies by organism and geography, with notable beta-lactamase–mediated resistance in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and variable pneumococcal penicillin nonsusceptibility; by contrast, H. pylori amoxicillin resistance remains rare, supporting its continued role as a backbone in eradication regimens when used appropriately [^1142oEAv] [^111w3Hjo].

> I need to check safety and contraindications. Amoxicillin is generally well tolerated, but hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis can occur. Patients should be screened for penicillin allergy and counseled on adherence and adverse effects, including diarrhea and the risk of Clostridioides difficile, with particular caution when clavulanate is added due to higher gastrointestinal adverse event rates [^112Sdzef] [^113Wjyhn].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, amoxicillin is commonly used for bacteriuria and as part of H. pylori regimens when indicated. In neonates and young infants, early IV-to-oral switch with amoxicillin-clavulanate has been shown to be noninferior to continued IV therapy in selected probable infections, shortening hospitalization. In older adults with ABRS, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate is often favored when resistance risk is elevated or disease is severe [^1144y4Gs] [^1144RLHo].

> But wait, what about lower respiratory tract infections without pneumonia. I should double-check that routine antibiotics, including amoxicillin, offer little average benefit for acute cough and bronchitis in primary care, with small signals of benefit in mixed bacterial-viral presentations; this reinforces watchful waiting and reserving amoxicillin for patients with clinical features suggesting bacterial involvement or higher risk of deterioration [^111JkRtB] [^115Uv8SE].

> In summary, amoxicillin's clinical role is that of a foundational, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam used first-line for many common bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, ears, throat, skin, and urinary tract, and as a core agent in H. pylori eradication. Its stewardship value lies in balancing efficacy with minimal resistance selection, while amoxicillin-clavulanate is reserved for beta-lactamase risk or specific syndromes, guided by patient factors, local resistance, and severity, with dosing and duration tailored to age, weight, and guideline recommendations [^113g1GAS] [^116tfRog] [^113UpHvh] [^115XaEn9] [^113Wjyhn].

---

Amoxicillin is a **first-line beta-lactam antibiotic** for mild-to-moderate infections of the respiratory tract, ear, skin, and genitourinary system, and is a key component of H. pylori eradication regimens [^111iRNrt] [^111pSMEu]. It is preferred for pediatric acute otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia due to its **narrow spectrum, safety, and low cost** [^113UpHvh] [^115h6tNF]. Amoxicillin is **inactive against beta-lactamase producers**, so amoxicillin-clavulanate is used when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected [^1172kFL6]. It is not effective for viral infections, and use should be guided by local resistance patterns and culture results to support antimicrobial stewardship [^1172kFL6] [^115ZzQTE].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, causing cell lysis and death [^1147fiDd].

- **Spectrum of activity**: Effective against Gram-positive cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and some Gram-negative rods (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis) [^1147fiDd].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Well absorbed orally, widely distributed, and primarily excreted unchanged in urine [^117Gw3hA].

---

## Clinical indications

Amoxicillin is indicated for a variety of **bacterial infections**, including:

| **Infection type** | **Common pathogens** | **Clinical indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Respiratory tract infections | - Streptococcus pneumoniae <br/> - Haemophilus influenzae <br/> - Streptococcus pyogenes | - Community-acquired pneumonia <br/> - Acute bacterial sinusitis <br/> - Acute otitis media <br/> - Pharyngitis/tonsillitis [^113g1GAS] [^116tfRog] [^113UpHvh] [^116eLGvN] |
| Skin and soft tissue infections | - Streptococcus spp. <br/> - Staphylococcus spp. <br/> - Escherichia coli | - Cellulitis <br/> - Impetigo <br/> - Erysipelas [^1172kFL6] |
| Genitourinary tract infections | - Escherichia coli <br/> - Proteus mirabilis <br/> - Enterococcus faecalis | - Uncomplicated cystitis <br/> - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Urethritis [^116mMRhR] |
| Helicobacter pylori infection | Helicobacter pylori | Part of triple or dual therapy regimens for eradication [^111pSMEu] [^115XaEn9] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pediatric acute otitis media**: First-line therapy due to efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness [^113UpHvh].

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: Recommended first-line therapy in children and adults without severe comorbidities or risk factors for resistant pathogens [^113g1GAS] [^115h6tNF].

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: Recommended first-line therapy in children and adults, with amoxicillin-clavulanate preferred in cases of antibiotic resistance or severe infection [^115VLjBL] [^116tfRog].

- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: Integral component of recommended eradication regimens [^111pSMEu] [^115XaEn9].

---

## Limitations and resistance considerations

- **Beta-lactamase production**: Many Gram-negative bacteria produce beta-lactamase enzymes, rendering amoxicillin ineffective. In such cases, amoxicillin-clavulanate (a beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) is recommended [^1142oEAv].

- **Resistance patterns**: Local resistance patterns should guide empiric therapy. Amoxicillin is not recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in areas with high resistance rates [^116tgw7z].

- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Amoxicillin should be used judiciously to minimize resistance development and adverse effects [^1172kFL6].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Amoxicillin is **generally well-tolerated**. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, and hypersensitivity reactions. Serious adverse effects — such as anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and Clostridioides difficile infection — are rare but require immediate medical attention.

---

## Special populations

Amoxicillin is **safe for use in pregnancy and lactation**, with no significant teratogenic or fetal risks reported. In pediatrics, it is a first-line agent for many infections given its safety, efficacy, and palatability [^113UpHvh] [^115h6tNF]. In renal impairment, dose adjustments are necessary in patients with significant renal dysfunction.

---

Amoxicillin is a **versatile, first-line antibiotic** for many common bacterial infections, particularly in pediatrics, and is a key part of H. pylori eradication therapy. Its use should be guided by local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, and antimicrobial stewardship principles to ensure effective treatment and minimize resistance.

The is no longer any role for concomitant, sequential, and hybrid therapies?

Antimicrobial therapies for H. pylori can be categorized into one of three categories: (a) can often be successfully given empirically, (b) should not be used because they each contain at least one unnecessary antibiotic, and (c) those that should only be used in susceptibility-based therapies (Table 3).

These complex regimens were introduced as empiric therapies to empirically overcome clarithromycin resistance. Basically, the concept was to add another antibiotic, generally metronidazole so that treatment failure required dual metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance. Sequential therapy proved effective in regions with high clarithromycin resistance but low metronidazole resistance. However, when given to patients with both clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance the regimen failed. Alternate formulations include concomitant therapy which provided all four drugs simultaneously and hybrid therapy which used a PPI plus amoxicillin followed by all four drugs (concomitant therapy). All three regimens were most effective when given for 14 days and all had their efficacy undermined by the presence of dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance. Sequential therapy has long been considered obsolete. Over time, the cure rates with concomitant therapy have also declined as dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance rates have increased. Critically, it was soon recognized that all of these multidrug therapies violated the principles of antimicrobial stewardship and, as discussed above, even when successful, all patients receive at least one unnecessary antibiotic. It now appears likely that these therapies are a major iatrogenic cause of increasing global antimicrobial resistance and are responsible for tens of thousands of kilograms of unnecessary antibiotics being prescribed annually. This is especially critical for clarithromycin which is listed by the World Health Organization as a 'necessary drug'.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^113zLweS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Role of antibiotic use history in antimicrobial selection

Antimicrobial resistance is the main reason for failure of otherwise successful antimicrobial therapies. The present of antibiotic resistance within a population is reflected on the amount of its use within that population. – Fluoroquinolone, macrolide, and metronidazole resistance are now almost universal, whereas resistance remains rare for amoxicillin, tetracycline, rifabutin, and furazolidone. The same principles used to identify resistance in populations are also applicable for individuals making review of each individual's antimicrobial use history and pharmacy records especially useful for identifying which antibiotics to avoid.

These recommendations were initially useful for ensuring successful empiric use of clarithromycin, metronidazole, or fluoroquinolones. The prevalence of resistance to these antibiotics, however, has increased to the point that it is now best to restrict their use to susceptibility-based therapy. Treatment success should be always be confirmed for each individual by a test-of-cure to confirm these drugs remain highly effective (e.g. cure rates of ⩾90%, locally).–

Therapy should also be preceded by a formal patient education/counseling regarding the therapy, potential side effects, and importance of completing the entire course. – Written instructions are particularly helpful. Based in part on the successful program used by Wink de Boer for prescribing bismuth quadruple therapy, we recommend establishing a trust-based doctor–patient relationship as outlined in Table 1.

### Ongoing trials of simplified antibiotic regimens for the treatment of serious infections in young infants in south Asia and sub-saharan Africa: implications for policy [^116JQnhJ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aside From Evidence of Efficacy, What Are Anticipated Concerns of Policy Makers and Health Professionals About These New Regimens and Delivery Strategies?

One of the concerns regarding the implementation of a program of antibiotic use for clinical severe infection in young infants outside the hospital setting is the perception of risk of increased antimicrobial resistance. We will draw upon existing data and reports from research teams to address this issue and recommend sentinel surveillance to measure antimicrobial resistance when outpatient treatment programs are implemented.

There are other challenges to adoption of the regimens that the research teams encountered in planning for the trials. Anecdotal evidence of practices of private providers suggests that they often use more expensive and third-/fourth-generation antibiotics, rather than the simple antibiotics that are being tested in the current studies. Furthermore, availability of antibiotic formulations of amoxicillin, procaine penicillin and gentamicin suitable for use in young infants remains a problem. We look to the ongoing United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities work to help address some of these challenges.

What Are the Steps for Translation of the Research Results to Programmatic Action?

After the results of these studies are published, they will be pulled together with all existing evidence into systematic reviews addressing specific priority issues. This evidence will be graded for quality and be subsequently submitted to a WHO advisory group to consider whether this new evidence merits updating global guidelines. We believe that the data from the current trials will contribute to the following guidelines:

Clinical

Simplest regimens for the treatment of clinical severe infection that is safe and effective, in settings where referral is not possible.
Optimal treatment of fast breathing in newborns and young infants.

Programmatic

Role of CHWs and home visits for identifying signs of serious infection.
Mechanisms that create and strengthen links between communities and health facilities, particularly the role of CHWs.
Reduced need for hospitalization, with outpatient treatment at health facilities near the home by first-level health workers.
Health system requirements (policy, program planning, human resources, capacity strengthening, logistics and supply of commodities, supervision and monitoring) to make outpatient treatment of most young infants with PSBI a reality.

Finally, we recognize that the completion of the studies in Africa and Asia and the guidelines development by WHO is only the beginning of a process of a series of policy dialogues by a large number of stakeholders at country level to implement a program of outpatient treatment of neonatal infections. This discussion will include not only governments but also nongovernmental organizations and participants from the private sector, including professional bodies, formal and nonformal health-care providers and civil society consumer groups.

### Current management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the role of moxifloxacin [^1127DAUT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are common among adults and are associated with a significant amount of morbidity. The symptoms of rhinosinusitis are nasal drainage, congestion, and sinus pressure. A bacterial sinus infection is more likely if these symptoms worsen after 5–7 days or do not improve after 10–14 days. The majority of bacterial episodes have been associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In the current era of increasing resistance to beta -lactams and macrolides, treatment guidelines have been formulated worldwide to assist clinicians in the selection of antibacterials. According to one model, the following antibacterials are most likely to provide desired outcomes (90%-92% predicted clinical efficacy) for adults: respiratory fluoroquinolones (i.e., moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin), ceftriaxone, and high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g of amoxicillin/day and 250 mg of clavulanate/day). Although the role of the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of this condition is evolving, fluoroquinolones are often recommended as second-line therapy or as first-line therapy for selected patients (e.g., those who received antibacterials in the previous 4–6 weeks or adults with moderate-to-severe disease).

### Penicillin V versus amoxicillin for pneumonia in children-a Swedish nationwide emulated target trial [^1137s8vY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although most countries recommend amoxicillin for paediatric pneumonia, there is a long tradition of treatment with penicillin V (PcV) in Sweden, thus not empirically covering Haemophilus influenzae. There are, however, large regional differences in treatment practice. The aim was to compare clinical outcomes (treatment failure and severe complications), in children aged 1–59 months treated with PcV vs. amoxicillin for pneumonia.

Methods

This population-based emulated target trial included all children born in Sweden between 2001 and 2021, using national health, sociodemographic, and population registers. All pneumonia cases from hospitals and paediatric outpatient clinics in children aged 1–59 months treated as outpatients with PcV or amoxicillin between July 2005 and December 2021, were identified. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for treatment failure (newly dispensed antibiotic prescription or pneumonia-associated hospitalization day 1–14) and severe complications (lung complications, an invasive bacterial disease, admission to intensive care unit or death day 1–28) were calculated with logistic regression analysis.

Results

PcV was prescribed in 14 766 cases and amoxicillin in 10 566. Treatment failure occurred in 7.7% with PcV vs. 4.7% with amoxicillin, aOR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54–2.00). Severe complications were rare, with no significant difference between PcV and amoxicillin (0.3% vs. 0.2%, aOR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.53–1.73). Sensitivity and interaction analyses showed consistent results.

Discussion

PcV treatment compared with amoxicillin, was associated with an increased risk for treatment failure but not for severe complications. The absolute risks for adverse outcomes were low in both groups suggesting a minor role of H. influenzae in paediatric pneumonia.

### Beta-lactam antibiotics: newer formulations and newer agents [^111JEjLd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

beta-Lactam antibiotics share a common structure and mechanism of action, although they differ in their spectrum of antimicrobial activity and utility in treating different infections. The current classes include the penicillins, the penicillinase-resistant penicillins, the extended- spectrum penicillins, the cephalosporins, the carbapenems, and the monobactams. This article discusses some of the newest beta-lactams available for use in the United States: ertapenem, cefditoren, and cefepime. A new formulation of amoxicillin-clavulanate, which contains higher doses of amoxicillin, is also discussed.

### Amoxicillin [^1147fiDd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.

Resistance

Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications And Usage (1).

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Enterococcus faecalis

Staphylococcus spp.

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus spp. (alpha and beta-hemolytic)

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Helicobacter pylori

Proteus mirabilis

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^113d8kVR]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Adjunctive and novel therapies (BPA #12) — The addition of clavulanic acid to amoxicillin-based regimens has been associated with a 10% to 20% increase in eradication success. To date, at least 20 clinical trials and several meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of probiotics on H pylori eradication, with mostly positive findings but significant trial heterogeneity and quality concerns. Collectively, there are limited data to guide timing, formulation, dosage, duration, and patient selection for these adjunctive therapies, and therefore they should therefore be considered experimental, while development of newer antimicrobial agents against H pylori should be fostered amid the exorbitant cost associated with treatment failure, which is estimated to be at least $33 billion in the United States alone.

### Efficacy and safety of switching from intravenous to oral antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) versus a full course of intravenous antibiotics in neonates with probable bacterial infection (RAIN): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1144y4Gs]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Switching from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral antibiotic therapy among neonates is not yet practised in high-income settings due to uncertainties about exposure and safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of early intravenous-to-oral antibiotic switch therapy compared with a full course of intravenous antibiotics among neonates with probable bacterial infection.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients were recruited at 17 hospitals in the Netherlands. Neonates (postmenstrual age ≥ 35 weeks, postnatal age 0–28 days, bodyweight ≥ 2 kg) in whom prolonged antibiotic treatment was indicated because of a probable bacterial infection, were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to an oral suspension of amoxicillin 75 mg/kg plus clavulanic acid 18.75 mg/kg (in a 4:1 dosing ratio, given daily in three doses) or continue on intravenous antibiotics (according to the local protocol). Both groups were treated for 7 days. The primary outcome was cumulative bacterial reinfection rate 28 days after treatment completion. A margin of 3% was deemed to indicate non-inferiority, thus if the reinfection rate in the oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group was less than 3% higher than that in the intravenous antibiotic group the null hypothesis would be rejected. The primary outcome was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all patients who were randomly assigned and completed the final follow-up visit on day 35) and the per protocol population. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one administration of the allocated treatment and who completed at least one follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included clinical deterioration and duration of hospitalisation. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03247920, and EudraCT, 2016–004447–36.

Findings

Between Feb 8, 2018 and May 12, 2021, 510 neonates were randomly assigned (n = 255 oral amoxicillin-clavulanic group; n = 255 intravenous antibiotic group). After excluding those who withdrew consent (n = 4), did not fulfil inclusion criteria (n = 1), and lost to follow-up (n = 1), 252 neonates in each group were included in the intention-to-treat population. The cumulative reinfection rate at day 28 was similar between groups (one [< 1%] of 252 neonates in the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group vs one [< 1%] of 252 neonates in the intravenous antibiotics group; between-group difference 0 [95% CI -1.9 to 1.9]; p non-inferiority < 0.0001). No statistically significant differences were observed in reported adverse events (127 [50%] vs 113 [45%]; p = 0.247). In the intention-to-treat population, median duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter in the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group than the intravenous antibiotics group (3.4 days [95% CI 3.0–4.1] vs 6.8 days [6.5–7.0]; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

An early intravenous-to-oral antibiotic switch with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is non-inferior to a full course of intravenous antibiotics in neonates with probable bacterial infection and is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^111w3Hjo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

What useful information, from which antibiotics, can be obtained from culture?

The standard method (culture and antibiogram) is the only way to test the susceptibility to all antibiotics. However, antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical practice yields useful information only for a few antibiotics. Antibiotics effective and generally used against H. pylori are mainly the following five: amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline and quinolones. Resistance to amoxicillin has been estimated to be as low as 0–1%; similarly, resistance to tetracycline has been reported to range from 0% to 5%. Hence, their role in clinical practice may even be marginalized. Finally, the relevance of in vitro metronidazole resistance for the in vivo treatment is quite limited (see next section). On the other hand, resistance to clarithromycin and quinolones is rapidly increasing and has reached alarming levels worldwide, and its clinical relevance is doubtless. Therefore, it may even be assumed that antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical practice yields useful information only regarding clarithromycin and quinolones.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113LDrEf]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. The causal estimates produced depend on several assumptions, including that all determinants of treatment choice are included in the models. However despite using comprehensive EHR data, unmeasured confounding likely still exists: there may be unwritten/unrecorded factors that lead clinicians to use broad-spectrum antibiotics in more unwell patients, even when all measured factors are the same (potentially undermining model assumptions). Hence, our study provides clear support for a future randomised trial that could be used to address this concern more completely; however, investment in such a trial would need to be balanced against how likely unmeasured confounding sufficient to change study findings was, and how generalisable findings might be over time and to different locations.

Other limitations include using diagnostic codes to identify CAP, which may be imperfect, although findings were similar in the subset of patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia. Additionally, we did not account for the causative organism, since, in common with most CAP, most patients (94%) lacked positive microbiology. This also precluded subgroup analyses by causative pathogens. In the subset of patients with positive blood cultures (3.1%), S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae accounted for 76/298 (26%) of infections, which would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin. However, as most patients did not have positive microbiology it is possible that beta-lactamase producing bacteria made up a smaller proportion of cases overall, which would be in keeping with our main findings suggesting amoxicillin was active in most cases. In settings with different bacterial species or resistance prevalence our findings may not generalise. As above, better diagnostics to reliably diagnose more of the infections that would not respond to amoxicillin, might help support wider use of narrow spectrum agents.

### Necessity of amoxicillin clavulanic acid in addition to prednisolone in mild-to-moderate COPD exacerbations [^113GNfdr]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by acute exacerbations (AECOPD) that are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Management of AECOPD includes oral corticosteroids often combined with broad spectrum antibiotics to treat a presumed bacterial infection. Some antibiotics, especially the macrolides, are also sometimes provided prophylactically for longer term use due to their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory or antiviral effects. A short course of broad spectrum antibiotics during AECOPD is, however, mainly used for their antibacterial effect. Their use remains controversial due to several reasons. First only approximately one-third of AECOPD are due to bacterial infections. Second, given the existence of bacterial infections, the treatment is empirical since culture and resistance results usually take 1 week to become available. Third, growing resistance against antibacterial agents is an additional reason to be reluctant to give a prescription of antibiotics. Finally and perhaps most importantly, there is no definitive evidence that antibiotics offer benefits in outpatients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD.

The latest international guidelines recommend antibiotics to patients with AECOPD who have three cardinal symptoms (increase in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence); patients who have two of the cardinal symptoms, if increased purulence of sputum is one of the two symptoms; or to patients who require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). These criteria originated from the study by Anthonisen et al which showed only a marginal benefit from antibiotics in a subgroup of patients. They divided AECOPD into three categories and concluded that in case of the presence of all three of the above mentioned criteria (type I) the cause of the AECOPD is probably bacterial and is more likely to have a favourable outcome with antibiotics.

Unfortunately, most placebo-controlled antibiotics trials, on which these guidelines are based, have important limitations and are difficult to compare because of different definitions of COPD and AECOPD, and different end points that have been used. Furthermore, these trials were conducted several decades ago, before systemic steroids were widely introduced for the treatment of AECOPD. Even in the recently published study by Llor et al, in which a beneficial effect with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo was observed, only 17% of the patients were treated with systemic steroids. Furthermore, as stated in the Cochrane Review of Vollenweider et al, when the analyses on the effects of antibiotics are restricted to currently used drugs, antibiotics do not significantly reduce treatment failure in outpatient AECOPDs.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115PKrFc]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^113ZAecG]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations (AECOPD) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Key symptoms are breathlessness, increased sputum volume and purulence. The treatment involves the use of bronchodilators, oxygen treatment, systemic corticosteroids and often antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, shorten the course of the disease, prevent further deterioration of lung function, and prolong the period between exacerbations. A quick recovery and longer interval between hospitalizations are important, as both the patient's life and healthcare costs are influenced by the severity and the number of AECOPD. The largest and most recent meta-analysis on treatment of AECOPD concludes in line with earlier meta-analyses, that for serious exacerbations (requiring hospital admission) there is moderate evidence that antibiotic treatment improves outcomes compared to placebo. For mild to moderate cases (outpatients), the conclusion is less clear, although it is observed, that the risk of treatment failure, defined as no resolution or deterioration of symptoms, is higher among patients who do not receive antibiotics. No effect was found regarding all-cause mortality or re-exacerbations within 2 to 6 weeks. The conclusion was based on pooled data from studies with different antibiotics, and where various doses were used. When using antibiotics, GOLD recommends that the choice is based on local resistance patterns. Today amoxicillin (AMX) 750 mg three times daily (TID) is recommended as first choice empirical treatment of AECOPD in Denmark in mild to moderate cases, however many clinicians prefer amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125 mg TID, as recommended in the previous guideline, referring to the fact that AMC is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis. A bacterial pathogen is believed to be accountable for around half of the deteriorations, where Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. AMX has a narrow spectrum of activity compared to AMC. Apart from Staphylococcus aureus and M. catarrhalis, most pathogens that cause community acquired pneumonia and AECOPD that are sensitive to AMC are also sensitive to AMX. The use of AMX instead of AMC in exacerbations in patients with severe COPD has not yet been investigated in a sufficiently large patient population and with clinically important endpoints like pneumonia hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcomes. On one hand, AMC has a broader spectrum of activity, and on the other hand, AMX is most often administered at a higher dose of amoxicillin (750 mg vs. 500 mg), which may increase the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for many pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, side effects may be more frequent when using AMC. The main analysis compares the risk of death or hospitalization due to pneumonia or AECOPD in the 30 days following a first AMX/AMC prescription.

### Small children receive large doses, while large children receive low doses of amoxicillin per kg [^117Rf8Ae]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With increasing pneumococcal penicillin resistance, physicians treat pneumococcal infections with high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/d). High-dose amoxicillin approaches adult doses which makes clinicians reluctant to exceed "adult doses". This study examines the disparity of amoxicillin dosing between the ages of children.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 5503 children prescribed amoxicillin regardless of diagnosis. The final cohort consisted of 3620 encounters with infections that align with recommendations of high-dose amoxicillin.

Results

Linear regression demonstrated a significant negative correlation between age/dose (mg/kg/d) and weight/dose (mg/kg/d). Larger children are prescribed declining doses in mg/kg/d, so most patients above 60 kg are dosed at less than 40 mg/kg/d. Children 6 years and under cluster around the 80 mg/kg/d dose.

Conclusions

Older children receiving a lower than recommended dose per kilogram of amoxicillin for conditions that require high-dose amoxicillin. There is a disparity in the dosing of amoxicillin between age/weight categories. Article summaryA chart review of 3620 pediatric patient encounters prescribed amoxicillin. After controlling for weight, as age and weight increases, the dose of amoxicillin prescribed decreases. Children are reaching the adult maximum dose right after they surpass 15 kg. What is known on this subject: An Amoxicillin guideline shift to 80 to 90 mg/kg/d for treating pneumococcal infections in 2014. This was due to increasing intermediate penicillin resistance. Obesity results in children reaching the "maximum" doses at younger ages as well. What this study adds: There is a disparity is amoxicillin dosing among the pediatric population, are small children getting too much amoxicillin, or are larger children getting too little? Children are also reaching the adult maximum dose at low weights, such as 20 kg. Deidentified individual participant data will not be made available.

### Amoxicillin (Amoxil) [^117Gw3hA]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolism and Excretion: The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.

Resistance

Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Enterococcus faecalis

Staphylococcus spp.

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus spp. (alpha and beta-hemolytic)

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Helicobacter pylori

Proteus mirabilis

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115XaEn9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

### Gaps in the wall: understanding cell wall biology to tackle amoxicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^1128a7v7]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, and one of the main pathogens responsible for otitis media infections in children. Amoxicillin (AMX) is a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic, used frequently for the treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections. Here, we discuss the pneumococcal response to AMX, including the mode of action of AMX, the effects on autolysin regulation, and the evolution of resistance through natural transformation. We discuss current knowledge gaps in the synthesis and translocation of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids, major constituents of the pneumococcal cell wall and critical to AMX activity. Furthermore, an outlook of AMX resistance research is presented, including the development of natural competence inhibitors to block evolution via horizontal gene transfer, and the use of high-throughput essentiality screens for the discovery of novel cotherapeutics.

### Private benefit of β-lactamase dictates selection dynamics of combination antibiotic treatment [^111tfw2j]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When available, these parameters can guide choice of treatment strategies. For example, for some clinical isolates (with large), the lowest resistant fractions were observed at high Bla inhibitor concentrations (Figs. 5 E, 6A). The historical development of drug combinations like amoxicillin/clavulanate, in which the relative concentration of antibiotic has been increased from 2:1 to formulations as high as 16:1, has been driven by the recognition that the time above MIC is the key parameter that determines treatment efficacy. While increasing antibiotic concentration increases the time above the MIC, so does increasing inhibitor concentration, by lowering the antibiotic's MIC rather than increasing its concentration. In the long term, giving clinicians more freedom to set separate doses of antibiotic and inhibitor components may facilitate dose optimization that reduces resistance.

Our analysis also highlights the importance of the intracellular inhibition of Bla. Current guidelines do not differentiate between combinations with different Bla inhibitors: for instance, amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam, which have β-lactam components with similar spectra of activity, may be used interchangeably. However, our results suggest the need to consider inhibitor permeability, which depends on both the target bacteria and the specific inhibitor, when choosing between otherwise equivalent therapies. In recalcitrant infections, the pairing of more effective antibiotics with antibiotic-inhibitor combinations with more permeable inhibitors can even be considered. This unorthodox method of obtaining different antibiotic-inhibitor pairs has been successful in some cases as salvage therapy, and suggests that regulatory approval of combinations which partner the most permeable of existing inhibitors with different antibiotics could provide more avenues to successful treatment. Adjuvants that increase inhibitor penetration should also be developed. Permeabilizing adjuvants have already been shown to boost the activity of various antibioticsand even Bla inhibitors; our work suggests that they may boost the resistance-suppressing ability of these inhibitors as well.

Decision-making in the clinic is frequently empirical and difficult. Paired with improvements in fast diagnostics at the strain level, databases of strains which record their key parameters will enable the development of algorithms that can make optimal treatment recommendations at the time of diagnosis, rather than after a lengthy period during which the pathogen is characterized. This increasingly personalized approach will ultimately enable more evidence-based clinical decisions that can account for both the needs of the individual patient and society's need to combat antibiotic resistance.

### Vonoprazan with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment ofInfection [^115sUkyy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and potential role of vonoprazan with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the terms: (vonoprazan OR voquezna) AND (" H. pylori " OR " Helicobacter pylori ") AND amoxicillin with no date limitations up to November 3, 2022.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies assessing the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan with amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin were included and divided into 3 groups based on different comparisons between treatment regimens used in each group.

Data Synthesis

Ten clinical trials and 17 observational studies were included. Vonoprazan-based therapy demonstrated greater acid inhibition and similar or higher efficacy than proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy in treatment-naïve patients and with clarithromycin-resistant infections.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Proton-pump inhibitor-based therapies have not reached the desired successful eradication rate of 90% for H. pylori infection. Vonoprazan-based therapies being at least as effective as PPI-based therapies offer an alternative for patients with H. pylori infection.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan-based therapies were effective and well tolerated for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults. These regimens provide an important alternative with prolonged acid inhibition, lower potential for CYP2C19 polymorphism, and at least comparable efficacy and safety versus PPI-based therapies in patients with H. pylori infections. Thus, vonoprazan-based therapy should be considered for certain patients, for example, those with failure to PPI-based treatments.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1141cYfL]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is a common outpatient diagnosis and is typically treated with antibiotics even though the current recommended regimen (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate by mouth twice a day)has been shown in clinical trials to provide only minimal benefit beyond placebo. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends using high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (containing amoxicillin 2000 mg rather than 875 mg twice a day) only when the prevalence in the community of penicillin-resistant pneumococci exceeds 10%. However, few primary care clinicians will know this prevalence, and evidence from studies in children of the penetration of amoxicillin into middle ear fluidand of the treatment of acute sinusitis with high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanatesuggests that higher-dose amoxicillin might provide more benefit to adults as well, even in areas with a low prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed from 2014 to 2017 comparing high-dose and standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate for adults with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis. That study confirmed that very few individuals carried resistant bacteria. The primary outcome was the participants' subjective rating of improvement after 3 days of treatment, knowing that most people get better by 2 weeks but value rapid relief and that the benefit of other common treatments — eg, for streptococcal pharyngitisand influenza — is largely a quicker improvement. The study drug was the extended-release formulation of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. Midway through the trial, the manufacturer stopped producing all formulations of the study drug. The study drug was transitioned to a combination of standard immediate-release amoxicillin with clavulanate (875/125 mg) and immediate-release amoxicillin (875 mg) twice a day. Unexpectedly, the extended-release formulation provided no significant benefit, but the immediate-release formulation did; in the second, immediate-release part of the study, 52% of participants receiving the high dose rated symptoms as "a lot better" at the end of 3 days of treatment vs 34% receiving the standard dose (P = 0.04).

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^115u89gu]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons. A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified, so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover 'atypical' infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ± a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP. Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections. Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP, none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Amoxicillin may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Randomized trial of amoxicillin for pneumonia in Pakistan [^114xfLtt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The second issue relates to the criteria for pneumonia categorization. Though not powered for subgroup analyses, RETAPP raises several questions about targeted treatment. Temperature greater than or equal to 37.5°C, anemia and the presence of wheeze all significantly predicted TF. In the absence of these signs, allocation groups were comparable. Reported temperature, documented fever and wheeze at presentation have also been identified to be of prognostic importance in children with acute cough and respiratory infections in developed countries.

This suggests that, although potentially more complex to manage in the primary care setting, that with a change in criteria for non-severity, screening by predictor variables might be more cost effective. One issue which is now unequivocal is that the roll out of oxygen saturation testing at presentation will enhance the process. Debate continues as to whether point of care biomarker testing will augment triage.

The third issue relates to the intriguing difference in relapse rates. There were fewer TFs but greater relapse rates (3% vs. 2%) in the antibiotic group. What does this mean biologically? One explanation might be that it represents a subgroup of children with resistant bacterial infection who were treated or suppressed and then relapsed. Could these be the same children who would have been the TFs in the placebo group who simply presented earlier? Though hard to prove, this seems possible and represents an interesting philosophical balance/'trade off'. resistant bacterial infection who were treated or suppressed and then relapsed.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute otorrhea through tympanostomy tube: randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with daily follow-up [^116sjhqj]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of routine antimicrobial treatment of acute middle-ear infections is under debate, because the efficacy of antimicrobials in the resolution of middle-ear fluid has not been unambiguously proven. Acute tube otorrhea is regarded as evidence of acute otitis media, and for methodologic reasons it was chosen to provide objectivity for diagnostics and outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to assess whether amoxicillin-clavulanate accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in outpatient setting.

Patients

Volunteer sample of basically healthy 6- to 72-month-old children with a tympanostomy tube. Eligibility required having acute tube otorrhea of < 48 hours' of duration and no prior treatment within the last 2 weeks. The mean age of the participants was 25 months; they had a history of 3 episodes of acute otitis media (median), and 99% had manifestations of a concomitant respiratory infection. Of 79 randomized patients, 7 were withdrawn because of adverse events; 66 patients completed the study.

Interventions

Amoxicillin-clavulanate (N = 34; 45 mg/kg/d) or matching placebo (N = 32) for 7 days and daily suction of middle-ear fluid through tympanostomy tube.

Main Outcome Measures

Duration of acute tube otorrhea and duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

Results

The median duration of tube otorrhea was significantly shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (3 vs 8 days). At the end of the 7-day medication period, tube otorrhea was resolved in 28 of 34 children receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with 13 of 32 children on placebo (treatment-control difference 41%; 95% confidence interval, 20%-63%; number needed to treat, 2.4). The median duration of bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid was shorter in amoxicillin-clavulanate than in the placebo group (1 vs 8 days).

Conclusions

Oral antibiotic treatment significantly accelerates the resolution of acute tube otorrhea by reducing bacterial growth in middle-ear fluid.

### Oral amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid: properties, indications and usage [^113Wjyhn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amoxicillin has been in use since the 1970s; it is the most widely used penicillin both alone and in combination with the β-lactamase clavulanic acid.

Objectives

In this narrative review, we re-examine the properties of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and provide guidance on their use, with emphasis on the preferred use of amoxicillin alone.

Sources

Published medical literature (MEDLINE database via Pubmed).

Content

While amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have similar half-lives, clavulanic acid is more protein bound and even less heat stable than amoxicillin, with primarily hepatic metabolism. It is also more strongly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including Clostridium difficile infection, and, thus, in oral combination formulations, limits the maximum daily dose of amoxicillin that can be given. The first ratio for an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination was set at 4:1 due to clavulanic acid's high affinity for β-lactamases; ratios of 2:1, 7:1, 14:1 and 16:1 are currently available in various regions. Comparative effectiveness data for the different ratios are scarce. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often used as empiric therapy for many of the World Health Organization's Priority Infectious Syndromes in adults and children, leading to extensive consumption, when some of these syndromes could be handled with a delayed antibiotic prescription approach or amoxicillin alone.

Implications

Using available epidemiological and pharmacokinetic data, we provide guidance on indications for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and on optimal oral administration, including choice of combination ratio. More data are needed, particularly on heat stability, pharmacodynamic effects and emergence of resistance in 'real-world' clinical settings.

### Amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care when pneumonia is not suspected: a 12-country, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111JkRtB]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower-respiratory-tract infection is one of the most common acute illnesses managed in primary care. Few placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics have been done, and overall effectiveness (particularly in subgroups such as older people) is debated. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection with those of placebo both overall and in patients aged 60 years or older.

Methods

Patients older than 18 years with acute lower-respiratory-tract infections (cough of ≤ 28 days' duration) in whom pneumonia was not suspected were randomly assigned (1:1) to either amoxicillin (1 g three times daily for 7 days) or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated "moderately bad" or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2–4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2007–001586–15), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 4175), ISRCTN (52261229), and FWO (G.0274.08N).

Findings

1038 patients were assigned to the amoxicillin group and 1023 to the placebo group. Neither duration of symptoms rated "moderately bad" or worse (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.96–1.18; p = 0.229) nor mean symptom severity (1.69 with placebo vs 1.62 with amoxicillin; difference -0.07 [95% CI -0.15 to 0.007]; p = 0.074) differed significantly between groups. New or worsening symptoms were significantly less common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (162 [15.9%] of 1021 patients vs 194 [19.3%] of 1006; p = 0.043; number needed to treat 30). Cases of nausea, rash, or diarrhoea were significantly more common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (number needed to harm 21, 95% CI 11–174; p = 0.025), and one case of anaphylaxis was noted with amoxicillin. Two patients in the placebo group and one in the amoxicillin group needed to be admitted to hospital; no study-related deaths were noted. We noted no evidence of selective benefit in patients aged 60 years or older (n = 595).

Interpretation

When pneumonia is not suspected clinically, amoxicillin provides little benefit for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care both overall and in patients aged 60 years or more, and causes slight harms.

17 Information for Patients

Patients should be advised that amoxicillin may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the dose prescribed.
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.
Patients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.
Patients should be aware that amoxicillin contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = 0.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

Optimal amoxicillin dosage and frequency of administration for dual therapy

Since the introduction of penicillin, there have been disagreements about dosing and frequency of administration partially in response to the presence of microbial dormancy and the persister effect.– H. pylori infection is associated with a marked enhancement of the gastric penetration of amoxicillin, as confirmed with a xenograft model of human H. pylori infection. The fact that permeability of the large molecule, sucrose, is also enhanced during H. pylori infection and that enhancement is correlated with the density of the mucosal polymorphonuclear cell infiltration is consistent with the paracellular pathway being the site of increased permeability. Finally, Kimura et al. previously showed it was possible to cure H. pylori infections in humans with topical therapy consisting of a 1 h instillation of bismuth, amoxicillin, and metronidazole into balloon-occluded stomachs.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase-negative) strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:

Infections of the ear, nose, and throat - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β- hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Infections of the genitourinary tract - due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, or E. faecalis.

Infections of the skin and skin structure - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli.

Infections of the lower respiratory tract - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Gonorrhea, acute uncomplicated (ano-genital and urethral infections) - due to N. gonorrhoeae (males and females).

H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

Triple Therapy

Amoxicillin/Clarithromycin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

Dual Therapy

Amoxicillin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY section.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

Amoxicillin–clavulanate in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) — evidence and recommendation indicate no benefit and potential harm without carbapenems; in adjusted analyses, patients who received amoxicillin–clavulanate were less likely to have treatment success (aOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8) and more likely to die (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.1) compared with those who did not receive it, and "the addition of amoxicillin–clavulanate (without coadministration with carbapenems) to a regimen for MDR-TB does not appear to provide benefit". Conclusions state it "should not be used in MDR-TB treatment, except to provide clavulanate when using a carbapenem", and "amoxicillin–clavulanate must be given whenever carbapenems are included in an MDR-TB regimen"; the guideline further notes, "Our recommendation against the use of amoxicillin–clavulanate… is strong despite the evidence being judged to be of very low certainty".

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Head-to-head trials of antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^1161V98t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is defined by abnormal dilation of the airways related to a pathological mechanism of progressive airway destruction that is due to a 'vicious cycle' of recurrent bacterial infection, inflammatory mediator release, airway damage, and subsequent further infection. Antibiotics are the main treatment option for reducing bacterial burden in people with exacerbations of bronchiectasis and for longer-term eradication, but their use is tempered against potential adverse effects and concerns regarding antibiotic resistance. The comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of different antibiotics have been highlighted as important issues, but currently little evidence is available to help resolve uncertainty on these questions.

Objectives

To evaluate the comparative effects of different antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) through searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials and online trials registries, run 30 April 2018. We augmented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only, and unpublished data. We included adults and children (younger than 18 years) with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography or high-resolution computed tomography who reported daily signs and symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, or haemoptysis, and those with recurrent episodes of chest infection; we included studies that compared one antibiotic versus another when they were administered by the same delivery method.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction, and risk of bias. We assessed overall quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We made efforts to collect missing data from trial authors. We have presented results with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as mean differences (MDs) or odds ratios (ORs).

Main Results

Four randomised trials were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review - two studies with 83 adults comparing fluoroquinolones with β-lactams and two studies with 55 adults comparing aminoglycosides with polymyxins. None of the included studies reported information on exacerbations - one of our primary outcomes. Included studies reported no serious adverse events - another of our primary outcomes - and no deaths. We graded this evidence as low or very low quality. Included studies did not report quality of life. Comparison between fluoroquinolones and β-lactams (amoxicillin) showed fewer treatment failures in the fluoroquinolone group than in the amoxicillin group (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32; low-quality evidence) after 7 to 10 days of therapy. Researchers reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was eradicated in more participants treated with fluoroquinolones (Peto OR 20.09, 95% CI 2.83 to 142.59; low-quality evidence) but provided no evidence of differences in the numbers of participants showing improvement in sputum purulence (OR 2.35, 95% CI 0.96 to 5.72; very low-quality evidence). Study authors presented no evidence of benefit in relation to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁). The two studies that compared polymyxins versus aminoglycosides described no clear differences between groups in the proportion of participants with P aeruginosa eradication (OR 1.40. 95% CI 0.36 to 5.35; very low-quality evidence) or improvement in sputum purulence (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.85; very low-quality evidence). The evidence for changes in FEV₁ was inconclusive. Two of three trials reported adverse events but did not report the proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events, so we were unable to interpret the information.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited low-quality evidence favours short-term oral fluoroquinolones over beta-lactam antibiotics for patients hospitalised with exacerbations. Very low-quality evidence suggests no benefit from inhaled aminoglycosides verus polymyxins. RCTs have presented no evidence comparing other modes of delivery for each of these comparisons, and no RCTs have included children. Overall, current evidence from a limited number of head-to-head trials in adults or children with bronchiectasis is insufficient to guide the selection of antibiotics for short-term or long-term therapy. More research on this topic is needed.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^113pi1at]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; p = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Levofloxacin or clarithromycin-based quadruple regimens: what is the best alternative as first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori eradication in a country with high resistance rates for both antibiotics? [^117S9jwL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram negative, microaerophilic bacterium that is presumed to infect from one-third to over half of the world's population. It is known to be a major responsible for a significant number of gastric pathologies, but its role in extra-gastric diseases is also becoming well documented. H. pylori leads to an inflammatory state, induces molecular mimicry and alters the absorbance of several nutrients. These discoveries are increasing physicians' awareness to the need to eradicate this bacterium.

Initially, the adopted treatment to eradicate H. pylori, the so-called 'legacy' triple therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin was quite effective. However, in the last 10 years, its' efficacy has decreased to unacceptable levels in many countries, especially due to increasing levels of bacterial resistance. Excessive and misjudged use of antibiotics contributed to this decreased susceptibility, leading to 50% resistance rates to Clarithromycin in the central region of Portugal (primary 21.4%; secondary 88.3%). Accordingly, current guidelines recommend bismuth-containing quadruple therapies or, alternatively, sequential or non-bismuth quadruple therapy, if Clarithromycin resistance is above the 15–20% threshold. Unfortunately, H. pylori antibiotic resistance has reached alarming levels not only for macrolides but also to other drugs. Metronidazole resistance has been stable in Europe, reaching 34.9% of H. pylori isolates. Fortunately, its impact on the success of eradication regimens is limited, as it can be overcome by prolonging duration of treatment or increasing the dosage of Metronidazole. Despite obtaining adequate eradication rates, standard sequential treatment should not be prescribed if the combined Clarithromycin and Metronidazole resistance is over 5% (which is the case in several European countries). To overcome these problems, some physicians prefer prescribing an adapted sequential treatment with Levofloxacin instead of Clarithromycin, as quinolones have been suggested as an alternative in both first- and second-line regimens. Patients with reported history of penicillin allergy were also often prescribed with such regimens. Regrettably, resistance rates to quinolones also reached worrisome figures in Portugal and in Europe, reflecting its ubiquitous use for minor respiratory and urinary infections. According to Almeida et al, overall resistance to Levofloxacin in the center of Portugal is currently 33.9% (primary: 26.2%; secondary: 44.2%). Facing such adverse ecological scenario, our aim was to compare the efficacy of Clarithromycin and Levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapies as first-line treatment options and determine factors associated with treatment failure.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115VLjBL]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (> 10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^115iRYAH]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings are consistent with several earlier studies. A recent multi-centre randomised trial in the Netherlands showed narrow-spectrum treatment for moderately-severe CAP outside of the ICU was non-inferior to broad-spectrum treatment in terms of 90-day mortality. Although some previous studies using similar PS approaches reported increased mortality associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for CAP and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), these studies acknowledge this may arise from unmeasured confounders unavailable in their administrative databases, a limitation which we address by potentially adjusting more completely for confounding with our more detailed data.

Our study suggests wider use of narrow-spectrum agents may potentially be safe for the treatment of CAP requiring hospital admission. Across several thousand patients, within the assumptions made, there was no evidence that using amoxicillin rather than co-amoxiclav was harmful; while other data suggest this could reduce AMRand antibiotic-related adverse events. Empirical treatment based on clinical syndromes is by definition population-based, even if some stratification by disease severity is recommended, as in CAP guidelines (although, we did not find any evidence that our findings depended on pneumonia severity scores). However, clinicians and patients may be rightly concerned that they do not want to see individual patients deprived of potentially lifesaving treatment. This is common to all empirical antibiotic use, which balances such risks against AMR, rather than simply offering everyone the broadest possible, most likely to be active, treatment. Although our findings suggest that amoxicillin can probably be used to successfully treat more CAP than at present, better diagnostics to identify the causative organisms in CAP more often would also be useful, alongside other demographic and healthcare data, as a basis for generating personalised treatment recommendations, to ensure antibiotic resistant or atypical infections are appropriately treated.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112Wcxye]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid — empiric therapy considerations for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): The literature search did not identify any RCTs published since 2000 evaluating this agent, and a small prospective trial comparing IV amoxicillin–clavulanic acid plus metronidazole versus IV ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole found lower success rates with the amoxicillin–clavulanic acid regimen, although not statistically significant. An observational study from The Netherlands reported amoxicillin–clavulanic acid-resistant E. coli was increasingly common and use of this agent in such patients was associated with increased death. Susceptibility of E. coli to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was 50%–51%, only marginally better than ampicillin–sulbactam (45%–47%). Because of these efficacy and resistance concerns and lack of recent RCTs, the task force does not support use of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for empiric treatment of patients with IAI; IV preparation is not available in the United States.

### Elements of design: the knowledge on which we build [^113xLVhV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The time the free drug serum concentration of antibiotic remains above the pathogen MIC (T > MIC) determines bacteriological efficacy and emergence or selection of resistance for penicillin and amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Multiple studies in animal and in-vitro models now support this conclusion. The size of the T > MIC (the pharmacokinetic/-dynamic target) is > 40–50% to maximise antibacterial effect and pathogen eradication for Streptococcus pneumoniae and probably also Haemophilus influenzae. The size of the T > MIC for optimal antibacterial effect is changed by host immune status but not by bacterial inoculum or mechanism of resistance. There is good animal evidence to support the prediction that, as long as the target T > MIC is achieved, strains of S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of 0.016 mg/L will respond to amoxicillin in the same way as those with MICs of 1–2 mg/L. Emergence of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate in S. pneumoniae is related to low T > MIC (< 20%) and also to the degree of population heterogeneity to amoxicillin. Selection of resistant strains of S. pneumoniae is also related to T > MIC. Monte Carlo simulations based on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin with or without clavulanate in humans are needed to best predict the likely efficacy of different amoxicillin dosing regimens. This approach adequately allows the considerable pharmacokinetic variability in amoxicillin handling by infected patients to be accounted for as well as differences in pathogen beta-lactam susceptibility.

### Amoxicillin for acute lower respiratory tract infection in primary care: subgroup analysis by bacterial and viral aetiology [^115Uv8SE]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to assess the effects of amoxicillin treatment in adult patients presenting to primary care with a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) who were infected with a potential bacterial, viral, or mixed bacterial/viral infection.

Methods

This multicentre randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0–6), and illness deterioration (reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analysed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral, or combined infection, and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, or blood urea nitrogen.

Results

2058 patients (amoxicillin n = 1036; placebo n = 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n = 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n = 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n = 804) was reduced by 0.26 points (95% CI -0.48 to -0.03). The odds of illness deterioration (n = 2024) was 0.24 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.53) times lower from treatment with amoxicillin when both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were isolated (combined infection; n = 198).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin may reduce the risk of illness deterioration in patients with a combined bacterial and viral infection. We found no clinically meaningful benefit from amoxicillin treatment in other subgroups.
