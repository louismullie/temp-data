## Question

The area of an isosceles trapezoid is 32. The cotangent of the angle between the diagonal and the base is 2. Find the height of the trapezoid.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the height of an isosceles trapezoid given its area and the cotangent of the angle between a diagonal and the base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the area formula for a trapezoid and what variables are involved. Then, I should verify how the diagonal–base angle constraint translates into a relationship between height and bases. Next, I will set up a system of equations and solve for the height. Finally, I should double-check the solution and consider whether any assumptions or special cases might affect the result.

> Let me first confirm the area formula and the given information. The area A of a trapezoid is [(b₁ + b₂)h/2], where b₁ and b₂ are the lengths of the two parallel bases and h is the height. Here, A = 32, so [(b₁ + b₂)h/2] = 32, which simplifies to (b₁ + b₂)h = 64. I should keep that in mind as my first equation.

> Now, I need to interpret the diagonal–base angle constraint. The cotangent of the angle between a diagonal and the base is 2. In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are congruent, and the angle each diagonal makes with the longer base is the same. Let me consider the right triangle formed by the height, the projection of the diagonal onto the base, and the diagonal itself. Wait, let me verify the geometry: the horizontal leg of that right triangle is the projection of the diagonal along the base, and the vertical leg is the height h. So cot θ = [adjacent/opposite] = [projection/h] = 2, which implies the projection of the diagonal onto the base is 2h.

> Hold on, I should verify how the projection relates to the bases. In an isosceles trapezoid, the horizontal distance from a vertex to the foot of the perpendicular from the opposite vertex is [(b₁ − b₂)/2] when b₁ > b₂. The diagonal's horizontal projection spans this offset plus the shorter base, so the total projection equals [(b₁ − b₂)/2] + b₂ = [(b₁ + b₂)/2]. Therefore, [(b₁ + b₂)/2] = 2h, which gives b₁ + b₂ = 4h. I should double-check that this aligns with the isosceles symmetry, and yes, it does.

> Next, I should substitute this into the area equation. From earlier, (b₁ + b₂)h = 64, and now b₁ + b₂ = 4h, so substituting yields 4h · h = 64, which simplifies to 4h² = 64. Solving for h gives h² = 16, so h = 4. I should confirm that this is the only positive solution, and since height must be positive, h = 4 is the unique answer.

> Let me reconsider the steps to ensure there are no hidden assumptions. The derivation relies on the isosceles symmetry to equate the diagonal's horizontal projection to (b1 + b2)/2, and it assumes the angle in question is the acute angle between the diagonal and the longer base. If the angle were obtuse, the cotangent would be negative, which is not the case here, so the setup remains consistent with the given cot θ = 2. I should also note that the area and the angle constraint together uniquely determine the height, even though the individual base lengths are not specified, which is acceptable because the problem only asks for the height.

> Final answer: The height of the isosceles trapezoid is 4.

The height of the isosceles trapezoid is **4 units**. This is found by using the area formula and the cotangent condition to relate the bases and height, then solving for height. The key steps are: (1) express the sum of the bases in terms of height using cot θ = 2, and (2) substitute into the area formula to solve for height.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: define variables and given information

Let the isosceles trapezoid have:

- **Area**: (A = 32)
- **Height**: (h) (unknown)
- **Longer base**: (a)
- **Shorter base**: (b)
- **Diagonal**: (d)
- **Angle between diagonal and longer base**: (θ), with (cot θ = 2)

---

### Step 2: use the area formula

The area of a trapezoid is:

A = [1/2](a + b)h

Substitute the given area:

32 = [1/2](a + b)h ⇒ (a + b)h = 64 (Equation 1)

---

### Step 3: relate the bases to the height using the cotangent condition

In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the height and a horizontal segment. The horizontal leg is [(a + b)/2], so:

cot θ = [adjacent/opposite] = [(a + b)/2]/h = 2

Solve for (a + b):

[(a + b)/2] = 2h ⇒ a + b = 4h (Equation 2)

---

### Step 4: substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1

Substitute (a + b = 4h) into ((a + b)h = 64):

(4h)h = 64 ⇒ 4h² = 64 ⇒ h² = 16 ⇒ h = 4

---

### Step 5: verify the solution

With (h = 4), Equation 2 gives (a + b = 16), and the area is:

A = [1/2](16)(4) = 32

This matches the given area, confirming the solution.

---

The height of the isosceles trapezoid is **4 units**.

The experiments proceeded as follows. A specific height is imposed on the sample using the L-shaped plates and the sample is secured in this configuration by locking the sliders with the locking system. We use a tape measure at various positions along the circular edge of the tessellation to manually verify the uniformity of the sample height. We then capture a photo with each of the two cameras in the locked configuration. We repeat this process for eight different configurations, specifically imposing heights of 31.5 cm, 32 cm, 33 cm, 34 cm, 35 cm, 36 cm, 37 cm, and 37.5 cm. Finally, we estimate the relationship between the height and radius via post-processing of these photos.

Analysis of Arc-Morph origami

We introduce the family of Arc-Morph origami, such as the example shown in Fig. 3 A. This family generalizes the Arc-Miura crease patterns presented in refs. to include the non-developable vertex geometry from the family of Morph parallelogram-based origami introduced in ref. The unit cell of these periodic crease patterns is constructed from copies of a base vertex that is parameterized by the two independently chosen sector angles α and β. The three remaining vertices of the cell have identical or supplementary sector angles and the distinction in the present work is that the vertices are arranged to form trapezoid faces rather than parallelograms. We exclusively consider isosceles trapezoids to simplify analytic expressions, but our model applies to tessellations composed of more general trapezoids and with larger unit cells such as those shown in Fig. 1 B–D which contain increased numbers of faces. Thus, each of the trapezoids has two legs of length q, one base of length p, and one base of eitheror(see Fig. 3 B). This yields the three-dimensional design space (α, β, q / p) for Arc-Morph, where the magnitude of p dictates the scale of the system which has no role in our kinematic analysis.

Such a crease pattern has a a rigid folding mechanism that we parameterize via the dihedral angle γ from which the remaining dihedral angles shown in Fig. 3 C. (θ, θ ″ ≡ 2 π − θ, ψ, and ψ ″ ≡ 2 π − ψ) are determined. We compute the coarse-grained fundamental forms for a generic ground state then we use the mean curvature to determine the radius and the Jacobian to determine the characteristic height:We find the components of the fundamental forms exactly match those shown in Eqn. ((1), (2), (3)). We denote the number of cells in the azimuthal direction as N 1 and the number of cells in the axial direction as N 2, then identify the instantaneous bounds of the coordinates in our continuum approximation as 0 ≤ φ ≤ N 1 η (γ) and 0 ≤ z ≤ N 2 h (γ). Consequently, the configuration manifold is bounded by the closure condition of the faces γ = π shown in Fig. 3 F and the closure condition of the cylinder N 1 η = 2 π shown in Fig. 3 H. We find these conditions restrict the space of viable configurations and system sizes, but we do not provide a thorough exploration of the design space in this work. We write the explicit expressions for the geometry along the rigid folding mechanism in Methods, Arc-Morph Geometry. We show the radius as a function of the height along the configuration manifold in Fig. 3 E, and use the inset to highlight a change in slope after the cylinder reaches its maximum height as shown in Fig. 3 G. Since we have explicit formulae for the radius and the height, it is straightforward to expand the fundamental forms about infinitesimal changes to the dihedral angle γ along the rigid mechanism (see Supplementary Note 5). However, we utilize our framework for the rigid isometry to compare it with existing methods.

In addition to characterizing the kinematics, quantifying the stiffness of the breathing and shearing modes is important for the application of our theory towards origami engineering. Such modal stiffness is frequently modeled via a truss model with Hookean potentials for the folding, bending, and stretching of the panels. In contrast to our theory, such truss models utilize virtual creases across the diagonals of the panels to quantify panel bending. Since our theory attempts to directly model the deflection field of the panels instead, it may be possible to equate the stiffness associated with the vertex amplitudes and the face amplitudes with scaling relations based on the dimensions of the panels and the elastic moduli of the constituent material. This could be especially valuable for the design of impact mitigating origami crash-boxes that utilize trapezoidal faces. Our vision is to extend the utility of the computational design enabled by, e.g. ref.to include the target effective elastic behavior in addition to the target shapes.

We repeat this analysis for the nonrigid isometry which we cannot describe in terms of changes to the dihedral angles exclusively. Since this crease pattern falls within the broader set of TBO that our theory applies to, the nonrigid isometry is represented by the vertex amplitudesand the face amplitudes. We again integrate the changes in the lattice vectors and the lattice rotation matrices, then average according to our coarse-graining procedure to find:where we determine σ₁ and σ₂ directly fromandand find that the diagonal components of the strain vanish: ε φ φ = ε z z = 0. We confirm these quantities are self consistent with δ I φ z = δ I z φ = R² σ₁ + σ₂, δ I I φ z = δ I I z φ = R σ₁ without any adjustment to the averaging step of our coarse-graining procedure. Here, there is an apparent discrepancy regarding the units of σ 1 and σ 2: from dimensional analysis of Eqn. (7), σ 1 must have units of inverse area and σ 2 must be dimensionless. However, our calculations leading to Eqns. ((15), (16)) use a dimensionless face amplitude to simplify our calculations while the integration framework assumes the face amplitude has units of inverse length. This is in contrast to the vertex amplitudes which are always dimensionless. Introducing such a length scale, for example from the square root of the cell area, resolves the apparent discrepancy. The self consistency of our results relies on both the averaging process in our coarse-graining method and the inclusion of the Jacobian to transform from the discrete lattice coordinates to the continuous surface coordinates. While for the nonrigid isometries of parallelogram-based origami the averaging is also important, the Jacobian may be neglected because the ground states are quasi-planar.

The theory developed in the present work connects the discrete representation to the continuum representation of locally uniform isometric deformations in TBO, thereby characterizing their low-energy kinematics at the large scale. It remains to test this theory with more general trapezoid crease patterns via analytical or numerical calculations. However, the underlying principles extend to quadrilateral-mesh origami sheets without parallel edges, where the breathing mode and the shearing mode are coupled along the configuration manifold, as well as axisymmetric origami such as those in refs. –, where the size of the faces changes between cells so that the continuum theory may adopt a conformally flat metric. Furthermore, our methods extend to spatially varying isometries, such as those explored linearly for parallelogram-based origami, (see Supplementary Note 6) and nonlinearly for the cylindrical waterbomb origami, where the fundamental forms and their derivatives are intimately related via the Gauss-Codazzi equations in the continuum regime. Extending our work in this way provides a rich avenue for future investigations that seek to incorporate the large-scale response of origami tessellations into models based on elastic plate theory, where we anticipate sinusoidal variations of mean curvature in the bulk and finite amounts of Gaussian curvature localized towards the boundary of the system. We expect our approximation to improve as the number of cells increases, and the consistency between the response shown in Fig. 1 A–D with crease patterns that have increased numbers of faces in the unit cells, non-isosceles trapezoid faces, and domain walls with parallelogram faces showcases the robustness of our predictions. Furthermore, our focus on geometric mechanics suggests our theory scales with the system size and the isometries should be observable at the sub-millimeter scale on crease patterns fabricated using, e.g. two-photon lithography as used in ref.

### Utility of heidelberg retinal tomography as a screening tool for analyzing retinal nerve fiber layer defects [^115VFCrs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

All patients underwent a complete eye examination including slit lamp biomicroscopy of the ocular surface and anterior segment, gonioscopy, dilated fundus examination with a +78D/20D lens, as well as disc stereo photography.

All patients underwent clinical evaluation prior to imaging studies. Two experienced clinicians (DAB, JAD) evaluated in a masked fashion for presence of RNFL defects based on clinical examination as well as fundus stereophotographs. In addition, optic and RNFL analysis with HRT II was performed by experienced clinicians (MMI, ASH) to evaluate the presence of any RNFL defects. HRT II measures the surface of the optic disc and peripapillary retina and then estimates the retinal thickness as an indirect measurement of the nerve fiver layer, as described previously. In short, the instrument performs A-scan in 32 focal planes, constructs a three-dimensional map, and displays the information as two images: a topographical image and a reflectivity image. Each HRT II scan includes a three-scan series of a 10×10° frame and creates a composite image with a reference plane for data analysis. The mean topography of the three series was used for the analysis, and the contour line of the optic disc edge drawn by an experienced technician was used. RNFL defect dimensions, including the smallest and largest width along with the height, were measured using the scale provided by the HRT II reflectivity image, and the area of the defect was approximated into an isosceles trapezoid shape and calculated in mm 2. The area of defect was converted to the average retinal arterial width by dividing the calculated area by the square of the average width of the imaged retinal arteriole (0.1912 mm 2).

All patients underwent standard 24–2 or 30–2 achromatic Humphrey visual field analysis (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) with an SITA (Swedish interactive threshold algorithm) standard or full threshold protocol. A reliable visual field test was defined as one with < 10% false positive response, < 5% false negatives, and < 20% fixation losses. A retrospective chart review was performed to collect the demographic details as well as current Humphrey visual field analysis. Student's t -test statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS ® Statistics version 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).

Introduction

Origami sheets are two-dimensional surfaces with predefined creases that control their three-dimensional response to mechanical loads –. The fundamental principle behind the behavior of origami is the difference between the energy scales of elastic deformations that bend the panels (cubic in sheet thickness) and elastic deformations that stretch the panels (linear in sheet thickness). This scaling leads to a quasi-static, low-energy response dominated by the deformations that do not stretch the panels, which we refer to as linear isometries. Since this principle relies solely on the thickness of the sheet, the linear isometries corresponding to a particular crease pattern are largely material independent and therefore realizable in both metallic – and polymeric – materials over a range of length scales. Hence, an understanding of the origami kinematics tends to be more consequential than an understanding of the origami dynamics for the design of origami metamaterials. There are two specific applications of origami kinematics that motivate our work.

The first application of interest is the class of isometries referred to as rigid folding mechanisms that fold the origami sheet along its predefined creases while keeping the panels entirely rigid (no stretching or bending). These rigid folding mechanisms are useful for the deployment and transformation of structures found in various engineering applications including solar arrays, heart stents, and temporary shelters. However, arbitrary quadrilateral-mesh crease patterns are not rigidly foldable and a significant body of work is devoted towards the development of design principles –. Moreover, arbitrary loads can lead to heterogeneous actuation of the mechanism, as well as undesirable deformations due to the existence of isometries distinct from the rigid folding mechanismor the intersection of separate branches in the configuration space. Therefore, efficient models for the response to external loads can inform the methods for deployment and transformation of origami structures along the programmed rigid mechanism without exciting undesirable responses via alternative low-energy instabilities.

Discussion

Our work develops analytical expressions for the large-scale low-energy deformations of rigidly foldable TBO and demonstrates the validity of our theory through experiment. We identify TBO as an architecture for control of shearing and breathing modes of surfaces through the geometry of the underlying crease pattern. Hence, our results distinguish tessellations with trapezoid faces from those with parallelogram faces and help to establish the classification of crease geometries according to their large-scale response. This classification can be utilized for more efficient inverse design by constraining the design space according to which types of modes are compatible with the target behavior. Interestingly, we find the mountain/valley assignment controls the sign of the slope of the height-radius profile in the same way that the assignment controls the Poisson's ratio of parallelogram-based origami. This helps narrow the design space to β = π − α (Arc-Miura) for applications that require a radius increasing with height, β = α (Arc-eggbox) for a radius decreasing with height, and somewhere in between (Arc-Morph) for a non-monotonic profile. These results showcase new functionality for origami as mechanical metamaterials, either as thin-walled structures with target stiffnesses or tubular coverings for snake-like robots, cables, and other long one-dimensional assemblies. Further development is required for the experimental demonstration of isometries in non-developable TBO, as well as the quantitative validation of the rigid isometry near the flattened state and the nonrigid isometry along the configuration manifold. We note that the nonrigid isometries of parallelogram-based origami still require the development of an experimental apparatus for their quantitative validation. For both trapezoid- and parallelogram-based tessellations, such an experiment requires careful attention to the loading mechanism so that the mode of interest is isolated and to the measurement system so that displacements are accurately tracked through three-dimensional space.

Methods

Coarse-graining

We coarse-grain the ground states of a periodic origami tessellation by averaging its primitive lattice vectors over all admissible primitive unit cells to determine the coarse-grained tangent vectors of the tessellation. We do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice vectors over the copies of a standard unit cell that change which vertex is located at the origin and denote the result. For example, one copy has vertex a at the origin with lattice vectors pointing between vertex a in adjacent cells and another copy has vertex b at the origin with lattice vectors pointing between vertex b in adjacent cells. Second, we average these copies between adjacent cells so that the forwards and backwards tangent vectors are equal and opposite. This yields our definition for the coarse-grained tangent vectors:Additionally, we average the cell-to-cell change in the primitive lattice vectors over all admissible primitive unit cells to determine the change in the coarse-grained tangent vectors. We do this by averaging over the change in the tangent vector defined in Eqn. (17) from an initial cell to the subsequent cell and from the previous cell to the initial cell so that the forwards and backwards derivatives of the tangent vectors are equal and opposite. Since the change in the tangent vectors is given by the action of the lattice rotation matrix or its inverse, this yields our definition for the derivative of the coarse-grained tangent vectors:These partial derivatives satisfy ∂ μ t ν = ∂ ν t μ. The indices of Eqns. ((17), (18)) remain the cell indices (n 1, n 2). We transform to the continuous surface coordinatesvia the Jacobian. For the trapezoid-based origami crease patterns we consider, we have, and Jφ₂ = Jz₁ = 0, where η is the lattice rotation angle and h is the magnitude of the second lattice vector.

We similarly coarse-grain the infinitesimal deformation of the periodic origami tessellation generated from a homogeneous isometry by averaging the corresponding lattice displacement (Δ μ) and lattice angular velocity (L μ) over all primitive unit cells. We again do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice displacement and lattice angular velocity over the same set of standard unit cells used to computeabove. Here, there are an additional four copies of each standard cell distinguished by the orientation of the frame for each of the four corners that meet at the vertex set at the origin. We denote the resultsand. Second, we expand Eqns. ((17), (18)) in terms of these quantities:Again, the partial derivatives satisfy δ ∂ μ t ν = δ ∂ ν t μ and we transform from the discrete cell indices to the continuous surface coordinates via the Jacobian. While we do not compute an embedding directly, this procedure is sufficient to compute the fundamental forms and characterize the geometry of the origami tessellations. These methods extend to the crease patterns shown in Fig. 1 C, D that are not periodic in the azimuthal direction but are still composed of cellular building blocks by performing the first step of our averaging between analogous, but nonequivalent, vertices in both the forward and backwards directions.

We provide more clarity on these modes by developing unit cell compatibility conditions for the class of TBO with parallel edges that alternate in length. Rather than triangulating the crease pattern as frequently done in previous works –, we separately consider folding degrees of freedom on the vertices, denoted by the vertex amplitudes, and bending degrees of freedom on the faces, denoted by the face amplitudes(see Methods, Linear Isometry Model) as introduced in ref.for the special case of parallelogram-based origami. The amplitude on a vertex maps to changes in the dihedral angles, which are not required to be uniform along the edge unless the isometry is rigid. Instead, a gradient in the folding along a crease generates bending of the adjacent faces, as quantified by the respective face amplitudes. For this reason, constraints on the face amplitudes can be integrated out, thereby yielding compatibility conditions that map from vertex amplitudes to vertex constraints which we illustrate via the compatibility diagrams shown in Fig. 1 A–D(iv). Here, each node is assigned a vertex amplitude and the line style of the edges indicate coupling coefficients that depend on the crease geometry (see Supplementary Note 4). When the coupling coefficients are uniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 A(iv), the rigid mode (for all faces) is represented by uniform assignment of vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). In contrast, when the coupling coefficients are nonuniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 B(iv), the vertex amplitudes of the rigid mode are proportional to one another to ensure the folding is uniform along the creases. In either case, we find that this family of TBO always exhibits a nonrigid mode represented by uniform face amplitudes (for all faces) and zero vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). Since the breathing (shearing) mode is generated by the rigid (nonrigid) isometry, its modal stiffness depends entirely on the stiffness of the creases (faces). This representation of the isometries effectively integrates the three-dimensional geometry out of the analysis to enable a succinct analytical classification of the modes.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

Light interception

To calculate the light l intercepted by each foliage, a ray-tracing numerical method is used. It is assumed that shadow cast by segments can be neglected, and that sunlight is uniformly distributed in the upper hemisphere, which is divided into 32 equal solid angles. For each solid angle, the whole forest is rotated, such that z is along the mean direction of the solid angle. Foliages are then ordered by descending z and the (x, y) position of each foliage is discretised onto a grid of L × L squares. When different foliages belong to the same grid square, the highest one receives 1/32 of light, the second highest α fol. /32, the third, etc. where α fol. = 0.5 is the optical transparency of foliages. This procedure is repeated for each of the 32 solid angles and gives a good approximation of the total light interception with a numerical scheme that scales as N log(N), with N the number of foliages. Note that the slowest part of this algorithm is to sort foliage heights, for which a quicksort algorithm is used.

Branching angles

New child segments are added by following geometrical rules based on three angles: θ 1, θ 2 and γ, (Fig. 1d). For a given parent segment oriented in the direction of the unit vector t and normal to the unit vector b (for the trunk, b is a random unit vector in the horizontal plane), two child segments of length L are constructed in the plane normal to b. Their tangential unit vectors t 1 and t 2 are obtained by rotating t with the angles θ 1 + ϵ δθ and θ 2 + ϵ δθ around b. For a given tree, angles θ 1 and θ 2 are two constants, δθ = 10°, and ϵ is a normal random variable with standard deviation 1. The normal vectors b 1 and b 2 defining the next-generation branching planes are obtained by rotating b with an angle γ + ϵ δθ around t 1 and t 2, respectively.

Fluid walls adapt during flow

In conventional devices, channels have fixed cross-sections; in contrast, heights of FF conduits adapt in response to changing pressures above unaltered footprints. If the cross-sectional area along the conduit in Fig. 2e is approximated by a segment of a circle, then its radius of curvature specifies the Laplace pressure across the interface (Supplementary Fig. 5). To a first approximation, curvature at each end of the conduit (R conduit) may be obtained by assuming pressures at bases of source and sink drops are equal to pressures in the conduit near inlet and outlet respectively. The pressure drop across the conduit interface, assuming conduit height is small relative to drop height, is (Eq. 1; see Supplementary Note 1 for details):

Because conduit height decreases with local pressure, the cross-sectional area of the conduit is predicted to decrease in the direction of flow. Table 2 provides some examples; a conduit (width 600 µm) connecting 5- and 10-µl drops has center-line heights at inlet and exit (where heights are h 1 and h 2) respectively of ∼44 and 30 μm, contact angles of ∼17 and 11°, and cross-sectional areas of ∼18,000 and 12,000 μm 2. As liquids are incompressible, volumetric flow rate must be the same at each cross-section along the conduit. Therefore, mean flow velocity increases in the direction of flow as cross-sectional area decreases, and – in this example – continuity dictates that it increases ∼1.3-fold from conduit inlet to exit as fluid walls change their shape accordingly. Here, effects of gravity on conduit and drop interfaces are ignored.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^113HxmTP]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

Through simple geometric calculations, the azimuth and elevation angles of a hidden scene point can be estimated from the slope and height of the illuminated right trapezoidal region of the observation. However, spatially extended hidden scenes do not create sharp shadows. They instead produce a superposition thereof, that is dependent on the geometry of the scene from the vantage of the observed ceiling portion, appearing as a region of highly informative penumbra(see Fig. 2 a for an example photograph of penumbra). The penumbra region encodes information about the geometry of the hidden scene from the perspective of the ceiling, along two dimensions (i.e. in azimuth and elevation angles). Efficiently extracting this information for reconstructing a general spatially extended scene is achievable through a computational algorithm presented later on.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^114BCwDn]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### A new safe and ergonomic manipulation tool for the flank-free supine position: "U-pad" [^112akfVF]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: One of the most important problems in the supine percutaneous approach to the kidney is the narrow surgical surface area (SSA) in the lumbar region. Herein, the spatial and angular geometric advantages of the U-shaped lumbar pad (U-Pad) used as a new positioning tool for safety and ergonomics in the supine percutaneous approach have been revealed. Materials and Methods: Data of patients who underwent endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (ECIRS) using the U-Pad for kidney stones between March and September 2021 were prospectively collected. The demographic, preoperative, operative, and postoperative data of patients have been saved. The patients were positioned first with the standard gel pad (group 1) and then with the U-Pad (group 2). Both SSA (X and X+Y, cm 2) and angular degree (α and β,°) calculations were compared. Fluoroscopy images with the same settings (97kV/3.00mA) were visually compared. In geometric data, trapezoidal area formula [(upper base + lower base)×height/2] and goniometer were used to compare with paired t -test. Results: ECIRS was performed on 17 patients, 13 men and 4 women, with a median age of 39 (range 32–47). The median body mass index was 26.2 (23.5–29.1). Stone localization and features were recorded. The median SSA was calculated as 35.7cm 2 in group 1 and 97.3cm 2 in group 2, and it was calculated that the total SSA increased to 272.5% with a median of 61.6cm 2 extra surgical area. Similarly, the downward manipulation angle was 32° (α°) in group 1, whereas it was 60.6° (β°) in group 2, and the median extra motion angle was calculated as 28.6° (89.3%). Conclusion: The U-Pad is a safe and rapid tool in the supine percutaneous approach to the kidney, providing at least two times the extra SSA and manipulation angle.

### Measuring osteotomy wedge angle is more important than measuring wedge height in open wedge osteotomies around the knee in preoperative planning [^114CjzPn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Medial open wedge proximal tibial osteotomy is planned following lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Per case, 27 osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and nine hinge points (A–C). Osteotomy entry points as well as hinge points were determined in a standardized fashion in a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Twenty‐one variations of DFO, each combining a different hinge and entry point, were planned to adjust the WBL to align with 50.0% of the tibial plateau's width, measured from the medial edge of the plateau (Figure 3). Conversely, a standardized coordinate system was defined to determine hinge and entry points (Figure 3). Osteotomy B7 was considered the optimal hinge position.

Figure 3
Lateral open wedge distal femur osteotomy is planned after initial lower limb deformity analysis using the mediCAD® software. Twenty‐one osteotomy variants were planned utilizing three osteotomy entry points and seven hinge points (A–C). Points were determined standardized on a coordinate system based on anatomic landmarks (a).

Of each planned osteotomy, the osteotomy depth and wedge height were measured manually. The widths of the tibia and femur were measured at their widest diameters, parallel to the tibial or femoral joint line. The correction angle, as well as the mechanical lateral distal femur angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibia angle (MPTA), joint line convergence angle (JLCA) and mFA‐mTA, were calculated using the mediCAD® software.

Mathematical prediction of wedge height

The wedge height was calculated using a formula based on the correction angle and osteotomy depth. In opening osteotomies, the wedge forms an isosceles triangle comprising two congruent right‐angled triangles, with the hypotenuses representing the osteotomy depth and the alpha angle being half the opening angle. Wedge height, calculated using the sine function, is the sum of the opposite sides relative to the hinge point (Figure 4). Example calculations are in Table 1. The wedge height was both manually measured and mathematically calculated, and deviations were determined.

Figure 4
The osteotomy wedge is an isosceles triangle consisting of two identical congruent right‐angled triangles. Using the sine function, the wedge height can be calculated as displayed.

### Exact, time-dependent analytical equations for spiral trajectories and matching gradient and density-correction waveforms [^115DJXVP]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of "vector" trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### 3D-printed spines for programmable liquid topographies and micromanipulation [^112synWD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Experimental measurements of the interface position have been done by optical means. Figure 2 a plots the heights h in orange and h v in purple dots as a function of the unit cell area A function for 12 square lattices. All lattices are 3D printed with fixed spine shapes (R = 0.2 mm and α = 1.15°) and varying lattice spacing a. The range of geometrical parameters is constrained by the 3D printing method used. Although the 3D printer has a specified resolution of 16 μ m, our experimental tests have demonstrated that we can print spines with a base distance as small as 0.3 mm. If this distance is reduced further, the gap between the spines becomes too small, causing complications during the 3D printing process and potentially resulting in the individual spines sticking together. Consequently, the chosen lattice spacing a and base radius R are determined by the limitations of our methodology. The 3D-printed material and the fluids determine the contact angle. For the air-water interface, we measured a contact angle of θ = 53° on our spines. For small lattice spacing a, h and h v are quite similar, while the difference between those couples of points seems to increase with the unit cell area A. High water elevations h up to 5–6 mm are reached with small lattice spacing. This order of magnitude is comparable to the capillary rise in a millimeter tube as given by Jurin's law.

### Trapezial space height after trapeziectomy: mechanism of formation and benefits [^116gNQPX]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Seventy-three thumbs in 67 women with osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint were assessed prospectively. The patients were randomly allocated for treatment by either trapeziectomy alone (n = 26) or trapeziectomy with tendon interposition (n = 23) or ligament reconstruction (n = 24). A K-wire was passed through the thumb metacarpal base and across the trapezial space into the distal pole of the scaphoid in all procedures; this held the base of the metacarpal away from the scaphoid for 4 weeks. Standard thumb radiographs were used to calculate the trapezial space ratio before surgery and at 1-year follow-up examination. The trapezial space ratio decreased significantly from a preoperative mean of 0.40 (range, 0.20–0.56) to a mean of 0.18 (range, 0.08–0.30) after trapeziectomy, 0.16 (range, 0.07–0.30) after trapeziectomy with tendon interposition, and 0.20 (range, 0.00–0.33) after trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction. There was no significant difference between these 1-year follow-up trapezial space ratios, suggesting that the placement of a K-wire across the trapezial void is as effective as tendon interposition or ligament reconstruction in creating a trapezial space in the short term at least. However, the need to create a trapezial space and maintain thumb length is questioned because the trapezial space height did not correlate with thumb strength at 1-year follow-up examination.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^113nmvmH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Among all possible choices of coordinate systems, the proposed projected-elevation spherical coordinate system leads to a natural representation of the hidden scene where almost all parameters of the hidden scene will be information orthogonal. A geometric depiction of the information orthogonality property among the angular parameters, θ and ψ, is provided in Fig. 1 d, e, as well as in Supplementary Movie 1. To achieve information orthogonality, the proposed coordinate system is constructed such that its angular coordinates, (θ, ψ), each pivot about one of the vertical and horizontal occluding edges of the doorway. Much like how polar (or cylindrical) coordinates are natural for the corner cameraand its variants, the projected-elevation spherical coordinate system is natural for TERI. Because single-edge corner cameras exploit a vertical occluding edge for resolution, a point source moving in the hidden scene changes only the observed penumbra shape when it moves only along the azimuth (pivoting about the vertical edge). Conversely, range-only motion produces subtle intensity changes in the penumbra, due to radial falloff effects, while the overall penumbra shape is unchanged. The projected-elevation spherical coordinate system, therefore, represents a combination of two orthogonal corner camera systems resulting from two orthogonal edges of the doorframe. In this two-edge configuration, a hidden scene point source will produce a sharp shadow resembling the top and slanted edges of a right trapezoid (see example observations shown in Fig. 1 d, e). Representing the hidden scene point in the proposed coordinate system, changes in the slope of the slanted edge of the shadow are due exclusively to point source motion along azimuth θ (with pivot at the vertical occluding edge). Conversely, changes in the position of the top edge of the shadow are due exclusively to source motion along the projected-elevation angle ψ (with pivot at the horizontal occluding edge). This apparent decoupling of how changes in θ and ψ affect the measurement ensures that errors in any one of the angular coordinates will not impact our estimation of the other. Because the elevation is defined in the plane containing the azimuth, however, this phenomenon does not occur in a spherical coordinate system.

### Considerable variation in current coronoid height and fracture measurement techniques: a systematic review [^112iFbE6]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronoid fractures usually occur in the presence of a significant osseoligamentous injury to the elbow. Fracture size and location correlate with degree of instability and many authors have attempted to analyze the effect of fracture variation on decision making and outcome. There remains no standardized technique for measuring coronoid height or fracture size. The aim of this study was to appraise the literature regarding techniques for coronoid height measurement in order to understand variation.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. A search was performed to identify studies with either a description of coronoid height, fracture size, or bone loss using the terms (Coronoid) AND (Measurement) OR (Size) OR (Height). Articles were shortlisted by screening for topic relevance based on title, abstract and, if required, full-text review. Exclusion criteria were non-English articles, those on nonhuman species or parts other than the ulna coronoid process, and studies that included patients with pre-existing elbow pathology. Shortlisted articles were grouped based on study type, imaging modality, measurement technique, and measurement parameter as well as its location along the coronoid.

Results

Thirty out of the initially identified 494 articles met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one articles were clinical studies, 8 were cadaveric studies, and 1 combined patients as well as cadavers. A variety of imaging modalities (plain radiographs, 2-dimensional computed tomography [CT], 3-dimensional CT, magnetic resonance imaging or a combination of these) were used with CT scan (either 2-dimensional images or 3-dimensional reconstructions or both) being the most common modality used by 21 studies. Measurement technique also varied from uniplanar linear measurements in 15 studies to multiplanar area and volumetric measurements in 6 studies to techniques describing various angles and indices as an indirect measure of coronoid height in 8 studies. Across the 30 shortlisted studies, 19 different measurement techniques were identified. Fifteen studies measured normal coronoid height while the other 15 measured intact coronoid and/or fracture fragment height. The location of this measurement was also variable between studies with measurements at the apex of the coronoid in 24/30 (80%) of studies. Measurement accuracy was assessed by only 1 study. A total of 12/30 (40%) studies reported on the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of their measurement technique.

Conclusion

The systemic review demonstrated considerable variability between studies that report coronoid height or fracture size measurements. This variability makes comparison of coronoid height or fracture measurements and recommendations based on these between studies unreliable. There is need for development of a consistent, easy to use, and reproducible technique for coronoid height and bone loss.

### A new double trapezoid-shaped osteotomy for reduction malarplasty [^114Hibam]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Various surgical techniques have been introduced and developed for the reduction of wide zygomatic bone. However, the previous methods have several disadvantages, including the following: potential cheek droop, a limited amount of possible volume reduction, an unfavorable contour due to nonunion, and limited inward repositioning of the zygomatic arch. Thus, the authors introduce an effective method to overcome the limitations and disadvantages of other previous reduction malarplasty techniques.

Methods

From March of 2010 to May of 2014, 532 women and 152 men underwent reduction malarplasty using a double trapezoid-shaped osteotomy. This method was created by making both 1 trapezoid-shaped osteotomy line that consisted of 2 oblique and 1 transverse line in the frontal view, and a second trapezoid-shaped osteotomy line, which consisted of 2 oblique osteotomies made to be slightly broader in the cross-sectional view.

Results

Reduction malarplasty with double trapezoid-shaped osteotomy was successfully performed in all patients. No severe complications were observed. There were some minor complications. In most patients, a wide midface with prominent malar eminences was reshaped into a slender contour.

Conclusions

A double trapezoid-shaped osteotomy for reduction malarplasty might be a more effective method to overcome the limitations of other previous techniques. The prominent malar eminences can be reduced effectively without major complications, and moreover, the cheek area can be induced to have an upward lifting and a 3-dimensional convexity of the midface.

The area of the whole retina and the retina up to the equator. These dimensions were derived from a textbook. c. The areas in S are equal to the areas of circles with radii of 18.6 mm and 15.6 mm, calculated via the formula presented in (a)

The scatter PRP normally stops at the retinal equator. The retinal area up to the equator corresponds to the area of a circle with a radius of 15.6 mm (Fig. 1 c). PRP was conducted without photocoagulation of the vascular arcade region and the optic disc. We set the PRP-free area as a circle with a radius of 5 mm, with a surface area equal to the area of a circle with a radius of 5.14 mm (Fig. 2). We assumed that the size of the spot on the retina was 400 μm, and that the spacing between each circle was equivalent to one spot.

### Spotlight on topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps: a review [^116bisnm]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Topographical mapping by muscle

The third aspect is the anatomical body region of interest. It should be noted that current topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps have been empirically constructed based on clinical aspects of the conditions associated with the body area of interest. In fact, topographical pain maps have been created for individual, for example, temporalis, trapezius, or infraspinatus, and for body regions, for example, shoulder, elbow, head, or lower limbs.

For the neck–shoulder region, the trapezius muscle has attracted a lot of attention. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the first study reporting topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps was conducted in 2005. For the trapezius, the following 11 points were originally used: 1) suboccipital musculature, 2) transverse process of C5, 3) transverse process of C7, 4) middle point between the spinous process of C7 and the acromion, 5) 2 cm superior to the superior angle of the scapula, 6) superior angle of the scapulae, 7) 1 cm medial to the acromion–clavicular joint, 8) 3 cm superior to the middle of the spinae of the scapula, 9) 2 cm distal to the middle of the spinae of the scapula, 10) middle point between the spinous process of T4 and medial border of the spinae of the scapula, and 11) middle point between spinous process of T6 and medial border of the spinae of the scapula(Figure 1A). The topographical map of the trapezius has been extended to 32, 36, and 48 points, respectively, covering the sole trapezius, the trapezius including the postural neck region and the trapezius, the postural neck region and the spinal processes. In these alternative maps, the distance between C7 and the acromion was used to define the PPT maps. A distance of one sixth of the C7–acromion distance was used with the exception of the four points located over the posterior–lateral part of the neck (here the horizontal distance was set to one seventh of the C7–acromion distance). The distance between the adjacent point and the acromion and the distance between the points over the spinal processes and the muscle points were set to one twelfth of the C7–acromion distance.

### Computer-based comparison of different methods for selecting mitral annuloplasty ring size [^116H5swH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The sizing results according to intercommissural distance (strategy 2) and AML surface area (strategy 5) led to the same sizing results in 14 patients (33%). For AML height (strategy 1) und AML surface area (strategy 5), ring sizing was equal in 10 patients (23%). In 4 patients (9%), the sizing results were equal according to AML height (strategy 1) and intercommissural distance (strategy 2). Note that in only 2 of the 43 patients (5%), the ring sizing in all methods was equal (see Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Sizing results for each patient according to the true sizing strategies: intercommissural distance, AML height, and AML surface area

The actually used intraoperative method to size the mitral valve as conducted by surgeons are not documented. However, the mean size of the used mitral annuloplasty rings was 32.11 ± 2.44 and no obvious relation was found between the implanted rings and the virtually proposed rings. From our results, the outcome of AML surface area sizing method (mean = 32.7 ± 3.29) has its closest relationships to the actual implanted ring size.

### Trapezial space height measurement after trapeziectomy: a comparison of the use of standard and stress radiographs [^116s1pR2]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess whether the behavior of the trapezial space under stress after excision of the trapezium and insertion of a K-wire to hold the thumb metacarpal base away from the distal pole of the scaphoid for 4 weeks is improved by either palmaris longus interposition or ligament reconstruction (LRTI).

Methods

The trapezial space height and trapezial space ratios were assessed on 50 pairs of standard and stress views obtained 1 year after trapeziectomy. Seventeen of the 50 thumbs had simple trapeziectomy, 15 had trapeziectomy plus LRTI and 18 had trapeziectomy with palmaris longus tendon interposition. The reproducibility of these measurements also was assessed.

Results

The 95% limits of agreement for intra- and interobserver differences in the measurement of the trapezial space height were -1 to +1 mm and -2 to +1 mm, respectively. The mean differences between the trapezial heights on the standard and stress radiographs were 1.6 mm (SD, 2.5) for simple trapeziectomy, 1.2 mm (SD, 3.1) for trapeziectomy and LRTI, and 1.2 mm (SD, 2.4) for trapeziectomy with interposition of palmaris longus. The differences between the trapezial space height and trapezial space ratios on the standard and stress radiographs after the 3 different surgeries were not notably different.

Conclusions

Neither the creation of a suspensory ligament nor palmaris longus tendon interposition, as opposed to the isolated placement of a K-wire across the trapezial void for 4 weeks, alters the behavior of the trapezial space under stress at the 1-year follow-up examination. It is thus appropriate to use standard radiographs at the 1-year follow-up examination to assess and compare the trapezial space after these different techniques of trapeziectomy.

### An alternative isovelocity surface model for quantitation of effective regurgitant orifice area in mitral regurgitation with an elongated orifice application to functional mitral regurgitation [^1178SuAw]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to develop and test a simple, clinically practical alternative isovelocity surface (ISVS) model for calculating effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) in mitral regurgitation (MR) when the regurgitant orifice is elongated, such as in functional MR.

Background

Clinical experience and 3-dimensional imaging suggest that the traditional hemispheric ISVS model used in the conventional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) calculation is invalid in certain MR cases and can cause erroneous EROA values.

Methods

Our ISVS model consisted of 3 sections of equal radius (R): a cylindrical midsection of length (L) positioned between 2 hemispheroidal end sections. Total ISVS area (T(S)) is equal to 2πR(2) + πLR and EROA is equal to (V(N/)V(CW))T(S), where V(N) is the flow velocity crossing perpendicular to the ISVS, and V(CW) is the peak MR jet velocity by continuous-wave Doppler. This EROA was corrected for any obtuse angle, θ formed by tented leaflets, by multiplying T(S) by a planar factor, (θ/180) or a combination of this planar factor for the cylindrical midsection and the solid-angle factor, 1-cos(θ/2), for the 2 spheroidal end sections. In 24 cases of severe or 3+ functional MR, we calculated EROA using 3 traditional hemispheric surfaces and 3 alternative ISVS models that differed in the leaflet angle correction applied. Results were compared with continuity-based EROA using the standard mitral valve - aortic valve stroke volume method and with predictions based upon theoretical geometric considerations.

Results

The mean differences between continuity EROA and ISVS area-based EROA for no angle correction, planar correction, or combined angle correction were, respectively, 0.38, 0.32, and 0.28 cm(2) for the 3 spherical surface models and 0.17, 0.018, and -0.012 cm(2) for the 3 alternative 3-section ISVS models. The empiric EROA results with both the traditional spherical and alternative ISVS models agreed well with theoretical geometric predictions.

Conclusions

The traditional spherical PISA model underestimates EROA in functional MR. For elongated MR orifices, an ISVS model that mirrors orifice shape yields more accurate EROA values. Correction to the ISVS area for obtuse leaflet angulation improves accuracy of EROA estimation.

### The concept of ideal lips of caucasian female: an anthropometric analysis of the lower third of the face [^113zUSzB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The demand for lip-redefining procedures has been rising in recent years, thus creating the need for reliable and detailed reference sources on aesthetic female lips. This study investigates the morphology of the lower third of the face, including the lips and jawline, of attractive young Caucasian females.

Methods

A semi-automatic photogrammetric analysis of the faces of professional female photograph models (n = 400) of the Caucasian race aged 18–39 was performed. Angular, linear, and surface area parameters were evaluated. A graphical summarization of the average facial shape of all analyzed attractive females was generated as an average body contours (ABC) image.

Results

The height of the lower third of the face equaled 0.32 ± 0.02 of the total facial height. The average lip width was 48.06 ± 3.34 mm. The upper vermilion height was found to be significantly lower than the lower vermilion height (6.47 ± 1.36 vs. 11.64 ± 1.46 mm, p < 0.01). The lip obliquity angle was found to be 1.05° ± 0.79°. The area surface of the upper lip vermilion was considerably smaller than the vermilion of the lower lip (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

This is one of the largest studies on attractive Caucasian females' lips and lower face morphology. The data it provides, including the graphical presentation of the aesthetic lower face as an ABC image, may provide physicians with valuable guidelines for lips rejuvenation and reconstruction procedures.

### A flexible readout mechanism of human sensory representations [^114CcbkF]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We computed event-related responses for each trial type using a finite-impulse response model. We assumed each combination of different base strengths for contrast and coherence evoked a different hemodynamic response and responses that overlapped in time summed linearly. Because each visual stimulus was lateralized in one half of the visual field, we assumed that they evoked a response only in contralateral retinotopic areas. There were four base increments for contrast (+7.5, +15, +30, and +60%) and four base increments for coherence (+15, +30, +45, and +60%), which were independently manipulated, resulting in 32 total conditions (4 contrast × 4 coherences × 2 task conditions). To model these data, we used the following equation:where y was an n × 1 column vector (n = number of volumes) containing the measured hemodynamic response for one hemifield of one visual area in a single observer. X was an n × (k × c) stimulus convolution matrix (c = number of conditions, k = length in volumes of hemodynamic response to calculate), β was a (k × c) × 1 column vector to be estimated, and ϵ the residual variance (assumed to be 0 mean Gaussian). Each block of k columns in X corresponded to one of the c conditions. These blocks contained a one in the first column at the starting volume of each occurrence of a trial of that condition and zeroes elsewhere. Each of the subsequent k columns was then shifted downwards by one to form a Toeplitz matrix for that condition. In total, X had n rows, equal to the length of the BOLD timeseries (for most observers, n was 13,184), and 2592 columns (k = 81 × c = 32, where k was chosen to compute 40.5 s of response and the c conditions were the 4 contrast base strengths × 4 coherence base strengths × 2 tasks). By computing the least-squares estimate of the column vector β, we obtained the estimated event-related response to each condition accounting linearly for overlap in time. On every trial, one dot patch was at a base strength and one had an additional increment. To equate difficulty throughout the task, we allowed the additional increments to vary continuously via staircasing. To simplify the estimation problem and to improve statistical power, we rounded the base + increment values to the nearest base strength. The choice of number of volumes of response k to compute did not change the result as long as it was sufficiently large to capture the full hemodynamic response. The Pearson's correlation of the first 41 volumes between an analysis with k = 41 (20.5 s of response) and k = 81 (40.5 s of response) was r = 0.97. Because we randomized trial presentation, we assessed multicollinearity by checking that the stimulus convolution matrices (see below) were full rank and that the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix were small (< 0.1% of off-diagonal elements were > 10% of the on-diagonal elements).

### Instant cup of soup: design flaws increase risk of burns [^111wGXxj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2006). Low credibility.

Prepackaged soups are a frequent cause of burn injury. We hypothesize that package design increases the risk for burn injury by affecting container stability. All pediatric scald burns caused by soup, between June 1997 and August 2004, were reviewed for burn and patient characteristics. Instant or "ready-to-eat" soups also were purchased. Safety statements and recommendations as to use of the microwave oven were documented. The height and the areas of the base and top were compared to the angle that a container would tip over on to its side. During the study period, 99 admissions and 80 outpatients were treated for burns caused by soup. Although the burn size was small (mean 5% TBSA) 22 patients required grafting. Of 13 different soups, 11 required the addition of hot water, and 2 were prepackaged for eating out of the container. Twelve containers had round bases and were tall and narrow, with one being shorter and rectangular. The measurements that correlated with the ease of tipping over were the base area, top area, and the ratio of height/base area. The most significant contributor to the ease of tipping over was height. Instant soups are packaged in containers that tend to be tall with a narrow base that predisposes them to being knocked over and spilled. Simple redesigning of instant soup packaging with a wider base and shorter height, along with the requirement for warnings about the risks of burns would reduce the frequency of soup burns.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^113BsdFK]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Animals in the natural world constantly encounter geometrically complex landscapes. Successful navigation requires that they understand geometric features of these landscapes, including boundaries, landmarks, corners and curved areas, all of which collectively define the geometry of the environment 1–12. Crucial to the reconstruction of the geometric layout of natural environments are concave and convex features, such as corners and protrusions. However, the neural substrates that could underlie the perception of concavity and convexity in the environment remain elusive. Here we show that the dorsal subiculum contains neurons that encode corners across environmental geometries in an allocentric reference frame. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we find that corner cells tune their activity to reflect the geometric properties of corners, including corner angles, wall height and the degree of wall intersection. A separate population of subicular neurons encode convex corners of both larger environments and discrete objects. Both corner cells are non-overlapping with the population of subicular neurons that encode environmental boundaries. Furthermore, corner cells that encode concave or convex corners generalize their activity such that they respond, respectively, to concave or convex curvatures within an environment. Together, our findings suggest that the subiculum contains the geometric information needed to reconstruct the shape and layout of naturalistic spatial environments.

### Idiopathic macular holes and direction of vitreomacular traction: structural changes and surgical outcomes [^114x79yt]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

PurposeTo compare the structural changes, clinical course, and treatment outcomes of vertical and horizontal vitreomacular traction (VMT) induced impending macular holes (IMHs) and full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs). MethodsIn this retrospective study, 23 and 32 cases of IMHs and FTMHs, respectively, were analyzed. The IMH cases were divided into two subgroups: IMH with and without foveal detachment. Vitreofoveal traction angles (TAs) between the inner retinal surface and posterior hyaloid were measured from horizontal and vertical optical coherence tomography (OCT) images by using the trigonometric function (the angle equals the arctangent of the height over the base) after adjustments for magnification factors. The largest angle was defined as the vitreomacular TA for the examined case. The critical angle-the TA differentiating cases with (vertical traction) or without (horizontal traction) foveal detachment (vertical traction)-was determined using regression analysis. Pretreatment and posttreatment OCT images, clinical courses, and treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups. ResultsThe critical angle was 27.2°. Cases of vertical traction had higher foveal height in the IMH group and wider bases in the FTMH group (P < 0.05 respectively). IMHs with vertical traction had greater VM attachment than those with horizontal traction. In the FTMH group, postoperative visual improvement was lower (P = 0.002); in the vertical traction group, inner segment:outer segment defects persisted longer (P = 0.02). ConclusionsThe critical angle separating vertical from horizontal traction was 27.2°. Vertical VMT results in greater foveal structural changes in IMHs and possibly less favorable surgical outcomes in FTMHs.

### Echocardiographic assessment of valve stenosis: EAE / ASE recommendations for clinical practice [^115i4rVc]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Mitral valve area by proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) — Level 2 Recommendation: The method "is based on the hemispherical shape of the convergence of diastolic mitral flow on the atrial side of the mitral valve, as shown by colour Doppler", and "enables mitral volume flow to be assessed and, thus, to determine MVA by dividing mitral volume flow by the maximum velocity of diastolic mitral flow as assessed by CWD", using the formula "MVA = πr²(Valiasing)/Peak Vmitral · α/180°". It states, "This method can be used in the presence of significant MR", but "it is technically demanding and requires multiple measurements", with accuracy affected by "uncertainties in the measurement of the radius of the convergence hemisphere, and the opening angle"; "The use of colour M-mode improves its accuracy, enabling simultaneous measurement of flow and velocity".

### Mapping thickness of nasal septal cartilage [^113oqryY]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the thickness of the septal cartilage relating to septal advancement surgery. Fourteen Korean adult cadavers were used. A rectangular coordinate was used, with the x-axis horizontal on the maxillary crest and the y-axis a vertical right angle to the x-axis on the anterior nasal spine. The length and the height of the septal cartilages were divided evenly in 5 dimensions, and the thickness was measured of intersecting points of grating. The mean length and height of the cartilaginous septum was 3.31 ± 0.53 and 2.99 ± 0.47 cm, respectively. The thickness of the septal cartilage varied according to the site (0.74–3.03 mm). The thickest area was the septal base (0% of the septal height) anterior to the vomer (2.19–3.03 mm). The thinnest area (0.74–0. 97 mm) was just above the base area at 20% of the septal height. The anterior-inferior part of the site above the thinnest area was 1.03 to 1.22 mm in thickness and the superior-posterior part was 1.26 to 1.50 mm. The anterior-inferior part was thinner than the superior-posterior one. The thickness map of the nasal septum might be usefully applied in septal surgery, particularly in septal advancement.

### Three-dimensional analysis of age-related orbital and midfacial bone remodeling in Asians [^113ieR4e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial bony changes vary among races, yet few studies have been conducted in Asians.

Objective

To analyze the aging of orbital and midfacial bones in Asians.

Methods

Based on the two-dimensional data obtained from the computed tomography scanner of imaging department, 3D reconstructions were conducted to take measurements (orbital diagonal diameter, orbital width, orbital area, maxillary angle, midfacial height, pyriform angle, pyriform width, and pyriform area).

Results

In this retrospective study of 261 subjects, a significant decrease in the orbital diagonal diameter, orbital width, and midfacial height was found in men, whereas women displayed a significant increase in the pyriform width and a significant decrease in maxillary angle and midfacial height by three-dimensional analysis.

Conclusion

This study verifies the minor female changes in the orbital region and less dramatic male changes in the midfacial region compared with that in Caucasians. Individualized treatment should be performed according to different genders and races. Further exploration of facial bone metabolism may have valuable implications for Asians.

### Impact of gender-affirming rhinoplasty techniques on objective facial appearance [^114KSm3i]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior population studies have shown that women generally have smaller nasal area and volume, including decreased width, and shorter dorsal height. This trend holds true in population studies across different ethnicities as well. For example, in one study analyzing composite photographs, the most "ideal" nasofrontal angle for males was found to be 129°, and more obtuse in females at 144.5°, a trend that was seen in our cohort. The ideal nasofacial angle in males has been proposed to be 36°, while in females an angle of 30° is ideal. Nasolabial angle was not rated differently between male and female composite photos as 115° and 116°, respectively. However, it is commonly suggested that a more obtuse angle is more feminine, and this gender‐based difference was seen in our cohort. Prior studies have shown that alar base widths were wider in males at 38.4 mm, and narrower in females at 34.4 mm, with the "ideal" being 36.8 mm and 35.2 mm, for males and females, respectively. This again was consistent with our findings. Another study evaluating White Italian patients found that nasal width varied from 35.2 mm in males down to 33.5 mm in females, with alar base widths of 24.5 mm in males and slightly narrower in females at 24.2 mm. As such, it comes as no surprise that reductive techniques such as osteotomies and dorsal reduction were frequently used in this patient population, and this has been previously described in the literature as well. Lastly, nasal projection decreased in a statistically significant manner by a mean of 2.7%, however, the clinical significance of this is unclear and the small change is likely influenced by a number of factors — the goal of rhinoplasty on nasal projection varies depending on preoperative projection, some patients require additional projection to improve facial harmony, and perceived projection can be impacted by other GFS interventions such as frontal sinus setback. Moreover, as physiological male faces are larger than female faces, even with the performance of reductive facial feminization, nasal‐facial ratios and harmony must be considered.

### Intra-observer reproducibility and inter-observer agreement of fels skeletal age assessments among male tennis players 8–16 years [^1112M2fY]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Descriptive statistics for estimates of Fels SAs for observers A and B at each time moment are summarized in Table 1. Intra-individual mean differences and coefficients of variation were negligible. Overall, the two observers accumulated 605 errors in the replicate assessments of individual bones (observer A: 234, observer B: 371; see Table 2). Note, that number of criteria for each bone varies. Based on the summed frequencies of assessment errors of the two observers, specific indicators of four bones were most problematic: 29 in metacarpal III (indicator MET III-4: proximo-medial projection of the epiphysis), 28 in the trapezoid (indicator TPD-3: shape of the medial margin of the trapezoid), 22 in the triquetral (indicator TRI-2: shape of the lateral margin of the triquetral), and 22 in the trapezium (indicator TPM-4: radiopaque line or zone within the proximal margin of the trapezium).

As the image shows, each lung was divided into 10 sterno-vertebral segments of equal height along the apex-base axis, as described by Pelosi and colleagues. Sterno-vertebral levels with the same number were merged (that is, all of the segments level 1 from apex to base, etc.), in order to obtain 10 regions for each lung and then a quantitative analysis was performed.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular volume calculation by short-axis summation — example and method show that sequential short-axis slices from the mitral annular plane (base) to the apex are summed using volume = area × thickness to compute LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LV end-systolic volume (LVESV); in the example, LV EDV = 41 mL + 41 mL + 38 mL + 34 mL + 28 mL + 19 mL + 5 mL = 206 mL and LV ESV = 0 mL + 30 mL + 27 mL + 24 mL + 18 mL + 3 mL + 0 mL = 102 ml; this methodology requires no geometric assumptions.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^11417Chn]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Pediatric quantification protocols — pulmonary veins, systemic veins, and atria — advise that the pulmonary veins are usually best evaluated in a high left parasternal or suprasternal short‑axis view ("crab" view) and that the left atrial (LA) appendage should not be mistakenly identified as the left upper pulmonary vein and the right middle pulmonary vein should not be mistakenly identified as the right upper pulmonary vein; subxiphoid short‑axis or right parasternal views are usually better at displaying the right upper pulmonary vein. The superior vena cava is not routinely measured in clinical practice, and normative data have not been established, whereas inferior vena cava (IVC) size can be measured above its junction with the hepatic veins just below the diaphragm in subxiphoid short‑axis views (displaying the IVC long axis), and this may help assess hydration status. The IVC diameter varies with respiration, and the collapsibility index (the percentage decrease in IVC diameter with inspiration) appears to correlate with right atrial (RA) pressures in adults, but neither the IVC diameter nor the collapsibility index appears to correlate with age or BSA in adult patients, and the utility of the collapsibility index in children has not been evaluated. Left atrial size can be assessed by M‑mode and 2D measurements of the distance from the posterior aortic wall to the posterior LA wall, though this anteroposterior distance correlates poorly with angiographically derived LA volumes; recent recommendations involve calculation of LA volumes from apical views at end‑systole just before the MV opens using major‑axis and minor‑axis dimensions and planimetered areas in orthogonal views. Among LA volume calculations, the biplane area‑length and the biplane Simpson (summation of disks) methods using apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views appear to provide the most consistent results with published reference values for normal adults; the biplane area‑length method has also been used in children, and LA volumes indexed to BSA appear to correlate with diastolic function and mitral regurgitation grade. Real‑time three‑dimensional echocardiography with a rotation/polyhedral‑based algorithm has correlated well with LA volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and right atrial size is usually assessed in an apical 4‑chamber view at end‑systole just before the TV opens.

### Relationship between rheology and structure of interpenetrating, deforming and compressing microgels [^116sQdUj]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Edge detection and contour smoothing of particles imaged by dSTORM

Our goal now is to obtain a faithful contour of each particle and use it for measuring different geometric features such as the particle area, area overlap and deformations. To this end we must first segment the image, that is separate the particle from the background and determine the boundary. There are several methods in image analysis to accomplish this, all with their advantages and pitfalls. More sophisticated methods involve gradients or Laplacians of the image. What characterizes an edge is a sharp change in intensity, making derivatives well suited to capture their locations. We use the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detector in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc. USA), which allows for edges to be selected based on their strength, and not on image intensity values. It also produces closed contours without branching, unlike methods based solely on thresholding. The Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection consists of the following steps: first the image is smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel, then the Laplacian (second derivative in 2D) is calculated and finally the zero-crossings are found which correspond to edges. Examples for the image segmentation done with this method, starting from a dSTORM image of a typical round and a more compressed and deformed particle are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. The two particles also display different intensities (i.e. density of blinking events detected), yet we can see that the overall shapes and sizes are well captured, with a decrease in size and deformations clearly visible for the second example. Nonetheless, the presence of significant roughness of the contour remains an obstacle in characterizing shape deformations. Visual inspection of the original deformed particle image clearly suggest five corners and nearly flat facets and this are the features to isolate by image analysis. In order to smooth the particle contours while maintaining the prominent shape features we need to eliminate small scale shape fluctuations without significantly altering the overall larger scale shape and corners. To this end we use the method of Fourier descriptors, which has been used for a variety of applications involving image analysis. By taking the Fourier transform of the contour different spatial frequencies can be separated, then, by appropriate filtering, a smoothed contour can be retrieved and used as a starting point for further analysis. First, coordinates of the boundary pixels with respect to the particle′s center of mass are extracted from the segmented image and ordered counterclockwise. We thus obtain a discrete curve [x j, y j] with j = 1. N where N is the number of pixels. Then, the coordinates are transformed into complex numbers as z j = x j + iy j. Now the Fourier descriptors Z (k) are calculated using a discrete Fourier transform

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111cFKNW]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Continuous wave Doppler (CWD) for regurgitation — Recording jet velocity with CWD provides information on velocity, the gradient between chambers, time course, and timing; the intensity of the returned Doppler signal is proportional to the number of red blood cells, so faint, incomplete, or soft signals indicate trace or mild regurgitation, whereas a dense signal may not differentiate moderate from severe and depends on alignment, with a central well-aligned jet possibly appearing denser than an eccentric jet. Regarding timing, most regurgitant lesions are holosystolic or holodiastolic, but in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) the regurgitation may be limited to late systole and is rarely severe when not holosystolic, and MR and TR may be limited to isovolumic contraction and relaxation phases. The spectral velocity profile shows a general parabolic shape during systole for atrioventricular valves and a trapezoid shape during diastole for semilunar valves; for atrioventricular valves, an early peaking or cutoff sign denotes a large regurgitant wave in the atrium and significant regurgitation.

### Long-term memory induced correction to arrhenius law [^11247JeS]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

METHODS

Numerical methods

To generate stochastic trajectories x (t n) satisfying the GLE (2) at sampling times t n = n × d t, a modified version of the circulant matrix algorithmdescribed in ref.was used. This algorithm enables one to generate trajectories of N points with a computational complexity. The value of the maximal time of the simulations and the time steps were systematically varied to check that the measured properties of the FPT do not depend on such values. Next, to determine the FPT, we have used a theory relying on the analysis of trajectories after the FPT, assumed to display Gaussian statistics with the same covariance function as the original stochastic process. The control of such approximations can be found in SI (Sections D for numerical check and E for a perturbative analysis for weakly non-Markovian processes). To obtain numerical predictions for the mean FPT, equations (7) and (8) were integrated numerically by evaluating the integrals over a non-uniform mesh (with more concentrated points near the origin) using the trapeze method; the number of points in the mesh and the maximal time were systematically varied to make sure that predictions do not depend on the properties of the mesh.

### Comparison of various lipid variables as predictors of coronary heart disease in Japanese men and women with type 2 diabetes: subanalysis of the Japan diabetes complications study [^117GZG9n]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses and data management were conducted at the central data center. Patient characteristics were described as mean ± SD, median and interquartile range, or percentage. We compared a CHD group with a no-CHD group by Student t test and Fisher exact test for numerical and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for risk factors. The strength of associations of each lipid variable was assessed using the χ 2 likelihood ratio test, and the corresponding P values were estimated from the regression coefficient based on the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, the relationships between tertiles of each baseline lipid variable and HR for CHD risks were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards model using the first tertile of each variable as the reference group. The discriminatory powers for CHD of the lipid variables were also compared by ROC curve analysis with application of various thresholds to the predicted probability obtained from the logistic regression model. The AUC was calculated by integrating the area between the ROC curve and the diagonal line where sensitivity is equal to one specificity based on the trapezoidal rule. Multivariate-adjusted generalized additive models with a spline function of three degrees of freedom were used to explore potential nonlinear relationships. All P values are two sided and the significance level is 0.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS packages version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

Table 3
Sensitivity and specificity of various combinations of sulcus angle and LTI to diagnose OPI.

A recent study by Gobbi et al. compared 181 healthy knees with 142 knees having patellar instability and found that the sulcus angles were 148.3° ± 7.5° and 160.3° ± 11.4°, respectively, and the central trochlear bump heights were 3.6 ± 1.4 mm and 5.0 ± 1.8 mm, respectively. Based on these findings, to detect a standardized mean difference of 1.24 in the sulcus angle between healthy knees and knees with patellar instability, an a priori power sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1 indicated that a total sample size of 36 knees (18 per group) would be needed to achieve a power of 95% with a 2.5% one‐sided significance level. Likewise, to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.923 in the central trochlear bump height between healthy knees and knees with patellar instability, an a priori power sample size calculation indicated that a total sample size of 64 knees (32/group) would be required to achieve a power of 95% with a 2.5% one‐sided significance level. All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio (2023.09.1 Build 494, Posit Software, PBC) and R (version 4.3.1, R Core Team [2023]. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing.

### Correlation between otitis media and craniofacial morphology in adults [^111sSUxH]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

We conducted a comparison study to determine if the development of otitis media in adults is correlated with craniofacial morphology. Our study population was made up of 66 adults, aged 18 to 40 years; 32 of these patients had otitis media and 34 did not. All subjects underwent a complete otolaryngologic examination, video-otoscopy, fiberoptic nasal endoscopy, and lateral cephalometry. Statistical analysis of the cephalometric measurements in the otitis media group and the control group revealed significant differences in the angle between the anterior skull base and medial skull base, upper facial height, and anterior facial height. Also, some significant differences were seen between the measurements in the otitis media group and the normal dimensions of the harmonic face as reported in the literature; these differences were seen in the length of the anterior skull base, the angle of cranial deflection, the depth of the maxilla, the angle of the mandibular plane, the angle of facial depth, the angle of the facial cone, and lower facial height. Not all of these significant differences, however were predictive of the evolution of otitis media. Based on our analysis, we conclude that four cephalometric measurements are predictive of the evolution of otitis media: (1) the length of the anterior skull base, (2) the angle between the anterior skull base and medial skull base, (3) maxillary depth, and (4) upper facial height. No correlations were found between otitis media and nasal blockage or between otitis media and facial type.

### Basal actomyosin pulses expand epithelium coordinating cell flattening and tissue elongation [^113zC3uu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When performing a signal sequence analysis (such as of PAK3RBD, AniRBD, F-actin, basal area and focal adhesions), the delay time period showed the time interval between signal peaks, while the latency time period represented the resting period of the signal.

The follicle cell boundary was manually defined based on the image using the E-cadherin or F-actin signals as the cell membrane reference. Then, several factors were generated to quantify membrane curvature, area, perimeter, height and volume of follicle cells:

1) To represent the curvature of the cell edge, a Fiji plugin Kappa was used for curvature measurement and a customized program coded in MATLAB (MathWorks Laboratory, Natick, MA) was applied to show the heatmap of curvature on the cell edge for local ruffling status. Here, we defined the de novo detectable outward protruding structure (with positive curvature) on the cell edge as membrane ruffles.

2) The cell basal area, cell perimeter and equivdiameter (the distance between the cell center and boundary) were measured using the regionprops function in MATLAB. When studying the systematic changes in Rac1/Rho1 activities and basal actomyosin networks associated with ruffles, area and focal adhesions, the area changes refer to subcellular area associated with membrane ruffling.

3) The cell height was generated by using 3D-reconstructed Z-stacks of confocal images.

4) The volume of follicle cells was computed aswhereis cell height, is the apical cell area andis the basal cell area. The orientation of ruffles was analyzed by the quantification of protrusion angles; and after dividing the circumstance into 12 equal parts, the distribution of ruffle directions was shown by rose diagram.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Effect of cleft width on the outcome of presurgical nasoalveolar molding in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate [^1127u6cU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of presurgical nasoalveolar molding (PNAM) according to cleft width (CW) in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). In this retrospective study, 32 newborns with nonsyndromic UCLP treated with PNAM were allocated to 2 groups based on CW (group A, CW ≤ 5mm; and group B, CW > 5mm). The following measurements were carried out using standardized photographs taken before and after PNAM therapy (before primary lip surgery): nostril axis inclination of healthy (NAI-NC) and cleft sides (NAI-C), columellar angle (CA), nasal base inclination (NBI), nasal floor width ratio (NFWR), alar base height ratio (ABHR), and columellar length ratio. Before PNAM therapy, there were significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to NAI-C, NBI, NFWR, and ABHR, indicating greater deformation of the nose in group B. After PNAM therapy, CA, NAI-C, NAI-NC, NFWR, and columellar length ratio were significantly improved in both the groups, whereas NBI and ABHR significantly worsened in group B. The improvement in CA, NAI-C, and NFWR was significantly greater in group B. Although a larger CW had some negative effects on the outcome of PNAM, it was found to be advantageous for nasal symmetry, if initiated as early as possible. Nevertheless, it is important to consider those aspects of the nasolabial area that are involved in the perception of symmetry when evaluating the effect of CW on PNAM outcomes in UCLP.

### Trapezoid fractures: report of 11 cases [^115dnP77]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Trapezoid fractures are rare. Mostly single cases reports appear in the literature. The purpose of this study was to review 11 patients treated for trapezoid fractures at our center.

Methods

We reviewed all trapezoid fractures that presented over the past 10 years at our institution. We reviewed case notes regarding mechanism of injury, fracture pattern, mode of diagnosis, and time to diagnosis and treatment.

Results

We treated 11 patients for trapezoid fractures over the 10-year period. A correct diagnosis was made in 5 cases on initial evaluation. Most trapezoid fractures were diagnosed on computed tomographic scan. The fracture plane was predominantly sagittal. Coronal fractures could not be diagnosed on plain radiographs.

Conclusions

Fractures of the trapezoid should be suspected from the mechanism of injury, in particular, axial force, and from local tenderness. These fractures may be underdiagnosed. We recommend computed tomography rather than plain radiography alone in case of clinical suspicion.

TPMS structure generation

TPMSs and related structures are widespread in natural biological systems –. TPMSs are considered to be the ideal geometric shape to describe the biological form of the human skeleton. Numerous studies have shown that the curved surfaces of TPMSs contribute to enhanced plasma membrane elongation during cell crawling and spreading –. In this study, we adopted the gyroid minimal surface structure, which is a member of the TMPS family. In addition to the abovementioned advantages of TMPSs, the helical surface structure of the gyroid unit makes the force distribution more uniform, leading to its excellent mechanical properties. The equation of the gyroid surface is as follows:

The equation φ (X, Y, Z) defines a surface evaluated at the isovalue (i.e. level-set constant) c and has a topology similar to that of a minimal surface. X = 2 απx, Y = 2 βπy, Z = 2 γπz, α, β, and γ are constants related to the unit cell size in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. In this work, we created the gyroid lattice based on the minimal surface by considering one of the volumes divided by the surface as the solid domain and the other as the void domain. This was done by considering the volume bounded by the minimal surface such that φ (X, Y, Z) > c to create a solid-network lattice. The porosity of gyroid lattices can be graded by spatially varying the value of the level-set constant c in Cartesian space depending on a certain function or tabulated data such that:

To achieve a smooth transition between units on edge (Supplementary Fig. 22), we describe the isovalue as a linear function along one of the Cartesian coordinates such that c = Ax + B, where A and B are constants. This smooth transition is a prerequisite for representing the actual geometric shape using a porosity matrix.

The scaffold contains 27 gyroid subunits in total, arranged as a 3 × 3 × 3 cubic structure. The geometry of the scaffold is controlled by the 3 × 3 × 3 porosity matrix. The porosity c of each subunit can take discrete values from 20 to 90%, with an increment of 10%.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation — proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method: The document notes, "In MR, PISA is more accurate for central regurgitant jets than eccentric jets and for circular orifices than noncircular orifices". It highlights measurement variability: "Errors of 10%-25% are common even among expert readers and are the smallest for central jets; therefore, PISA should always be considered in the context of the other echo/Doppler findings". Additional limitations are described: "The dynamic nature of the orifice in MR can also lead to errors with the PISA formula", and because "The regurgitant orifice is often crescent shaped in secondary MR", the "assumption of circular orifice geometry inherent to 2D PISA may result in underestimation of secondary MR". Prognostic linkage is stated as "lower values of EROA by 2D PISA are associated with worsened prognosis in secondary MR", and it is reminded that "PISA EROA, like VCW or VCA, is calculated from a single-frame image".

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^112GXW9M]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Inspecting the distribution of responsesacross trials with varying difficulty (Fig. 3 e), we found that the learned mental line is still a geometric combination of the mean representation of the items. Indeed, a linear relationship between readout activity and symbolic distance is apparent, although the slope of the regression now decreases with σ S. This is because the learned GMLis no longer parallel to the theoretical one from Eq. (3) (Fig. 3 f). In fact, the noisy representationsaveraged across the presented trials are not fully embedded into the M -dimensional space of the exact representationswhere the theoretical GML unfolds. Thus, the larger is the noise σ S, the smaller is the overlap between these subspaces, meaning that the network state falls in large part into the orthogonal N − M -dimensional space. As a consequence, the representations of itemsonly in part are embedded in the subspace occupied by the learned GML, leading to y values linearly distributed on a range that shrinks with the noise level.

Nonlinear mapping of serial order depends on task protocol

In the previous Section, we have shown that the encoding quality of the items to sort, eventually affects the shape of the GML, and hence, the projections y determining the behavior. Indeed, learning in the presence of higher sensory noise reduces the quality of the item representations leading to a GML oriented in directions external to the M -dimensional space of the items (Fig. 3 e, f). The quality of such representations can, in general be influenced also by the design of the task and the cognitive resources requested to solve it. An example is the immediate serial recall (ISR) task – consisting of the presentation of a sequence of items, followed by a test phase in which the subject is requested to recall such items in the same order they have been seen. ISR task is performed in this test phase by accessing the short-term memory (STM) of the items with their position in the sequence. The limited amount of cognitive/neuronal resources for STM limits the length of the sequence to reproduce. According to "ordinal theories", this can be modeled with a decreasing activation of the item representations in memory.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation imaging — significant secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) in dilated cardiomyopathy is shown with marked tenting of the mitral valve (MV) and parasternal short-axis color Doppler demonstrating regurgitation along the entire length of valve coaptation. Pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler at the tips of the MV leaflets shows high E velocity, and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler has a triangular spectral shape in significant MR. Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) from apical three- and two- (commissural) chamber views shows nonhemispheric flow convergence and a noncircular vena contracta (VC), and the legend cautions that assumption of a hemispheric flow convergence or circular VC would underestimate MR.

### The anatomic rationale for transforaminal endoscopic interbody fusion: a cadaveric analysis [^1176eRkz]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors describe a cadaveric analysis to determine the ideal dimensions and trajectory for considering endoscopic transforaminal interbody implantation. METHODS The soft tissues of 8 human cadavers were removed from L-1 to the sacrum, exposing the posterior bony elements. Facetectomies were performed bilaterally at each lumbar level with resection of the pars interarticularis, revealing the pedicles, nerve roots, and interbody disc space. Each level was digitally photographed with a marker for scale and evaluated with digital analysis software. The traversing and exiting nerve roots and pedicle margins were identified, and the distances between these structures and their relationships to the surrounding structures were documented. RESULTS The dimensions of 2 areas were measured: the working triangle and safe zone. The working triangle is the triangle between the exiting and traversing nerve roots above the superior margin of the inferior pedicle. The safe zone is the trapezoid bounded by the widths of the superior and inferior pedicles between the exiting and traversing nerve roots. The mean surface area for the working triangle was 1.83 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 2.19 cm(2). The mean surface area of the safe zone was 1.19 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 1.26 cm(2). At the medial border of the pedicle extending superiorly, there were no nerve structures within 1.19 cm at any level. On the lateral border of the pedicle, the exiting nerve root was closer superiorly, with the closest being 0.3 cm. CONCLUSIONS The working triangle is a relatively large area. The safe zone, just superior to the pedicle, is free of nerve structures. By utilizing the superior border of the pedicle, the disc space can be accessed within this safe zone without risk of injury to the nerves. A thorough understanding of foraminal anatomy is fundamental for considering how to safely access the disc space, thereby utilizing less invasive endoscopic techniques, and is an important first step in considering what shapes and sizes of interbody implants and retractors are feasible for use in the foramen.

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^111arwcC]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Hidden metric spaces underlying real weighted networks

At the beginning of this section, we showed that the normalized weights of links participating in triangles are higher, thus suggesting a coupling between the weighted organization of real weighted complex networks and an underlying metric space. We then presented a model that has the critical ability to fix the joint degree–strength distribution, while independently varying the level of coupling between the weights and the metric space (parameter α). This opens the way to a definite proof of the geometric nature of weights in real complex networks, which inevitably must involve the triangle inequality: the most fundamental property of any metric space.

For unweighted networks, a direct verification of the triangle inequality based on the topology without an embedding in a metric space is not possible, due to the probabilistic nature of the relationship between the binary structure and the distance between nodes. In contrast, weights do contain information about their distances in the metric space (via equation (2)) such that a direct verification of the triangle inequality is possible. To ensure that the metric properties of triples in the network are in correspondence to the metric properties of the corresponding triangles in the underlying space, only triples of nodes forming triangles in the network are taken into account to evaluate the triangle inequality. There are however two main challenges when one tries to apply this methodology. The first one is related to the fact that connections in the weightedmodel depend not only on angular distances but also on hidden degrees, such that we need a purely geometrical formulation of the weighted hidden metric space network model, in which angular distances and degrees are combined into a single distance measure. The second issue is related to the intrinsic noise present in the system due to the stochastic nature of the processes conforming it, which may blur the evaluation of the triangle inequality. Below, we propose a way to overcome these two issues.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112YwU3k]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Aortic measurement conventions — across transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — are summarized as follows: TTE measures the aortic root "from the leading-edge of the anterior wall to the leading-edge of the posterior wall, thus identifying the largest diameter", and "inner-edge measurement on TTE images may also be considered". On CT and MRI, "the root diameter can be measured from the commissure to the opposite sinus, or from sinus to sinus, which results in larger dimensions", and "measuring from sinus-to-sinus and from inner-edge to inner-edge on CT and MRI has shown good correlation with TTE for measurements of the root and ascending segments". Although diameter is important, "most dissections occur in aortas with diameters that do not meet the threshold for preventive surgery", so additional metrics are used; for example, "ascending aortic area indexed to height is associated with aortic dissection and adverse outcomes in patients with tricuspid or bicuspid valves". For imaging technique, "measurements of the arch and further distal segments should also be performed perpendicular to the aortic axis, with care taken to avoid oblique imaging that may overestimate the aortic diameter at levels of greater curvature and tortuosity".

### Trapeziometacarpal subluxation predisposes to incident trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (OA): the framingham study [^117E8jQ6]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the thumb carpo-metacarpal joint is a common condition that can lead to substantial pain, instability, deformity, and loss of motion. It has been hypothesized that instability of the trapeziometacarpal joint combined with strenuous use can potentially lead to OA. However, as yet there have been no longitudinal evaluations to determine if this hypothesis is true. We examined the relation of radial subluxation to the risk of radiographic OA at trapeziometacarpal joint.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control study. We restricted our evaluation of cases to subjects with no radiographic trapeziometacarpal OA at baseline (1967). We defined incident trapeziometacarpal OA as the development of a modified Kellgren and Lawrence grade ≥ 2 in that joint at a later examination (1992–1993). Radial subluxation of the base of the first metacarpal off the trapezium and the amount of the base of the first metacarpal covering the articulating surface of the trapezium were measured using a digital calculation caliper. We examined the relation of gender-specific quartile groups of radial subluxation to the risk of trapeziometacarpal OA using a conditional logistic regression model.

Results

We assessed 203 men and 431 women. After adjusting for age, handedness, number of other joints with OA, and grip strength, the odds ratios for the risk of trapeziometacarpal OA in men were 1.0, 1.8, 2.7, and 3.1 from the lowest quartile of radial subluxation to the highest quartile, respectively (P for trend = 0.015). There was no significant relationship between radial subluxation quartiles and incident trapeziometacarpal OA in women.

Conclusion

This study provides evidence that radial subluxation predisposes to subsequent OA of the trapeziometacarpal joint in men.

### Actin polymerisation and crosslinking drive left-right asymmetry in single cell and cell collectives [^111tW8ox]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Measurement of radial fibre tilt angles

The following procedures were performed using a custom MATLAB script unless otherwise stated. Cell segmentation was performed by thresholding the Gaussian-smoothed (sigma value set to 3) actin image using Otsu binarization (threshold value set to 0.4 of Otsu auto threshold), followed by a series of mathematical morphological operations (imclose, imfill, imerode). Cell centroid and cell spread area were calculated based on this cell mask. The cell mask was also used for generating concentric ring masks of 4 µm in width starting from the cell edge, with 2 µm increments, for masking the segmented radial fibres. In each ring, the angle of each radial fibre segment was measured relative to the cell edge. See also Supplementary Fig. 1c. The angle at the cell edge, computed using Python, was given by the formula, whereconnects the cell centroid and intersection of the continuation of the radial fibre segment with the edge of the cell andconnects the cell centroid and intersection of radial fibre with outer edge of the annulus.andare the angles between the radial fiber segment andandrespectively (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Based on visual inspection, actin fibre segments withmore than or equals to 68° were unlikely to be radial fibres and were omitted from the analysis. The average inflation of area of the cell mask relative to the area of the micropatterns (1800 µm 2) was estimated to be 63.353 µm 2 using a dataset of ~100 cells. This constant was subtracted from the cell area before the computation of cell radius R. Only cells with area between 1700 and 2000 µm 2 were analysed.

### Corrective osteotomy for symptomatic scaphoid malunion [^1155Fz91]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

A prospective study aimed at assessment of the outcome of management of symptomatic scaphoid malunion (hump-back deformity). The work included 13 scaphoid malunions in 13 patients. All patients complained of weak painful hand grip and limitation of wrist function. All cases were subjected to a corrective opening wedge scaphoid osteotomy with insertion of a trapezoid-shaped tricortical iliac bone graft. At the final assessment, after a mean follow-up period of 42 months, the achieved results were rated excellent in seven cases, good in four and fair in two according to the scoring system used. Objectively, the mean range of wrist motion and hand grip strength improved from 48% and 47% pre-operatively to 82% and 79% at the final assessment. Radiological parameters including height to length ratio, lateral intrascaphoid angle and dorsal cortical angle were also effectively improved. The intra-operative corrected carpal alignment has almost been maintained at the final follow-up. The procedure did not have serious drawbacks such as non-union or avascular necrosis and perhaps might delay the development of degenerative arthritis of the wrist.

### Real-time 3-dimensional dynamics of functional mitral regurgitation: a prospective quantitative and mechanistic study [^115ReN7g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Quantification of Mitral Valve Coaptation by 3D Echocardiography

The quantification software was used to analyze volumetric images as previously described. – Once the entire 3D dataset was captured, steps of quantitation involved first defining, in cross‐sectional planes the LV long‐axis through the mitral annulus center and mitral annular anterior‐posterior and intercommissural axes. Then, 3D data were automatically cropped into 18 radial planes spaced 10 degrees apart (Figure 1). Annular marks and leaflets tracings were semi‐automatically defined and manually adjusted in each radial plane. Then, posterior and anterior papillary tips were marked manually where clearly visible by examination of all radial planes. Midanterior mitral annulus (valvular fibrosa) was defined in cross‐sectional views after complete annulus marking to ensure appropriate positioning. All spatial positioning and measurements were performed 6 times during the cardiac cycle, in early‐, mid‐ and late‐diastole and early‐, mid‐, and late‐systole. Early‐diastole was identified just after mitral valve opening, late‐diastole as preceding mitral closure and middiastole as midway between these frames. Early‐systole was identified as immediately following onset of mitral closure, late‐systole at or immediately before aortic closure, and midsystole midway between these frames. From these positioned structures, anatomic 3D images of mitral apparatus were reconstructed for display 6 times in each cardiac cycle with, at each phase measurement of mitral annular area, annular circumference, antero‐posterior diameter, intercommissural diameter, leaflet maximal tenting volume, papillary muscle area (the area of the triangle formed between both papillary tips and midanterior annulus — PtAT), length of posterior papillary tip to midanterior annulus (PPM‐AA length), length anterior papillary tip to midanterior annulus (APM‐AA length), interpapillary tips distance (PAP‐width), and acute angle of the triangle formed between papillary tips and midanterior annulus (inter‐PAP angle). Annular height was measured as well and was defined as the instantaneous maximal vertical distance between the highest (anterior or posterior) and lowest (antero‐lateral or postero‐medial) points and was used to compute instantaneous ratio of annular height to intercommissural diameter, a measure of annular saddle shape. Deeper mitral annular saddle shape is characterized by more apical position of medial and lateral aspects of the annulus, whereas the anterior and posterior aspects remain basal in position (higher ratio of annular height to intercommissural diameter). The ratio of PPM‐AA length to APM‐AA length was calculated as a measure of symmetric position of papillary muscles in regard to the mitral annulus center. Variability of measurement was determined by repeating measurements on stored 3D data sets at least 1 week after initial measurement by the same observer (intraobserver) and a different observer (interobserver).

Statistical analysis

We estimated the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the performance metrics pertaining to our classification results using bootstrapping, which encompassed AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, NPV and PPV. The method we used involved implementing n-out-of-n bootstrap sampling with replacement at the image level for our datasets. For each bootstrap sample (100 samples), we calculated and retained the performance metrics specific to that sample. This process was carried out 1000 times. Subsequently, we established the 95% CIs by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from the distribution of each metric's empirical data. All computations and statistical analyses were conducted using Python, version 3.9 (Python Software Foundation).

NPV is the probability that a person testing negative for a disease truly does not have the disease. In other words, it's the percentage of negative results that are correct. The formula for NPV is:PPV is the probability that a person testing positive for a disease truly has the disease. It's the percentage of positive results that are correct. The formula for PPV is:Sensitivity (also referred to as the true positive rate and the recall) is the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as follows:Specificity (also known as the true negative rate), which measures the proportion of correctly identified negatives, was calculated as follows:AUC, standing for Area under the ROC Curve, measuring the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (think integral calculus) from (0,0) to (1,1), was calculated as:Where. Given two bounding boxesand, their IoU could be computed as:Where A(·) was the area of the shape. The calculation of IoU could therefore be formulated as a problem involving the computation of the area of each spherical rectangle and the intersection of two spherical rectangles.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117DhVZd]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

High-intensity zone (HIZ) on magnetic resonance imaging — In a prospective comparative study, symptomatic group A included 72 patients (40 males, 32 females, aged 24–59 years) with LBP for ≥ 6 months and asymptomatic control group B included 79 patients (44 males, 35 females, aged 23–59 years); the incidence of HIZ was higher in group A (45.8%) than group B (20.2%) (p = 0.001), and HIZ signal intensity was brighter in group A (57.5 ± 14.0%) than group B (45.1 ± 7.2%) (p = 0.000), with no significant differences in area of disc and HIZ nor the area ratio between groups, and the authors concluded that HIZ intensity is greater in subjects with LBP compared to those without LBP.
