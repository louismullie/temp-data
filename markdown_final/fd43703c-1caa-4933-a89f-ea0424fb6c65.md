## Question

What does normal iron and high ferritin mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means to have "normal iron and high ferritin" and how to interpret these lab results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "normal iron" typically represents in the lab panel. Then, I should verify what ferritin actually measures and why it might be elevated. Next, I will consider the key differential diagnoses that produce high ferritin with otherwise normal iron studies, including inflammation, liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and true iron overload. After that, I should outline a practical, stepwise diagnostic approach, including transferrin saturation, inflammatory markers, liver enzymes, and when to pursue HFE testing or MRI. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications and management considerations, making sure I don't overcall iron overload when inflammation is the driver.

> Let me first confirm what "normal iron" usually implies in this context. Wait, let me verify the components clinicians mean by "iron studies": serum iron, total iron-binding capacity or transferrin, and transferrin saturation. When these are "normal", it generally suggests adequate circulating iron and transport capacity, which makes isolated hyperferritinemia less likely to reflect increased iron availability in plasma, though I should be cautious not to overinterpret a single value without the full panel and context.

> Now, I need to check what ferritin actually measures. Ferritin is the main intracellular iron storage protein, but it is also an acute-phase reactant that rises with inflammation, infection, liver injury, malignancy, and metabolic dysfunction; therefore, an elevated ferritin with normal serum iron and transferrin saturation often signals inflammation or tissue injury rather than true iron overload, and I should confirm this pattern before concluding anything definitive [^1157g8j4] [^113PRqko].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the major causes of isolated hyperferritinemia with normal iron studies. Inflammation and anemia of chronic disease are common, where hepcidin-driven iron sequestration lowers serum iron and transferrin saturation despite normal or high ferritin. Chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorder, and NAFLD frequently raise ferritin. Metabolic syndrome and dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia can elevate ferritin out of proportion to iron stores. And malignancy or macrophage activation syndromes can drive marked ferritin elevations, so I need to ensure I'm correlating with the clinical picture and other labs [^117Bn4Sx] [^116M47yq] [^113UwyPT] [^112N6wmB].

> But wait, what if this is early hereditary hemochromatosis or another iron overload syndrome? I should double-check transferrin saturation because TS is the most sensitive early marker for HFE hemochromatosis. A TS ≥ 45% should prompt HFE testing even if ferritin is normal, whereas a normal TS with normal ferritin makes clinically significant iron overload unlikely, though rare exceptions exist, so I need to ensure I interpret TS in the right clinical context and, if needed, repeat fasting or confirm an elevated TS before proceeding [^116AdNiR] [^115oKwcQ].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach. Let me first confirm the full iron panel including TS, and if TS is normal, I will assess inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR. Check liver enzymes and consider NAFLD, alcohol-related liver disease, or viral hepatitis. And correlate with BMI and metabolic risk factors for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, reserving HFE genetic testing for those with TS ≥ 45% or a suggestive family history, because that sequence minimizes unnecessary testing while catching true iron overload [^114Mor4a] [^116kXCsb].

> I will now examine when to escalate to quantitative iron assessment. If TS is elevated or ferritin is very high, particularly above 1,000 µg/L, the risk of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis increases in HFE hemochromatosis, and I should consider noninvasive hepatic iron quantification by MRI rather than routine liver biopsy; conversely, ferritin below 1,000 µg/L with normal transaminases makes advanced fibrosis unlikely and supports a more conservative initial approach, though I should remain vigilant for exceptions [^113CCKLs] [^112PDk3f].

> Let me consider special populations where interpretation is trickier. In chronic kidney disease, high ferritin with low TSAT often reflects functional iron deficiency due to inflammation. Withholding iron solely because ferritin is high can worsen anemia, so I should confirm TSAT and consider IV iron when TSAT is low, even if ferritin exceeds 500 ng/mL, balancing infection risk and response monitoring carefully [^114Kcnym] [^111CX2fR]. In preoperative or inflammatory states, ferritin between 30 and 100 µg/L with TSAT < 20% may still indicate iron-restricted erythropoiesis that could benefit from iron repletion, so I need to ensure I don't miss treatable functional deficiency masked by inflammation [^114stzej] [^116GUMcq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that any ferritin above the lab upper limit of normal mandates phlebotomy; I should correct that. Phlebotomy is indicated for confirmed iron overload, typically C282Y homozygotes with elevated ferritin and TS, with treatment targets often aiming for ferritin around 50–100 µg/L during maintenance, whereas isolated hyperferritinemia without elevated TS or evidence of iron loading should prompt evaluation for secondary causes rather than immediate venesection [^115E1W6a] [^111Bw5iz].

> Putting this together, "normal iron and high ferritin" most often reflects inflammation, liver disease, metabolic dysfunction, or malignancy rather than true iron overload, especially when transferrin saturation is normal. I should confirm TS, assess CRP and liver enzymes, consider metabolic risk and alcohol intake, and reserve HFE testing or hepatic iron quantification for those with elevated TS or markedly high ferritin, because that strategy aligns with guidelines and minimizes both under- and over-diagnosis of iron overload syndromes [^116kXCsb] [^113GfgzE] [^113UwyPT].

Normal iron with high ferritin most often reflects **inflammation or liver disease** [^1157g8j4] rather than true iron overload [^113PRqko]. Ferritin is an **acute-phase reactant** [^1133sWtF] that rises with inflammation, infection, malignancy, or liver injury, even when iron stores are normal [^116kXCsb]. Confirm with **transferrin saturation** [^114Mor4a]; if TS is normal (< 45%), iron overload is unlikely and the high ferritin is likely due to inflammation or liver disease [^114SLmej]. Evaluate for chronic inflammatory conditions, liver disease, alcohol use, and malignancy, and consider HFE testing only if TS is elevated or there is a family history of hemochromatosis [^notfound].

---

## Physiological role of ferritin

Ferritin is the **primary intracellular iron storage protein** [^1157g8j4], maintaining iron in a soluble, non-toxic form and releasing it as needed. Serum ferritin reflects iron stores but also rises with inflammation, infection, liver disease, and malignancy, so high ferritin does not always mean iron overload [^113PRqko].

---

## Interpretation of normal iron with high ferritin

When iron studies show normal serum iron and transferrin saturation but elevated ferritin, consider:

- **Inflammation**: Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant [^1157g8j4] and rises with inflammation, infection, or chronic disease [^1157g8j4].

- **Liver disease**: Alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and hepatitis can elevate ferritin even with normal iron stores [^115Y9ujF].

- **Malignancy**: Some cancers increase ferritin via inflammation or tumor-derived ferritin [^112N6wmB].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Obesity and insulin resistance can cause dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia [^116M47yq].

- **Alcohol use**: Chronic alcohol intake elevates ferritin independently of iron status [^116M47yq].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with normal iron and high ferritin

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) | Acute-phase response [^1157g8j4] |
| Chronic liver disease (e.g. alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, hepatitis) | Hepatic ferritin synthesis, inflammation [^11434Rag] |
| Malignancy (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphoma) | Tumor-derived ferritin, inflammation [^11434Rag] |
| Metabolic syndrome, obesity | Inflammation, insulin resistance [^115rAxKV] |
| Alcohol use disorder | Hepatic ferritin synthesis, inflammation [^1157g8j4] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm iron status**: Measure transferrin saturation (TS) [^114Mor4a]; TS < 45% argues against iron overload [^113PRqko].

- **Assess inflammation**: Check CRP and ESR; elevated levels support an inflammatory cause [^notfound].

- **Evaluate liver function**: ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT help identify liver disease [^notfound].

- **Consider genetic testing**: If TS is elevated or there is a family history, test for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D) [^113GfgzE].

- **Imaging**: Liver MRI can quantify hepatic iron if iron overload is suspected [^112PDk3f].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Inflammation**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition; ferritin will fall as inflammation resolves [^117Bn4Sx].

- **Liver disease**: Manage the liver disease; ferritin often declines with improved liver function [^notfound].

- **Malignancy**: Evaluate and treat the cancer; ferritin may serve as a tumor marker in some cases [^notfound].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Lifestyle modification and weight loss can lower ferritin [^notfound].

- **Alcohol use**: Abstinence or reduction can significantly reduce ferritin [^notfound].

---

## When to suspect iron overload despite normal iron studies

Iron overload is unlikely if **transferrin saturation is normal**, but consider it when:

- **Transferrin saturation ≥ 45%**: Suggests iron overload [^116AdNiR].

- **Family history**: Of hereditary hemochromatosis [^113GfgzE].

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, arthralgia, skin hyperpigmentation, or organ dysfunction [^1169ycLm].

In these cases, **genetic testing and hepatic iron quantification** are indicated [^113GfgzE].

---

## Conclusion

Normal iron with high ferritin usually reflects **inflammation or liver disease** rather than true iron overload [^113PRqko]. Confirm with transferrin saturation, assess for inflammatory and liver disease, and reserve genetic testing or MRI for cases with elevated TS or suggestive features. Management targets the underlying cause, after which ferritin typically normalizes.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Iron deficiency anemia: guidelines from the American… [^115WmkBo]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain.

Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. Editor's Note: Dr. Sonoda is the resident representative for AFP. These guidelines from the AGA add specific recommendations for the workup of IDA. The recommendation to diagnose iron deficiency with a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng per mL is consistent with a previous.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115tZ6D9]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a combination of true iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease is likely in the case of serum ferritin levels between 30 and 100 mcg/L.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Extreme hyperferritinaemia; clinical causes [^112N6wmB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

There are many causes of raised serum ferritin concentrations including iron overload, inflammation and liver disease to name but a few examples. Cases of extreme hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin concentration equal to or greater than 10 000 ug/l) are being reported in laboratories but the causes of this are unclear. We conducted an audit study to explore this further. Extreme hyperferritinaemia was rare with only 0.08% of ferritin requests displaying this. The main causes of extreme hyperferritinaemia included multiple blood transfusions, malignant disease, hepatic disease and suspected Still's disease.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111nsCNv]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

### Predictors of the response to treatment in anemic hemodialysis patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^113WdYn3]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Treating hemodialysis patients to combat anemia corrects hemoglobin but exacerbates iron deficiency by utilizing iron stores. Patients needing iron should receive this by intravenous (i.v.) means. The Dialysis patients' Response to IV iron with Elevated ferritin (DRIVE) trial investigated the role of i.v. iron in anemic patients with high ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and adequate epoetin doses. We examined whether baseline iron and inflammation markers predict the response of hemoglobin to treatment. Patients (134) were randomized to no added iron or to i.v. ferric gluconate for eight consecutive hemodialysis sessions spanning 6 weeks with epoetin increased by 25% in both groups. The patients started with hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dl, ferritin between 500 and 1200 ng/ml, and transferrin saturation of less than 25%. Significantly, patients with a reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than or equal to 31.2 pg were over five times more likely to achieve a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl. Lower reticulocyte hemoglobin contents did not preclude a response to i.v. iron. Significantly higher transferrin saturation or lower C-reactive protein but not ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor levels predicted a greater response; however their influence was not clinically significant in either group. We conclude that none of the studied markers is a good predictor of response to anemia treatment in this patient sub-population.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116AdNiR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

AASLD testing recommendations emphasize paired iron studies and conditional HFE testing: "In a patient with suggestive symptoms, physical findings, or family history, a combination of TS and ferritin should be obtained rather than relying on a single test. (1B) If either is abnormal (TS ≥ 45% or ferritin above the upper limit of normal), then HFE mutation analysis should be performed. (1B)" Additionally, "Diagnostic strategies using serum iron markers should target high-risk groups such as those with a family history of HH or those with suspected organ involvement. (1B)".

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1127FpV6]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and epidemiologic presentation notes that "The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels", and that in older series women "typically presented approximately 10 years later than men, and there were approximately 10 times as many men presenting as women", while "the proportion of C282Y homozygous women with definite disease manifestations… is… lower than men (1% versus 25%, respectively)". It also states serologic markers are "widely available", with most patients now identified "while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis", and that "It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation".

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis discovered after COVID-19 hospitalisation [^114PBkKs]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 infection and hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have something in common; the disease course can be monitored with ferritin levels. Throughout the pandemic, physicians have looked for markers to help predict disease severity. Ferritin levels are commonly used to predict and monitor disease severity in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. While ferritin is elevated as part of the acute-phase reaction in response to infection, it can also be elevated due to iron overload. We report a case of undiagnosed, asymptomatic HH that was unveiled after COVID-19 infection via monitoring for resolution of ferritin levels that were found to be extremely elevated during a moderate COVID-19 infection. This diagnosis allowed the patient to initiate phlebotomy treatment before symptoms of HH arose.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a combination of true iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease is likely in the case of serum ferritin levels between 30 and 100 mcg/L.

### Serum transferrin receptor [^114MZmUH]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Transferrin receptors (TfRs) are the conventional pathway by which cells acquire iron for physiological requirements. Under iron-deficient conditions there is an increased concentration of surface TfR, especially on bone marrow erythroid precursors, as a mechanism to sequester needed iron. TfRs are also present in the circulation, and the circulating serum TfR (sTfR) level reflects total body TfR concentration. Under normal conditions erythroid precursors are the main source of sTfR. Disorders of the bone marrow with reduced erythroid precursors are associated with low sTfR levels. The sTfR concentration begins to rise early in iron deficiency with the onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and continues to rise as iron-deficient erythropoiesis progressively worsens, prior to the development of anemia. The sTfR level does not increase in anemia of chronic inflammation, but is increased when anemia of chronic inflammation is combined with iron deficiency. The sTfR level is also increased in patients with expanded erythropoiesis, including hemolytic anemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and use of erythropoietic stimulating agents. The ratio of sTfR/ferritin can be used to quantify the entire spectrum of iron status from positive iron stores through negative iron balance, and is particularly useful in evaluating iron status in population studies. The sTfR/log ferritin ratio is valuable for distinguishing anemia of chronic inflammation from iron deficiency anemia, whether the latter occurs alone or in combination with anemia of chronic inflammation.

### Natural history of the C282Y homozygote for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) with a normal serum ferritin level [^117TxPTb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The discovery of a genetic test for hereditary hemochromatosis has identified many individuals who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene with a normal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level. The long-term prognosis, rate of iron accumulation, and surveillance guidelines for these individuals are unknown.

Methods

To determine the degree of iron accumulation over time, an updated serum ferritin level was obtained in patients initially identified as homozygous for the C282Y mutation with a normal serum ferritin level.

Results

Twenty-two asymptomatic untreated C282Y homozygotes with a normal serum ferritin level were identified, 10 through population screening, 9 through pedigree analysis, and 3 through a general medical work-up. There were 18 women (4 postmenopausal) and 4 men with a median age of 46 years, range 28–76 years. The median follow-up interval was 4 years, range 2–23 years. The serum ferritin levels of 20 of 22 patients remained below the upper limit of normal during the follow-up period. A decline in serum ferritin level was observed in 13 of 22 patients. Three patients had an increase in serum ferritin level of greater than 50%, with only 1 male patient exceeding the upper limit of normal by having a serum ferritin level increase from 295 to 344 microg/L during a 3-year period.

Conclusions

In C282Y homozygotes with a normal ferritin level at the time of diagnosis, 20 of 22 patients failed to show any significant increase in serum ferritin level during a median follow-up of 4 years. This has clinical and economic implications for follow-up and surveillance of this selected population.

### Ferritin is closely associated with microglia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115ACSe4]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron deposition is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and has been strongly implicated in its pathogenesis. As a byproduct of cellular oxidative stress, iron dysregulation modifies basal levels of the regulatory iron-binding protein ferritin. Examination of thoracic and lumbar spinal cord tissues found increased ferritin immunostaining in white matter axons that corresponded to areas of increased microgliosis in 8 ALS patients versus 8 normal subjects. Gray matter areas containing the motor neurons also demonstrated increased ferritin and microglia in ALS compared to controls but at lower levels than in the white matter. Motor neurons with or without TDP-43 inclusions did not demonstrate either increased ferritin or associated microglial activation. We also observed an association of ferritin with microglia in cerebral cortical tissue samples of ALS cases and in the spinal cord tissues of transgenic mice expressing the SOD1G93A mutation. Elevated ferritin levels were detected in the insoluble fraction from spinal cord tissues of individuals with ALS. These findings suggest that activated microglia and increased ferritin may play significant roles in ALS progression since they are found closely associated in areas of axonal and cortical degeneration.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115E1W6a]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis therapeutic phlebotomy and monitoring — patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should undergo therapeutic phlebotomy weekly (as tolerated), with target ferritin 50–100 μg/L. In the absence of indicators suggesting significant liver disease (ALT, AST elevation), C282Y homozygotes who have an elevated ferritin (but < 1000 μg/L) should proceed to phlebotomy without a liver biopsy. Patients with end-organ damage due to iron overload should undergo regular phlebotomy to the same endpoints. During treatment for HH, dietary adjustments are unnecessary, and vitamin C supplements and iron supplements should be avoided. Patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should be monitored for reaccumulation of iron and undergo maintenance phlebotomy, again aiming for a ferritin level of 50–100 μg/L. We recommend treatment by phlebotomy of patients with non-HFE iron overload who have an elevated HIC.

### Serum ferritin values in primary care: are high values overlooked? [^112LRwus]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine serum ferritin values in iron-replete patients in primary care and determine the action taken on those patients with very high values (> 1000 μg/l).

Methods

Serum ferritin values from 4170 consecutive patients in primary care were examined. All measurements had been made at the request of the general practitioner.

Results

Ferritin values in males reached a steady state by 30 years and did not increase thereafter. Values above 300 μg/l were found in 17% of all males. Female values rose progressively with age. Less than 10% of women < 50 years had values > 100 μg/l. By the age of 70 years, 8% had values > 300 μg/l. Ferritin values > 1000 μg/l were found in 59 patients. This rise was neither explained nor investigated in 32 cases.

Conclusion

Raised ferritin values are frequently found in samples submitted from primary care and most so in adult males. The authors also conclude that general practitioners require more guidance from haematologists in the management of patients with very high values.

### Influence of iron deficiency on Hb A1c levels in type 2 diabetic patients [^114t9DD8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is gold-standard for the assessment of glycemic control in diabetic patients. Previous studies have reported that iron deficiency may elevate A1c concentrations, independent of glycemia. This study aimed to analyze the effect of iron status on HbA1c levels in diabetic patients.

Methods

661 patients 336 females (228 menopausal and 108 premenopausal) and 325 males (237 age > 50 years and 88 age < 50 years) were recruited. HbA1c, ferritin, fasting plasma glucose, hemogram and medical history were recorded. Analysis of variance ANOVA and Pearson's regression were applied.

Results

patients were divided according gender, age, glycemia and iron status (normal, latent iron deficiency LID, iron deficiency anemia IDA). All groups presented increasing HbA1c values in parallel with iron deficiency, subclinical and anemia, but the level of significance was not homogeneous in the different groups. Controlled premenopausal women HbA1c in normal iron status and IDA groups P = 0.0048, between normal and LID, P = 0.033. Not controlled premenopausal women Normal group and IDAP < 0.001, normal iron status and LID P = 0.019. Controlled menopausal women normal group and IDAP < 0.0001, LID and IDA P = 0.01. Not controlled menopausal women normal group and IDA P = 0.04. Controlled men over 50 years normal and IDA groups P = 0.002, LID and IDA P = 0.02. Controlled young men normal group and LID P = 0.03.

Conclusion

This study found a positive correlation between iron deficiency and increased HA1c levels. In diabetic patients with IDA should be interpreted with caution, due to the possibility of spurious increment in HbA1c.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. View values < 12 mcg/L indicative for absent iron stores.
Do not exclude the possibility of functional iron deficiency in case of values as high as 1,200 mcg/L in patients with CKD, and recognize that some such patients may respond to IV iron therapy. View a serum ferritin concentration of < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis patients or < 200 mcg/L in chronic hemodialysis patients as predictive of iron deficiency and potentially good response to IV iron therapy.
Do not use values above the suggested cut-offs to guide iron therapy. Use serum ferritin values > 1,200 mcg/L to ascertain obtaining evaluation for potential iron overload.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Screening for hemochromatosis by measuring ferritin levels: a more effective approach [^1171p2TC]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Because the penetrance of HFE hemochromatosis is low, traditional population screening measuring the transferrin saturation is unlikely to be cost-effective because the majority of subjects detected neither have clinical disease nor are likely to develop it. Three independent studies show that only patients with serum ferritin concentrations more than 1000 microg/L are at risk for cirrhosis, one of the main morbidities of hemochromatosis. Among 29,699 white subjects participating in the Scripps/Kaiser hemochromatosis study, only 59 had serum ferritin levels more than 1000 microg/L; 24 had homozygous mutant or compound heterozygous mutant HFE genotypes. In all but 5 of the other subjects, the causes of elevated ferritin were excessive alcohol intake, cancer, or liver disease. Screening for hemochromatosis with serum ferritin levels will detect the majority of patients who will be clinically affected and may detect other clinically significant disease in patients who do not have hemochromatosis genotypes. Because the ferritin level of the majority of adult homozygotes for HFE mutations does not rise over long periods of time, excluding subjects with serum ferritin levels less than or equal to 1000 microg/L should not result in missed opportunities for early treatment of patients who could benefit.

### Uric acid as a potential cue to screen for iron overload [^1145fDgg]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It is suggested that targeted screening for hemochromatosis and iron overload may be worthwhile. The aim of this study was to examine uric acid as a potential indicator of the presence of iron overload.

Methods

We analyzed adults aged 20 and older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2002. We computed logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, liver or kidney condition, and alcohol use to see the relationship between combinations of uric acid and ferritin with the outcomes of elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria.

Results

In unadjusted analyses, 20.7% of individuals with high uric acid had high ferritin levels versus 8.8% of individuals with low uric acid levels (P < .001). Individuals with both elevated uric acid and elevated ferritin levels had significantly higher liver enzymes than individuals with either elevated uric acid or ferritin. With low uric acid and low ferritin as the reference category, individuals with high uric acid and high ferritin were significantly more likely to also have proteinuria (odds ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.82–3.91).

Conclusions

Elevated levels of uric acid is associated with elevated ferritin levels and may serve as a risk stratification variable for presence of iron overload and hemochromatosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^112PDk3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### Impact of hemochromatosis screening in patients with indeterminate results: the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study [^112Pwy4k]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Assess the quality of life impact of receiving indeterminate test results for hemochromatosis, a disorder involving HFE genetic mutations and/or elevated serum transferrin saturation and ferritin.

Methods

The study sample was from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study, a large observational study of hemochromatosis among primary care patients in the US and Canada using HFE genotype and serum transferrin saturation and ferritin screening. Study subjects included 2,304 patients found with hemochromatosis risk of uncertain clinical significance. Assessed was SF-36 general health and emotional well-being before screening and six weeks after participants received their test results. Health worries were assessed after screening.

Results

Of the study subjects, 1,268 participants (51.5%) completed both assessments. Compared to normal controls, those with HFE mutations or elevated serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels of uncertain significance were more likely to report diminished general health and mental well-being, and more health worries. These effects were associated with participants' belief of having tested positive for hemochromatosis or iron overload.

Conclusion

Notification of indeterminate results from screening may be associated with mild negative effects on well-being, and might be a potential participant risk in screening programs for disorders with uncertain genotype-phenotype.

### Unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia without iron overload [^113NsueP]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although hyperferritinemia may be reflective of elevated total body iron stores, there are conditions in which ferritin levels are disproportionately elevated relative to iron status. Autosomal dominant forms of hyperferritinemia due to mutations in the L-ferritin IRE or in A helix of L-ferritin gene have been described, however cases of isolated hyperferritinemia still remain unsolved. We describe 12 Italian subjects with unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia (UIH). Four probands have affected siblings, but no affected parents or offspring. Sequencing analyses did not identify casual mutations in ferritin gene or IRE regions. These patients had normal levels of intracellular ferritin protein and mRNA in peripheral blood cells excluding pathological ferritin production at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In contrast with individuals with benign hyperferritinemia caused by mutations affecting the ferritin A helix, low rather than high glycosylation of serum ferritin was observed in our UIH subjects compared with controls. These findings suggest that subjects with UIH have a previously undescribed form of hyperferritinemia possibly attributable to increased cellular ferritin secretion and/or decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cause remains to be defined and we can only speculate the existence of mutations in gene/s not directly implicated in iron metabolism that could affect ferritin turnover including ferritin secretion.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1175qH98]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

### Adjusting plasma ferritin concentrations to remove the effects of subclinical inflammation in the assessment of iron deficiency: a meta-analysis [^1133sWtF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends serum ferritin concentrations as the best indicator of iron deficiency (ID). Unfortunately, ferritin increases with infections; hence, the prevalence of ID is underestimated.

Objective

The objective was to estimate the increase in ferritin in 32 studies of apparently healthy persons by using 2 acute-phase proteins (APPs), C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), individually and in combination, and to calculate factors to remove the influence of inflammation from ferritin concentrations.

Design

We estimated the increase in ferritin associated with inflammation (ie, CRP > 5 mg/L and/or AGP > 1 g/L). The 32 studies comprised infants (5 studies), children (7 studies), men (4 studies), and women (16 studies) (n = 8796 subjects). In 2-group analyses (either CRP or AGP), we compared the ratios of log ferritin with or without inflammation in 30 studies. In addition, in 22 studies, the data allowed a comparison of ratios of log ferritin between 4 subgroups: reference (no elevated APP), incubation (elevated CRP only), early convalescence (both APP and CRP elevated), and late convalescence (elevated AGP only).

Results

In the 2-group analysis, inflammation increased ferritin by 49.6% (CRP) or 38.2% (AGP; both P < 0.001). Elevated AGP was more common than CRP in young persons than in adults. In the 4-group analysis, ferritin was 30%, 90%, and 36% (all P < 0.001) higher in the incubation, early convalescence, and late convalescence subgroups, respectively, with corresponding correction factors of 0.77, 0.53, and 0.75. Overall, inflammation increased ferritin by ap 30% and was associated with a 14% (CI: 7%, 21%) underestimation of ID.

Conclusions

Measures of both APP and CRP are needed to estimate the full effect of inflammation and can be used to correct ferritin concentrations. Few differences were observed between age and sex subgroups.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113PRqko]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: rapid evidence review [^1169ycLm]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts iron homeostasis, resulting in systemic iron overload. It is the most common inherited disorder among people of northern European ancestry. Despite the high prevalence of the gene mutation, there is a low and variable clinical penetrance. The deposition of excess iron into parenchymal cells leads to cellular dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The liver, pancreas, joints, heart, skin, and pituitary gland are the most commonly involved organs. Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually diagnosed in the 40s or 50s. Women are often diagnosed later than men, likely because of menstrual blood loss. There is no typical presentation or pathognomonic signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because of increased awareness and earlier diagnosis, the end-organ damage secondary to iron overload is not often seen in clinical practice. A common initial presentation is an asymptomatic patient with mildly elevated liver enzymes who is subsequently found to have elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferritin levels greater than 300 ng per mL for men and 200 ng per mL for women and transferrin saturations greater than 45% are highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and can help improve heart function, reduce abnormal skin pigmentation, and lessen the risk of liver complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in select patients. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal and breast cancers. Genetic testing for the hereditary hemochromatosis genes should be offered after 18 years of age to first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

### A comprehensive vision for intravenous iron therapy [^1133mjD8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Commonly used iron indices, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), have limited utility in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both dialysis and nondialysis patients may have normal to high serum ferritin levels and little or no iron available for erythropoiesis. Inflammation can result in increased serum ferritin level and low TSAT and restrict the ability to mobilize iron stores. Management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease requires recognizing that not only decreased erythropoietin production, but also decreased iron availability, can lead to anemia. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial showed the efficacy of intravenous (IV) iron in anemic hemodialysis patients with serum ferritin levels of 500 to 1,200 ng/mL and TSAT of 25% or less receiving adequate erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses. Withholding iron from these patients resulted in worsening iron-restricted erythropoiesis. To improve anemia management in patients receiving hemodialysis and being treated with ESAs, clinicians should consider the benefits of IV iron.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

Hemochromatosis — liver biopsy indications and ferritin-based risk in C282Y homozygotes: Serum ferritin helps triage biopsy; "Several studies have demonstrated that C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin > 1000 μg/L are at an increased risk of cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 20%-45%". In contrast, "fewer than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a ferritin level < 1000 μg/L at the time of diagnosis has cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis". A study of "more than 670 asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes" performed biopsy "in 350 subjects" (cutoff "500 μg/L"), with cirrhosis "in 5.6% of all males and 1.9% of all females", and "All subjects with cirrhosis had a hepatic iron concentration (HIC) > 200 μmol/g of weight". Diagnostic performance showed "A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for identification of cirrhosis", and "No subject with a serum ferritin level < 1000 μg/L had cirrhosis". Accordingly, "liver biopsy does not need to be performed when ferritin is < 1000 μg/L, in the absence of excess alcohol consumption and elevated serum liver enzymes". For non-C282Y homozygotes, "Patients with elevated serum iron studies, but who lack C282Y homozygosity, should be considered for liver biopsy if they have elevated liver enzymes or other clinical evidence of liver disease".

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^113GfgzE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

### Disorders of iron metabolism. part II: iron deficiency and iron overload [^116cS6G1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

MAIN DISORDERS OF IRON METABOLISM: Increased iron requirements, limited external supply, and increased blood loss may lead to iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia. In chronic inflammation, the excess of hepcidin decreases iron absorption and prevents iron recycling, resulting in hypoferraemia and iron restricted erythropoiesis, despite normal iron stores (functional iron deficiency), and finally anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which can evolve to ACD plus true ID (ACD+ID). In contrast, low hepcidin expression may lead to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH type I, mutations of the HFE gene) and type II (mutations of the hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes). Mutations of transferrin receptor 2 lead to HH type III, whereas those of the ferroportin gene lead to HH type IV. All these syndromes are characterised by iron overload. As transferrin becomes saturated in iron overload states, non-transferrin bound iron appears. Part of this iron is highly reactive (labile plasma iron), inducing free radical formation. Free radicals are responsible for the parenchymal cell injury associated with iron overload syndromes. ROLE OF LABORATORY TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS: In iron deficiency status, laboratory tests may provide evidence of iron depletion in the body or reflect iron deficient red cell production. Increased transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels are the main cues for further investigation of iron overload. The appropriate combination of different laboratory tests with an integrated algorithm will help to establish a correct diagnosis of iron overload, iron deficiency and anaemia. REVIEW OF TREATMENT OPTIONS: Indications, advantages and side effects of the different options for treating iron overload (phlebotomy and iron chelators) and iron deficiency (oral or intravenous iron formulations) will be discussed.

### Suspecting hyperferritinemic sepsis in iron-deficient population: Do we need a lower plasma ferritin threshold? [^111bpmvV]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyperferritinemia is being suggested to identify patients with sepsis-induced macrophage activation syndrome for early intervention. However, data among iron-deficient children are scarce. This study was planned to explore the biological behavior of plasma ferritin in children from communities with a high frequency of iron deficiency with septic shock and its association with the outcome.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care teaching hospital in a low-middle income economy of South Asia.

Patients Or Subjects

Patients (6 mo to 12 yr) (n = 42) with septic shock and their healthy siblings as controls (n = 36). Patients/controls with blood transfusion/iron supplement during last 6 months or with any chronic disease were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Ferritin was measured in patients at enrollment and then at 1 month of hospital discharge while they were not on iron supplementation and in controls as indicative of baseline level. Patients' median age was 30 months (13.5–87 mo), 31% were malnourished, majority (86%) had anemia, and two thirds had microcytic hypochromic red cells. Ferritin at admission was 763 ng/mL (480–1,820 ng/mL) in nonsurvivors, whereas 415 ng/mL (262–852 ng/mL) in survivors (p = 0.11). Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score and C-reactive protein correlated positively with plasma ferritin (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively) at enrollment. Elevated ferritin of greater than 500 ng/mL (relative risk, 2.48; 95% CI, 0.95–6.43) and greater than 1,000 ng/mL (relative risk, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.94–4.02) were associated with higher mortality but not independently. Among survivors, the 1-month follow-up ferritin fell significantly to 97 ng/mL (16–118 ng/mL) (p = 0.001). However, it was still significantly higher than that in sibling controls (19 ng/mL [10–54 ng/mL]) (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Ferritin rises significantly in septic shock patients despite iron deficiency and seems to correlate with the severity of inflammation and organ dysfunction. Even a lower threshold (of 500 or 1,000 ng/mL) could predict higher mortality. It may suggest the need for redefining the plasma ferritin threshold for suspecting hyperferritinemic sepsis and sepsis-induced macrophage activation syndrome in these patients. Larger studies with frequent ferritin measurements are desirable to validate these initial observations.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116gS2jE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

### The origin of ferritin reference intervals: a systematic review [^116CTNtA]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, which contributes to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L has a high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults, but the laboratory reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence and might be contributing to structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency. A systematic review was done per systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with the use of medical literature databases from inception of each database to Nov 30, 2021, to identify studies that determined ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults and grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844). The objectives were to systematically summarise the ferritin reference intervals and to do a methodological quality assessment of the included studies. 2306 studies were screened and 61 full texts were included. 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population. The population the sample was comprised of was a total of 21 882 females and 23 650 males participants. The ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11) in females and a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29) in males. 30 (49%) of 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline (eg, guideline recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). The five most used commercial ferritin laboratory assays reported reference intervals with a median LLN of 11 (IQR 9–12) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 4) for females and median of 22 (IQR 22–24) and mean of 23 μg/L (SD 4) for males. In the literature, serum ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults consistently report a LLN of less than 30 μg/L. Data driving these ferritin reference intervals are at high risk of bias, given no exclusion of individuals at risk for iron deficiency in the presumed normal population sample and no adherence to reference interval establishment standards. We suggest the use of evidence-based laboratory clinical decision limits to diagnose iron deficiency.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: should we change our practice? [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The near universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis. Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### Cardiovascular function and treatment in β-thalassemia major: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^1146ikv9]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Cardiac risk biomarkers in β-thalassemia major — serum ferritin trends indicate that long-term elevations predict cardiac mortality, but single measurements may mislead; a ferritin level > 2500 μg/L indicates raised risk, risk is increased even down to 1000 μg/L, and a low ferritin does not guarantee freedom from heart failure (HF); inflammation, infection or vitamin C deficiency can alter ferritin, so individual serum ferritin may not reflect total body iron load or cardiac risk.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

### Estimating iron overload in patients with suspected liver disease and elevated serum ferritin [^117DWzh9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron status evaluation in patients with suspected liver disease and elevated serum ferritin is often challenging because hyperferritinemia does not always indicate iron overload. A reliable approach to estimate iron overload without exposing the patient to unnecessary investigations would help the clinician to identify patients who may take advantage of iron-removal therapy.

Methods

We analyzed all liver biopsies, including measurement of hepatic iron concentration, performed at the University Hospital Zurich from 1997 to 2010 to identify clinical and laboratory predictors of iron overload in patients with elevated serum ferritin (n = 147).

Results

Hyperferritinemia was predictive of iron overload only in patients with a high level of serum ferritin (> 2000 μg/L). In patients with moderate hyperferritinemia, liver transaminases inversely correlated with hepatic iron concentration. A combination of both parameters expressed as ferritin/aspartate transaminase ratio was highly predictive of tissue iron overload (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 78.6%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis resulted in an area under the curve of 0.83.

Conclusions

We established a simple and reliable method to correctly estimate iron overload in patients with suspected liver disease and elevated serum ferritin.

### The fascinating but deceptive ferritin: to measure it or not to measure it in chronic kidney disease? [^112Yq2rp]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the emergence of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has revolutionized the anemia management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the past two decades, strategies to assess iron (Fe) status and to provide Fe supplementation have remained indistinct. The reported cases of hemochromatosis in dialysis patients from the pre-erythropoiesis-stimulating agent era along with the possible associations of Fe with infection and oxidative stress have fueled the "iron apprehension". To date, no reliable marker of Fe stores in CKD has been agreed on. Serum ferritin continues to be the focus of attention. Almost half of all maintenance hemodialysis patients have a serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml. In this ferritin range, Fe supplementation currently is not encouraged, although most reported hemochromatosis cases had a serum ferritin > 2000 ng/ml. The moderate-range hyperferritinemia (500 to 2000 ng/ml) seems to be due mostly to non-Fe-related conditions, including inflammation, malnutrition, liver disease, infection, and malignancy. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that a low, rather than a high, serum Fe is associated with a poor survival in maintenance hemodialysis patients. In multivariate adjusted models that mitigate the confounding effect of malnutrition-inflammation, serum ferritin < 1200 ng/ml and Fe saturation ratio in 30 to 50% range are associated with the greatest survival in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Although ferritin is a fascinating molecule, moderate hyperferritinemia is a misleading marker of Fe stores in patients with CKD. It may be time to revisit the utility of serum ferritin in CKD and ask ourselves whether its measurement has helped us or has caused more confusion and controversy.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Is obesity associated with anemia of chronic disease? A population-based study [^115rAxKV]. Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity is characterized by chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation, which, in turn, has been associated with anemia of chronic disease. We hypothesized that obesity may be associated with the features of anemia of chronic disease, including low hemoglobin concentration, low serum iron and transferrin saturation (TS), and elevated serum ferritin. We compared normal-weight to overweight and obese adult participants of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with respect to hemoglobin concentration and levels of serum iron, TS, and ferritin. Measured BMI was used to categorize participants into normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 6,059), overweight (BMI 25 to < 30 kg/m(2), n = 5,108), mildly obese (BMI 30 to < 35 kg/m(2), n = 2,366), moderately obese (BMI 35 to < 40 kg/m(2), n = 850), and severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2), n = 465). After adjustment for age, gender, menstruation, race/ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, blood donation, and dietary iron intake, serum ferritin was progressively higher with increasing BMI category, whereas serum iron and TS were progressively lower. However, compared to normal-weight persons, those in all other higher BMI categories did not have a significant change in hemoglobin concentration after adjustment for the above-mentioned confounders. Overweight and obesity were associated with changes in serum iron, TS, and ferritin that would be expected to occur in the setting of chronic, systemic inflammation. However, overweight and obese persons were not more likely to be anemic compared with normal-weight persons.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^113CTph7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary iron overload in nontransfusion-dependent iron-loading anemias — because serum ferritin (SF) may underestimate hepatic iron concentration (HIC), an SF threshold of > 800 ng/mL should lead to initiation of treatment in these patients; both phlebotomy and chelation may have a therapeutic role, though chelation is the preferred treatment due to concerns regarding exacerbation of the underlying anemia.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111CX2fR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113CLG4W]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116M47yq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary iron overload — liver disease associations note that in alcohol use disorder (AUD), chronic alcohol consumption is associated with elevation in serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) and can result in increased hepatic iron stores, with low hepcidin levels noted due to ethanol-induced downregulation; in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), patients frequently have elevated serum TS, SF, or both and the term dysmetabolic or insulin-resistance hepatic iron overload syndrome (DIOS or IR-HIO) describes unexplained hepatic iron overload with high SF and normal serum iron related to hepcidin downregulation; in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 30%–40% of patients have elevated serum iron, SF, and TS.

### Should patients with anemia and low normal or normal serum ferritin undergo colonoscopy? [^114JTM3s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia have a greater prevalence of colonic neoplasia, and should be evaluated for a colonoscopy. The approach to patients with anemia without iron deficiency remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the prevalence of colonic neoplasia in anemic patients with normal ferritin (> 50 ng/mL), to those with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL, and nonanemic individuals.

Methods

Patients referred for colonoscopy for anemia evaluation were stratified into 3 groups: ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL, 51–100 ng/mL, and > 100 ng/mL. We compared these groups to each other, and to asymptomatic nonanemic individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy. The prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasia was determined for each group using existing records.

Results

During the study period, 414 patients who underwent colonoscopy for anemia evaluation and 323 nonanemic individuals who underwent colonoscopy for cancer screening met inclusion criteria. Study subjects were mostly men. The prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasia in subjects with ferritin 51–100 ng/mL was 7.2% (95% CI 2.4–17.9%), similar to 7.9% (95% CI 5.1–11.9%) in those with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL. The incidence of advanced colonic neoplasia in subjects with ferritin > 100 ng/mL was 1.7% (95% CI 0.1–6.6%), similar to 1.2% (95% CI 0.4–3.3%) in the asymptomatic nonanemic group. After adjusting for age, patients with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL and 51–100 ng/mL were almost 5 times more likely to harbor advanced colonic neoplasia than the other groups. The addition of other laboratory parameters did not improve the predictive value of ferritin.

Conclusion

A ferritin cutoff of 100 ng/mL can be used to determine the need for colonoscopy in men with anemia.

### An exploratory analysis of routine ferritin measurement upon admission and the prognostic implications of low-grade ferritinemia during inflammation [^113j4wkN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ferritin is usually measured in the presence of anemia or in suspected iron overload syndromes. Ferritin is also an acute-phase protein that is elevated during systemic inflammation. However, the prognostic value of routinely measuring ferritin upon admission to a medical facility is not clear. Therefore, we examined the association between ferritin concentrations measured at the time of hospital admission with 30-day and long-term mortality.

Methods

We obtained routine ferritin measurements taken within 24 hours of admission in 2859 patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department. Multiple clinical and laboratory parameters were used to assess the association between ferritin and overall mortality during a median follow-up of 15 months (interquartile range [IQR] 8–22).

Results

Ferritin levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.06) for each 100 ng/mL increase. Patients with intermediate (78–220 ng/mL) and high (> 221 ng/mL) ferritin concentrations (2nd and 3rd tertiles) had higher 30-day mortality rates even after adjustment for age, sex, and existing comorbidities (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.70–2.5). Long-term overall mortality rates demonstrated a similar pattern across ferritin tertiles (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71).

Conclusions

Routine admission ferritin concentrations are linearly and independently correlated with excess mortality risk in hospitalized patients, even those with apparently "normal" ferritin concentrations (< 300 mg/mL). Thus, low-grade ferritinemia might not be an innocent finding in the context of the inflammatory response. Its potential biological and therapeutic implications warrant future research.

### Serum ferritin threshold for iron deficiency screening in one-year-old children [^116tp5Hq]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal hemoglobin screening for iron deficiency anemia using hemoglobin < 110 g/L at the 1-year-old well child visit. Our retrospective study suggests the need for combined hemoglobin and serum ferritin iron deficiency screening and raising the diagnostic serum ferritin threshold to 24–25 μg/L.

### Ferritin levels and risk of heart failure-the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^112dcLCb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Severe iron overload is associated with cardiac damage, while iron deficiency has been related to worse outcomes in subjects with heart failure (HF). This study investigated the relationship between ferritin, a marker of iron status, and the incidence of HF in a community-based cohort.

Methods and Results

We examined 1063 participants who were free of heart failure from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study in whom ferritin serum levels were measured at baseline (1987–1989). The participants (mean age 52.7 ± 5.5 years, 62% women), were categorized in low (< 30 ng/mL; n = 153), normal (30–200 ng/mL in women and 30–300 ng/mL in men; n = 663), and high (> 200 ng/mL in women and > 300 ng/mL in men; n = 247) ferritin levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship between ferritin and incident HF. After 21 ± 4.6 years of follow-up, HF occurred in 144 (13.5%) participants. When compared with participants with normal ferritin levels, participants with low ferritin levels had a higher risk of HF [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–4.35; P = 0.02] as did those with high ferritin levels (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.01–3.25; P = 0.04), after adjusting for potential confounders. Notably, low ferritin levels remained associated with incident HF even after excluding subjects with anaemia (HR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.11–4.68; P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Derangements in iron metabolism, either low or high ferritin serum levels, were associated with higher risk of incident HF in a general population, even without concurrent anaemia. These findings suggest that iron imbalance might play a role in the development of HF.
