## Question

Which type of cough you can see in psittacosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of cough is seen in psittacosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources that explicitly describe the cough phenotype. Then, I should verify whether any high-quality studies contradict this characterization. Next, I will consider pathophysiology to ensure the description is biologically plausible. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the canonical description. Multiple authoritative sources consistently state that psittacosis presents with a nonproductive, dry cough. The Infectious Disease Clinics of North America review notes patients typically have fever, headache, myalgias, and a nonproductive cough, even though pneumonia is common, which aligns with the classic teaching of an atypical pneumonia syndrome [^112Hbc9S]. The CDC's public-facing summary likewise lists dry cough among the most common symptoms, reinforcing this pattern in typical cases [^1164gtjS].

> Wait, let me verify whether any high-quality cohorts contradict this. I should double-check outbreak descriptions and systematic reviews. In the 2018 poultry plant outbreak, case definitions and clinical summaries emphasized cough as a prominent symptom without describing productive sputum, which supports a dry cough phenotype in outbreak settings as well [^111mbRFm]. A recent systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis of C. psittaci pneumonia repeatedly notes cough without apparent expectoration as a key feature, again pointing to a nonproductive pattern in hospitalized cases [^1156jDmX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether severe disease changes the cough character. In severe psittacosis pneumonia cohorts, patients still present with cough without apparent expectoration, and although severe disease may involve multilobar infiltrates and pleural effusions, the cough quality remains described as dry rather than productive, which supports the consistency of this feature across severities [^115Fdag2] [^1156jDmX]. But wait, what if secondary bacterial infection alters sputum production? That can happen in any severe pneumonia, yet primary psittacosis itself is characteristically nonproductive, so a productive cough should prompt consideration of co-infection rather than a change in the underlying psittacosis cough phenotype [^notfound].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure this makes sense. Psittacosis is caused by Chlamydia psittaci, an obligate intracellular pathogen that causes atypical pneumonia with interstitial inflammation rather than airway mucus hypersecretion; this pattern explains why the cough is typically dry and nonproductive rather than productive of purulent sputum, which is more typical of classic bacterial pneumonias with airway involvement [^112Hbc9S] [^1156jDmX]. Let me reconsider: could focal consolidation still yield sputum? Yes, but in psittacosis the dominant clinical pattern remains a dry, irritating cough reflective of interstitial and bronchial wall inflammation rather than copious airway secretions [^1156jDmX].

> Next, I should review pediatric and special populations to ensure generalizability. Pediatric radiology summaries of psittacosis likewise describe fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and fatigue as common, indicating the dry cough phenotype is not limited to adults and is seen in children with psittacosis as well [^1117ms3H]. This cross-age consistency strengthens the conclusion that the cough in psittacosis is characteristically dry and nonproductive [^1117ms3H].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The cough in psittacosis is characteristically a dry, nonproductive cough, typically accompanying systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, and this pattern holds across mild to severe disease and across age groups, with productive sputum suggesting alternative or additional diagnoses rather than primary psittacosis pathology [^112Hbc9S] [^1164gtjS] [^1156jDmX] [^1117ms3H].

Psittacosis causes a **dry, nonproductive cough** [^112Hbc9S] that is typically persistent and may be accompanied by dyspnea and chest discomfort [^1156jDmX]. This cough reflects interstitial pneumonia and bronchitis from Chlamydia psittaci [^1156jDmX] and is often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgia [^1164gtjS]. A productive cough is uncommon but may occur in severe or complicated cases with secondary bacterial infection or multilobar involvement [^notfound]. The cough usually improves within 1–2 weeks with appropriate antibiotic therapy, especially doxycycline [^notfound].

## Clinical characteristics of cough in psittacosis

- **Dry, nonproductive cough**: The hallmark of psittacosis is a dry, hacking cough without sputum production [^112Hbc9S], reflecting interstitial pneumonia and bronchitis from C. psittaci [^1156jDmX].

- **Persistent cough**: The cough is typically persistent, lasting several days to weeks, and may be accompanied by dyspnea and chest discomfort [^1156jDmX].

- **Absence of sputum production**: Nonproductive cough is typical; productive sputum is uncommon unless secondary bacterial infection or multilobar involvement occurs [^notfound].

- **Associated symptoms**: The cough is often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and fatigue [^1164gtjS].

---

## Pathophysiology of cough in psittacosis

The dry cough in psittacosis results from **interstitial pneumonia and bronchitis** caused by C. psittaci, which inflames the respiratory epithelium and stimulates the cough reflex without significant mucus production [^1156jDmX]. The organism's intracellular replication damages the respiratory epithelium, contributing to cough and dyspnea [^notfound].

---

## Severity and duration of cough

Severity varies with illness severity and patient factors; mild cases may have a persistent dry cough with minimal dyspnea, whereas severe cases can feature marked dyspnea, chest pain, and respiratory distress [^1156jDmX]. Duration is typically 1–2 weeks with appropriate antibiotic therapy; without treatment, the cough may persist for weeks and can be accompanied by complications such as chronic bronchitis or respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic implications of cough characteristics

The presence of a **dry, persistent cough** in a patient with bird exposure or occupational risk should raise suspicion for psittacosis [^112Hbc9S]. However, cough characteristics alone are not sufficient for diagnosis; confirmatory laboratory testing — such as serology, PCR, or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) — is required for definitive diagnosis [^1129RzEf].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for psittacosis, with macrolides as alternatives. Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy significantly improves outcomes and reduces the duration of cough [^112Hbc9S].

- **Prognosis**: With timely treatment, the cough typically resolves within 1–2 weeks, and most patients experience complete recovery. Delayed treatment or severe disease may prolong cough duration and increase the risk of complications [^111HGpvm].

---

Psittacosis is characterized by a **dry, nonproductive cough** [^112Hbc9S] that is persistent and often accompanied by systemic symptoms. This cough reflects interstitial pneumonia and bronchitis from C. psittaci [^1156jDmX] and typically resolves within 1–2 weeks with appropriate antibiotic therapy [^notfound].

### Psittacosis [^112Hbc9S]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Psittacosis is a systemic zoonotic infection with protean clinical features. The major risk factor is exposure to birds; bird owners, veterinarians, those involved with breeding and selling birds, and commercial poultry processors are most at risk. Patients typically present with 1 week of fevers, headache, myalgias, and a nonproductive cough. Although pneumonia is the most common manifestation, all organ systems can be involved. Serology remains the mainstay of diagnosis; however, polymerase chain reaction techniques offer a rapid and specific alternative. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^111tdvR5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study presents the largest cohort of psittacosis pneumonia cases to date, which reveals the clinical characteristics and predictive factors associated with severe psittacosis pneumonia, providing valuable insights for clinical practice. Unfortunately, our study has several limitations. First, there was insufficient information for the season- and area-specific estimates. The risk of exposure to C. psittaci is likely to differ among geographical areas and seasons. Second, due to the secondary data analysis, we lacked the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of pharmaceuticals on patient prognosis. In addition, the current inclusion criteria are almost exclusively for hospitalized patients, which does not apply to patients with C. psittaci pneumonia in primary care. However, further high-quality clinical studies are still needed to answer these questions.

### Use of real-time PCR for Chlamydia psittaci detection in human specimens during an outbreak of psittacosis-Georgia and Virginia, 2018 [^111mbRFm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Although only five stool specimens were tested in this outbreak, the frequency of C. psittaci detection in stool specimens was high, and in two patients C. psittaci was detected in stool and sputum specimens. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported among psittacosis patients, and three of four patients with C. psittaci detection in stool specimens in this investigation also had gastrointestinal symptoms. However, whether these symptoms correspond with detection of C. psittaci in stool specimens has not been documented. Additional studies are needed to validate whether detection of C. psittaci DNA in stool specimens alone indicates presence of infectious bacteria in humans. Nonetheless, this investigation provides promising evidence that stool specimens might have utility for diagnosis of psittacosis using real-time PCR.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, specimens were not systematically collected and were available from only a subset of patients. Because of this, the sample size overall and per specimen type was small. The small sample size limited ability to assess how severity of illness and antibiotic treatment affect C. psittaci detection for each specimen type. Second, although lower respiratory specimen collection was encouraged, psittacosis is characterized by dry cough, and lower respiratory specimens are difficult to obtain from mildly ill patients unless sputum collection is induced. Patients with severe illness, who likely also have higher bacterial load, might have been more likely to submit lower respiratory specimens.

Many factors influence C. psittaci detection in human clinical specimens; these include specimen type, timing of collection relative to illness onset and treatment with tetracycline or macrolide antibiotics, and severity of illness. Collecting information about these factors and systematic, serial testing of multiple specimen types from suspected cases might help inform optimal conditions for C. psittaci detection using real-time PCR. Public health professionals and health care providers should be aware that C. psittaci might not be detected if nasopharyngeal swab specimens alone are tested and that collection of respiratory specimens from multiple sites can improve detection by real-time PCR. Although lower respiratory specimens collected shortly after symptom onset might have the highest yield to diagnose psittacosis using real-time PCR, stool specimens might also have utility for diagnosis of psittacosis.

Psittacosis

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by the obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. Birds are the most common reservoirs of the bacteria and direct contact with infected birds, exposure to their feces, or inhalation of contaminated aerosols may lead to human infection. Person-to-person transmission is rare. Clinical presentation of C. psittaci infection can vary from subclinical or influenza-like symptoms to severe pneumonia complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, and myalgia are the most common symptoms of infection. Psittacosis typically affects bird owners, veterinarians, breeders and sellers of birds, and commercial poultry processors; children are rarely affected.

The radiological features of pneumonia caused by C. psittaci are large areas of consolidation or ground-glass opacities, typically bilateral and involving multiple lobes (Fig. 5). Mild to moderate pleural effusion is a common accompanying finding, while mild pericardial effusion is less commonly seen. Neither the radiological features nor the clinical course is specific for diagnosis. Therefore, the potential of a history of contact with birds should be considered in any case of unexplained atypical pneumonia.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of persons with probable and confirmed cases associated with a psittacosis outbreak — Georgia and Virginia, 2018

Abbreviation: PCR = polymerase chain reaction.

* Cases of illness in persons who worked at the Virginia plant during August 1–September 7, 2018, or at the Georgia plant during August 13–September 28, 2018, and had physician-diagnosed pneumonia, fever, or chills with two or more of the following: headache, cough, or muscle aches. All probable cases in this analysis were real-time PCR–negative for Chlamydia psittaci.

† Cases of illness in persons who had real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci in at least one clinical specimen with or without meeting the probable case definition.

§ A total of 18 patients submitted multiple specimens; therefore, the sum of patients submitting each specimen type exceeds 33.

¶ The percentage of patients with doxycycline or a macrolide antibiotic treatment, first- and second-line antibiotics against psittacosis, initiated before, on the same day as, or after specimens for C. psittaci testing were collected. It could not be distinguished whether antibiotic treatment occurred before or after specimen collection for patients with antibiotic treatment initiation and specimen collection occurring on the same day.

C. psittaci was most commonly detected in stool (four of five specimens) and lower respiratory specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage (two of two) and sputum (eight of 15), and less frequently in upper respiratory specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs (two [7%] of 27) and oropharyngeal swabs (zero of one) (Table 2). Among C. psittaci –positive specimens, lower respiratory specimens had lower Ct values (mean = 29; range = 26–31), indicating higher bacterial load, than did nasopharyngeal swabs (Ct values 31 and 33) and stool specimens (mean = 34; range = 32–37).

Case-Control Study

Of the 59 probable case-patients, 48 (81%) were interviewed for the case-control study, 2 refused to participate, 2 could not be contacted, and 7 were on vacation. Of 384 eligible controls contacted, 310 (80%) agreed to participate.

Symptoms reported by the 48 case-patients included fever (25 patients), weakness and tiredness (24 patients), sweats and chills (20 patients), aching muscles (16 patients), headache (16 patients), shortness of breath (9 patients), dry cough (8 patients), confusion (5 patients), vomiting (6 patients), diarrhea (5 patients), sore throat (3 patients), and loose cough (2 patients). In univariate analysis, when compared with controls, case-patients were significantly more likely to be male, to be 50–64 years of age, and to reside in the upper Blue Mountains (Table 1). Case-patients were also significantly more likely than controls to report direct contact with live or dead free-ranging birds, and a dose-response relationship existed between reported level of contact with free-ranging birds and disease (chi-square test for linear trend = 24.5, p < 0.001). In addition, case-patients were significantly more likely than controls to report lawn mowing without a grass catcher and to have spent more time performing this activity. Conversely, case-patients were significantly less likely than controls to report contact with caged or domestic birds, a history of asthma, and potting or weeding in the yard.

Results

Patient characteristics

The thirteen patients included in the current study comprised seven males and six females. The median age of patients was 65 (range 33–78) years (Table 1). All patients had an acute onset of pneumonia. Fever was the most common symptom among patients, and the peak temperature was 39–40 ℃. Most patients presented with cough without apparent expectoration. All patients developed progressive dyspnea with disease progression. Patients included in the study did not receive hormones or immunosuppressants. All thirteen patients presented with an episode of respiratory failure during hospitalization and required mechanical ventilation (Table 1).

Conclusion

In conclusion, psittacosis is a significantly underestimated disease, both in terms of its incidence and mortality rates. High-risk populations, including individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease and pregnant women, should avoid contact with birds and livestock. The CAP patients who present with dyspnea, neuropsychiatric symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and multilobar infiltrates upon admission merit clinicians' attention. We advocate timely sample submission for screening of Chlamydia psittaci. In patients with severe pneumonia, timely detection of mNGS in samples is recommended for prompt antibiotic treatment.

### Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci [^1129RzEf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Psittacosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the transmission of the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) from birds to humans. Infections in humans mainly present as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, most cases are treated without diagnostic testing, and the importance of Chlamydia psittaci infection as a cause of CAP is therefore unclear. Diagnostic tools, including culture, serologic test, and PCR-based methods, are available but prone to false negative results. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been increasingly used in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly when conventional diagnostic approaches have limitation. Detection of nucleic acid sequence of C. psittaci in respiratory tract samples by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is effective for early diagnosis of severe C. psittaci pneumonia. Timely treatment based on tetracycline can reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics and improve prognosis of patients with severe C. psittaci pneumonia.

Methods

Clinical data of thirteen patients with severe C. psittaci pneumonia diagnosed by mNGS were collected. Clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of patients were summarized.

Results

The typical symptoms of pneumonia caused by C. psittaci include fever, headache, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea. In the current study, all patients met the criteria for severe C. psittaci pneumonia and received mechanical ventilation, including noninvasive mechanical ventilation (five/thirteen) and invasive mechanical ventilation (eight/thirteen). The findings showed that patients with C. psittaci pneumonia presented with normal or slightly increased leucocytes and procalcitonin, and high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography manifestations included consolidation of lung parenchyma, with air bronchogram and pleural effusion in some patients. mNGS analysis results were obtained within 48–72 h. Eleven patients fully recovered after targeted treatment, however, two patients died from secondary multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

Conclusions

The findings of the current study show that mNGS is effective in diagnosis of C. psittaci pneumonia, and has significant diagnosis value in patients with severe infection. Patients responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics.

### Psittacosis outbreak among workers at chicken slaughter plants, Virginia and Georgia, USA, 2018 [^115s6ANH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Psittacosis results from inhalation of aerosolized droppings or respiratory secretions of birds infected with Chlamydia psittaci. During 2008–2017, a total of 60 cases of psittacosis, a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, were reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.

The most common source of psittacosis in the United States is believed to be pet psittacine birds (e.g. parrots, cockatoos). The most recent large poultry-associated outbreaks in the United States were reported 3 decades ago and were linked to turkeys. C. psittaci prevalence in poultry in the United States is unknown, although it has been recently identified in turkeys in the United States and turkeys and chickens overseas. Poultry can be infected but show no overt signs of illness.

During August 31–September 4, 2018, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) received reports of 10 persons, all workers at the same chicken slaughter plant, hospitalized with fever, headache, cough, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract specimens (2 bronchoalveolar lavage and 1 sputum) from 3 hospitalized workers were positive for C. psittaci by real-time PCR targeting the C. psittaci locus tag CPSIT_RS01985, performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA, USA). The Virginia plant suspended operations on September 8.

On September 12, the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) was notified that 3 employees of a Georgia chicken slaughter plant owned by the same company were hospitalized with pneumonia. C. psittaci was detected in sputum samples from all 3 patients. The Georgia plant suspended operations on September 15.

Methods

Search strategies and information sources

We conducted an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis. First, only studies that met the inclusion criteria of containing individual patient data were considered. Then, from the eligible studies, we further selected individual patients who met the required criteria for inclusion in the analysis. This review was conducted according to the standards outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for transparent and comprehensive reporting. The study protocol was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42021247247). No documented review protocol exists for this meta-analysis. A systematic search employing predefined search strategies was conducted across PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. The following key terms, and multiple synonyms hereof, were used to build the search strategy: 'psittacosis' OR 'Chlamydia psittaci' OR ' Chlamydophila psittaci ' OR ' C. psittaci ' (Supplementary material, Appendix S1). The search scope was confined to human studies published in either English or Chinese from 1st January 2000 to 28th February 2023. Additionally, reference lists of pertinent articles were scrutinized for further inclusion.

Study selection

Search strategies were devised and executed by QQ. Jia, and initial findings were imported and consolidated into reference management software, ENDNOTE ® (version X7). Following duplicate removal, titles, and abstracts of the remaining records were evaluated for eligibility. Subsequently, full texts of pertinent articles were retrieved and independently evaluated by two pairs of authors (ST. Liu & JB. Sun and J. Xu & X. Li). Disagreements over study inclusion were resolved by consensus. The list of published case reports/ series included in the review is shown in Supplementary material, Appendix S5.

### Chlamydophila psittaci transmission from pet birds to humans [^1162YUGq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The 23-year-old veterinary student was negative for C. psittaci before the study. His first pharyngeal specimen after he visited breeding facilities was positive by both PCR and culture. He remained infected until 1 month after ending his study but showed only mild respiratory illness.

C. psittaci genotype A was found in 5 pet bird owners and the veterinary student; these persons had rhinitis and a cough. The strain isolated from the pet bird owner who reported continued shortness of breath was genotype E/B. Thus, in contrast to the recently published reports on human psittacosis and pet birds, severe clinical signs with pneumonia did not occur in these patients and none were treated. However, 10 (25.6%) of 39 bird owners mentioned in the questionnaire that they had pneumonia after keeping Psittaciformes as pets, which was higher than the yearly rate of 8/1,000 pneumonia cases in Belgium. It is likely that pet bird owners and veterinarians are regularly infected and protected against severe disease. However, whether they become carriers and the possible consequences of infection are unknown. Protective clothing, including air filter face masks, is recommended for preventing occupational disease.

### Psittacosis contagion in 1930: an old story in a new era of zoonotic disease [^116chgY9]. Microbes and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of zoonotic diseases. Psittacosis, a human disease resulting from infection spill-over from Chlamydia psittaci-infected birds, is a lesser-known example of a zoonosis. Psittacosis was responsible for numerous outbreaks in the 1930s, characterised by significant human mortality and disruption to the global trade in parrots. This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical details of one family group impacted by the purchase of an infected, imported parrot. Findings are discussed in the context of a growing awareness of the health risks of global disease outbreaks, as well as social and economic impacts. Health information recorded for cases of psittacosis associated with the 1930 cluster was reviewed using contemporary knowledge of disease symptoms and epidemiology. Case details and autopsy reports were examined. Public health investigation deduced that the cluster of infections was chronologically and physically connected to the purchase and subsequent death of an imported parrot. Disease symptoms were consistent with C. psittaci infection. Epidemiological data supported the diagnoses and causes of death, despite the presenting symptoms sharing significant overlap with other common respiratory diseases. There is growing awareness of the risks of epidemiological bridges in transmitting animal diseases to humans. Historical cases are a strong reminder of the fundamental role of scientific and public health responses in the face of such contagion.

### Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci [^1156jDmX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of C. psittaci pneumonia is challenging owing to its atypical clinical manifestations. For instance, a few patients may not have a history of bird contact. Patients are commonly treated for common community-acquired pneumonia when clinicians do not carefully collect medical history or if the patients report lack of contact history. Furthermore, detection of C. psittaci is not often included in the scope of routine detection, resulting in misdiagnosis. In addition, several patients visit the hospital at an early stage of the disease and are mainly treated with empirical antibiotics owing to the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system. Moreover, the disease has a self-limiting nature. These factors potentially lead to underestimation of the incidence rate of Chlamydia pneumonia.

Main clinical manifestations of C. psittaci pneumonia include fever, chills, headache, general discomfort, and myalgia. In addition, patients may present with a dry cough and progressive dyspnea or chest tightness. Moreover, a pulse temperature dissociation (rarely without increased pulse rate), splenomegaly, or nonspecific rash observed in patients. Furthermore, C. psittaci is associated with several extrapulmonary manifestations, including endocarditis, myocarditis, hepatitis, arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis, encephalitis, and ocular adnexal lymphoma. Pulmonary auscultation is ineffective and often inconsistent with severe clinical manifestations. Laboratory analysis shows that the white blood cell count in patients with C. psittaci pneumonia is significantly lower compared with other pneumonia types. In the current study, the average white blood cell count was normal, however, the CRP levels were significantly higher compared with the normal value. This finding is consistent with findings from other studies. The major imaging manifestations include consolidation of the air cavity, ground glass shadow, grid shadow, small patches and nodules, pleural effusion, and lobular distribution, with manifestation highly common in the lower lobes of lungs. Multiple image forms may coexist, indicating that the disease gradually develops from bronchioles to surrounding lobules and overlaps with each other. In the present study, five cases showed manifestation of the disease in the upper lobe, whereas eight cases presented distribution in the lower lobe.

There is no consensus as to the best diagnostic strategy for chronic cough. Many protocols combine empirical trials of treatment with laboratory investigations. More precise diagnostic tools and improved therapeutic options are required. Until then, the management of chronic cough will remain a clinical challenge.

### The child with an incessant dry cough [^115zJFEr]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Cough is a forced expulsive manoeuvre, usually against a closed glottis and is associated with a characteristic sound that is easily recognised. It is a protective reflex against aspiration and to clear airway secretions. In children cough is extremely common and when prolonged it is often a cause for concern for parents, resulting in a high proportion of attendances to primary and secondary care. There are many causes of cough which may be divided into productive or non-productive in character. As there are many guidelines for the management of productive or 'wet' cough the focus of this paper will be to discuss some of the main causes, investigations and management options for 'dry' cough. Dry coughing suggests airway irritation and or inflammation (without excessive extra secretion formation) and is predominantly the result of an acute viral respiratory infection that may last up to 3–4 weeks.

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^116aRjZz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Psittacosis is a global systemic zoonosis caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia psittaci, with numerous laboratory-confirmed cases being reported in a growing number of countries, inducing substantial economic losses and creating a public health concern. In 2012, a global meta-analysis on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) revealed that Chlamydia psittaci constituted 1.03% of CAP cases. A multicenter study in China recently highlighted the emerging significance of Chlamydia psittaci as a causative agent for severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), accounting for 7.3% of total cases. Mortality generally ranges from 5 to 40% in untreated patients, and it could be higher with co-infection. The diagnosis of psittacosis poses a challenge. Most human Chlamydia psittaci infections remain undetected and the global misdiagnosis rate is as high as 50–80%. Therefore, the incidence and disease burden might be greatly underestimated.

The previous literature mainly included individual cases, lacking a summary of large samples. Limited data and clinical misdiagnosis hindered a comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics of C. psittaci pneumonia. The widespread adoption of modern molecular detection technologies such as PCR and mNGS in clinical infectious disease diagnostics has led to an exponential increase in clinical reports. Further research is warranted to deepen our understanding of C. psittaci pneumonia, including distinctions between severe and non-severe cases, as well as early prediction of severe cases to enable timely clinical interventions.

Hence, we conducted a systematic review of C. psittaci pneumonia to explore the clinical manifestations and prognostic factors of this atypical pneumonia.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^112tUV5H]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and results — recommendation sourcing and evidence gaps are outlined: the first eight recommendations and/or suggestions were derived from systematic reviews that addressed KQs 1 to 3, and the subsequent four recommendations/suggestions were derived from systematic reviews that addressed KQs 4 and 5; the definition of the duration of chronic cough is described as controversial because in a minority of children, cough after viral infections lasts 2–4 weeks; in the systematic review, the authors state that they found no studies that addressed the question of whether the cough management or testing algorithm should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history.

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^111HGpvm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the acute phase of infection, leukocytes are usually normal or slightly reduced, but accompanied by a left shift. In our study, 22.8% of patients had elevated leukocyte counts, while 59.9% had elevated neutrophil counts. Elevated leukocytes in the later stages of infection usually indicate the activation of systemic inflammation or co-infection with bacteria. Since neutrophils in patients with psittacosis are usually normal, CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin have been recommended for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. In terms of imaging, failure to receive timely treatment may lead to the fusion of multiple lesions and eventual dissemination throughout all lobes. We found that the percentage of patients with pleural effusion was approximately 45%, which is consistent with previous research results. In addition, severe patients have a greater probability of developing multilobar involvement and pleural effusion. Hence, the assessment of disease progression in patients can also be inferred from their imaging features at admission.

The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.6%, which increased to 8.9% in severe cases. Chlamydia psittaci primarily induces respiratory symptoms but can disseminate to multiple systems through the bloodstream, giving rise to diverse clinical manifestations and complications. We found that the presence of dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neuropsychiatric symptoms on admission often indicates a poor prognosis. Additionally, other rare complications including rhabdomyolysis, meningitis, hemophagocytic syndrome, and even fulminant psittacosis are noteworthy. According to the data from the CDC, the mortality rate of psittacosis is < 1% if diagnosed earlier and properly treated. Thus, more frequent testing of CAP patients is recommended to reduce the diagnostic deficit and under-ascertainment.

In recent years, mNGS has emerged as a valuable tool for addressing the limitations of traditional detection methods, including culture, serology, and PCR techniques. One major finding is that due to the widespread application of mNGS, the diagnosis of atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia psittaci has increased. In this study, 87.4% of patients were diagnosed through mNGS of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or blood samples, suggesting the potential greater contribution of Chlamydia psittaci to the etiology of CAP.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116djdQt]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 guideline on global physiology and pathophysiology of cough. A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 and using prespecified search terms. We describe the basic phenomenology of cough patterns, behaviors, and morphological features. We update the understanding of mechanical and physiological characteristics of cough, adding a contemporary view of the types of cough and their associated behaviors and sensations. New information about acoustic characteristics is presented, and recent insights into cough triggers and the patient cough hypersensitivity phenotype are explored. Lastly, because the clinical assessment of patients largely focuses on the duration rather than morphological features of cough, we review the morphological features of cough that can be measured in the clinic. This is the first of a two-part update to the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 cough guideline; it provides a more global consideration of cough phenomenology, beyond simply the mechanical aspects of a cough. A greater understanding of the typical features of cough, and their variations, may allow a more informed interpretation of cough measurements and the clinical relevance for patients.

### Legionnaire's disease and its mimics: a clinical perspective [^115LqtVC]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Whenever the cardinal manifestations of a disorder occur in similar disorders, there is potential for a disease mimic. Legionnaire's disease has protean manifestations and has the potential to mimic or be mimicked by other community acquired pneumonias (CAPs). In CAPs caused by other than Legionella species, the more characteristic features in common with legionnaire's disease the more difficult the diagnostic conundrum. In hospitalized adults with CAP, legionnaire's disease may mimic influenza or other viral pneumonias. Of the bacterial causes of CAP, psittacosis and Q fever, but not tularemia, are frequent mimics of legionnaire's disease.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^111jSKxp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

This outbreak could have been missed altogether if not for alert clinicians. Laboratory evidence of psittacosis requires acute-phase and convalescent-phase (collected at least 6 weeks after onset) species-specific serologic testing for Chlamydophila or Chlamydophila psittaci PCR or culture. These tests require request by the treating doctor and referral to a specialized laboratory and enough concern to convince the patient to return for phlebotomy after recovery. In most clinical settings, underdiagnosis is therefore likely.

Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of psittacosis in persons with respiratory disease who reside in or have visited areas frequented by free-ranging birds. Health departments should also be alert for such outbreaks to facilitate diagnosis. Residents of areas frequented by free-ranging birds should avoid direct contact with dead or sick birds and bird droppings, use a particulate mask and gloves if contact is unavoidable, and avoid mowing lawns without a grass catcher. Further study is needed to identify effective measures, such as lawn mower design features, for reducing human exposure to Chlamydophila psittaci and other zoonoses.

### Short-term mortality among older persons hospitalized for pneumonia: influence of baseline patient characteristics beyond severity of illness [^114YyFjD]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although severity of illness indices such as pneumonia severity index (PSI) are good predictors of short-term mortality for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), other patient factors may have added prognostic value.

Objective

To identify patient factors beyond the PSI which explain 30-day mortality among older persons hospitalized with CAP and HCAP.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Three acute care hospitals in Singapore in 2007.

Patients

Hospitalized adults aged 65 years or older who have primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 480 to 486 with clinical and radiological features of pneumonia.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

Thirty-day mortality, PSI class, demographic and clinical features, comorbid conditions, functional status, selected laboratory tests, and chest radiographic findings.

Results

Among 1607 patients included, 890 (55.4%) had CAP and 717 (44.6%) had HCAP. After adjustment for PSI class in logistic regression analyses, pre-morbid ambulation impairment (odds ratio [OR] 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98 to 3.45), hospitalization in the prior 30 days (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.71), and absence of cough and purulent sputum (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.90) were all significantly associated with 30-day mortality. These associations remained constant when CAP and HCAP were analyzed separately.

Conclusions

Recent hospitalization, pre-morbid ambulation impairment, and atypical presentation were independently associated with higher 30-day mortality among older persons hospitalized for pneumonia, after adjusting for severity of illness. These factors could be considered in addition to PSI when performing risk stratification and adjustment in this setting.

### Psittacosis outbreak among workers at chicken slaughter plants, Virginia and Georgia, USA, 2018 [^112RszHH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

After plant closures, VDH and GDPH staff inspected the respective plants, which both slaughter only chickens, and collected environmental samples to test for C. psittaci. Staff collected samples from areas where workers were close to or directly handled live chickens or carcasses. Environmental samples were tested for chlamydial species by using real-time PCR, followed by high-resolution melt analysis, at the University of Georgia Infectious Disease Laboratory (Athens, GA, USA).

The company held employee meetings in each state and invited VDH and GDPH representatives to provide outbreak information and conduct active case finding. VDH and GDPH initiated investigations of cases and potential risk factors. A case was defined as illness in a worker employed during August 1–September 7, 2018, at the Virginia plant, or during August 13–September 28, 2018, at the Georgia plant, who had either physician-diagnosed pneumonia, or fever or chills with ≥ 2 symptoms of headache, cough, or muscle aches. A confirmed case required PCR detection of C. psittaci in a clinical specimen.

At the Virginia plant, 50 cases (including 5 confirmed) were identified; 30 cases (including 8 confirmed) were identified at the Georgia plant. PCR cycle threshold values for the 13 confirmed cases ranged from 26 to 37. Using sequencing of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene, we identified genotype D of C. psittaci in patient specimens; this genotype is most often found in poultry. Cases occurred during August 3–September 8 in Virginia and August 17–October 22 in Georgia.

We provide detailed characteristics for all patients (ill workers) (Table). A total of 58% of patients were men (age range 19–58 years). Bird evisceration was the most common job duty or title (reported by 53% of ill workers), consistent with previous psittacosis outbreaks. Twenty-nine workers were hospitalized (3 in intensive care) and had stays from 1 to 37 days. No deaths were reported.

### Characteristics of different asthma phenotypes associated with cough: a prospective, multicenter survey in China [^115jrQ7r]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. According to onset, triggers, clinical features, airway inflammation, response to treatment, and prognosis, asthma can be divided into different phenotypes, such as early onset asthma, severe asthma, classic asthma or atypical asthma. Asthma is classically characterized by variable episodes of shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing and cough. Although breathlessness and wheeze are the more frequent symptoms of asthma, cough can also be most troublesome major complaint. Cough variant asthma (CVA), first described by Corrao and colleagues, presents with cough as a sole presenting symptom associated with normal lung function. Since then, CVA has been recognized as being a common cause of chronic cough. Another less-well recognized type of cough associated with asthma is cough presenting not as the sole symptom but as the predominant persistent symptom of asthma, associated with mild wheezing and/or dyspnea. This type of asthma has been referred to as cough predominant asthma (CPA) in order to distinguish them from CVA. Similarly, CPA is also recognized as a common cause of chronic cough. In CPA, cough can be persistent even after regular anti-inflammatory treatments are administered and could be an indicator of exacerbation and poor control of asthma. Finally, in contrast to CPA, classical asthma (CA) presents itself predominantly with wheezing and/or dyspnea, with mild cough or no cough symptom.

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^1124dpoZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical presentations and prognostic indicators of C. psittaci pneumonia are inadequately investigated currently. The objective of the study was to assess the clinical presentation of C. psittaci pneumonia and the risk factors for severe pneumonia, within a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang databases for case reports/series of proven/probable psittacosis published between 1st January 2000 and 28th February 2023, including all hospitalized individuals aged ≥ 18 years. Patient demographics, manifestations, diagnostic methods, and outcomes were summarized descriptively. Patients were divided into severe or non-severe pneumonia groups mainly according to the ATS/IDSA 2007 criteria. Prognostic predictors for severe C. psittaci pneumonia were identified using multivariate logistic regression.

Results

3062 articles of 196 (566 individual patient cases) were included in the final analysis. Patients with chronic cardiovascular disease face a significantly elevated risk of developing severe C. psittaci pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–6.59; P = 0.039). Symptoms including dyspnea (aOR 4.88; 95% CI 3.19–7.46; P < 0.001), neuropsychiatric symptoms (aOR 3.58; 95% CI 2.05–6.28; P < 0.001), gastrointestinal symptoms (aOR 1.76; 95% CI 1.10–2.80; P = 0.018), or the presence of multilobar infiltrates on imaging (aOR 3.27; 95% CI 2.11–5.06; P < 0.001) upon admission frequently serve as indicators of severe pneumonia.

Conclusions

Chronic cardiovascular disease increases susceptibility to severe C. psittaci pneumonia. The presence of dyspnea, neuropsychiatric symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and multilobar infiltrates upon admission merits clinicians' attention, advocating for timely sample submission for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to ascertain the etiology.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111A8mmz]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Older adults — impaired cough, dysphagia, and aspiration risk are interrelated and clinically important. Impaired cough can occur in older adults and is strongly associated with pathologic states, such as neurologic diseases, and in these conditions there is a strong association of impaired cough mechanics and cough sensitivity with dysphagia. The presence of both dysphagia and impaired coughing has been linked to an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, and co-occurrence of these impairments is thought to lead to increased vocal cord penetration and aspiration of pathogen-laden saliva and food materials while impaired coughing reduces the ability of the subject to expectorate this pathogen-laden material, thereby increasing exposure of the airway mucosa to colonization. A proposed model indicates that age-related cognitive decline is associated with the emergence of dysphagia and later dystussia; further declines lead to loss of ambulation and/or impaired consciousness, silent aspiration, and community-acquired pneumonia, with silent aspiration defined as the lack of coughing in response to intrusion of material into the larynx and/or lower airways, and repeated microaspiration leading to chronic airway inflammation, even in the absence of colonization by pathogens, which could enhance the risk of further dysphagia.

### Chlamydophila pneumoniae [^111Kcfnz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Chlamydophila pneumoniae is estimated to cause about 10% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases and 5% of bronchitis cases, although most patients with C pneumoniae infection are asymptomatic, and the course of respiratory illness is relatively mild. The incubation period of C pneumoniae infection is around 21 days, and such symptoms as cough and malaise show a gradual onset, yet may persist for several weeks or months despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis by nasopharyngeal specimen culture, serum antibody titers, or molecular techniques is usually delayed with respect to the onset of symptoms, antibiotic treatment, or disease resolution and there is no accurate, standardized, commercial US Food and Drug Administration-cleared diagnostic method available. Erythromycin, tetracycline, and doxycycline are used as first-line therapy, although some investigators report no clinical or survival benefits from treating CAP caused by atypical pathogens. Meanwhile, adequate prospective studies have met with ethical and logistic barriers. Despite these limitations, North American guidelines recommend the antimicrobial treatment of patients with acute C pneumoniae respiratory infection.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112srRRm]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective — clinical cough is a reflex event beginning with activation of vagal afferent sensory nerves located in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites that project the signal centrally, where it undergoes modulation, resulting in the generation of the appropriate efferent motor response. This concept of distinct afferent sites has provided the rationale for use of the anatomic diagnostic protocol to evaluate and manage patients with cough, and this approach has become embedded in clinical practice, leading to a broad recognition that asthma, GERD, and upper airways disease are, at least in adult patients, the most common causes of chronic cough; adequate treatment of one or more of these causes is effective in the majority, although a significant minority remains troubled with unexplained, refractory chronic cough despite extensive investigation and trials of therapy. The most sensitive regions of the airways for mechanically eliciting cough are the larynx and the tracheal and bronchial bifurcations.

### Psittacosis infection and tracheobronchomalacia in a patient undergoing thyroidectomy [^115s5MMm]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 34-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy with central and lateral lymphadenectomy. Immediate airway compromise required re-intubation immediately after surgery. Marked tracheal and bronchial collapse of greater than 50% of the lumen indicated tracheobronchomalacia. Subsequent attempts at extubation failed over the next week. The patient soon developed evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection. Empirical treatment with penicillins was unsuccessful. A clinical suspicion of chlamydia infection prompted initiation of macrolide treatment followed by resolution of both the patient's respiratory infection and tracheobronchomalacia. Serology returned positive for Chlamydophila psittaci infection. It later transpired that the patient had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection just prior to surgery. This case demonstrates an interesting and unreported cause of tracheobronchomalacia as well as providing a good lesson on the importance of preoperative screening for infection.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114xJEoo]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — pointers to presence of specific cough in children lists abnormalities with example etiologies and notes the list is not exhaustive. Daily wet/productive cough is linked to protracted bacterial bronchitis, suppurative lung disease, recurrent aspiration, atypical infections, TB, and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Wheeze — monophonic indicates large airway obstruction (for example, from foreign body aspiration, malacia and/or stenosis, vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal tumors) and TB should be considered in selected settings (for example, high prevalence or HIV). Wheeze — polyphonic is associated with asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiolitis. Hoarse voice/stridor suggests laryngeal cleft/problems and airway abnormalities. Recurrent pneumonia is associated with immunodeficiency, atypical infections, suppurative lung disease, congenital lung abnormalities, and trachea-esophageal H-type fistulas. Hypoxia/cyanosis is linked to any airway or parenchyma disease and cardiac disease. Neurodevelopmental abnormality is associated with aspiration lung disease. Chest radiograph (other than peribronchial changes) or spirometry abnormality can reflect any cardiopulmonary disease. Growth failure indicates any serious systemic including pulmonary illness such as cystic fibrosis.

### Use of real-time PCR for Chlamydia psittaci detection in human specimens during an outbreak of psittacosis-Georgia and Virginia, 2018 [^113S5Lnt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This was the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years, the first U.S. outbreak in which human specimens were tested exclusively by real-time PCR, and the first that included testing of stool specimens. In this outbreak investigation, as in other published studies with real-time PCR–based detection of C. psittaci, C. psittaci was more frequently detected in lower respiratory specimens than in upper respiratory specimens, as reflected by detection in sputum but not nasopharyngeal swabs in five confirmed cases. Ct values in C. psittaci –positive specimens also suggest that bacterial load is higher in lower respiratory specimens than in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. This analysis suggests that lower respiratory specimens are more useful than upper respiratory specimens for C. psittaci detection by real-time PCR. Although submission of lower respiratory specimens is encouraged, upper respiratory specimens are easier to collect, which could explain why nasopharyngeal swab was the most frequently submitted specimen type. Given that 60% of patients with probable cases submitted only nasopharyngeal swab specimens, C. psittaci might have been underdetected in this outbreak; it is possible that more confirmed cases would have been detected if lower respiratory specimens were collected for testing in these patients.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CL7RD]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough physiology and pathophysiology — conclusions emphasize that chronic cough is more often encountered as a clinical problem in older women and that physicians should recognize comorbidities when managing troublesome cough. Conditions associated with impairment in the nervous or muscular systems may contribute to deficits in cough mechanics, the consequences of which in some cases can be predicted by assessing cough peak flow (CPF) and other measures, and airway secretion properties may impact cough efficiency. Respiratory maneuvers and devices can augment CPF, whereas medications can modify the physical properties of secretions, and these approaches may be of particular help with cough efficiency in some patients, especially with neuromuscular weakness or with difficulty in sputum expectoration. Cough testing approaches vary greatly in the type of cough measured and reported measures, with most studies reporting CPF only, and in populations with ineffective cough there is reduced cough output as opposed to the hypersensitive, increased output seen with chronic cough. The focus with these populations is evaluating the ability to effectively clear the airways, there is critical need to develop therapeutic techniques with this goal, yet despite many airway clearance devices and medications there are few well-controlled randomized controlled trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness, and the design and delivery of such trials remain a priority. A heightened cough reflex sensitivity in women is widely reported but poorly understood, and creating normative values and a standardized methodology for CPF and other clinically meaningful cough metrics represent important knowledge gaps.

Patient comorbidities

Hypertension emerged as the most prevalent underlying condition (105/566, 18.5%), followed by diabetes (63/566, 11.1%), chronic cardiovascular disease (41/566, 7.2%), and other diseases. We observed that immunocompromised individuals, including those with diabetes, constituted only 14.3% (81/566) of the total population, with no significant difference between the two groups (49/292, 16.8% versus 32/274, 11.7%; P = 0.083). Among patients with severe C. psittaci pneumonia, the prevalence of comorbidities was greater (155/292, 53.1% versus 98/274, 35.8%; P < 0.001). Specifically, the severe group exhibited a greater prevalence of diabetes (44/292, 15.1% versus 21/274, 7.7%; P = 0.006) and chronic cardiovascular disease (32/292, 10.9% versus 9/274, 3.3%; P < 0.001) (Table 1).

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114rmk98]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Cough guideline methodology — PICO refinement, literature searches, and quality assessments are outlined as follows: Each topic-specific committee drafted key clinical questions that a frontline clinician and consumer representative agreed would provide important guidance, and with a methodologist these key questions were formulated to examine descriptors of the relevant PICO; these PICO elements then informed the search strategies, including synonyms, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for study screening and acceptance. Searches were conducted in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network Library, with additional searches for published systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library; when no reasonable quality systematic reviews were identified, primary literature searches were conducted in at least two databases using the predefined search strategies, and Medline and the Cochrane Library were always searched for relevant English language studies and, depending on the topic, other databases (eg, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Identified English-language articles were initially screened by title and abstract, using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by full-text screening of qualified articles; search strategies are available upon request at science@chestnet.org, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferentially assessed using DART, which was adopted in 2011 for CHEST guidelines and consensus statements; quality was assessed for individual studies and the body of relevant evidence, with randomized controlled trials primarily indicating benefits and observational studies helpful in identifying harms and examined when RCTs were not available.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114tMyKL]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians) guideline overview — cough pathophysiology, measurement, and clinical significance are summarized as follows: Cough arises following activation of a complex sensorimotor reflex arc, and its distinctive sound is generated by the explosive release of trapped and pressurized intrathoracic air from the sudden opening of the vocal folds. Because cough is an easily described and recognizable physical act, patient surveys on the prevalence of cough have credibility, enabling development of cough-specific, patient-reported outcome tools by which physicians can assess the impact of cough on patients. Because the sound resulting from coughing has a typical acoustic waveform profile, software detection algorithms for automatic monitoring have been developed for cough counting. While cough in healthy individuals is physiologically important, it typically is of little clinical importance because it is normally a very uncommon event, yet it assumes importance as a defense mechanism when it helps clear excessive secretions and foreign material from the airways and as a factor in the spread of infection. The report states that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem and that the panel's purpose is to synthesize current knowledge to aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and to identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^117S4U1P]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Reported symptoms of the probable psittacosis case-patients in this outbreak were similar to those described elsewhere. One other community-wide outbreak of psittacosis has been reported to be potentially associated with contact with free-ranging birds. In 1995, 16 cases of psittacosis among residents of a rural town in a forested area in southern Australia were linked to trimming and mowing lawns and time spent in a yard, which are thought to be proxies for exposure to infectious particles shed by free-ranging birds with chlamydiosis. While this 1995 study did not find a significant relationship between illness and handling of dead birds (OR 2.4, 95% CI 0.25–21.05), the OR supports the positive association between illness and handling live or dead free-ranging birds (adjusted OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.5–22, p < 0.001) found in our study. The 1995 study reported the risk of illness associated with lawn mowing was not linked to use of a grass catcher, though whether the authors differentiated between those who never used a catcher and those who sometimes used a catcher is not clear. Previous studies have linked lawn mowing with psittacosis and with primary pneumonic tularemia. In our case-control study questionnaire, we differentiated between persons who mowed only with, with and without, and only without a grass catcher. We found this probable psittacosis outbreak to be linked to lawn mowing only without the use of a grass catcher. We could find no evidence in the literature suggesting that the use of a grass catcher provides lawn mower operators some protection from inhaling infectious particles, though grass catcher marketing materials of lawn mower manufacturers in Australia suggest that grass catchers reduce the generation of dust and hence the amount of dust expelled into the operator's breathing zone.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^116VtkKd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Psittacosis is a human disease caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. The bacterium also causes avian chlamydiosis, a disease reported in psittacine birds such as parrots, cockatiels, and parakeets. Chlamydophila psittaci can be present in large numbers in the droppings of sick birds and in dust contaminated by infected droppings. The organism can remain infectious in the environment for months. Human infection usually occurs when a person inhales the bacterium shed in feces and secretions of infected birds. Sheep, goats, cattle, and reptiles can also be infected, but these animals have rarely been linked to human cases.

Psittacosis has an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks, and manifestations of disease can range from asymptomatic infection to systemic illness with severe pneumonia. Untreated psittacosis has a reported case-fatality rate of 15% to 20%. Psittacosis is most commonly reported among people in close contact with domestic birds, such as bird owners, poultry farmers, veterinarians, and workers within pet shops and poultry-processing plants Sporadic cases and an outbreak in Australia linked to contact with free-ranging (wild) birds have been reported; however, little information is available on the role of wild birds in the transmission of Chlamydophila psittaci to humans

### Clinical features and prognostic predictors of C. psittaci pneumonia: a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis [^112Zmhng]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Published case reports/series of proven/probable C. psittaci pneumonia, as mainly defined by the Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia guidelines published by the American Society of Infections and the American Thoracic Society(ATS/IDSA 2007 criteria) and Psittacosis/Ornithosis (Chlamydophila psittaci) 2010 Case Definition published by CDC in patients ≥ 18 years old were reviewed. Additionally, C. psittaci infection diagnosed through the mNGS test will also be included (Supplementary material, Appendix S2). For inclusion, the published cases must have had documentation of (i) demographics and history of contact with live poultry, (ii) comorbidities, (iii) method(s) of diagnosis, (iv) treatment process and strategy, and (v) patient outcomes. Conference abstracts, editorials, poorly described cases, review articles, or case series without primary data or where the analysis was pooled without the description of individual patient data were excluded. In addition to the severe pneumonia screening criteria outlined in ATS/IDSA 2007 guidelines, patients meeting any of the following criteria were categorized into the severe group: admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), necessitating cardiovascular support (vasopressors, inotropes, with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and death.

Data collection process and data items

Using standardized data extraction forms (Supplementary materials), data were extracted independently by the two author groups (as above) and compared. Discrepancies were discussed with X. Tong and DG. Wang as adjudicators. Initial data were collected after admission. Data extracted included the authors, the country of origin of the published cases, year of publication, patient demographics, underlying conditions/comorbidities, method of diagnosis, severity, clinical manifestations, imaging, and clinical outcomes.

Summary measures and statistical analysis

Data analysis was performed utilizing STATA 16.0 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Patient characteristics, manifestations, and methods of diagnosis were descriptively summarized. Categorical variables underwent assessment via the chi-squared test or Fischer's exact test, while continuous variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Predictive factors for severe patients were discerned through multivariate logistic regression. P < 0.05 was statistically significant.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^111hiccH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We defined a suspected case of disease as community-acquired pneumonia (as primary clinical diagnosis), confirmed by chest radiograph, in a resident of the Blue Mountains 15 to 75 years of age who was admitted to a local hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2002. Patients with a history of congestive cardiac failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded. Active surveillance for suspected cases of psittacosis was initiated in the first week of June 2002. Surveillance was performed by review of patient medical records and daily contact with the emergency department and infection control staff at the Blue Mountains and other local hospitals. We attempted to contact all suspected case-patients by telephone to invite them to participate in the study and provide serum samples for laboratory testing.

We defined a probable case of disease as psittacosis in a suspected case-patient in which any of the following were demonstrated: seroconversion, a 4-fold rise in immunoglobulin (Ig) G titer by microimmunofluorescence (MIF), or a single or static high convalescent-phase MIF IgG titer to Chlamydophila psittaci.

We conducted a case-control study to identify independent risk factors for psittacosis in the outbreak. Only probable case-patients were included in the analysis. To identify controls, random digit dialing was used to select household telephone numbers from the randomly sorted Blue Mountains telephone directory. All randomly selected households were telephoned, and 1 person 15–75 years of age from every household was randomly selected and invited to participate in the study.

Interviews were conducted by trained interviewers in a computer-assisted telephone interview service, from June 18 to July 2, 2002, 7 days per week, during the day and the evening. Up to 10 attempts were made to contact each case-patient and control. Case-patients and controls completed a detailed telephone questionnaire, which included questions on demographics; contact with poultry, pet, and free-ranging birds; types of bird contact; other animal contact; and gardening and other outdoor activities undertaken in the 3 weeks before onset of illness (for case-patients) or the 3-week period April 1–21, 2002 (for controls).

### Chlamydophila psittaci transmission from pet birds to humans [^112cFWmE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The remaining 26 breeding facilities with healthy birds had negative results for PCR and culture. Early infections may have been missed because fecal excretion occurs after primary bacterial replication in the respiratory tract and septicemia. Moreover, fecal shedding occurs intermittently and healthy carrier birds might not excrete bacteria for > 1 year. Pharyngeal swabs would have been a better choice for testing but psittacine owners are reluctant to catch their birds because stress induces respiratory disease. Reactivation of a C. psittaci carrier status might be involved in this phenomenon.

Nested PCR/EIA detected C. psittaci DNA in 6 (13%) of 46 pet bird owners. All 6 owners obtained birds at different breeding facilities, and all facilities had birds positive for C. psittaci by PCR and culture. The infected persons were 22, 24, 31, 38, 49, and 56 years of age (mean age of the pet bird owners was 46 years). Viable organisms were present in 4 of 6 persons with positive PCR results, and all 4 (who were nonsmokers and had no allergies) had mild respiratory illness (shortness of breath or rhinitis and coughing). Although the study was conducted in the summer, 8 (20%) of the remaining 40 C. psittaci –negative owners reported rhinitis or coughing during the past 2 weeks, some (7.5%) with a sore throat. Thus, statistical conclusions on the relationship of viable chlamydophila in humans and respiratory disease were not obtained.

### Habit cough, tic cough, and psychogenic cough in adult and pediatric populations: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115ka5LG]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the literature on habit, tic, and psychogenic cough, and to make evidence-based recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment.

Design/Methodology

For data on adults, an Ovid MEDLINE literature review (through February 2005) was performed for all studies published in the English language, including case series and case reports, since 1966 using the medical subject heading terms "habit cough", "psychogenic cough", "tic disorder", "vocal tic", "Tourette's syndrome", "honking cough", and "barking cough". For pediatric data, articles were identified dating from 1966 from searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, the list of references in relevant publications, and the authors' collection of references with the last search performed in February 2005. The search terms used were "children" and "vocal tics" or "habit cough", or "psychogenic cough" or "chronic cough".

Results/Conclusions

The methodologies used and rigor of the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions reported in the literature are inconsistent. The putative clinical characteristics of habit cough and psychogenic cough, for the most part, have not been prospectively or systematically studied. Therefore, on the basis of expert opinion, the diagnoses of habit cough or psychogenic cough can be made only after an extensive evaluation is performed that includes ruling out tic disorders and uncommon causes of chronic cough, and when cough improves with behavior modification or psychiatric therapy. In adult patients with chronic cough that remains persistently troublesome despite an extensive and thorough evidence-based evaluation, and after behavior modification and/or psychiatric therapy have failed, unexplained cough should be diagnosed rather than habit cough or psychogenic cough. In children, the depth of investigations to rule out uncommon causes must be individualized as some investigations and/or treatment may increase morbidity. In adult and pediatric patients with chronic cough that is associated with troublesome psychological manifestations, psychological counseling or psychiatric intervention should be encouraged after other causes have been ruled out.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115UyjiY]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough — Part 2: demographic and clinical considerations updates the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline by noting that cough characteristics vary between patients and can impact clinical diagnosis and care, and by reviewing literature using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019. The report describes the demographics of typical patients with cough in the clinical setting, including how cough characteristics change across age, and summarizes the effect of common clinical conditions impacting cough mechanics and the physical properties of mucus on airway clearance. It is the second of a two-part update that complements part one on basic phenomenology by providing an extended clinical picture of cough along with factors that alter cough mechanics and efficiency in patients, stating that a greater understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cough will improve clinical management.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

### Cough: a worldwide problem [^112ux3cj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.

### How It spreads… [^1164gtjS]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What it is Psittacosis is a disease caused by bacteria called Chlamydia psittaci. These bacteria infect birds more often than people. Up until recently, some scientists called the bacteria Chlamydophila psittaci. Symptoms Most people begin developing signs and symptoms within 5 to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria. Less commonly, people report symptoms starting after 14 days. In general, psittacosis is a mild respiratory illness. Symptoms of psittacosis are similar to the symptoms of other respiratory illnesses. The most common symptoms include:

- Dry cough
- Fever and chills
- Headache
- Muscle aches. Risk factors Some people are more likely to get infected with C. psittaci than others. Age People of all ages can get psittacosis, but it is more commonly reported among adults.

Bird exposure People who have contact with pet birds and poultry, including those who work in bird-related occupations, are at increased risk:

- Aviary and pet shop employees
- Bird owners
- Poultry farmers and processing plant workers
- Veterinarians. How it spreads The most common way someone gets infected is by breathing in dust containing dried bird secretions or droppings. Both sick birds and infected birds without signs of illness shed the bacteria in their droppings and respiratory secretions. When the droppings and secretions dry, small dust particles that include the bacteria can get into the air. Less commonly, birds infect people through bites and beak-to-mouth contact. In general, people don't spread the bacteria that cause psittacosis to other people. However, this may be possible in rare cases. Testing and diagnosis Psittacosis is difficult to diagnose.

Healthcare providers may not suspect psittacosis because its symptoms are like the symptoms for many other respiratory diseases. If a healthcare provider suspects psittacosis, they may collect one of the following samples to send for testing:

- Blood
- Sputum
- Swab from the nose or throat However, tests to see if someone has psittacosis aren't always easily available. Treatment and recovery People diagnosed with psittacosis usually take antibiotics to treat the infection. Most people improve quickly if they start antibiotics soon after they get sick.

### Clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough in adults and Children: a diagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PvBEr]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly infective cause of cough that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping, and posttussive vomiting, but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough.

Methods

We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction, and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic, RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. The bivariate meta-analysis method was used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Of 1,969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity (93.2% [CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [CI, 8.1–37.9]), whereas posttussive vomiting and whooping have low sensitivity (32.5% [CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [CI, 8.0–45.2]) and high specificity (77.7% [CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [CI, 69.4–86.9]). Posttussive vomiting in children is moderately sensitive (60.0% [CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adult patients, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children, posttussive vomiting is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test.

### Cluster analysis in 975 patients with current cough identifies a phenotype with several cough triggers, many background disorders, and low quality of life [^113FAQLf]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Two clusters could be identified in a large population with current cough. The authors propose that these clusters represent two cough phenotypes. Cluster A represents phenotype A, containing the majority of patients. This cough phenotype has a tendency to heal by itself. On the contrary, patients of the cluster B are at high risk of cough prolongation. They are especially characterized by several reported cough triggers, many cough background disorders, and severe impairment in the C-QOL. We propose an acronym TBQ (Triggers, Background disorders, Quality of life impairment) for this phenotype. The characteristics of the phenotype TBQ fit into the cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Duration of the cough episode was not among the most important variables to separate the phenotypes. Given the poor prognosis of the cough phenotype TBQ, it urges a prompt and comprehensive clinical evaluation regardless of the duration of the cough episode. In future, this kind of cluster analysis should be performed in other, different types of cough populations to further evaluate the validity of the presently identified phenotypes.

### Zoonotic Chlamydophila psittaci infections from a clinical perspective [^1129nc2g]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Human psittacosis is a zoonotic infectious disease which is caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci. Transmission of the disease usually originates from close contact with infected birds, most frequently in the context of the poultry industry, and from contact with Psittaciformes (cockatoos, parrots, parakeets and lories). Due to a low awareness of the disease and a variable clinical presentation psittacosis is often not recognised as such by general practitioners. This review therefore gives an overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments for psittacosis in humans. The current case definition for epidemiological surveillance, as issued by the CDC, is discussed, as well as the possible emergence of Cp. psittaci antibiotic-resistant strains. There is an urgent need for information and for awareness campaigns directed at professional health care workers and the general public. In addition, a broader use of new diagnostic methods in medical laboratories and the development of prophylactics are called for.

TABLE 2
Real-time PCR test results, by specimen type, for all specimens tested in association with a psittacosis outbreak — Georgia and Virginia, 2018

Abbreviations: C. psittaci = Chlamydia psittaci; Ct = cycle threshold; PCR = polymerase chain reaction.

* Data are from two nasopharyngeal swabs with Ct values 31 and 33.

† Data are only from stool specimens because there were no C. psittaci –positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

Among 13 patients with confirmed psittacosis, nine submitted multiple specimen types, allowing comparison of C. psittaci detection by specimen type (Table 3). Six patients had nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens tested; all sputa tested positive for C. psittaci, but only one nasopharyngeal swab tested positive. Three patients submitted stool and sputum specimens; all three sputum specimens tested positive for C. psittaci, and two stool specimens tested positive. C. psittaci was also detected in stool specimens of two patients with C. psittaci –negative nasopharyngeal swabs, including patient A, who had positive sputum and stool specimens but a negative nasopharyngeal swab. Ct values were lower in sputum than in stool specimens or nasopharyngeal swabs from the same patient (patients A, F, and G).

TABLE 3
Clinical findings, hospitalization status, and real-time PCR test results in patients * with confirmed psittacosis cases (n = 13) associated with a psittacosis outbreak — Georgia and Virginia, 2018

Abbreviations: BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage; Ct = cycle threshold; ICU = intensive care unit; Neg = negative; NP = nasopharyngeal; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; Pos = positive.

* All specimens associated with an individual patient were collected on the same day unless otherwise noted. For example, sputum, NP swab, and stool specimens for patient A were all collected on the same day, but specimens from patient A were not necessarily collected on the same day as were those from patient B.

† "Pos" indicates Chlamydia psittaci was detected. "Neg" indicates C. psittaci was not detected. Ct values represent the real-time PCR amplification cycle at which CPSIT_RS01985 amplification was first detected. Ct values are displayed only for C. psittaci– positive specimens, because CPSIT_RS01985 was not detected in C. psittaci –negative specimens.

### Causes of chronic productive cough: an approach to management [^117T5Gvx]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A chronic 'productive' or 'wet' cough is a common presenting complaint for patients attending the adult respiratory clinic. Most reviews and guidelines suggest that the causes of a productive cough are the same as those of a non-productive cough and as such the same diagnostic pathway should be followed. We suggest a different diagnostic approach for patients with a productive cough, focussing on the conditions that are the most likely causes of this problem. This review is intended to briefly summarise the epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of a number of conditions which are often associated with chronic productive cough to aid decision making when encountering a patient with this often distressing symptom. The conditions discussed include bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis and immunodeficiency. We also propose an adult version of the paediatric diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in patients with idiopathic chronic productive cough who appear to respond well to low dose macrolide therapy.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114RWfLw]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough patient follow-up and outcome assessment states that hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptoms be sought for and, if present, immediately addressed and evaluated (ie, red flags); that a validated cough severity tool be routinely used to assess the outcome of therapy; and that patients be routinely followed in a clinic or by telephone within 4–6 weeks after the initial evaluation, with a follow-up appointment should be arranged if cough persists.

### Somatic cough syndrome (previously referred to as psychogenic cough) and tic cough (previously referred to as habit cough) in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115K3wGs]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Somatic cough syndrome and tic cough — diagnostic value of cough characteristics and psychiatric comorbidity is limited: these cough-associated presentations are "not sensitive screening findings for psychogenic or habit cough" and "these three findings lack specificity for the diagnoses of psychogenic or habit cough". Barking cough is "reported in other childhood conditions, such as tracheomalacia" and "a barking or honking cough can be due to a variety of diseases, such as bronchiectasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postnasal drip syndrome (ie, now referred to as upper airway cough syndrome)". For sleep-related features, cough from other diseases "is unlikely to occur once patients fall asleep", likely due to "the observed suppression effect that sleep has on cough". Regarding psychiatric symptoms, adult literature states "the mere presence of depression and/or anxiety in patients with chronic unexplained cough not be used to make a definitive diagnosis of a psychologic condition", and overall "based upon low-quality studies, little evidence exists to support how to define or diagnose psychogenic or habit cough".

### Cluster analysis in 975 patients with current cough identifies a phenotype with several cough triggers, many background disorders, and low quality of life [^111nYm7s]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The third strongest variable was the level of impairment in the C-QOL. Low C-QOL can be regarded as the most important consequence of cough and it is associated with repeated doctor's consultations due to cough. Therefore, it is not surprising that cluster B was also associated with frequent doctor's consultations and many sick leave days due to cough.

Since this is, to the authors' best knowledge, the first cluster analysis among patients with cough, we cannot compare our results with previous studies. Current international cough management guidelines classify patients according to the duration of the cough episode. The classification by duration is based on the knowledge that certain cough background disorders are more common in prolonged cough than in shorter cough subtypes. However, the classification of cough by the duration of the episode is not based on phenotype analyses and thus, is more or less arbitrary. Furthermore, cough often has a relapsing and remitting course making the duration-based classification difficult to sustain. In the present study, the duration of the cough episode was one of the many variables that could separate the clusters. However, it was far from the most important variables and there was a large overlap between the clusters. This finding speaks against episode duration -based classification of cough.

There are several shortcomings in the present study. First, the participation rate to the first survey was relatively low. It is possible that patients with severe cough have been more willing to participate than patients with mild cough. This may have led to an over-representation of phenotype B. In reality, the proportion of patients with cluster B-type cough is probably smaller than the 37.6% reported here. However, this bias probably did not affect the clustering analysis and its main results. Of note, the responders and non-responders did not differ with respect to age and sex distribution. Second, the population was rather homogenous, consisting of working-age, employed subjects. Old people and unemployed subjects are missing. Also, the number of current smokers was small. Third, the baseline questionnaire did not include the information about how many cough episodes they had had previously, i.e. the tendency of the cough to recur. Fourth, the analysis is based on questionnaire data only. Spirometry, laboratory, and x-ray data is missing. However, cough is an extremely common disorder and primary care physicians usually do not have this information, neither, when deciding the management of cough.

### Microbiological aspects of bacterial lower respiratory tract illness in children: atypical pathogens [^1158cmzG]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

'Atypical' lower respiratory tract pathogens often cause a distinct identifiable syndrome in adults, but in children the clinical presentation of atypical, typical and viral pneumonia is less well differentiated. Specific microbiological investigations are usually required, but an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses is necessary to make interpretation possible. This review examines clinical presentation, microbiology and current evidence surrounding diagnostic techniques for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella species. Applying an understanding of the investigations to the diagnosis of pneumonia in children may lead to more appropriate patient management by ensuring that they clarify rather than further obscure the diagnosis.

### Probable psittacosis outbreak linked to wild birds [^113oD1cR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Analysis of hospital admission and discharge data indicated that, compared with the NSW state average and with the lower Blue Mountains average, increased rates of pneumonia have been seen among residents of the upper Blue Mountains during the autumn of previous years (unpub. data). This excess in pneumonia may be due to seasonal outbreaks of psittacosis in the area. Free-ranging birds are plentiful in the Blue Mountains, and chlamydiosis has been clinically diagnosed among juvenile birds, in particular crimson rosellas, in the area during the autumn of previous years (M. Cannon, pers. comm.).

Reasons for the positive association between probable psittacosis and residence in the upper Blue Mountains are speculative. The residents of the upper Blue Mountains are slightly older than that of the lower Blue Mountains (unpub. data) and may be more likely to remain at home and be active in their yards than the slightly younger residents of the lower Blue Mountains, who tend to commute to work in Sydney every day. This age difference may result in greater proximity between residents and free-ranging birds in the upper Blue Mountains.

Although the reason probable psittacosis case-patients were more likely to be 50–64 years of age is unclear, younger people may have had milder infection or been less likely to seek medical attention and require hospitalization. That persons with congestive cardiac failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded from the study may explain why persons 65–75 years of age appeared less at risk of disease.

Why a history of asthma seemed protective against psittacosis is uncertain. Persons with a history of asthma may be less likely to perform outdoor yard activities that generate dust and pollen. That persons who reported contact with caged or domestic birds appeared protected against disease may be related to previous exposure to Chlamydophila psittaci. While the development of protective immunity following infection with Chlamydophila psittaci has not been proven, laboratory-confirmed cases of reinfection have seldom been reported. That disease was less likely to develop in persons who reported potting or weeding may be because these activities generate little contaminated dust compared with activities such as lawn mowing.
