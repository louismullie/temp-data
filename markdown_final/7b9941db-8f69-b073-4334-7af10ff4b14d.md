## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best defines market socialism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of market socialism and how it differs from pure capitalism and pure command socialism. Then, I should verify which answer choices align with those distinctions. Next, I will examine each option against the key features: social ownership, market mechanisms, and the role of the state. Finally, I will select the best fit and briefly justify why the alternatives are incorrect, drawing on the provided sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm the concept. Market socialism is a hybrid system that combines socialist ownership or control of the means of production with market mechanisms for allocation and exchange; it is not pure capitalism (private ownership with minimal state) nor pure command socialism (state ownership with central planning), and it typically involves some degree of state coordination or redistribution alongside market pricing and wages, rather than laissez-faire markets or total state control.

> Now, I will examine Option A. It states market socialism incorporates features of capitalistic markets and socialist planning, with state ownership of land and capital, state-determined investment, market-set wages, and some income redistribution. Wait, let me verify the balance here: this matches the hybrid nature of market socialism, where social ownership coexists with market signals for labor and goods, and the state steers investment and redistribution rather than dictating all prices or outputs, which is consistent with reformist approaches that work within market economies while redirecting them toward equity and public goods.

> Next, Option B claims the market dictates all aspects, including social welfare and public goods. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: that sounds like neoliberal capitalism, not market socialism, because market socialism retains state responsibility for public goods and redistribution rather than leaving them entirely to market forces, so this option overstates market dominance and understates state roles.

> Option C describes complete state ownership with central planning. I should double-check: that is classic command socialism, not market socialism, which deliberately introduces market mechanisms and decentralized pricing rather than abolishing them, so this conflates market socialism with centrally planned socialism.

> Option D is a purely capitalistic system. Let me reconsider: this would imply private ownership and minimal state intervention, which contradicts the socialist ownership and state coordination elements inherent to market socialism, so this is incorrect.

> Option E posits private ownership with state redistribution of profits. Hmm, wait a minute, that still centers private ownership rather than social ownership, so it leans toward a regulated capitalist model rather than market socialism, which requires social or public ownership of key means of production even if markets allocate resources.

> Option F suggests equal distribution of personal wealth regardless of contribution. I need to ensure I'm precise: market socialism does not necessarily mandate perfectly equal outcomes; it emphasizes equitable distribution and social ownership, but wages and rewards can still reflect market dynamics and individual contribution, so this overstates egalitarianism and mischaracterizes the incentive structure.

> Option G asserts government solely determines production, investment, and prices without market influence. Hold on, I should verify: that is again command socialism, not market socialism, which relies on markets for price formation and allocation even as the state shapes investment and redistribution, so this is a mismatch.

> Option H claims no state intervention. Let me think about this: that would be anarcho-capitalism or extreme laissez-faire, which is incompatible with the state coordination and redistribution features of market socialism, so this is incorrect.

> Option I says only the private sector determines investment. I should confirm: this is a capitalist feature, not market socialism, which includes state influence over investment priorities even when markets guide execution, so this is not accurate.

> Option J proposes worker-managed firms in free markets with no government intervention. Wait, let me verify: while worker cooperatives are compatible with market socialism, the "no government intervention" clause is too strong; market socialism typically involves state policies for redistribution, public goods, and macro coordination, so this option overcorrects toward anarchic markets and omits the state role.

> Putting this together, Option A remains the best fit because it captures the hybrid essence: socialist ownership and planning elements alongside capitalist market mechanisms, with the state steering investment and redistribution while allowing market-set wages and prices, which aligns with contemporary reformist frameworks that transform markets toward equity and sustainability rather than replacing them outright.

Market socialism is best described as **Option A**: an economic system that blends capitalist markets with socialist planning, featuring state ownership of land and capital, state-directed investment, market-determined wages, and income redistribution. It is **not pure capitalism** (D), **pure command socialism** (C), or a system with no state intervention (H). Options B, E, F, G, I, and J are incorrect because they either overstate market control, misstate ownership, or deny necessary state roles. Market socialism aims to harness market efficiency while ensuring equitable outcomes through public ownership and redistribution.

## Key characteristics of market socialism

Market socialism has the following **core features**:

- **State ownership of land and capital**: The state owns major productive assets, ensuring public control over the economy's commanding heights [^notfound].

- **State-determined investment**: The government directs investment to prioritize social goals, such as full employment, equitable development, and public goods provision [^notfound].

- **Market-set wages**: Wages are determined by market forces, allowing labor markets to allocate workers efficiently while maintaining worker incentives [^notfound].

- **Income redistribution**: The state redistributes income through taxation and social welfare programs to reduce inequality and ensure social justice [^1165iRYR].

## Comparison with other economic systems

| **Attribute** | **Market socialism (option a)** | **Pure capitalism (option d)** | **Command socialism (option c)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ownership of land and capital | State ownership | Private ownership | State ownership |
| Investment decisions | State-directed | Market-driven | Centrally planned |
| Wage determination | Market-set | Market-set | State-set |
| Income redistribution | Yes | Minimal | Minimal |
| Market mechanisms | Present | Dominant | Absent |

---

## Analysis of alternative options

- **Option B**: Incorrect. Market socialism does not allow the market to dictate all aspects, including social welfare and public goods; the state retains significant control and responsibility [^notfound].

- **Option C**: Incorrect. This describes command socialism, not market socialism, which incorporates market mechanisms and does not rely solely on central planning [^notfound].

- **Option D**: Incorrect. Market socialism is not purely capitalistic; it integrates socialist planning and state ownership with market mechanisms [^notfound].

- **Option E**: Incorrect. Private individuals do not own resources in market socialism; the state or collective owns major productive assets [^notfound].

- **Option F**: Incorrect. Market socialism does not guarantee equal distribution of wealth regardless of contribution; it allows market-determined wages and uses redistribution to address inequality [^notfound].

- **Option G**: Incorrect. This describes command socialism, where the government solely determines production, investment, and prices without market influence [^notfound].

- **Option H**: Incorrect. Market socialism involves significant state intervention, particularly in ownership, investment, and redistribution [^notfound].

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The private sector does not solely determine investment; the state plays a crucial role in directing investment toward social goals [^notfound].

- **Option J**: Incorrect. While worker-managed firms may exist, market socialism typically involves state intervention and ownership, not the absence of government involvement [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Market socialism is best represented by **Option A**, which accurately captures its hybrid nature: combining socialist planning and state ownership with capitalist market mechanisms. This approach seeks to balance economic efficiency with social equity, leveraging markets for allocation while ensuring public control and redistribution to meet collective needs [^notfound].

Understanding the language of economic policy

Broadly, all approaches to studying the economy describe the economy in terms of consumption and production practices and how they are organised to provision individuals and populations. This involves various institutions, such as households, firms, markets and states. Political economy, a term closely associated with heterodox economics, refers to approaches that understand the economy as a complex evolving system in which individuals, populations and organisations attempt to address their needs, wants and aims. The economic system is shaped by historical and geographical contingencies, power relations, culture, values, legal systems and ecology. The economy is, therefore, seen as embedded in society and partially reflective of prevailing social values.

Heterodox economic approaches include various distinctive schools of thought, including, Austrianism, Marxism and Radical Political Economics, Feminist Economics, Post Keynesianism (which includes Modern Money Theory), Social and Institutional economics. Economics is usually synonymous with mainstream and earlier neoclassical economics, studies the economy as an equilibrating system in which agents (individuals, households, firms, organisations and governments) aim to maximise their welfare. Markets and prices are the focus of analysis. The economy is viewed as separate or separable from the rest of society.

### Integrating social and medical care: could it worsen health and increase inequity? [^1159kmWg]. Annals of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

As a result of a large and compelling body of evidence documenting the impacts of social determinants, such as income and education, on health outcomes, health care systems are beginning to incorporate social and economic risk data into health care delivery decisions. But there is a risk that some of these efforts could worsen health and widen health inequities. We highlight 3 examples- including recent policy changes in Medicaid, social needs, informed risk prediction models, and advances in precision medicine-where the inclusion of social risk information threatens to reduce care quality or health care access for some groups of patients. A new dialog is needed about both the opportunities and potential consequences of bringing information about patients' social circumstances into a market-based health care system.

### Capitalogenic disease: social determinants in focus [^113HKxgY]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Scholarship on the social determinants of health and disease has become firmly established over the past several decades. This school of thought has created space for academics and health professionals to consider the structural factors that may produce ill health, generate health inequalities and prevent access to healthcare or other goods and services necessary for human welfare. Research on social determinants has been developed through attention to 'structural violence", commercial determinants'and the 'causes of the causes' of disease.

These are useful analytical developments. But terms such as structures, commerce and so on are generic descriptors, and it may be useful to further specify the particular political and economic systems that are at stake. This includes paying attention to capitalism and dynamics of capital accumulation. Given that capitalism prevails in nearly every country, and organises the world economy, it seems necessary to develop analytical frameworks that can help us understand and assess its implications for health outcomes, which have been described in existing literature.

It is important to clarify what we mean by capitalism. People often assume that capitalism is a generic system of businesses, markets and trade. But these existed for thousands of years before capitalism and have taken many forms. Capitalism, which arose during the long 16th century, is defined by several key features.(1) It is undemocratic, in that production (and the distribution of surplus) is determined predominantly by a wealthy elite, who control the majority of investable assets and elect the directors of firms. (2) Within this system, the purpose of production is not primarily to meet human needs or to improve social outcomes, but rather to maximise growth, profits and accumulation. (3) Given the focus on profits and accumulation, there is a constant pressure to 'cheapen' inputs — specifically labour and nature — by compressing wages and resource prices while externalising social and ecological damages.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^116rCxSL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Achieving food system transformation requires a deep understanding of the market mechanisms that underpin both the social benefits and the externalities of modern development. We examine how market dynamics affect the production and consumption of healthy and equitable diets in North America. Using causal loop diagramming, we show how three market feedback processes (industry capabilities, consumer category considerations, and systems and institutions) both constrain and enable food system transformation. Through behavioral-dynamic computational modeling, we demonstrate the ineffectiveness of isolated social or commercial interventions to achieve equitable access to nutritious foods across populations of varying socioeconomic statuses. Rather, self-sustaining transformations at scale require convergent innovations that bridge individual and collective action across typically siloed sectors, to achieve alignment between commercial, social, and environmental goals and activities. We discuss how this simulation-based analytical framework can inform policy for food system transformation, whether at the local, national, or global level.

Discussion

Food systems are pivotal in addressing global health, well-being, and sustainability issues but still face daunting challenges in ensuring equitable healthy food at scale. Our analysis highlights that large-scale food systems changes require market transformationsthat involve complex system-level feedback dynamics and are hindered by strong lock-in effects. Central to achieving sustainable, equitable, and scaled-up production and consumption of healthy diets is therefore ambitious individual and collective action involving diverse stakeholders — producers, consumers, social entrepreneurs, not-for-profits, governments, and intermediaries. Collaborative cross-sector approaches that consider these market transformation dynamics are key to creating aligned incentives for ongoing innovation, reducing acceptance barriers, increasing consideration to overcome the inertial forces from a lack of initial market infrastructure, and pushing socially responsible activities from niche to mainstream. Domains beyond agrifood with well-established knowledge about creating, mapping, and maintaining cooperative networks, such as supply chain collaboration, can offer important lessons, for example about critical success factors such as trust building, technology and information sharing, and actor willingness to change –. Yet the fundamental market transformations that are needed, and the number and diversity of actors involved, also indicate considerably greater and different challenges.

Our analysis highlights the unsustainable divide between human, environmental, and economic health due to entrenched roles, responsibilities, and institutional arrangements within market structures. With an increasingly populated world, excessive resource depletion, and inequalities, more and more goods provided through the market must be seen as semi-public, rather than just private. Yet, whereas societal value creation, aiming to correct problems of poverty, education, environment, or health, tend to be at odds with organizational value capture of capitalist systems, other pathways are possible, as our analysis illustrates. Such pathways require ambitious synergy-oriented policies — e.g. expanding grants, new coopetition models, and research funding — supporting purposive and directional research and innovation in the healthy food sector and considering all dimensions of the market infrastructure and its dynamic nature.

### Glossary: economics and health [^113qnQkZ]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Money is one of many forms of capital. In early economic work, capital often referred to the assets not embodied in people (eg, money, land or the 'means of production' (most frequently tools or machinery)) that was used in combination with labour (the work done by people) to create goods and services. Wealth refers to the ownership and possession of valuable capital, and different economic traditions are more or less concerned with its distribution. However, other forms of capital have more recently elaborated, most prominently by Bourdieu, to include cultural, social, human (usually conceptualised as education, skills and knowledge) and symbolic capitals that can be embodied and used in social differentiation and to maintain class privileges.

Most countries in the world have a capitalist economy. Although there are varieties of capitalism, they all share the characteristics of having: a legal system supporting individual property rights; widespread private ownership, markets and employment contracts; an extensive proportion of production organised separately from domestic activities and a developed financial system. Hall and Soskice argued that there are three types (or varieties) of market economies: liberal market economies, co-ordinated market economies and a hybrid. They are characterised in terms of industrial/employee relations, education and training, corporate governance and interfirm relations, and are associated with differences in socioeconomic outcomes such as income inequality.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^112UmwX9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Creating social and commercial Systems & Institutions supporting industry and consumer affinity for healthy product categories and equitable diet requires efforts ranging from those leading to favorable regulation, to formation of distribution and logistics networks, to the shaping norms of exchange across organizations and communities. In the food context, these efforts enable speedy transport of food from farms, processing plants, and manufacturing centers to different retail outlets (e.g. supermarkets, convenience stores, or farmers markets) and food service locations (e.g. restaurants, cafeterias, catered operations), or allow outlets to be equipped in accessible places (e.g. with refrigeration, storage, and preparation facilities), particularly critical for fresh perishable products. Activities also involve the development of supply-chain-level collaboration structures, understandings about logistics, and cultures falling outside the direct scope of industry capabilities. Such efforts may, for example, reduce supply chain risks or support circularity. Food supply not only interlinks multiple sectors (e.g. agriculture, fertilizing, processing, transport and distribution, retailing) but is also deeply embedded within a larger system of structures (e.g. the economic system, government regulation, incentive programs, tariff schedules, technology standards) that incentivizes and constrains firm and market behavior. Without such elements in place in support of product categories, consumers have difficulty accessing these products, have less exposure to them and, thus, would be less likely to consider them. Systems and institutions development may require efforts by social entrepreneurs, FP and NFP market actors, and other intermediaries, as well as by government players (Fig. 1, "Systems & Institutions Development" flowing into the stock). These efforts increase as actors respond to and anticipate growth in supply and demand of the categories they support, completing the final positive feedback loop (Fig. 1, loop R3, "Systems & Institutions").

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^1164UEku]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This paper analyzes the problem of how market mechanisms affect the dynamics of equitable healthy food system transformations. Using an inductive multi-stage process (see section "Methods"), we demonstrate a comprehensive approach for analyzing and guiding market transformation pathways. We illustrate this through a stylized analysis of transformation from low-nutrition to high-nutrition food (LN-HN food) for low- and high-socioeconomic status (low-high-SES — representing here respectively the bottom and top 50%) populations, within the North American context. (For a list of definitions of all acronyms used, see Supplementary Information (SI) S.1.) Using existing knowledge of market formation mechanisms, we first identified three key market-level feedback processes — industry capabilities, consumer category consideration, and systems & institutions — that shape the development of food market infrastructure. Next, converting this characterization into a computational model, we examined the system's responses to diverse interventions through simulation. Engaging these individually and jointly through simulation, we compare their impacts against a no-intervention baseline in terms of scale, equity, and health-oriented induced innovation. We show that strong and lasting equitable impacts leverage the synergistic effects across the market infrastructure dimensions, implying the importance of comprehensive, coordinated individual and collective action among for-profit (FP) producers, social entrepreneurs, not-for-profits (NFPs), governments, consumers, and other intermediaries. Identifying market mechanisms that both resist and enable food system change, this work advances knowledge on science and society efforts toward SDGs by explaining persistent challenges rooted in market dynamics and providing a framework to point to transformation obstacles and identify high-impact interventions for sustainable change at scale.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^113LKaCU]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

System-justifying ideologies — definition and implications — are described as the general motivation to defend, bolster, and justify the status quo, current institutions, and social arrangements, encompassing constructs such as Protestant work ethic, meritocratic ideology, fair market ideology, and belief in a just world; these share an assumption that hard work, merit, and subsequent achievement is based on an individual's ability and that this ability is rewarded by a system that is fair and just, and evidence indicates that subtle priming messages of meritocracy can contribute to individual cognitive justification of social inequalities.

### Financialisation: a 21st century commercial determinant of health equity [^114iKHFb]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

In 21st century capitalism, financial markets reign supreme. The elevation of investing, trading, and speculating as a way of making profit has shifted economic power towards institutional investors and enhanced the power of financial capital. Financialisation has introduced uncertainty in the commitment to public provision of goods and services. The behaviours of corporations focus more on profit for shareholders and senior executives to the detriment of wages, worker protections, livelihoods, and impact on prices and the environment. The practices of this financial system pose major challenges to public health and planetary health equity through the influence on social inequality, climate change, and health outcomes. The aim of this Viewpoint is to expand the understanding of the commercial determinants of health to explicitly include the financial system and present key plausible pathways via which the financialisation of advanced economies influences public health and planetary health equity. The global public health community must pay close attention to these key commercial determinants of health. It is now crucial to reduce the power of financial actors and hold financial actors accountable. Civil society groups can highlight their practices, articulate alternative visions, and hold financial actors and governments to account. Interdisciplinary research must provide a diagnosis of the financial and public health issues, and, importantly, illuminate effective pathways forward. Financial and commercial worlds must return to stakeholder primacy rather than that of the shareholder.

### Capitalogenic disease: social determinants in focus [^112rkvmo]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Capitalism has always been organised as a world system, where accumulation in the 'core' (i.e. the affluent economies of Europe, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Japan) is predicated on a large net appropriation of labour, energy and materials from the 'periphery' (developing economies in the global South), either directly as during the period of European colonialism, or indirectly through the patterns of unequal exchange in international trade and global commodity chains that predominate today. This arrangement drains the global South of resources that are necessary to meet human needs, and perpetuates patterns of poverty and underdevelopment.

We need an analytical framework that can assess the extent to which these arrangements may have adverse effects on health outcomes. We propose that the term capitalogenic disease may help towards this end. The historical geographer Jason Moore has used the term capitalogenic to specify that the ecological crisis we presently face is not simply a natural phenomenon or a problem caused by generic human activity, but is being produced by the capitalist system of production and by processes of capital accumulation. The term has become indispensable to analysts across disciplines for identifying the causal dynamics of ecological crisis and envisioning pathways out of it. We propose that this term can and should be applied where appropriate to disease and health inequalities as well.

Here, we illustrate the concept of capitalogenic disease with eight concrete examples:

### Delivering child health interventions through the private sector in low and middle income countries: challenges, opportunities, and potential next steps [^117NwaVC]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Next steps

Evidence is growing in favour of private sector approaches that are relevant for improving child health outcomes. These include contracting out (for example, of primary healthcare in the post-conflict states of Cambodia and Rwanda), use of vouchers to increase access to delivery services for poor populations, accreditation of health facilities and laboratories, social marketing and social franchising. However, for maximum benefit, these strategies must be used in various combinations, as single interventions are generally less effectivein both public and private health sectors. In addition, it is important to support wide scale use of social health insurance to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditure, through pooling contributions from individual community members, governments, and external funding that is available for health in low and middle income countries.

Given the high healthcare seeking in the private sector, governments (which are responsible for the health of their citizens) cannot afford to leave the sector unregulated. The market influences on the private sector should guide the conceptualisation, design and implementation of interventions. There are multiple institutions that influence health markets, many people involved, and an interplay of formal and informal rules within these market systems. For this reason, interventions that focus too narrowly on specific aspects — for example, training — are likely to failbecause they do not adequately anticipate and account for complex interactions among the existing stakeholders. Additionally, health markets exist within the broader health system, which require a "systems thinking" approach to working with private providers. Systems thinking considers the effects of a particular intervention on other health system building blocks and enables holistic understanding of interactions with the rest of the health system. This increases understanding of both the intended and unintended consequences of private sector interventions.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^111dYMnA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Onset and development of Consumer Consideration of alternative product categories — irrespective of attractiveness of available options — requires consumer awareness, familiarity, and knowledge. Through social exposure and other influence processes, consumers form collective expectations of common product dimensions. As new products become increasingly similar and recognizable, categorical prototypes emerge (refs.; Fig. 1, "Category Exposure" flowing the "Category Consideration" stock). Social influence from peers occurs through direct observation of others' behavior, information exchange, or transmission of social norms, and is amplified through media attentionand habituation and sensitization. Thus, social influence about a product category grows with its consumption (Fig. 1, link from "Category Consumption" to "Social Pressure and Habituation"), closing a positive feedback loop (Fig. 1, loop R2a, "Consideration (Social Influence)"). Producers (and others) strengthen this process by educating consumers and shaping their understanding of or attention to new categories. As firms dedicate available resources to product advertisement, on-product label claims, product promotions, and product size assortments, depending on their assessment of returns, compared to those for R&D investments and for other product categories, this forms another positive feedback loop (Fig. 1, loop R2b, "Consideration (Marketing)").

### A global social contract to ensure access to essential medicines and health technologies [^112mvepF]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

The social contract and its application to medicines and health technologies access

The concept of the social contract originates from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's 1762 On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right ("The Social Contract"). It describes the implicit agreement between the individual and state, wherein the state attains the authority to govern through the collective consent of its citizens. This mutually beneficial 'contract' enables and requires the state to protect the rights of citizens in return for its monopoly on power and control. The protection and promotion of public goods, such as public security and public morals, are essential elements in the pact. Public security and other civil rights (eg, the right to life or the right to obtain and impart information) are distinct yet highly interdependent on social rights (eg, right to health). Ensuring public security is also dependent on public access to 'goods' in the collective interest, such as safe and effective medicines, clean air and fresh water. For the social contract to operate effectively, state commitment and action to better society through the creation, protection and promotion of these public goods is needed. Moreover, the stewardship (and in some cases, production) of these public goods demands social cooperation. Essential medicines and health technologies are central to attaining health security and the maintenance of functioning health systems. Under social contract theory, the state is thus the primary actor responsible for shaping the political, economic and regulatory conditions required to ensure that medicines and health technologies are available, safe, effective, of assured quality and affordable for all.

### Capitalogenic disease: social determinants in focus [^113Pbk9p]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Naming the disease

This list is intended to be illustrative; it is neither exhaustive nor systematic. Crucially, we are not arguing that all social or structural determinants of disease are capitalogenic, or that improvements in health outcomes have not been achieved within capitalism, or that capitalism is the only cause of the diseases we have listed above. Other political-economic arrangements may also produce ill health and health inequalities. But in cases where diseases are perpetuated or exacerbated by specifically capitalist relations of production (profit/growth orientation, restrictive patent regimens, artificial scarcities of essential goods, labour-related abuses and insecurities, hierarchies of exploitation, etc) we must be able to identify and understand these dynamics and respond appropriately.

We have focused here on contemporary health crises, but the concept of capitalogenic disease also helps us understand long-term trends in health indicators. Researchers have shown that the expansion of the capitalist world-system from the 16th century was associated with a prolonged deterioration in health indicators (welfare ratios, stature and mortality), on a scale unprecedented in human history, including through atrocities such as the European enclosures, the genocide of Indigenous Americans, the mass enslavement of Africans, policy-induced famines in India and so on. In some cases, social indicators have still not recovered. Where progress has been achieved, it began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the rise of democratic, socialist and other progressive political movements that established public provisioning systems, redistributed incomes, regulated capital and organised production more around human needs and social outcomes. Understanding these dynamics of capital and resistance allows us to situate contemporary health challenges in broader historical perspective.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^115DQaiK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Socioeconomic status differentiates population segments by their access to financial, educational, social, and health resources. We used the neighborhood socioeconomic and household characteristics as proxy for individual socioeconomic and household characteristics. Representative FSAs for low-SES and high-SES populations were selected based on the following neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics: (i) Population density; (ii) Median family income; (iii) Proportion of the population aged 15 years and over that was employed; and (iv) Proportion of the population aged 15 years and over with post-secondary education. Splitting the population halfway into 50% low-SES and 50% high-SES, we matched consumption and access characteristics and demographics by postal code. We used this to characterize the healthy food consumption in low-SES and high-SES populations and availability of healthy food stores. Results were triangulated with literature findings, which we further used as sources for attribute-level characterizations (Table 1 and Table S7).

We then used the literature and empirical-oriented workshops (Stage 1) to identify types of interventions and articulate and develop different intervention scenarios (overview in Fig. 2, details in Table S8, columns 1 and 2).

Stage 5: Development of a computational model and simulation-based analysis

Given the dynamic complexity of the problem, our upfront goal had been to develop scenario analysis using computational modeling. Simulation is a powerful method for sharply specifying and extending existing conceptualizations and theoryand is particularly powerful for producing insights when the problem is longitudinal, nonlinear, or processual, as is the case here. We set out to operationalize a model as close as possible to the conceptual model (Fig. 1). Doing this required a focus on modeling how actors evaluate and adjust their actions behaviorally and endogenously over time, in response to changes they observe within the system (e.g. producers adjusting their investments in response to changes in accessibility or in consumer consideration of product categories, through increase in relative perceived marginal returns; or, consumers altering their consumption choices following changes in social exposure to products). To develop these notions, we used compartment (differential equation) modeling using the standard system dynamics practice and principles, used for such dynamic behavioral modeling. For this we also built on a more aggregate and narrower-scoped model involving consumer-producer interactions.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^1165iRYR]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Meta approaches for sustainable prosperity.

This table only provides a rough overview, focusing on the most obvious differences of the respective approaches. There are overlaps between them and considerable heterogeneity within each approach, e.g. eco-feminism and post-development overlap with eco-socialism and eco-anarchism.

The reformist group consists of heterogeneous approaches such as a-growth, precautionary/pragmatic post-growth, prosperityand managingwithout growth as well as steady-state economics. These approaches have in common that they aim to achieve the required socio-ecological transformation through and within today's dominant institutions, such as centralised democratic states and market economies. From this position it often follows that current, socially vital institutions, such as the welfare state, labour markets, healthcare, pensions and others, need to be reformed to become independent from GDP growth. Generally, bottom-up movements are seen as crucial, leading to value and cultural changes towards sufficiency. Eventually, however, significant policy changes are proposed to achieve the necessary downshifting of consumption and production, and/or the reduction of environmental impacts through decoupling. These include, among others, stringent eco-taxes or cap-and trade systems, directed investments in green industries and public institutions, wealth redistribution through taxation and a maximum income, a guaranteed basic income and/or reduced working hours. Although these policies already seem radical when compared to today's policies, the proponents of reformist approaches are convinced that the transformation can be achieved in current capitalist economies and democratic states.

### Commercial determinants of health: future directions [^116aPNk6]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

This paper is about the future role of the commercial sector in global health and health equity. The discussion is not about the overthrow of capitalism nor a full-throated embrace of corporate partnerships. No single solution can eradicate the harms from the commercial determinants of health-the business models, practices, and products of market actors that damage health equity and human and planetary health and wellbeing. But evidence shows that progressive economic models, international frameworks, government regulation, compliance mechanisms for commercial entities, regenerative business types and models that incorporate health, social, and environmental goals, and strategic civil society mobilisation together offer possibilities of systemic, transformative change, reduce those harms arising from commercial forces, and foster human and planetary wellbeing. In our view, the most basic public health question is not whether the world has the resources or will to take such actions, but whether humanity can survive if society fails to make this effort.

### Health system governance: a triangle of rules [^1119pRWb]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Notably, the answer may be found among three sets of contextual factors (see the matrix in figure 4): socioeconomic context (eg, inability to afford formal providers means that people would rather 'shop around' at informal providers); geographical context (eg, the large size of the village means there are many informal providers, and for many in the community, it is difficult to physically access a single formal provider); and institutional (ie, rules-in-use) context of the local healthcare market (eg, the constitutional rules to regulate informal providers are neither monitored nor enforced). Interacting with one another, all these contextual factors combine to promote or inhibit the emergence of trust, power and accountability relations, which also strongly influence the choice of provider. When constitutional rules are not monitored and enforced, the rules of the marketplace may dominate at the operational level. Or collective rules may dominate. The collective rules may be a 'professional code' among informal providers such that, even if constitutional rules are neither monitored nor enforced, they may continue to refer to formal providers as appropriate.

Figure 4
The 'matrix' showing 'rules-in-use' as one of three categories of context: rules-in-use are influenced by the three categories of rules, all of which together influence (are, in turn, influenced by) the three categories of context. The three categories of rules influence the three categories of context through how they influence the provision of public goods, the definition and protection of rights, and the facilitation of social exchange.

A strategy to address the problem may be to change existing rules that govern informal providers so that they refer their clients to formal providers or work alongside formal providers. Another may be to spread information about the costs of inappropriate care in the community so people can change their care-seeking behaviours. But these strategies require changing local norms (ie, informal rules), which can take decades to change. A third strategy is to change constitutional rules to enable the supply of more formal providers or reduce out-of-pocket costs of care at formal providers. But these require political engagement strong enough to alter those constitutional rules. A fourth strategy is to improve the monitoring and enforcement of the constitutional rules that limit informal providers. But entrenched local norms and informal practices are hard to regulate at a distance. With a large distance between the constitutional and operational levels, it may be more effective to strengthen collective actors to make new rules or change existing ones in ways they can monitor and enforce.

### Building systemic resilience, productivity and well-being: a mental wealth perspective [^111DtVFa]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

In sum, there is a reciprocal dependence between brain capital and productivity. Social and economic productivity are needed to maintain brain capital, and investments in brain capital are needed to boost productivity. However, when productivity demands (be they economic or social) exceed brain capital capacity, resilience can be undermined. This thesis gives rise to several questions: (1) where does the threshold lie beyond which demands in productivity growth exceed brain capital capacity, thereby reducing resilience, (2) can the threshold be raised by technological advances, reductions in inequality, and investments in brain and social capital infrastructures and (3) what is the optimal balance between economic and social productivity at a macro level needed to support multisystem resilience? These are important questions for further empirical exploration. The balance required in any context will depend on prevailing circumstances, especially legacies concerning the role of the state, business and civil society in the organisation of production and consumption and the arrangements determining the distribution of income and wealth. In thinking through ways to achieve balance and enhance resilience, table 1 (and online supplemental file 1) highlights four domains requiring attention: investing in brain capital, guarding against mass unemployment and productivity loss, fostering social productivity and establishing a legal framework for resilience. Systems modelling and simulation is additionally proposed to explore the viability of the recommended strategies in different political and economic contexts and how best to allocate resources across them to build resilience and foster the Mental Wealth of nations. A paradigm shift in our understanding of resilience is imperative. By embracing a transdisciplinary Mental Wealth perspective and nurturing a nation's most critical asset (brain capital), we deepen and enrich our capacity to evolve and adapt in a more stable, cohesive, prosperous and sustainable way.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^1126avk2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Stage 2: Providing theoretical underpinnings: market infrastructure for market transformations

As our understanding of market mechanisms developed, we turned to literature on market transformation. At this time, theory on market formation started to develop around market infrastructure and associated collective action problems. Applying this concept to the food market formation problem helped us condense and conceptualize the many market mechanisms at an appropriate level, understand what constructs to use, and identify gaps in our representation of mechanisms. The literature emphasized major challenges to market infrastructure development that we deemed relevant to the food context, including: resource deployment, investment, and commitment from diverse market- and non-market actors involved; absence of established market infrastructure creating uncertainty, leading to hesitancy among actors to take action; biased decision-making within organizations and industries favoring long-established patterns and conventional practices and technologies versus commitments to new market infrastructure; and limited sense of control for individual firms because multiple distinct inchoate elements needed. Based on the empirical exploration (Stage 1), we also recognized the central role of collective action — how modifying or building new market infrastructure requires collective action across distinct market actors — for-profit and not-for-profit firms, firms, governments, and civil society — each controlling different elements. Importantly, as had become also clear from our workshops, these actors are either unfamiliar with one another or tend to focus on competitive interactions. Finally, in early forming markets, government action may be important. However, governments may be hesitant to provide impositions when there is no existing market. And, if they do act, their actions may not align with those from industry. Together these points illustrated that one can gain analytical traction from deploying the market formation theory as a basis for our food-systems transformation framework.

### Systems science methods in public health: what can they contribute to our understanding of and response to the cost-of-living crisis? [^114di1Hw]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

System dynamics models

SDMs enable modelling systems at an aggregate level, making them an ideal choice for testing policies or wider implications of shocks.SDMs are built on the idea that stock changes over time can be modelled by their interdependence on in- and out-flows, feedback loops and lag effects. One key feature of SDMs is the strong stakeholder engagement nature which lends itself to early collaboration. Like SSM, the model building process itself can aid shared understanding of the complex problem and involve relevant intersectoral stakeholders in the policy process. Like microsimulations and ABMs, SDMs allow ex ante forecasting of a systems' behaviour and estimation of alternative outcomes given different potential public health policy choices. The simulated long time horizons are a key strength of SDMs, particularly since public health deals with upstream causes of the causes, where it is extremely difficult to directly capture lagged health effects causally with empirical research.

Since the cost-of-living crisis is ultimately a whole-economy problem, many of the population health solutions might necessarily be explored at this aggregate level. For example, rising energy prices have been identified as a key driver of recent acute escalations in prices, particularly in Europe and the UK. Energy prices are a key input for basically every other sector, including food production and transport, and supply of any other product or service that affects population health. Unfortunately, energy also represents an input where demand, a major focus of Central Banks, is difficult to reduce without causing many knock-on consequences across sectors, for instance, unemployment with decreased production and sales. Modelling the aggregate interactions and these key drivers of current inflation might help to explore ultimately more effective public health solutions in the long term. For example, it could allow modelling of windfall taxes and other direct energy policy options, and comparison of the relative benefits of up/downstream policy efforts on stock of population health as a key outcome of interest. SDMs could also model the impacts on specific subsystems, or impacts on other social determinants of health, such as the housing market, the provision of third sector services, or health and social care capacity.

Overall, this paper has covered four of the main systems science methods and discussed how they can be applied to the cost-of-living crisis. Table 4 provides an overview of strengths and limitations of the selected methods. Importantly, these methods can be combined in hybrid-models to attempt to further dampen these limitations.

### Precarity, inequality, and the problem of agency in the study of the life course [^112PJ1Xp]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

"… pathway of social empowerment in which voluntary associations in civil society directly organize various aspects of economic activity… that is distinct from capitalist market production, state organized production, and household production. Its hallmark is production organized by collectivities directly to satisfy human needs not subject to the discipline of profit maximization nor state-technocratic rationality" (:140–141).

In the United States, the Villages and the Village-to-Village Network provides flourishing examples of the exercise of collective agency by older people who have worked to establish a social economy:

Villages are a… consumer-directed model that brings together older adults in a neighborhood or community who have a mutual interest in aging in place. These membership organizations are often developed and governed by older adults themselves. Though there can be great variation in structure and service provision… the primary goal… Is to promote members' independence and prevent undesired relocations (:3).

From its start in Beacon Hill in 2002, the Village movement proliferated rapidly, growing to a national network of more than 150 villages by 2016.

A range of examples of the application of collective agency in establishing social economies can readily be identified, and may apply to specific segments of the life course. One community with a long tradition of political engagement in Barcelona, where a sense of collective efficacy can be seen in the strong participatory involvement of local communities in the process of schooling. Describing the situation in Barcelona,:143) reports that "… some public schools have been turned into what are called 'learning communities' in which… governance… is substantially shifted to parents, teachers and members of the community, and the function of the school shifts from narrowly teaching children to providing a broader range of learning activities for the community as a whole".

### Uncertainties about the quality of medical products globally: lessons from multidisciplinary research [^1167EfYx]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Overall, the nine papers provide a well-balanced representation of different countries and regions, and a good balance between disciplines, research methods, and global reflection vs national analyses. The variety of contexts suggests that no region can consider itself exempted from the risk of SF medical products, even if the determinants vary in nature and weight, for example, by country income, regulatory maturity level, social protection and health insurance, and the overall ecosystem of education, health financing, market and taxation system. Analyses and corrective interventions related to purely technical aspects, such as implementing Good Manufacturing Practice and enhancing the performance of regulatory oversight, will not suffice to counteract SF medical products, because technical, social and ethical determinants are strictly interconnected. This complexity confirms the need for a systemic policy approach to SF medical products, informed and guided by interdisciplinary research in this field.

It is encouraging that most contributions to this Special Issue came from the disciplines of pharmacy and social science. The interest of social scientists is particularly welcome. Sociology, anthropology and health economy are needed to uncover, disentangle and document the non-pharmaceutical factors that favour or hinder SF. The rapidly growing body of social science studies in this field is outstanding, especially given the limited funding opportunities. We hope that the work published here will inspire more collaborative groups. Although ethical considerations are embedded in many of the papers in the Special Issue, there were no contributions from ethicists. This is not surprising for an emerging field in global health. However, it is important that future collaborative work include ethicists, who provide an important lens to build a value-based approachand to guide researchers in this field. Efforts could also be made to stimulate research in apparently underrepresented areas, such as Central Asia and the Americas. More awareness and support is needed from all the stakeholders in global health, including but not limited to governments, donors and academia, to facilitate dialogue between researchers who, in different disciplinary communities, contribute to the achievement of universal access to quality-assured, adequately used medical products.

### A social engineering model for poverty alleviation [^115g4aYf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Poverty, the quintessential denominator of a developing nation, has been traditionally defined against an arbitrary poverty line; individuals (or countries) below this line are deemed poor and those above it, not so! This has two pitfalls. First, absolute reliance on a single poverty line, based on basic food consumption, and not on total consumption distribution, is only a partial poverty index at best. Second, a single expense descriptor is an exogenous quantity that does not evolve from income-expenditure statistics. Using extensive income-expenditure statistics from India, here we show how a self-consistent endogenous poverty line can be derived from an agent-based stochastic model of market exchange, combining all expenditure modes (basic food, other food and non-food), whose parameters are probabilistically estimated using advanced Machine Learning tools. Our mathematical study establishes a consumption based poverty measure that combines labor, commodity, and asset market outcomes, delivering an excellent tool for economic policy formulation.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^114aYWH8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Super-affluent consumers and growth imperatives

Growth imperatives are active at multiple levels, making the pursuit of economic growth (net investment, i.e. investment above depreciation) a necessity for different actors and leading to social and economic instability in the absence of it. Following a Marxian perspective as put forward by Pirgmaier and Steinberger, growth imperatives can be attributed to capitalism as the currently dominant socio-economic system in affluent countries, although this is debated by other scholars. To structure this topic, we will discuss different affected actors separately, namely corporations, states and individuals, following Richters and Siemoneit. Most importantly, we address the role of the super-affluent consumers within a society, which overlap with powerful fractions of the capitalist class. From a Marxian perspective, this social class is structurally defined by its position in the capitalist production process, as financially tied with the function of capital. In capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, implying that they must compete in labour markets to sell their labour power to capitalists in order to earn a living.

Even though some small- and medium-sized businesses manage to refrain from pursuing growth, e.g. due to a low competition intensity in niche markets, or lack of financial debt imperatives, this cannot be said for most firms. In capitalism, firms need to compete in the market, leading to a necessity to reinvest profits into more efficient production processes to minimise costs (e.g. through replacing human labour power with machines and positive returns to scale), innovation of new products and/or advertising to convince consumers to buy more. As a result, the average energy intensity of labour is now twice as high as in 1950. As long as a firm has a competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to sell as much as possible. Financial markets are crucial to enable this constant expansion by providing (interest-bearing) capital and channelling it where it is most profitable. If a firm fails to stay competitive, it either goes bankrupt or is taken over by a more successful business. Under normal economic conditions, this capitalist competition is expected to lead to aggregate growth dynamics.

### The synergy of the whole: building a global system for clinical trials to accelerate medicines development [^116PGSrj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The pharmaceutical industry, once highly respected, productive, and profitable, is in the throes of major change driven by many forces, including economics, science, regulation, and ethics. A variety of initiatives and partnerships have been launched to improve efficiency and productivity but without significant effect because they have failed to consider the process as a system.

Methods

Addressing the challenges facing this complex endeavor requires more than modifications of individual processes; it requires a fully integrated application of systems thinking and an understanding of the desired goals and complex interactions among essential components and stakeholders of the whole. A multistakeholder collaborative effort, led by the Alliance for Clinical Research Excellence and Safety (ACRES), a global nonprofit organization operating in the public interest, is now under way to build a shared global system for clinical research. Its systems approach focuses on the interconnection of stakeholders at critical points of interaction within 4 operational domains: site development and support, quality management, information technology, and safety. The ACRES initiatives, Site Accreditation and Standards, Product Safety Culture, Global Ethical Review and Regulatory Innovation, and Quality Assurance and Safety, focus on building and implementing systems solutions. Underpinning these initiatives is an open, shared, integrated technology (site and optics and quality informatics initiative).

Findings

We describe the rationale, challenges, progress, and successes of this effort to date and lessons learned. The complexity and fragmentation of the intensely proprietary ecosystem of drug development, challenging regulatory climate, and magnitude of the endeavor itself pose significant challenges, but the economic, social, and scientific rewards will more than justify the effort.

Implications

An effective alliance model requires a willingness of multiple stakeholders to work together to build a shared system within a noncompetitive space that will have major benefits for all, including better access to medicines, better health, and more productive lives.

### A cultural and global perspective of United States health care economics [^111gJVha]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Because the relative costs are so high, the healthcare system of the United States is the subject of much scrutiny, analysis, and criticism. Other countries have the same or better outcomes with significantly lower costs. Health care systems, however, are a reflection of the societies they serve. They develop over time within a framework of the collective national experience. The American approach is unique in that it has relied much more on market-based solutions to healthcare issues. This article provides an overview of the healthcare systems in Canada, Germany, and Japan. It then discusses the significant factors that drive the higher costs of the American system, starting with a review of the general aspects of Markets. American hospitals, the pharmaceutical industry, malpractice costs, private insurance, Medicare and physicians are then placed in historical context to give the reader a broader perspective of United States Healthcare Economics.

### Optimizing technology development and adoption in medical imaging using the principles of innovation diffusion, part I: theoretical, historical, and contemporary considerations [^113PF86J]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

The pioneering work performed in the social sciences on diffusion of innovation can be applied to medical imaging and shed valuable insights as to how innovation is analyzed and adopted within the population of end-users. Successful innovation must take into account unique stakeholder differences, changes in communication and social interactions, and shifting priorities in market economics. The dramatic changes currently underway in current medical imaging practice provides unique innovation opportunities to those individuals and companies which can utilize this knowledge and effect change in objective and reproducible means. Successful innovation should rely upon data-driven objective analysis, which can scientifically validate the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the innovation, when compared with the idea or technology it supercedes.

### Globalisation and health: the need for a global vision [^11152wus]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

The reduction of health inequities is an ethical imperative, according to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH). Drawing on detailed multidisciplinary evidence assembled by the Globalization Knowledge Network that supported the CSDH, we define globalisation in mainly economic terms. We consider and reject the presumption that globalisation will yield health benefits as a result of its contribution to rapid economic growth and associated reductions in poverty. Expanding on this point, we describe four disequalising dynamics by which contemporary globalisation causes divergence: the global reorganisation of production and emergence of a global labour-market; the increasing importance of binding trade agreements and processes to resolve disputes; the rapidly increasing mobility of financial capital; and the persistence of debt crises in developing countries. Generic policies designed to reduce health inequities are described with reference to the three Rs of redistribution, regulation, and rights. We conclude with an examination of the interconnected intellectual and institutional challenges to reduction of health inequities that are created by contemporary globalisation.

### Disease-economy trade-offs under alternative epidemic control strategies [^113QzzYC]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The social planner problem coordinates the economic activities of the individuals described above. Instead of economic activities being individually chosen to maximize personal utility, the social planner coordinates consumption and labor choices of each type to maximize the utility of the population over the planning horizon, subject to the disease dynamics (3) and budget constraints (9):

Additional structure (e.g. age compartments, job types, geography) can be incorporated here either by creating additional utility functions or by introducing type-specific constraints. For example, with age compartments, each age type would have a set of utility functions like equations (5)–(8). These would then be calibrated to reflect age-specific economic activity levels, structural parameters, and observed risk-averting behaviors.

Both the decentralized problem and the social planner problem are solved for optimal daily consumption and labor supply choices in response to daily state variable updates, and we normalize the total initial population size to 1 for computational convenience. The assumption that individuals use a daily test that reveals their health state is maintained across both the decentralized and the social planner problems. We abstract from the cost of the testing system. Since the cost is common to both problems, it does not affect the relative comparison between the two.

Utility calibration

Details of the utility function calibration and data sources are found in the SI. Briefly, economic activity levels and structural economic parameters are calibrated to match observed pre-epidemic variables for the US economy. We calibrate risk aversion and the utility cost of death to match the value of a statistical life. This approach ensures both the levels of economic choice variables and their responses to changes in the probability of infection are consistent with observed behaviors in other settings.

### Market forces influence helping behaviour in cooperatively breeding paper wasps [^112yX4Vc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Biological market theory is potentially useful for understanding helping behaviour in animal societies. It predicts that competition for trading partners will affect the value of commodities exchanged. It has gained empirical support in cooperative breeders, where subordinates help dominant breeders in exchange for group membership, but so far without considering one crucial aspect: outside options. We find support for a biological market in paper wasps, Polistes dominula. We first show that females have a choice of cooperative partners. Second, by manipulating entire subpopulations in the field, we increase the supply of outside options for subordinates, freeing up suitable nesting spots and providing additional nesting partners. We predicted that by intensifying competition for help, our manipulation would force dominants to accept a lower price for group membership. As expected, subordinates reduce their foraging effort following our treatments. We conclude that to accurately predict the amount of help provided, social units cannot be viewed in isolation: the surrounding market must also be considered.

### Systems science methods in public health: what can they contribute to our understanding of and response to the cost-of-living crisis? [^114oLrhv]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Cost-of-living crisis as a complex systems problem

The cost-of-living crisis presents a timely case study of a systems problem with public health implications. As a major feature, it affects disposable incomes, a key determinant of health, while limiting the opportunities for efficient population-level interventions.

The systems aspect of the cost-of-living crisis becomes apparent when trying to understand its causes. The International Monetary Fund attributes today's high rates of inflation to multiple causes. With prices in the economy reflecting the interaction of supply and demand, the current imbalance leading to inflation is mostly thought to be due to constrained supply of goods and services. These patterns have emerged as part of the interaction and unintended lags of previous policy responses to COVID-19, and its effects have clearly been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the resulting disruptions in food production and energy supplies. A country's ability to adapt and respond to these shocks will also be mediated by their previous broader policy choices, for example, from where they source their energy and goods. In the UK, for example, real income was already falling behind comparator countries, falling 0.2% between 2007 and 2021 compared with an OECD average increase of 0.8%.

It is often assumed that increasing wages in line with inflation is a straightforward solution. However, disconnecting inflation from wages is often a conscious policy decision to avoid a wage-price spiral, a vicious cycle which might fuel inflation further via increased. Central Banks try to temper inflation by increasing interest rates, mostly acting to dampen demand rather than the underlying supply problem directly, risking recession and increased unemployment. A simple point of intervention is therefore not straightforward when the wider system is considered, calling for a systems science approach when considering impacts of interventions on population health (see figure 1).

### Knowing the goal: an inclusive economy that can address the public health challenges of our time [^117NkMfQ]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Attributes of an inclusive economy

Some definitions included wealth creation or growth as a defining attribute of an inclusive economy, while many other definitions did not make reference to growth. As discussed (see box 1), there is disagreement about the role of economic growth in an inclusive economic approach and is not addressed further here.

Box 1
A matter of growth

A related concept, inclusive growth, shares many of the attributes important in the inclusive economy perspective. The use of inclusive economy in preference to inclusive growth reflects diverging opinions on the role of economic growth in an inclusive economy. Some argue that economic growth — typically measured through gross domestic product (GDP) — is no longer correlated with improvements in well-being and that increased economic growth is environmentally unsustainable (currently economic growth is largely driven by growth in the use of limited natural resources). Others argue that economic growth is necessary to achieve greater equity if we want to avoid redistributing resources from some groups to others and that it is possible to decouple economic growth from the depletion of limited resources. These issues cannot be dealt with sufficiently here and are not discussed further, except to say that the role of economic growth in delivering an inclusive economy is a live issue.

The four attributes of an inclusive economy (summarised in box 2) were built up from the 22 concepts identified from the published reports (online supplemental appendix 3).

Box 2
Attributes of an inclusive economy

The economy is designed to be equitable: the institutions, governance mechanisms and goals of the economy are designed to deliver equity for the population.
Equitable distribution of the benefits from the economy: including (A) essential goods and services produced; (B) economic participation (eg, income, networks); (C) assets (eg, wealth, capital); and (D) value ascribed (eg, to female dominated sectors, the non-monetary economy).
Equitable access to the resources needed to participate in the economy: more equitable access to the resources (eg, good health, education) that allow people to participate in the economy.
The economy operates within planetary boundaries.

The economy is designed to deliver inclusion

The ways that our institutions, governance mechanisms, laws and regulations operate determine what is prioritised and privileged and, ultimately, what the economy delivers. For an economy to deliver inclusion, the economy and the associated institutions need to be actively designed to that end, that is, systemic changes are needed to deliver an inclusive economy.

### Addressing social and structural determinants of health in the delivery of reproductive health care: ACOG committee statement no. 11 [^1153W1pi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Statement No. 11 — background definitions note that social determinants of health are the conditions in which a person is born and lives that affect their health, including access to safe housing, adequate food, and clean water, and that structural determinants of health are macro-level effects such as economic, social, and political systems that influence and drive disparities in health outcomes. Social and structural determinants include historical, social, political, and economic forces rooted in racism and inequality that shape the relationship between environmental conditions and individual health, and political determinants of health are the policy choices that created the social determinants of health. The statement highlights that conditions in the environment where people are born, live, work, and age play an equal or even more important a role in shaping health outcomes, that environmental factors account for more than one-third of the total deaths in the United States in a year, and that evidence suggests that addressing the social needs of individuals results in improved overall health.

### The key role of sufficiency for low demand-based carbon neutrality and energy security across Europe [^117WNKtD]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Future work should build upon this by assessing how variations in income inequality impact access to energy services and the resulting compatibility with decent living energy thresholds. Sufficient analysis also needs to be given to how policy measures must be designed not only to ensure that the sufficiency corridor is achieved on average per country, but also to ensure fair distribution within countries so that minimum standards are achieved for each person.

As for renewables and efficiency potentials, the realisation of sufficiency potentials and its fair distribution is contingent on a respective policy framework, partly in interdependence with deeper cultural and social changes. However, sufficiency does not play a major role in policy frameworks of existing scenarios yet, as renewable energies and efficiency are usually the dominant strategies in rather technology-focused narratives. In the present scenario, policies were not modelled in detail, but instruments have been outlined for all sectors. In the Supplementary Data 1, about 100 policy measures are listed. Additionally, for a better overview, a summary of main policy strategies per sector pursued by sufficiency policies within the CLEVER scenario, and examples for specific instruments. Some of the policy measures are not only aimed at achieving the sufficiency corridor per country in Europe, but also explicitly at ensuring that every individual within the country achieves the basis for a good life.

Sufficiency policy mixes require a range of instrument types, regulative but also fiscal and information policies –. Effective policy mixes are characterised by consistency (to exclude contradictions), coherence (to use synergies between instruments) and comprehensiveness (to support the full range of strategies for a shift to a 100% renewable energy system).

The instrument mix proposed to achieve the CLEVER scenario varies by sector and mostly targets structural changes (by regulation, economic instruments, education) rather than individual behaviour (information). In contrast to the present European National Energy and Climate Plans, all sectors include a large share of regulatory sufficiency measures (20%-50%). For an overview graph of instrument types per sector, see the Supplementary Fig. 5. This approach of mixed policy instruments resonates with the recommendations of Climate Citizen Assemblies in European countries, which additionally call for a regulatory framework in climate policy, where the state sets clear rules rather than relying on price and market instruments. The strong focus of citizens' assemblies on sufficiency measures to combat climate change can also be interpreted as an indication that the cultural and social changes required for comprehensive sufficiency have already begun.

### Enabling conditions for an equitable and sustainable blue economy [^115jkjZQ]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The future of the global ocean economy is currently envisioned as advancing towards a 'blue economy'-socially equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically viable ocean industries 1,2. However, tensions exist within sustainable development approaches, arising from differing perspectives framed around natural capital or social equity. Here we show that there are stark differences in outlook on the capacity for establishing a blue economy, and on its potential outcomes, when social conditions and governance capacity-not just resource availability-are considered, and we highlight limits to establishing multiple overlapping industries. This is reflected by an analysis using a fuzzy logic model to integrate indicators from multiple disciplines and to evaluate their current capacity to contribute to establishing equitable, sustainable and viable ocean sectors consistent with a blue economy approach. We find that the key differences in the capacity of regions to achieve a blue economy are not due to available natural resources, but include factors such as national stability, corruption and infrastructure, which can be improved through targeted investments and cross-scale cooperation. Knowledge gaps can be addressed by integrating historical natural and social science information on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management, thus identifying equitable pathways to establishing or transforming ocean sectors 1,3,4. Our results suggest that policymakers must engage researchers and stakeholders to promote evidence-based, collaborative planning that ensures that sectors are chosen carefully, that local benefits are prioritized, and that the blue economy delivers on its social, environmental and economic goals.

### Unequal exchange is not primarily about monetary value [^112cmSfd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our propensity to translate transfers of physical substances into flows of monetary values derives from centuries of economic discourse and labour theories of value. This eschewing of the material in favour of the semiotic (given that money is a species of sign), exemplifies the conceptual separation of nature and society in modern thought. It explains why we have been unable to grasp the socio-natural essence of the technological systems amassed in core areas of the world-system since the Industrial Revolution. The underlying assumption is that technologies simply represent engineering knowledge applied to nature and that provisioning them with the requisite material resources is a separate issue, to be dealt with by economists. A more integrated understanding of technological systems is to see them as social strategies for appropriating embodied human labour time and natural space from peripheral areas. To take an iconic example, the Industrial Revolution in 19th-century Britain built on resources from throughout the world-system; each bale of cotton from North America embodied substantial amounts of African slave labour as well as hectares of American land to grow the cotton and feed its harvesters. Reinforced by monetary flows, the accumulation of industrial technomass is a local manifestation of global processes. Although conventionally understood to reflect flows of money, it is also irrefutably material.

### A financial and global demand analysis to inform decisions for funding and clinical development of group B. streptococcus vaccines for pregnant women [^113GjGNL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Also, in this case, those results depend on the following 4 key conditions. (1) The acceptability of a phase 3 pivotal trial with an immunogenicity end point. The significantly higher clinical development costs and longer timeline associated with an efficacy trial represent the largest risk to a profitable business model for the first manufacturer (or others that may be in late-stage development prior to licensure of the first vaccine). (2) Competition to be moderate or absent in the first 10 years with all global revenue earned by 1 manufacturer or with the first to market retaining a share of 60% or greater. While highly desirable from a supply security standpoint, the presence of a second or third manufacturer in the market would gain market share at the expense of the first and thus lower the overall revenue and financial sustainability for each player. In view of the potential return that can be generated by a GBS vaccine, presence of multiple competitors is to be considered likely. While the first manufacturer's development costs would remain constant, it may have first-mover advantage in locking certain markets. However, the second or third manufacturer could incur lower development costs, allowing for more aggressive pricing strategies and gain of a relevant share of the market. As result, the presence of 3 competitors in the market would reduce the share of the first to market to 20% by year 5 and its revenues and NPV by three-quarters. It should be noted that while reducing the potential attractiveness of the market, competition and decline in price can speed up the adoption for countries where ability to pay represents a significant barrier. (3) Policy recommendations and use in HICs that provide two-thirds of revenue during the first decade after first registration. Adoption in HICs is necessary to achieve maximum return on investment for the manufacturer. Inability to achieve widespread recommendations or significant lower demand in this market segment because of factors such as vaccine hesitancy and limited support from the medical community would greatly affect the profitability of this vaccine's business case. (4) Direct margin, based on price and COGS, which are the main drivers of the cash flow generated by the project. A reduction of 60% of prices across all income groups resulted in a NPV loss of $350 million (48% decrease), while a 60% increase in COGS translated to a NPV loss of $120 million (16% decrease).

### Aging in different welfare contexts: a comparative perspective on later-life employment and health [^1177hK6t]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Other scholars have extended and modified this typology to include a broader range of countries that do not fit well withclassification, such as southern European and liberal-corporatist welfare states. Southern European welfare states, such as Spain and Italy, are characterized by low levels of public expenditure for social security and a high reliance on family solidarity for welfare provision, including the strong involvement of women in child and elderly care. Liberal-corporatist welfare states, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland, combine elements of liberalism, such as a large private sector, with elements of corporatism, such as status maintenance of breadwinners' earnings. Overall population health has been observed to be better in countries that offer greater social protection and promote equality. This finding has mainly been attributed to the generosity of social programs.

With respect to later-life labor market participation, until the early 2000s, there was a cross-country trend toward early exit. Yet, in the context of increasing international competition, countries with different welfare regimes tried to counteract this trend using different strategies. Whereas liberal countries sought to keep older workers in the labor force through market-driven training programs and low public pensions, social-democratic countries provided support for older workers to help them adapt to flexibility demands through, for instance, active labor market policies. At the same time, like liberal countries, they reduced incentives for early retirement to promote an extended working life. Finally, corporatist and southern countries continued to promote early labor market exits, partially by means of interim welfare state provisions.

Old-age pension regulations vary among welfare states: they are more strongly regulated by market mechanisms and based on work performance in liberal countries and more strongly based on needs in social-democratic countries, with corporatist countries falling in-between. Accordingly, social-democratic countries like Sweden and Denmark have nearly universal pension coverage systems (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2015;). Liberal and liberal-corporatist countries, such as the United States, Chile, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, have income-tested pension systems with low public pension benefits, whereas corporatist countries, such as Germany and France, have income-tested pension systems with generous public benefits.

Nonprofit biomedical firms are an integrated market-based solution to improve incentives for investment in promising scientific areas that have high social value but minimal potential for profit. We briefly review the current market with an emphasis on the financing of innovative product development and propose ideas for new nonprofit companies centered on the health concerns of developed countries. We conclude with a suggestion that opportunities exist for nonprofit firms focused on cancer diagnostics, given the limitations of current financing incentives and ripe scientific opportunity.

### Balancing national economic policy outcomes for sustainable development [^11517wcu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Scenario-based design of linear systems often use the superposition principle, but economy-wide models are non-linear in their behavior. For instance, doubling an economic shock does not lead to a doubled effect, and the impacts of policy instruments are not additive. Therefore, selecting and simulating a small set of policy scenarios to guide policy-making could be flawed by decision-making biases. Human decisions (including scenario selection) are often driven by rationality. However, the perceptions and conceptions regarding interventions and their outcomes could influence this rationality, notably when decisions are related to financial choices or fatalities. To overcome this issue, we couple the economy-wide model with an AI-driven multiobjective search to enable sifting through complex multi-SDG policy performance spaces to identify the most efficient policy portfolios based on combinations of the policy instruments identified in the first step. In this study, we define a "policy portfolio" as a parameterized set of policy instruments.

### Mutual reinforcement of land-based carbon dioxide removal and international emissions trading in deep decarbonization scenarios [^115TQEdu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model

We deploy a multi-region, multi-sector dynamic model of the global economy, the EPPA model, which represents the market interactions among all sectors and regions of the world. The model projects the behavior of economic agents in optimizing production and consumption decisions, taking into account the resources available (labor, capital, land, natural resources), market prices, and alternative policies in place (such as those constraining greenhouse gas emissions). EPPA combines economic data and physical information on natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions. Economic data is provided by social accounting matrices depicting the structure of regional economies and includes bilateral trade and energy markets in physical units from the Global Trade Analysis Project database, organized into 18 regions and 14 sectors. Data on greenhouse gases (GHG) are obtained from several sources, including the International Energy Agencyfor CO₂ emissions from energy consumption, Boden et al.for emissions from cement production, and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) Version 4.2and Bond et al.for non-CO₂ GHGs and conventional air pollutants.

A broad set of energy sources are available in EPPA, including biomass technologies providing liquid fuels and power generation. Biomass production competes for land with other uses, such as food and forestry production. Land use changes among alternative land use categories are endogenously represented. Natural vegetation (natural forest and natural grasslands) may be converted to agricultural uses, and agricultural land can be reverted to natural states (secondary vegetation).

The model projects future economic pathways in 5-year intervals from 2025 to 2100. Economic development through 2020 is benchmarked to historical data and short-term GDP projections of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Future projections are driven by economic growth resulting from decisions related to savings and investment and exogenously specified productivity improvements in labor, capital, land, and energy. Demand for goods and services increases over time due to GDP and income growth. Higher cost grades of depletable resources are accessed as lower cost stocks are depleted. Backstop and advanced technologies may become cost competitive as conventional energy sources become more expensive. These economic drivers, combined with imposed policies and shocks, determine the economic trajectories over time and across scenarios.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^115UGqZW]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Degrowth advocates propose similar policy changes as the reformist group. However, it is stressed that implementing these changes would most likely imply a shift beyond capitalism, e.g. preventing capital accumulation through dis-economies of scale and collective firm ownership, and thus require radical social change. Eco-socialists usually focus more on rationing, planning of investments and employment, price controls and public ownership of at least the most central means of production to plan their downscaling in a socially sustainable way.

Both groups agree on the crucial role of bottom-up movements to change culture and values, push for the implementation of these top-down changes and establish parts of the new economy within the old. Finally, eco-anarchists do not view the state as a central means to achieve the socio-ecological transformation. Instead, they stress the role of bottom-up grassroots initiatives, such as transition initiatives and eco-villages, in prefiguring the transformation as well as cultural and value changes as a necessary precondition for wider radical change. With these initiatives scaling up, the state might get used to remove barriers and to support establishing a participatory-democratic and localised post-capitalist economy.

In summary, there seems to be some strategic overlap between reformist and the more radical eco-anarchist and eco-socialist approaches, at least in the short term. The question remains how these solution approaches help in overcoming the capitalist dynamics previously outlined, since here bottom-up and governmental action seem to be limited. It is important to recognise the pivotal role of social movements in this process, which can bring forward social tipping points through complex, unpredictable and reinforcing feedbacks, and create windows of opportunity from crises.

### Social, cultural and political conditions for advancing health equity: examples from eight country case studies (2011–2021) [^113ZBHab]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite global commitments to reducing health inequities, progress has been slow and mixed. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health highlighted that 'the social gradient in health within countries and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods and services, globally and nationally'. Staggering differences in life expectancy both between and within countries persist, and in some cases, are increasing. In contrast, progress in health equity (HE) is defined as 'levelling the social gradient' so that everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being. HE progress is achieved through the systematic identification and elimination of inequities resulting from differences in social and commercial determinants of health.

Evidence on how best to reduce health inequities is substantial and clear; however, the power and influence of political economies and their competing priorities have hampered progress. Researchers have explored the reasons behind inaction on HE, citing poor governance, globalisation, capitalism and corporate domination, competing vested interests, privatisation, repression of civil society, low unionisation, absence of collective bargaining, regressive welfare state policies, lack of understanding of how to act and low motivation. While a number of countries have given consideration to the social determinants of HE (SDHE), the recommendations of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health have not been significantly enacted.

Reducing health inequities is often described as too challenging and complex. Yet while the need for studies that contribute to the evidence base for how to embed effective policies in specific political economy contexts is crucial, actions must not stall in the interim. Indeed, the European Health Equity Status Reportstated that there is a need to change common perceptions that 'health equity is too complex to address and that it is unclear what actions to take and which policies and approaches will be effective'.

With this in mind, this article identifies five countries that made progress on HE and three countries that had not made the same gains, during 2011–2021 (a period of 10 years after the launch of the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health). We use the term 'progress' to mean a reduction in 'within-country' social gradients in health outcomes and 'between country' health inequities. On the basis of the cases, we identify a set of social and political conditions that appeared to be prerequisites for progress towards achieving HE.

### Global property rights and land use efficiency [^1114ugub]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The countries that exemplify common law and robust protection of property rights, such as the United States, Australia, and Canada, prioritize government responsibility in providing equitable compensation to landowners when their actions greatly devalue properties. A well-established title ensures stable taxation while imposing taxes on vacant land increases holding costs for inefficient use of land. Strong property rights act as a check on governmental power by limiting encroachment upon private property. Furthermore, clearly defined property rights mitigate corruption among local officials and collusion between governments and businesses, striking a balance between public regulation and private property rights in the real estate market. In the US, reorganization of land rights enables more efficient utilization and transfer of land, thereby enhancing its value. Similarly, incremental reforms through legal instruments have guaranteed an efficient system for land use in the UK. Australia boasts a robust framework for protecting and transferring property rights with an efficient registry system that ensures transparency and security during transactions.

Countries with civil law, such as France, Germany, China, Russia, and Brazil, exhibit a higher prevalence of ambiguous property rights compared to common law countries. This ambiguity contributes to an increase in land conflicts and a decrease in productivity. For example, in China, land ownership is categorized into state-owned land and collective-owned land. Rural collective-owned land lacks the right to generate income from development or be transferred to other users. This lack of clarity has facilitated low-compensation acquisitions by local governments and is considered as a major factor contributing to urban sprawl across China. In Russia, despite transitioning to a market economy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many lands remain uncertainly defined, potentially leading to misuse. This uncertainty hampers effective land management and conservation efforts while widespread corruption and fraud impede property rights protection effectiveness, and thereby negatively hinder economic development –. Brazil's property system has been profoundly influenced by high concentration of land ownership and large estates (latifundia) since the 19th century which exacerbates social inequality. The instability of property rights affects investment opportunities and long-term land development while violent conflicts related to disputes over ownership threaten social stability and environmental quality.

### Building systemic resilience, productivity and well-being: a mental wealth perspective [^112oLH5x]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The maintenance of social productivity during periods of economic stability and expansion can also increase access to employmentand enhance economic productivity through access to additional networks, resources, opportunities, informal skills training and mentorship, the social development of intellectual property and intergenerational knowledge transmission. Therefore, the relationship between civil society and the business sector is one of mutual dependence, with economic and social productivity being two sides of the same coin. Both are required to achieve multi-sector resilience.

The importance of brain capital

The concept of Mental Wealth also calls attention to brain capital. This concept has been the focal point for a novel research and policy agenda underpinned by a broad range of disciplines concerned with brain health. Brain capital is a new asset class that recognises brain skills and brain health as fundamental drivers of the economy. Brain skills (or mental capital) include cognitive, emotional, and collective intelligence and creativity, while brain health includes mental health and well-being which affect the ability to acquire and deploy mental capital, as well as neurological disorders which fundamentally change social and economic productive potential. Worldwide, it is estimated that the cost of lost productivity attributable to depression and anxiety alone is US$1.15 trillion per year. However, such estimates fail to adequately capture the counterfactual; namely, the potential increase in innovation and collective productivity (beyond individual absenteeism and presenteeism) that may have been possible with optimal population brain health.

### Enhancement, ethics and society: towards an empirical research agenda for the medical humanities and social sciences [^115UEyU8]. Medical Humanities (2015). Low credibility.

Exploring new terrain

We outline some research questions and directions that might contribute to research on enhancement that intersects with existing bioethics scholarship. As a consequence of our own inclination towards the field of science and technology studies (STS), we start with specifying questions that direct the gaze of scholars to the objects around which bioethical debate circulates (eg, pharmaceuticals), before considering the sociotechnical networks that enable, legitimise and sustain their production and consumption.

Like others, we feel that the substantial body of interdisciplinary STS scholarship on the social shaping of technology is of immediate relevance and import to our considerations. Such work seeks to open up the 'black box' of technology and consider the ways in which a range of social and economic factors construct the eventual form and feel of an object. In the case of enhancement, we might ask: what ideas about society, of the body, and of individual hopes and fears are imagined and/or channelled within processes of innovation? What values — clinical, scientific, economic, societal and so on — are 'inscribed' in particular substances and technologies deemed to be enhancing?How are the practices of potential users configured in the process?Scrutiny of the circulation and transformation of different kinds of value and values within the innovation processes producing technological enhancements will likely represent an interesting case for scholars who have attended to these issues in more straightforwardly biomedical contexts (such as in drug trials, trial recruitment and marketing). Disaggregating the different values and practices of valuation constitutive of the innovation and consumption of materials purchased (in formal, grey or black markets) for their enhancing properties also serves to trouble the more essentialist claims of some bioethical commentators who present these as unproblematic social and individual goods.

### Building systemic resilience, productivity and well-being: a mental wealth perspective [^111eX7Hi]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Human productivity and well-being: preserving what is most valuable

Human productivity is central to the functioning of society and its preservation is a critical starting point for achieving multisystem resilience. As Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman famously stated; 'Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything'. Productivity growth raises living standards (when equally distributed across society), increases competitiveness and improves business performance and investment opportunities. Given a concern with the human dimension of economic performance the labour element of productivity is of particular interest. The global slowdown in aggregate labour productivity since the 1990s has ignited significant debate. Commonly reported causes of the slowdown include declining innovation, an imbalance or deterioration in diffusion of innovation across sectors, a stabilisation of educational attainment, a deceleration of working-age population growth and increasing monopolisation with global frontier firms increasing their market share. The role of brain capital (encompassing brain health, mental capital, mental health and well-being) as a key driver of productivity and resilience is part of an emerging interdisciplinary (neuroscience, medicine, social science, etc) and systemic perspective in the broader, largely economic debate.

Being productive is important for mental health. Studies dating back to the 1930s highlight the relationship between labour market status and well-being, demonstrating both the positive impacts of being engaged in productive work and the negative effects of unemployment. Unemployment and underemployment are associated with significant increases in psychological distress, mental ill-health and suicidal behaviour. With increasing duration of unemployment, perceived helplessness is theorised to reduce a person's motivation to search for employment or acquire new skills due to the belief that actions will have little or no effect on their circumstances. Well-being impacts can also occur when workers experience a reduction in wages, conditions and job security on reemployment.

In addition to its detrimental effect on mental health and well-being, unemployment is thought to erode mental capital. According to Kirkwood et al, unlike fiscal capital, mental capital 'is not depleted by 'spending' it'; rather, the ongoing acquisition and deployment of new skills through work is essential for the growth of mental capital that underpins innovation and in turn, productivity. The extent of mental capital depreciation associated with unemployment and its impact on future productivity is dependent on duration of unemployment and the extent to which there is a mismatch between former and new occupations.

### Problems and promises of innovation: why healthcare needs to rethink its love / hate relationship with the new [^115tY6iM]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: addressing the problems of innovation

Rationality is a contested concept in the social sciences, but perhaps the most influential approach derives from the work of psychologists Tversky and Kahnemann, who specify rationality in terms of consistency and coherence. Defined in that sense, the paradoxes we have outlined help to explain why it makes little sense to think of rationality as the main driver of innovation in health systems. Non-rational collective decisions should perhaps be considered the norm rather than the outlier: when health systems are faced with continual external and internal pressures for innovation combined with strong emotional, economic and political forces, the ability of those systems to engage in rational debate and planning is undermined. Yet the need to avoid unnecessary innovations and manage the transition for necessary innovations is among the most important challenges facing health systems today.

If a new technology or technique is being considered for use, health systems should consider the principles of quality improvement as they are introduced rather than waiting for the inevitable problems to occur (box 1). Thus, for a new surgical procedure, we might ask:

What is the evidence that the procedure improves outcomes in other settings, while recognising the complexities of generalisation?
What support, training and systems will be needed before it can be introduced?
How should we monitor the introduction?

Box 1
Innovation in healthcare: an agenda for action

Recognise the risks and costs of innovation, including the disruptive effects even of beneficial innovation.
Have more effective systems for controlling the diffusion of innovation, including better systems for accrediting use of technologies (not simply approval of the product/device).
Study innovation at the same time as it is occurring, and collect data to link new interventions to outcomes (both intended and unintended).
Run adoption and implementation studies using high-quality social science methods and theory alongside trials; do not wait until the trial is complete before working out what is needed to adopt and implement the intervention in real life.
Clarify lines of authority in relation to innovation and use institutional authorities to mediate and adjudicate between the competing interests and demands of front-line actors, patients and their advocates, and manufacturers.
Use the clinical trial model of Phase I studies to identify the potentially unwanted or unhelpful effects of innovations in systems, and the ways they are 'metabolised' by healthcare organisations, before proceeding to full-scale testing and implementation.
Improve training of health professionals to deal with the challenges — both positive and negative — of innovation.

### Inferring personal economic status from social network location [^116L8zHL]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is commonly believed that patterns of social ties affect individuals' economic status. Here we translate this concept into an operational definition at the network level, which allows us to infer the economic well-being of individuals through a measure of their location and influence in the social network. We analyse two large-scale sources: telecommunications and financial data of a whole country's population. Our results show that an individual's location, measured as the optimal collective influence to the structural integrity of the social network, is highly correlated with personal economic status. The observed social network patterns of influence mimic the patterns of economic inequality. For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a marketing campaign that shows a threefold increase in response rate by targeting individuals identified by our social network metrics as compared to random targeting. Our strategy can also be useful in maximizing the effects of large-scale economic stimulus policies.

Prevention funding and incentive realignment — policy context — emphasizes that "Today's federal programs pay minimal attention to prevention health services" and that "Public and private investment in sick care (especially low-leverage and end-of-life care) should not be allowed to crowd out higher-leverage investments in prevention that can produce more social benefit for the same cost". It calls for parity by stating "There should be parity in the funding of high value evidence-based preventive services in both public and private programs", and notes that certain benefit designs "actually create disincentives to healing and healthful behavior".

### Uncovering social structures and informational prejudices to reduce inequity in delivery and uptake of new molecular technologies [^116YtzNz]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Measures and key characterises used in social network analysis

How and why knowledge is shared is an important consideration in the context of informational prejudices and their occurrence. Knowledge sharing is a fundamentally social phenomenon and inherently relational in nature. Relation models theory claims that people are fundamentally sociable and have certain motivations for sharing (or not): communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching and market pricing. For example, "How is knowledge perceived?" can be answered in four different ways — for communal sharing, the answer is: as a common resource, something for sharing; for authority ranking the answer is: as means to display power; for equality matching, the answer is: as a means of exchange for other knowledge; and for market pricing, the answer is: as a commodity which has a value and can be traded. Deciphering the motivations for information sharing could be garnered through in-depth interviews of knowledge brokers and other members as identified from the network analysis, including any members which take a peripheral position.

In order to understand how 'successful' the network relations and structures are at enabling the adoption and delivery of a particular test, gathering empirical evidence such as the number of tests delivered, and by and for whom, over time are important metrics to include. Such metrics relate to diffusions of innovation theories, such as Magnitude — the number of network members who have adopted the test, and the number of patients who have undergone such testing; Speed — the time to reach a certain level of penetration, has peak adoption rate been reached? Market share — to determine which particular test brands are being used. These metrics could then be correlated with those from the social network analysis to explore any interplay with social position, for example, equivalence (table 1). For example, we could interrogate the data to see whether all professionals (eg, general practitioners) are structurally equivalent through their knowledge acquisition/sharing; if they are, do they deliver the molecular test to the same extent, and to whom?

### Banking for health: the role of financial sector actors in investing in global health [^1141hnnv]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

The world faces multiple health financing challenges as the global health burden evolves. Countries have set an ambitious health policy agenda for the next 15 years with prioritisation of universal health coverage under the Sustainable Development Goals. The scale of investment needed for equitable access to health services means global health is one of the key economic opportunities for decades to come. New financing partnerships with the private sector are vital. The aim of this study is to unlock additional financing sources, acknowledging the imperative to link financial returns to the providers of capital, and create profitable, sustainable financing structures. This paper outlines the global health investment opportunity exploring intersections of financial and health sector interests, and the role investment in health can play in economic development. Considering increasing demand for impact investments, the paper explores responsible financing initiatives and expansion of the global movement for sustainable capital markets. Adding an explicit health component (H) to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment criteria, creating the ESG+H initiative, could serve as catalyst for the inclusion of health criteria into mainstream financial actors' business practices and investment objectives. The conclusion finds that health considerations directly impact profitability of the firm and therefore should be incorporated into financial analysis. Positive assessment of health impact, at a broad societal or environmental level, as well as for a firm's employees can become a value enhancing competitive advantage. An ESG+H framework could incorporate this into mainstream financial decision-making and into scalable investment products.

### Core elements of national policy for digital health technology evidence and access [^114j6u2P]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Policy "full-stack" to support DHT integration into healthcare

The first element of a policy "full-stack" is regulatory authorization. A regulatory system involves policy aimed at protecting public health outcomes and innovations through guidance, oversight, and enforcement. Regulatory systems are critical to assessing therapeutic and medical device products' safety and efficacy. National jurisdictions such as Australia, South Korea, and the United Statesthat regulate DHTs qualifying as a medical device tend to do so within the 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) frameworkor as part of a traditional medical device pathway.

While regulatory oversight is often required for DHTs that qualify as a medical device to achieve market and patient access, this authorization alone is not sufficient. In Europe, for example, a DHT that receives CE marking recognition at the European Union (EU) level typically needs to meet additional country-specific requirements to achieve patient access. Similarly, in the United States, a DHT that receives FDA clearance does not necessarily achieve automatic patient access.

The second element of the policy "full-stack" is product value assessment. DHT value assessments can take many different forms, including Health Technology Assessment (HTA) processes. HTA involves evaluating health technologies for economic, social, clinical, and ethical issues to inform policy and/or reimbursement plans. Agencies that conduct HTAs support evidence generation and collaboration between stakeholders to facilitate guidance on potential product pricing and reimbursement. European countries are preparing for the launch of the HTA Regulation in 2025, which will encompass a wide range of therapeutic modalities, including medicinal products, medical devices, and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. While this regulation creates a foundation for DHT-inclusive HTAs, a limited number of HTA pathways currently exist in Europe and globally that specifically account for DHTs.

The third element of the policy "full-stack" includes pricing and reimbursement. These processes facilitate the access and affordability of health technologies. Where available for DHTs, pricing and reimbursement processes involve a complex system that seeks to determine the value of a product by balancing the new benefit received by society with the benefit the manufacturer ought to receive for providing the product. Pricing models include cost-based pricing, cost-effectiveness thresholds, external price referencing, and value-based pricing, and consider a variety of factors such as patient and health system needs, clinical guidelines, DHT clinical outcomes and economic impact, and market dynamics.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^113hG22U]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

What we need to know — The Surgeon General's report advised that economic, regulatory, and comprehensive approaches will have the greatest population impact on tobacco use, and specific interventions such as counter-advertising, increasing the price of tobacco products, and global bans on all forms of advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, would be required for reducing smoking initiation. Gaps remain in understanding how health system interventions might contribute to reductions in initiation and maintenance rates alongside improvements in cessation, and important areas for future research should include determining why such policies are not already in place or enforced and identifying barriers within a permissive global political environment; research should also account for multiple "players" across organizational levels and may require investigating nonlinear responses because system inputs are dynamic and not necessarily linear, with chaotic relationships raising the possibility of unanticipated consequences under linear assumptions.

### Cognitive capital, equity and child-sensitive social protection in Asia and the pacific [^1172SNzk]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Total projected dependency ratios in Asia 2015 to 2100.

Second, while public investment in social protection has started to accelerate in recent years, spending is still very low in international comparison, especially when it comes to child and family-oriented expenditures. International Labour Organization (ILO) data show that spending on children amounts to a meagre 0.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in Asia Pacific, which is one of the lowest among the main global regions, and about 10 times less in relative terms than in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies with which the region intends to compete in global markets over the longer term.

Conclusions and policy recommendations

In the second half of the past century, East Asian economies channelled unskilled labour into a rapidly expanding industrial base, sustaining for decades some of the highest economic growth rates the world has ever seen. Today, however, the most prominent source of economic growth lies in cognitive capital. For example, a college kid types at a keyboard and births a company that grows to a market capitalisation exceeding $100 billion. Cognitive capital cannot be mined or traded but rather must be carefully cultivated by the most forward-looking of policies. Box 3 shows a five-step agenda to embrace these policies, address headwinds and build a more virtuous, sustainable cycle of social and economic development — reconciling two major development paradigms: child rights and economic policy perspectives.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives — Table 1 delineates cost components and examples by perspective (Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", Full Societal). Components and examples include health care costs paid by third-party payers (drug/device costs, hospital services, physician services, home care services, allied health), costs paid out-of-pocket by patients (drug copayment/coinsurance and user fees), patient-time costs (time spent seeking care), unpaid caregiver-time costs (time spent in caregiving), and productivity losses (formal/informal labor earnings lost, cost of unpaid lost productivity due to illness, cost of uncompensated household production). Broader sectors listed include social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental. Footnotes instruct that analysts should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective and describe a "modified" societal perspective that includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy.

### Diverse values of nature for sustainability [^111YXsDK]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

This case also illustrates the potential challenges and approaches to accounting for the many values held by different stakeholders in decisions. For example, the wetland's specific values are directly 'comparable' when they can be accounted for with the same indicators (for example, monetary metrics for cost–benefit analyses of tourism development projects, in which investment costs are compared with the market and non-market economic effects on people and the wetland). Other specific values can be 'compatible' when they share common features such as being measured in spatial units, allowing them to be addressed together, despite using different indicators (for example, spatially overlaying bundles of the wetland's contributions to people proxied with biophysical, monetary and socio-cultural indicators). However, some values are simply 'incommensurable', being neither comparable nor compatible with others. For instance, a wetland could be solely managed for fisheries and commercial tourism to enhance some stakeholder's instrumental values, such as economic benefits or nutritional yield, but erode other intrinsic values, such as keystone species' habitat, and relational values, including fishers' cultural identity. Without a common or compatible denominator, decisions cannot rely on standard trade-off analyses (for example, cost–benefit analysis, multicriteria decision aid); rather, they should treat these values in 'parallel'.

The challenge of incommensurability does not indicate that any particular value by definition should have higher priority than others in decision-making. It does mean that procedures need to recognize values that would otherwise be excluded or lost and ensure reasoned prioritization. Societies create principles to handle such difficult evaluations. For example, several countries have institutionalized the precautionary principle for situations when the consequences of decisions are largely unknown. Similarly, dealing with incommensurability demands further development of agreed principles, which may in turn require deliberative approachesto help decision makers choose among alternative policy options. This can complement evidence based on 'social' preferences (that is, aggregated individual preferences) although it is well understood in social-choice research that aggregation of individual preferences to guide fair societal choices faces dilemmas. The challenges compound when different value types need to be weighed against each other and aggregated. Yet, as participatory processes can be manipulated, power asymmetries should be addressed.

### The dynamics of higher-order novelties [^112kBPoy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The idea of the AP, modeled either in terms of extractions from urns or random walks over a network, is of great importance to understand the processes leading to novelties. There is, however, another important mechanism of creation of the new which is neglected by the frameworks discussed above: novelties can arise from the combination of already-known elements. For instance, a meaningless sequence of words, if ordered in a different way, may generate elegant poetry. Novel combinations of existing hashtags may lead to new social-media trends. Different orderings of the same musical notes may in principle generate an endless number of songs. The mechanics of combination of "pre-existing" items has been studied in various fields, e.g. in biology where new associations of various entities produce new organisms. It has been shown that the immune system recombines existing segments of genes to produce new receptors. Also, publications and collaborations in scienceare typically combinations of research ideas – and expertises –. Similarly, in innovation economics, as originally discussed by Schumpeter, and confirmed by recent works on the generation of technologies –, new combinations of existing factors, that interact in a technological production process, may give rise to innovations, which rule out of the market obsolete products and services, thus increasing the probability of reaching further innovations (the so-called "creative destruction").

### Power and the commercial determinants of health: ideas for a research agenda [^115rnkz5]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Appeasement and accommodation are much more subtle and are not always legible as an expression of power. They can include accommodations and concessions to diffuse challenges to the status quo, reduce and distort pressure for transformative change. Levy and Newelland Levy and Egandescribe the use of accommodations as a 'passive revolution' to appease industry critics. Similarly, corporate social responsibility initiatives are described as a strategy to 'neutralise opposition', 'pre-empt viable threats' and absorb 'counter hegemonic forces'. As with coercive forms of power, appeasement also cuts across Luke's three 'faces' of power. In the late 1990s, for example, in response to the threat of regulation of emissions, the automobile industry began to invest in low-emission technologies and to promoted a 'win–win' rhetoric of environmental sustainability and corporate profits. An earlier example from the soft drink industry was the promotion of voluntary recycling programmes as an alternative to proposed bans and taxes on disposable beverage containers in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s. A key consequence of these accommodations and concessions is their potential to 'pacify' industry opposition.

Thinking of power in these terms offers important insights into the nature and outcomes of corporate political strategies and helps illuminate how power is exerted and shapes policy making. It is also largely overlooked in the emergent literature on power in health policy and systems research. Coercive strategies tend to foster reciprocal antagonism, whereas appeasement has the potential to foster goodwill and even facilitate important relationships. The value of the appeasement strategy can be seen in the food and alcohol industries, where the rhetoric of partnerships and collaboration has become the norm in global policy settings. These public–private partnerships are often criticised for providing more benefits for businesses than public health. Further, because many in public health remain suspicious of appeasement initiatives and the industry's intentions, this strategy has also fragmented the public health community, with those who see industry actors as potential partners on one side and those who prefer a tobacco-style command and control approach on the other. As interest group cohesion is a predictor of political influence, the absence of a unified public health alliance has important consequences. Lastly, some appeasement strategies (eg, product reformulation) can in fact increase market resources, which can then be translated into political power and influence.

### The social value of candidate HIV cures: actualism versus possibilism [^115eteEt]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Financing cost and delivery of interventions

Worldwide, drug prices usually determine their accessibility. At present, the cost of cell-based therapy is very high — autologous cell transplant is estimated at US$75 000–$150 000 and allogeneic cell transplant is estimated at US$150 000–$300,000. These estimated costs remain lower than the current cost of lifelong ART in developed countries, which is estimated at US$420 000–$755 000 per individual in the USA.

While the price of cure interventions will likely become lower with time, some elements of cost are insurmountable. In low-income countries, sophisticated and technology-intensive HIV cure interventions like cell-based therapy will be challenging to deliver in rural regions without reliable power supply. The apheresis procedure, which is used for collecting cells (T cells or stem cells) in cell-based therapy, is medically and technically demanding and is not currently available worldwide. As of 2014, only one country (out of 16) in West Africa had the capacity to perform apheresis procedures. Overcoming these technical challenges would require strengthening health systems in low-income countries and making resources available to transport people from rural regions to urban centres that are equipped to deliver these complex interventions. Constrained public budgets make it difficult for governments in low-income countries to purchase innovative health technologies for use in healthcare centres. As such, political commitment and donor efforts would need radical expansion to support access to a complex or sophisticated candidate cure. We are not confident that such an expansion is likely to occur; bottlenecks to point-of-care delivery will remain. As actualists, these bottlenecks support the argument for prioritising less complex cure interventions.

High-risk intervention

Cell-based therapy that involves stem cell transplantation is highly risky and requires continuous medical attention and immunosuppressant use. Some latency reversing agents currently being considered for HIV cure are mutagenic and may potentially cause cancer in the long term. Unless transformed to become low-risk with fewer inpatient procedures, it will be challenging to convince patients who are doing very well on ART to undergo these potentially risky interventions.

### The prospective relationship between social cohesion and depressive symptoms among older adults from central and Eastern Europe [^1169xrwY]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a major public health concern in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and strongly predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in this region. Depression rates in CEE are substantially higher than in other parts of Europe, potentially reflecting the disruptions of the societal transition after the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. The accelerated shift towards a market economy resulted not only in dramatic health declines, but also rapid increases in social inequalities and social distress. In particular, the unprecedented social, economic and political changes have been theorised to undermine the regulatory aspects of social integration, such as social control and norms. These unparalleled changes disrupted the psychosocial environment, due to the lack of security and collapse of social institutions.

Social cohesion is a cultural dimension of the psychosocial environment, and has been defined as a component of cognitive social capital that is expressed by altruism, reciprocity, values and norms between members of a community. Markers of cognitive social capital, including social cohesion, have become increasingly recognised as determinants of common mental disorders, including depression, according to three reviews. This area of research is relatively well-established, but most evidence is cross-sectional and limited to high-income countries with particular sociocultural settings; none of the reviews included prospective studies from CEE or other lower income countries.

### The differential impact of economic recessions on health systems in middle-income settings: a comparative case study of unequal States in Brazil [^114jS4xw]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Despite the peculiarities of Brazil's health system and the unique features of its economic crises, our analysis bears implications for health financing and provision of health services amid economic slowdowns in low/middle-income settings. This 'differential impact' of crises on health sectors is not new, as the concept of a system's vulnerability stemming from the combination of its exposure to economic fluctuation and its ability to respond to change is well-established in the development economic literature. Paradoxically, our results show that more dynamic and sophisticated health systems, reliant on multiple health services providers, may find themselves more exposed during an economic downturn than poorer systems that rely predominantly on less volatile public funds. In such a scenario, public health spending would create mechanisms of social protection during an economic downturn, therefore counteracting the expected disproportionate impact of recessions on services for the poor. This conclusion appears consistent with the recent evidence from Brazil on the relation between unemployment and health during recession, and on the mitigation effects of social protection mechanisms.

Our findings call for a more nuanced understanding of how the effects of economic recessions reverberate across complex and multi-layered health systems typical of the world's emerging middle-income economies. Our results should be interpreted in the light of the study's acknowledged limitations. First, public health expenditures in Brazil take place within a complex federative structure, including financial transfers between central, state and local governments. Therefore, tracking expenditures is complex, and the risk of double counting expenditures is very real, as these are often recorded by multiple agencies at different levels of government. This possible bias should not however change the discussed expenditure trends. Second, the lack of information on the private sector hampered our exploration of its behaviour during the economic recession; more complete data on out-of-pocket spending for medicines, medical services and other markets would strengthen our analysis and conclusions. Third, our methodological choice to convert national expenditure in US dollars may have, to some extent, distorted the spending trends, as during the period of study, BRL to USD exchange rate had non-negligible fluctuations, which may have influenced some of our conclusions from a cross-countries comparative perspective. Finally, the analysis must take into account that both MA and SP are large territories with great heterogeneities between and within cities, which may not have been fully captured by our aggregated data. Despite such limitations, a few key lessons can be safely learnt from our study.

### Quantification of an efficiency-sovereignty trade-off in climate policy [^112YxJAV]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

The Paris Agreement calls for a cooperative response with the aim of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while reaffirming the principles of equity and common, but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities 1. Although the goal is clear, the approach required to achieve it is not. Cap-and-trade policies using uniform carbon prices could produce cost-effective reductions of global carbon emissions, but tend to impose relatively high mitigation costs on developing and emerging economies. Huge international financial transfers are required to complement cap-and-trade to achieve equal sharing of effort, defined as an equal distribution of mitigation costs as a share of income 2,3, and therefore the cap-and-trade policy is often perceived as infringing on national sovereignty 2–7. Here we show that a strategy of international financial transfers guided by moderate deviations from uniform carbon pricing could achieve the goal without straining either the economies or sovereignty of nations. We use the integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE to analyse alternative policies: financial transfers in uniform carbon pricing systems, differentiated carbon pricing in the absence of financial transfers, or a hybrid combining financial transfers and differentiated carbon prices. Under uniform carbon prices, a present value of international financial transfers of 4.4 trillion US dollars over the next 80 years to 2100 would be required to equalize effort. By contrast, achieving equal effort without financial transfers requires carbon prices in advanced countries to exceed those in developing countries by a factor of more than 100, leading to efficiency losses of 2.6 trillion US dollars. Hybrid solutions reveal a strongly nonlinear trade-off between cost efficiency and sovereignty: moderate deviations from uniform carbon prices strongly reduce financial transfers at relatively small efficiency losses and moderate financial transfers substantially reduce inefficiencies by narrowing the carbon price spread. We also identify risks and adverse consequences of carbon price differentiation due to market distortions that can undermine environmental sustainability targets 8,9. Quantifying the advantages and risks of carbon price differentiation provides insight into climate and sector-specific policy mixes.

### A cure for everything and nothing? Local partnerships for improving health in england [^1168u6TU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Some partnerships were mandated by policy makers (such as health and wellbeing boards, established across the whole country in 2012), while others were voluntary initiatives (such as integrated care pilots, in place between 2009 and 2011 in 16 areas). Local agencies have typically been required to work together to develop a strategy for improving health and quality of services in their area — and sometimes have been provided with extra funding to help do so. Some programmes involved stronger national direction over the content of local initiatives than others. For instance, recent "vanguards" of new care models received national funding and support to develop three broad models of health and social service integration, including collaboration between general practices, hospitals, social care, and wider community services.

Area based partnerships proliferated from 1997 under New Labour governments — including health action zones, Sure Start local programmes, and local strategic partnerships. These policies were combined with a national strategy to reduce health inequalities in England and major public investment in the NHS and social programmes. Policies to encourage local partnerships continued under coalition and Conservative governments — including a series of initiatives to better coordinate NHS and social care services, such as the Better Care Fund — but explicit aims to reduce health inequalities appeared less prominently. Partnerships since 2010 were implemented in the context of austerity in public spending, and national policy makers often prioritised objectives of improving efficiency and reducing use of hospitals and other services.

The new integrated care systems (fig 1) mix elements of these previous partnership policies, combining a narrower focus on coordinating health services for patients with broader ambitions to address social and economic determinants of health for populations. The result is a broad and ambitious list of objectives for the partnerships, including to improve population health, improve healthcare services, reduce inequalities in health and healthcare, improve productivity and value for money, and support broader social and economic development. Collaboration between agencies and integration of services are seen as mechanisms to do this.

Fig 1
Organisation of health and care partnerships in England's integrated care systems. Each integrated care system will be made up of two bodies: integrated care boards, responsible for controlling most healthcare resources in their area, and broader integrated care partnerships, responsible for developing an integrated care strategy to guide local decisions

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^114KGBgc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers — a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin. It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome. Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers' power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender. Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale. For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998–2002). Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

### Policy and market forces delay real estate price declines on the US coast [^112vBkMh]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Despite increasing risks from sea-level rise (SLR) and storms, US coastal communities continue to attract relatively high-income residents, and coastal property values continue to rise. To understand this seeming paradox and explore policy responses, we develop the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) and analyze the long-term evolution of coastal real estate markets. C-HOM incorporates changing physical attributes of the coast, economic values of these attributes, and dynamic risks associated with storms and flooding. Resident owners, renters, and non-resident investors jointly determine coastal property values and the policy choices that influence the physical evolution of the coast. In the coupled system, we find that subsidies for coastal management, such as beach nourishment, tax advantages for high-income property owners, and stable or increasing property values outside the coastal zone all dampen the effects of SLR on coastal property values. The effects, however, are temporary and only delay precipitous declines as total inundation approaches. By removing subsidies, prices would more accurately reflect risks from SLR but also trigger more coastal gentrification, as relatively high-income owners enter the market and self-finance nourishment. Our results suggest a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic transitions in coastal communities and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks from climate change.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^113HMMyH]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) — overview of domains and directive aims states that psychologists "strive to gain awareness of how their biases related to social class may impact the training and education they provide" and "are encouraged to increase their knowledge and understanding of social class issues, including poverty and wealth, through continuing education, training, supervision, and consultation"; they "strive to understand the contribution of economic and social marginalization to the substantial health disparities in our society" and "strive to promote equity in the access to, and the quality of, health care available for people from LIEM backgrounds"; in treatment contexts, psychologists "acknowledge the presence of social class as a variable that is present in mental health treatment settings" and "are encouraged to seek to a) understand how social class influences psychotherapists' ability to effectively engage clients in treatment, and b) attend to ways that social class differences manifest and impact the experience of mental health treatment for clients", "aim to understand the barriers that prevent persons with low SES from better accessing mental health care and make efforts to alleviate these barriers when providing psychological interventions and/or creating mental health care delivery systems", and "strive to understand the common clinical presentations that may be more likely to occur among persons who are from LIEM populations and how best to address these in treatment settings"; regarding career concerns and unemployment, psychologists "seek to understand the impact of social class on academic success, career aspirations, and career development throughout the lifespan" and "seek to understand the interaction among economic insecurity, unemployment, and underemployment and attempt to contribute to re-employment processes for individuals".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 — cost-effectiveness analysis perspectives delineate cost components by perspective: Health care costs paid by third-party payers and costs paid out-of-pocket by patients are included across Health Care Sector, "Modified Societal", and Full Societal; patient-time costs, unpaid caregiver-time costs, transportation costs, and productivity are included under "Modified Societal" and "Full Societal"; and cross-sector items such as social services, housing, legal or criminal justice, education, and environmental are included only under Full Societal. The footnote adds that analysts "should attempt to capture all relevant costs from a societal perspective", that a "'modified' societal perspective includes some societal costs, such as patient time and lost productivity, but excludes costs from other sectors of the economy", and that "An Impact Inventory can aid in communicating and discussing these limitations".

### Income security during periods of ill health: a scoping review of policies, practice and coverage in low-income and middle-income countries [^114Yaz4a]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

This review marks a first step towards synthesising information on income security for individuals in LMICs who experience ill health. In doing so, it has identified significant inequalities in the level of income support and coverage across and within LMICs, specifically in regard to sickness benefits, injury compensation, social insurance, microfinance and UCTs. This review demonstrates the need for a greater understanding of the circumstances of those who cannot work due to ill heath, to improve the equity and coverage of income security in LMICs.

The small number of studies in LMICs is in itself a significant finding, showing that the topic has received very limited attention in countries where it is of major importance. Moving forward, further research is crucial in contributing towards a better understanding of how to reach the SDGs, particularly goals 1, 3, 8 and 10, which advocate for the eradication of poverty, good health and well-being, decent work and reduced inequalities. More specifically, further investigation into coverage, protective effects, equity and operational challenges must involve the study of all forms of sickness-related income loss and account for the changing landscape of global health and labour market transition. In order to foster intersectoral approaches for financial risk protection for people struck by ill health, research on income security needs to become a more visible part of the UHC research and policy agenda. Without valuable input from the health sector, the true understanding of illness-related costs and the corresponding scalability, equity and fiscal space to develop protective interventions will remain limited.

Ultimately, more research in this field could inform a number of evidence-based interventions, including better enforcement of labour regulations, improving access to social insurance, developing more diverse or integrated contributory and non-contributory schemes, and improving rehabilitation and work opportunities for people with disabilities. In turn, greater understanding of these topics will better inform spending decisions to improve financial sustainability and institutional capacity. In doing so, further research and recognition may ultimately elevate the role of income security and generate equitable policies which can serve a universally protective and productive function.

### The ambiguous role of alcohol in economic and social development [^1161dMA5]. Addiction (2000). Low credibility.

An increased and industrialized alcohol supply in a developing society is usually assumed to have positive effects on economic development, although it may be recognized that the effects on public health and order will be negative. There has been little attention to the potential for negative effects on the economic side. This paper directs attention to such factors as unemployment for cottage producers (often female heads of household) and reduced industrial employment as highly-automated "turnkey" brewers are installed. On the other hand, changes in the mode of production of alcoholic beverages may have little impact on the much larger work-force involved in serving or selling alcohol in retail trade. The net contribution of an increased and industrialized alcohol supply in terms of economic development is unclear, but industrialization and development bring with them increased demands for attention and sobriety, e.g. in motorized traffic and on the production line, which increased drinking may undercut. Decisions by international development agencies on investment in alcohol production and distribution should take account of both the positive and negative impacts on economic development as well as on public health. In line with this, the World Bank has recently decided to invest in alcohol industry projects only when there is a strong positive development impact and the project is "consistent with public health issues and social policy concerns".

### The WHO-INTEGRATE evidence to decision framework version 1.0: integrating WHO norms and values and a complexity perspective [^111QhS5h]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

All criteria are important and should be reflected on, but their relevance varies depending on the type of health decision and the decision-making context. In contrast, not all subcriteria are always relevant. At the start of a guideline or other decision-making process, an appropriately composed guideline panel or other decision-making group needs to discuss which of the subcriteria are applicable and useful in relation to the nature and specific characteristics of the intervention (see table 1); this group will also need to consider the specific information needed to populate criteria or subcriteria (see table 3). Complexity in the intervention and complexity in the system into which this intervention is implemented can usually be detected; the critical question is whether it is of value to examine this complexity in depth (see box 1 in this paper and box 2 in an earlier paper in this series). This prioritisation process should take the views of relevant stakeholder groups into account; which stakeholder groups are relevant depends on the nature of the problem and the institutional as well as broader physical and social context. In principle, these should include those directly affected by the intervention (eg, patients, beneficiaries), those financing (eg, health insurance providers, ministries of health, other ministries) or implementing the intervention (eg, healthcare providers, public health professionals, professionals outside of the health sector), as well as the general public.

Table 3
WHO-INTEGRATE framework version 1.0: criteria and suggested types of primary studies, evidence synthesis methods and approaches to assessing quality of evidence

A systematic weakness in many guideline development and other health decision-making processes is that consumer participation is obviated and guideline panels often substitute their own values and views for those of patients/beneficiaries. The voices of patients/beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholder groups can be incorporated through direct participation or representative surveysas well as qualitative research (see table 3).

The guideline panel will also need to decide how best to populate the criteria with evidence and whether a formal evidence synthesis or a more pragmatic approach is warranted for each. This decision will be influenced by the relevance of criteria and subcriteria in relation to a specific intervention or decision, and by the likely types and quantity of evidence available, as well as time and resource constraints. At the end of the process, the guideline panel will need to reassess the criteria and relevant subcriteria in light of the assembled evidence and make a judgement regarding each criterion.

### A framework for valuing investments in a nurturing society: opportunities for prevention research [^113dy8ew]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2017). Low credibility.

Investing in strategies that aim to build a more nurturing society offers tremendous opportunities for the field of prevention science. Yet, scientists struggle to consistently take their research beyond effectiveness evaluations and actually value the impact of preventive strategies. Ultimately, it is clear that convincing policymakers to make meaningful investments in children and youth will require estimates of the fiscal impact of such strategies across public service systems. The framework offered here values such investments. First, we review current public spending on children and families. Then, we describe how to quantify and monetize the impact of preventive interventions. This includes a new measurement strategy for assessing multisystem service utilization and a price list for key service provision from public education, social services, criminal justice, health care and tax systems.

### Collaborative management of the grand Ethiopian renaissance dam increases economic benefits and resilience [^113fULZ4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Structure of the modeling framework

The coevolutionary macroeconomy and river system simulation framework introduced in this study consists of two modeling components: (a) the Egyptian economy and (b) the Nile river system. The modeling framework accounts for the coevolutionary dynamics of river and economic systems using an iterative process. This multi-sector framework is designed for river systems with multiyear storage dams and a mix of hydro and non-hydro electricity generation. The two modeling components are described separately below, followed by a description of their interaction, which characterizes two-way hydro-economic feedbacks. The application of the coevolutionary framework to the Nile is then discussed.

Economy-wide modeling component

The Egyptian economy-wide modeling component is based on the IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) standard open-source CGE model. The model was modified to include water, energy, and land components and run dynamically (i.e. for a multiyear period). In previous studies, water, energy, and land resources have been included in the productive activities of CGE models in a variety of ways. A recent review of the literature distinguished between CGE models that treat water as an explicit factor of production, those that include water as an implicit factor of production (i.e. embedded in land productivity), and those that treat water as a commodity (i.e. an intermediate input). Energy-oriented CGE models typically combine energy with capital in the production structure of goods and services. The inclusion of energy in CGE models is straightforward compared to water because energy is a marketed commodity that can be easily reallocated to different sectors. The reallocation of water supplies across space and time requires storage and network infrastructure and is often constrained by unpredictable supplies (stochastic hydrology). Moreover, raw water supplies are typically unpriced –; thus, the economic value of water is not included in economic data (e.g. social accounting matrices and input–output tables).

### Why are investors not interested in my radiotracer? The industrial and regulatory constraints in the development of radiopharmaceuticals [^113fBRd2]. Nuclear Medicine and Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Four criteria are essential in the acceptance by investors of new radiopharmaceuticals: the existence of a market and a medical need, the quality of the science and technology behind the new molecule, the feasibility and compliance with regulations and the limited competitive landscape. Potential investors need to get more convincing market evidence, largely beyond the nice preclinical data generated to the point of first discussion. A properly protected compound not jeopardized by earlier published results is a must. A guarantee of an easy and secured source of the ligand is obvious. A safe access to the radionuclide in volumes corresponding to the targeted market is rarely taken into account, but of utmost importance. The evaluation of new drugs by investors will include the evaluation of the real market size for the targeted indication and the position of the drug in the healthcare environment at the time to market. This includes the potential competition with other radiopharmaceuticals, but also with conventional drugs or competitive modalities also at time to market. Both criteria are usually not easily accessible to researchers whose acquaintance remains limited to the scientific and technical part. Starting from this set of information, a first business plan can be deduced based on a best estimate for price per dose and a rough evaluation about the chance and level of reimbursement. In the following most of the events are covered that could jeopardize the development of the drug, focusing on the industrial, economic and regulatory aspects, comprehending the detailed analysis of the currently best available radionuclides.

### Economy-wide evaluation of COand air quality impacts of electrification in the United States [^113bJHo1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The end-use model includes structural detail across several dimensions relevant for fuel and technology choice, such as building size, type, and vintage, climate zone and location, and vehicle ownership and driving intensity. Within each structural category, service demand may be met with a range of options, characterized as combinations of fuels and technologies. The model evaluates the total cost of each option in each new vintage based on assumed technology cost and performance, fuel prices, structural attributes of service demand, and non-economic factors. The resulting allocation across the options is based on a logit model translating relative costs to equilibrium market shares, with a lagged process to simulate a gradual transition toward the model's calculated equilibrium shares. Parameter selection for the logit model is discussed in Supplementary Note 1. The parameterization of the logit model determines the sensitivity of the market allocation (within a given nest in the nested structure) to assumed ("observed") costs, or, conversely the influence of non-modeled ("non-observed") or costs or preferences, which by construction are assumed to be independently and identically distributed for each technology in the nest. The model then determines annual and hourly fuel use by region as a function of the resulting mix of end-use technologies. Investment costs for end-use technologies (e.g. light-duty electric vehicles, air-source heat pumps) are sourced from the literature and EPRI expert elicitations. Behavioral features of energy consumers are represented by incorporating disutility costs associated with purchase decisions such as refueling station availability for passenger vehicles, using a simulation-based approach to capture unobserved preference heterogeneity across households (Table 1), and explicitly breaking out structural classes to capture observed heterogeneity across households and firms. Note that this framework does not capture possible interactions of heterogeneous agents, where adoption and utilization decisions are influenced by the choices of others, as many agent-based models do.

### Social determinants of health, universal health coverage, and sustainable development: case studies from latin American countries [^11158bAC]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Many intrinsically related determinants of health and disease exist, including social and economic status, education, employment, housing, and physical and environmental exposures. These factors interact to cumulatively affect health and disease burden of individuals and populations, and to establish health inequities and disparities across and within countries. Biomedical models of health care decrease adverse consequences of disease, but are not enough to effectively improve individual and population health and advance health equity. Social determinants of health are especially important in Latin American countries, which are characterised by adverse colonial legacies, tremendous social injustice, huge socioeconomic disparities, and wide health inequities. Poverty and inequality worsened substantially in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s in these countries. Many Latin American countries have introduced public policies that integrate health, social, and economic actions, and have sought to develop health systems that incorporate multisectoral interventions when introducing universal health coverage to improve health and its upstream determinants. We present case studies from four Latin American countries to show the design and implementation of health programmes underpinned by intersectoral action and social participation that have reached national scale to effectively address social determinants of health, improve health outcomes, and reduce health inequities. Investment in managerial and political capacity, strong political and managerial commitment, and state programmes, not just time-limited government actions, have been crucial in underpinning the success of these policies.

### Entry order as a consideration for innovation strategies [^1157pgRS]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2006). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have defined an effect of market entry order on commercial success that depends on attributes of the underlying technology, the rate of change in technology improvement, consumer expectations of these attributes and the degree of unmet demand. Analyses of pharmaceutical sales data suggest that the commercial success of drugs is subject to similar forces. These findings have important implications for innovation strategies.

### What can one legitimately expect from a health system? A conceptual analysis and a proposal for research and action [^113NgyUu]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

'Legitimacy' in social psychology, political science, and organisational studies

Within their social psychological theory of 'legitimation of interpersonal status hierarchies', Ridgeway and Bergerdefine legitimacy as a 'process by which cultural accounts from a larger social framework' can be used to explain the 'existence' of a particular social entity, regardless if that entity is a group, structure of inequality or a position of authority. The central tenet here is that Ridgeway and Bergerdistinguish between the 'object' of legitimation at one level, and the broader beliefs, values, and norms that actors possess at a more encompassing, social level. Drawing on work from both social psychology and institutional theory, Johnson et al articulate the link between these two levels, showing how patterns of behaviour or beliefs are widely accepted into the broader cultural framework and become taken-for-granted social features. In the first stage (innovation), a new social innovation is created to address a need or desire at the level of actors (such as an organisation developing new procedures to meet policies). For an innovation to be accepted locally, local actors must believe that it is consonant with an existing, widely accepted cultural framework. As a result of being implicitly accepted, the innovation achieves local validation. Eventually, the new social innovation may diffuse into new, local situations and is adopted by actors in other contexts. As the new social object diffuses across contexts, it acquires widespread acceptance and is generally validated, becoming a 'taken-for-granted' social innovation.

### The differential impact of economic recessions on health systems in middle-income settings: a comparative case study of unequal States in Brazil [^116FB1vF]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Data and sources of information

In order to understand the relationship between the economic recession and the Brazilian health system, we began by selecting certain indicators to evidence both SP and MA socioeconomic positions. Gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita GDP indicators were extracted from the System of National Accounts.

Population, labour market and poverty indicators were taken from the National Household Sample Survey of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Health plans and insurance data — quantity of contracts, companies' income, among others — are published by the ANS. In this paper, 'private health coverage' signifies the number of existing health plan contracts divided by the country's overall population.

Analysis regarding São Paulo and Maranhão was based on health expenditures recorded for each state and local governments before and after the crisis. In order to understand the general context, overall public spending was also examined, based on federal, state and local governments' aggregate data extracted from the Public Health Budget Information System and complemented by fiscal statements.

Private health systems' reaction to the crisis was described by analysing health plans and out-of-pocket expenditures. Company and family spending on health plans and the evolution of the number of beneficiaries were obtained from the ANS database. The analysis of household out-of-pocket expenditures, including drugs, services and other health items, was based on Health Satellite Account data collected by IBGE for the 2010–2015 period and estimated for the 2016–2018 period.

Health workforce data were extracted from the Annual Relation of Social Indicators, which exclusively covers formally employed physicians and nurses in the public health system (SUS). To describe the effects of the economic crisis on non-financial resources, we selected the evolution of intensive and intermediate hospital beds stock from the National Health Facilities Register; as the stock of such core beds is typically more stable than overall hospital beds, such an indicator is believed to better capture changes in this resource availability. These non-financial resources were weighted by the state population as estimated by IBGE.

### Society's choice: the tradeoff between efficacy and equity and the lives at stake [^115TWB4G]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Society understands that racial and ethnic minorities experience inferior medical care and health status, but may not appreciate the seriousness of the problem. Each year the nation spends billions of dollars to perfect the "technology" of health care (e.g., development of new drugs) and modernize delivery systems, thereby saving thousands of lives. Correcting disparities in care, however, would avert five times as many deaths. If policymakers adhered to the goal of optimizing population health, greater priority would go to resolving disparities than to refining technology, but reverse priorities prevail. Adverse socioeconomic conditions-chief among the many causes of disparities-could be eased through bold socioeconomic reforms. Society has the resources to enable the disadvantaged to attain better health but pursues other priorities.

### Optimally generate policy-based evidence before scaling [^1135T3cS]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Social scientists have increasingly turned to the experimental method to understand human behaviour. One critical issue that makes solving social problems difficult is scaling up the idea from a small group to a larger group in more diverse situations. The urgency of scaling policies impacts us every day, whether it is protecting the health and safety of a community or enhancing the opportunities of future generations. Yet, a common result is that, when we scale up ideas, most experience a 'voltage drop'-that is, on scaling, the cost-benefit profile depreciates considerably. Here I argue that, to reduce voltage drops, we must optimally generate policy-based evidence. Optimality requires answering two crucial questions: what information should be generated and in what sequence. The economics underlying the science of scaling provides insights into these questions, which are in some cases at odds with conventional approaches. For example, there are important situations in which I advocate flipping the traditional social science research model to an approach that, from the beginning, produces the type of policy-based evidence that the science of scaling demands. To do so, I propose augmenting efficacy trials by including relevant tests of scale in the original discovery process, which forces the scientist to naturally start with a recognition of the big picture: what information do I need to have scaling confidence?

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^112hfu6Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) — discussion on integrating economic evidence explains that the CGC aims to improve health and health care by providing clinicians with recommendations based on the best available evidence and includes evaluating the cost of care, assessing the value of an intervention, incorporating economic evidence into recommendations, and discussing corresponding clinical considerations; it highlights limitations of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), noting that willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly used in the United States do not reflect clinical, social, individual economic, and inflation considerations, economic evidence is sparse and poorly reported in the United States and analyses from outside the United States have low applicability, the certainty of economic evidence is often limited due to dynamic pricing and modeling assumptions, industry funding of CEAs is common and results cannot be easily repurposed in quantitative meta-analytic syntheses, many CEAs rely on surrogate outcomes and analyze medications individually rather than by class, and certainty in CEA results should be based on critically appraised certainty of clinical benefits and harms and model credibility.

### Non-trivial stimuli-responsive collective behaviours emerging from microscopic dynamic complexity in supramolecular polymer systems [^115iZKHn]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Supramolecular polymers are composed of monomers that self-assemble non-covalently generating distributions of fibres in continuous exchange-and-communication with each other and the surroundings. Intriguing collective properties may emerge in such molecular-scale complex systems, following mechanisms often difficult to ascertain. Here we show how non-trivial collective behaviours may emerge in dynamical supramolecular polymer systems already at low-complexity levels. We combine minimalistic models, simulations, and advanced statistical analyses investigating how cooperative and non-cooperative supramolecular polymer systems respond to a specific stimulus: i.e., the addition of molecular sequestrators perturbing their equilibrium. Our data show how, while in a non-cooperative system all assemblies populating the system suffer uniformly the perturbation, in a cooperative system the larger/stronger assemblies survive at the expense of the smaller/weaker entities. Collective behaviours typical of larger-scale and more complex (social, economic, etc.) systems may thus emerge even in relatively simple self-assembling systems from the internal (microscopic) dynamic heterogeneity of their ensembles.

### Justification of CT for individual health assessment of asymptomatic persons: a World Health Organization consultation [^117JfQkY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Public Health, Resource, and Other Considerations

The WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being is broad, including ethical, social, public health, and resource considerations. The radiation protection system has an ethical dimension that is not explicitly stated but is currently being reviewed/further elaborated. It is important to be aware that the system of radiological protection recommended by the ICRP is based on a mixture of scientific evidence, practical experience, and value judgments. The three ICRP principles — justification, optimization, and dose limitation — should take account of the values generally informing medical practice and ethical behavior in society. A pragmatic set of such values recently presented and explored includes (Table 1),:
□ Dignity and Autonomy (of the individual).
□ Nonmaleficence and Beneficence (do not harm and do good).
□ Justice (be fair).
□ Prudence (keep in mind possible long-term risks of actions), and
□ Honesty (share knowledge with those concerned truthfully).

The ethics values in Table 1 are socially sensitive and necessary for radiological IHA, if it is to function in accord with contemporary social, philosophical, and medical thinking. The values must be nuanced in their application, as their varying requirements will inevitably conflict with each other and with existing practices. For example, dignity and autonomy are essential for justification, and give rise to a requirement for implicit or explicit consent. In addition, they come into conflict with nonmaleficence (ie, do no harm). The precautionary principle implies looking at the potential for serious harm before it happens, even where the evidence base is incomplete. It has been adopted in the environmental and climate change fields at the highest levels.

WHO places a high value on identification of the right patient, for the right examination, at the right dose. An important part of this is considering the cost of examinations and how they can be best deployed in the health care system. If IHA is to be part of the health care system — and many feel it should be — it must take account of this context. This will require some adjustment to how it functions now. Present reimbursement models might be adjusted to encourage necessary changes, as further discussed below.

IHA leads to false positives and incidental/equivocal findings. The consequences of dealing with these in terms of resources can be significant. This, and its management, is further discussed later in the paper.

### The neoliberal political economy and erosion of retirement security [^1118Afay]. The Gerontologist (2015). Low credibility.

The origins and trajectory of the crisis in the United States retirement security system have slowly become part of the discussion about the social, political, and economic impacts of population aging. Private sources of retirement security have weakened significantly since 1980 as employers have converted defined benefits precisions to defined contribution plans. The Center for Retirement Research (CRR) now estimates that over half of boomer generation retirees will not receive 70–80% of their wages while working. This erosion of the private retirement security system will likely increase reliance on the public system, mainly Social Security and Medicare. These programs, however, have increasingly become the targets of critics who claim that they are not financially sustainable in their current form and must be significantly modified. This article will focus on an analysis of these trends in the erosion of the United States retirement security system and their connection to changes in the United States political economy as neoliberal, promarket ideology, and policies (low taxes, reduced spending, and deregulation) have become dominant in the private and public sectors. The neoliberal priority on reducing labor costs and achieving maximum shareholder value has created an environment inimical to maintain the traditional system of pension and health care benefits in both the private and public sectors. This article explores the implications of these neoliberal trends in the United States economy for the future of retirement security.

### Comparison of access to novel drugs for lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia between India and the United States [^1126w5m5]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

DRUG PRICING IN THE UNITED STATES

The average cost of new drug development is approximately $100 million, and the projected cost for a successful approval is approximately $1 billion, so the prices for marketed drugs are higher. Generic medicines and the biosimilars that enter the system later can help to reduce the cost of the drugs for the consumer. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Hatch-Waxman Act, 1984) has led to accelerated methods for approving generic drugs. However, in some cases, prices for cancer drugs are kept high by pharmaceutical company lobbying, which can also potentially delay the entry of generics into the market. The benchmark for drug reimbursement is set by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Effective January 1, 2017, payment for infusion drugs is based on Section 1847A of the Social Security Act and implies that most of the payments will be based on the average sales price of these drugs. - Accordingly, Medicare pays 106% of the average sales price for most drugs covered under Part B.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116UY7oF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected — 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020 — and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are "cost-effective" without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### The impact of social determinants of health on outcomes of brexucabtagene autoleucel in adults with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116obgjE]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

When investigating impact of insurance, we found that patients with public insurance were more likely to have a complete response (p = 0.03). However, this finding did not translate into differences in OS (p = 0.63) or PFS (p = 0.98). Our study contrasts with literature indicating that patients with public insurance have worse outcomes, possibly due to delays in care and a tendency to present with more advanced disease, which limit treatment options. Additionally, other studies have found that patients with public insurance are less likely to receive CAR T therapy. Interestingly, a large proportion of our cohort were publicly insured (47%), suggesting that insurance type, in and of itself, does not seem to be a primary barrier to receiving this therapy in the US. However, our patients include only those that made it to CAR T infusion, presumably with specialized support from social workers, case managers, and financial advisors embedded within the hospital system and cell therapy program. This finding emphasizes the importance of expanding access and improving affordability of CAR T-cell therapies through better collaboration among the healthcare system including referral base, payers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Greater emphasis should be placed on equity and quality-adjusted life-years gained in the context of a disease with a relatively poor prognosis. Historically disadvantaged patients may fair just as well so long as they are given the opportunity to receive novel therapies.

### Moving east: how the transnational tobacco industry gained entry to the emerging markets of the former soviet union-part II: an overview of priorities and tactics used to establish a manufacturing presence [^111GWtMR]. Tobacco Control (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore how British American Tobacco (BAT), having established cigarette imports, responded to the opportunities for investment in cigarette manufacturing in the former Soviet Union (FSU).

Design

Analysis of documents held at the BAT archive in Guildford, UK.

Results

Considerable priority was attached to investing in the FSU. This led BAT to undertake a major organisational change and to intense competition to acquire assets. BAT used flawed economic arguments to persuade cash starved governments that its investment would reap economic rewards. It offered excise advice that disadvantaged governments while benefiting BAT, confused issues over pricing, and avoided competitive tendering. BAT targeted agriculture ministries, using its expertise in leaf production to differentiate itself from other potential investors. It subverted the principles of corporate social responsibility to promote itself as a business partner. BAT's task was made easier by the naivety of post-Soviet governments and by the international financial organisations' support for rapid economic reform. The latter permitted tobacco transnationals to penetrate markets before effective competitive tendering processes had been established, giving them the opportunity to minimise prices and establish monopolies.

Conclusions

Many of the arguments employed when penetrating post-Soviet markets were highly misleading but governments lacked expertise to realise this. There is a need to build tobacco control capacity in transition economies, within and outside government, to ensure that governments are better informed of the true economic and health impacts of tobacco. Rapid transition from socialist to market economies without establishing regulatory institutional structures may be dangerous when investing companies use business practices that fall short of international standards.
