## Question

Why there is thrombocytosis in case of IDA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why thrombocytosis occurs in iron deficiency anemia and what mechanisms explain it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence that thrombocytosis truly occurs in IDA and how often. Then, I should verify the proposed mechanisms, distinguishing established from speculative. Next, I will examine counterexamples where thrombocytopenia can occur in severe IDA. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and make sure the synthesis aligns with high-quality sources and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical association itself. Multiple large datasets and reviews consistently show that reactive thrombocytosis is common in iron deficiency anemia, with a frequency around one-third of IDA patients and platelet counts that can occasionally reach extreme levels, which supports that this is a real and clinically meaningful phenomenon rather than an anecdotal observation [^dc5b0ced] [^d592abc6] [^ae3aadc0].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic explanations. The most consistently supported mechanism is lineage bias at the megakaryocyte–erythroid progenitor (MEP) stage, where iron deficiency reprograms progenitors toward megakaryocyte differentiation at the expense of erythroid cells, thereby increasing platelet production. Importantly, this appears independent of changes in thrombopoietin, IL-6, or IL-11, which I should explicitly note to avoid overattributing to cytokines [^24967e0c] [^167f4b43].

> Wait, let me verify the role of erythropoietin because it is often cited. Earlier thinking implicated EPO as a driver of thrombocytosis via functional overlap with TPO or marrow stimulation, but more recent data in humans and models suggest EPO is not the principal regulator of IDA-associated thrombocytosis, even though ESA therapy can worsen iron-restricted erythropoiesis and indirectly promote thrombocytosis; I should be careful to separate ESA effects from native IDA biology [^24967e0c] [^f973bf79] [^c548cf36].

> I will now examine platelet phenotype and function, because increased count alone may not fully explain risk. Platelets produced in iron deficiency exhibit larger mean platelet volume and increased aggregability, and iron repletion not only lowers platelet counts but also reduces platelet activation markers such as P-selectin, which strengthens the causal link between iron status and platelet biology [^24967e0c] [^121c7ebc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thrombotic risk without anchoring to data. Observational cohorts show that thrombocytosis in IDA roughly doubles the risk of thrombotic events compared with IDA without thrombocytosis, and case series document venous and arterial thromboses, including cerebral venous thrombosis and ischemic stroke, in the setting of IDA-related thrombocytosis; I should acknowledge that causality is supported by mechanistic and interventional data but remains largely inferential in humans [^dc5b0ced] [^d592abc6] [^7840c5c9].

> But wait, what if the platelet count is low in iron deficiency? I need to ensure I address the counterexample. In severe IDA, particularly in children, thrombocytopenia can occur, sometimes with a subsequent "overshoot" during iron repletion; this likely reflects marrow failure dynamics and consumptive or dysplastic processes in profound deficiency, reminding me that thrombocytosis is the typical reactive pattern, yet exceptions exist [^e35603d8] [^7726e03f].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and treatment response to solidify causality. Iron repletion, especially intravenous iron in selected contexts, consistently normalizes platelet counts and reduces platelet activation in IDA, including in IBD and CKD cohorts, and this reversal occurs independent of ESA use, reinforcing that iron availability directly modulates megakaryopoiesis and platelet phenotype in IDA [^121c7ebc] [^efb1b629] [^bfd60cbd].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the core model. In iron deficiency anemia, reduced iron availability constrains erythroid proliferation and biases MEP differentiation toward megakaryocytes, producing reactive thrombocytosis with larger, more reactive platelets; this phenotype is reversible with iron repletion, and the magnitude of thrombocytosis correlates with the severity of anemia, which aligns with both mechanistic and clinical observations [^24967e0c] [^167f4b43] [^dc5b0ced].

---

Thrombocytosis in iron deficiency anemia is a **reactive process** driven by iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^24967e0c] that shifts megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors toward megakaryocyte differentiation, increasing platelet production [^167f4b43]. This lineage bias is **independent of thrombopoietin** and cytokines like IL-6 or IL-11 [^24967e0c] [^c777d437]. Platelets in IDA are larger and more reactive [^24967e0c], contributing to a prothrombotic state [^d592abc6] that resolves with iron repletion [^121c7ebc] [^dc5b0ced].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie thrombocytosis in IDA:

---

### Lineage bias in hematopoiesis

- **Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) bias**: Iron deficiency alters MEP fate, favoring megakaryocyte differentiation at the expense of erythroid cells, increasing platelet production [^167f4b43].
- **Independent of thrombopoietin**: This bias occurs without increased TPO, IL-6, or IL-11, indicating a direct iron-dependent regulation of lineage commitment [^24967e0c] [^c777d437].

---

### Altered megakaryopoiesis and platelet phenotype

- **Increased megakaryocyte ploidy and size**: Iron deficiency drives larger, more polyploid megakaryocytes, yielding more platelets per megakaryocyte [^24967e0c] [^c777d437].
- **Platelet activation**: Platelets in IDA are larger and more reactive, enhancing aggregation and thrombotic risk [^24967e0c] [^d592abc6].

---

### Hypoxia-induced erythropoietin and vascular effects

While EPO is not the primary driver of thrombocytosis, **anemia-related hypoxia** may indirectly influence platelet production and function, and microcytic, rigid RBCs increase blood viscosity and endothelial shear, further promoting thrombosis [^05def390].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and reviews document **thrombocytosis in IDA**:

- **Prevalence**: Thrombocytosis occurs in ~32.6% of IDA patients, correlating with anemia severity [^dc5b0ced].
- **Resolution with iron therapy**: Platelet counts normalize after iron repletion, confirming a causal link [^121c7ebc] [^dc5b0ced].
- **Extreme thrombocytosis**: Counts > 1000 × 10⁹/L are reported in severe IDA, underscoring the strength of this reactive process [^cc4b3811].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Thrombocytosis in IDA is **not merely a laboratory curiosity**; it carries clinical consequences:

- **Increased thrombotic risk**: IDA with thrombocytosis has a ~2-fold higher thrombosis risk than IDA alone, including venous and arterial events [^dc5b0ced] [^d592abc6].
- **Platelet activation**: Elevated platelet activation and aggregation further augment thrombotic risk [^24967e0c] [^d592abc6].
- **Resolution with treatment**: Iron repletion reverses thrombocytosis and reduces platelet activation, lowering thrombotic risk [^121c7ebc] [^dc5b0ced].

## Summary of mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Lineage bias | Iron deficiency shifts MEPs toward megakaryocytes, increasing platelet production [^167f4b43] |
| Platelet phenotype | Larger, more reactive platelets enhance aggregation and thrombosis [^24967e0c] [^d592abc6] |
| Hypoxia effects | Anemia-related hypoxia and microcytic RBCs increase viscosity and endothelial stress [^05def390] |

---

Thrombocytosis in IDA is a **reactive megakaryocytic expansion** driven by iron-restricted erythropoiesis, producing more and more reactive platelets and increasing thrombotic risk until iron repletion reverses the process [^24967e0c] [^dc5b0ced].

### Study details | Ferinject® in patient with thrombocytosis… [^bfd60cbd]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Study Overview For the first time a platelet abnormality in IBD was reported in 1968, with a description of an increased platelet count in patients having an exacerbation of clinical activity 1. Since then it has been established that thrombocytosis and platelet activation are common features in IBD2. Both features are strongly connected to thromboembolic events, which are a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality
3. In vitro studies have so far shown that spontaneous platelet aggregation is present in more than 30% of IBD patients compared to none of the controls and besides independent of disease severity 4. Unfortunately the mechanisms behind the abnormal megakaryopoiesis are not completely understood. Nevertheless platelets can store and produce a large amount of inflammatory mediators and are activated by multiple proinflammatory substances. Therefore, platelets are regarded as a major target in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases 5.

An increase in systemic cytokine levels such as IL-6 or IL-11 may contribute to enhanced platelet production. Also intestinal bleeding and iron deficiency, which are major symptoms of IBD, may have stimulatory effects on megakaryopoiesis 6. Previously, we observed a normalization of elevated platelet counts in IBD patients with iron deficiency anemia upon treatment with intravenous iron sucrose
7. We therefore believe that iron deficiency is causatively involved in the pathogenesis of thrombocytosis in IBD and intend to investigate the effect of intravenous iron therapy on platelet levels and platelet activation markers in patients with IBD and iron deficiency. Red cell utilization of iron was found to be high. After 24 days, patients with IDA showed a red cell utilization of 91% to 99%. Various studies demonstrated that FERINJECT® could be safely administered at doses of up to 1000mg, which is a significant advantage of FERINJECT® over iron sucrose.

A multiple-dose phase I/II study in patients with IBD investigating the safety, efficacy, and kinetics of repeated doses of FERINJECT® has been completed. Patients who were treated at our unit were also analyzed regarding the effect of VIT45 on platelet counts. Similar to our experience with iron sucrose, we observed a significant drop in thrombocytosis within 8 weeks pointing again to the direct effect of iron on regulating megakaryopoiesis in vivo8.

Figure 1.
Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis among patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Rates of thrombocytosis and thrombosis in a recent large clinical database study of over six million patients, supported by extensive chart review to exclude alternative confounding causes of thrombocytosis and confirm thrombotic events.

The development of a high quality animal model to lend support to the longstanding observation of iron deficiency mediated-thrombocytosis leading to a significantly higher risk of thrombosis is an important advance. Without stratifying for iron deficiency or its successful abatement by intravenous iron, the observation of a marked increment in thromboses in erythropoiesis stimulating agent-treated patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia and anemia associated with both non-dialysis and dialysis- dependent chronic kidney disease led to the near proscription of the use of a treatment which unqualifiedly leads to improvements in energy, activity and quality of life in a cohort with debilitating chronic illness. Despite a litany of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies failing to show harm with the use of erythropoiesis- stimulating agents, especially in cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia, extreme caution with their use remains the order of the day.

A now growing body of inferential evidence supports the use of intravenous iron as the preferred route of administration in most of the described conditions. This new animal model provides evidence that intravenous iron replenishment may have additional advantages in mitigating the thrombogenic potential of iron deficiency. It also suggests that intravenous iron might preferentially provide an important adjunctive therapy to mitigate the hypercoagulability associated with iron-deficiency states comorbid with multiple disorders in humans, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, after bariatric surgery, abnormal uterine bleeding and pregnancy. Given that iron-deficiency anemia affects approximately 20% of the human population at any given point in time, even a modestly increased thrombotic risk imparted by iron deficiency has profound public health implications. Additionally, synergism of multiple thrombotic risk factors is well-documented, raising the specter of a potentially even greater thrombotic impact of this common problem given its frequent comorbidities. Thankfully, additional avenues of investigation to better understand these risks are open, as this animal model also suggests that critical biomarkers can now be explored and can then be correlated with objective in vivo events. Such biomarkers could also include the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, whose target genes include erythropoietin, the transferrin receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor. These targets are also associated with increased thrombogenesis.

### Characterization of the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency anemia [^dc5b0ced]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The association of thrombocytosis with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is well-recognized, but data describing the rate, predictors, and risk of thrombotic complications associated with IDA-related thrombocytosis are limited. We queried an institutional patient data repository containing comprehensive chart data for over 6 million patients to identify IDA patients with and without thrombocytosis and thrombotic events over a 40-year time period (1979 to 2019). Demographics, hematological parameters, thrombosis history, and other medical history were collected. Fidelity of query data was assessed via detailed manual chart review of 700 patients, including confirmation of ferritin and hematologic parameters in addition to temporal and clinical association of thrombocytosis. Our queries identified 36327 cases of IDA of which 15022 had thrombocytosis. Following assessment for data integrity, we observed a thrombocytosis rate of 32.6% in patients with IDA. The rate of thrombosis was calculated to be 7.8% in patients with IDA and 15.8% in patients with IDA and thrombocytosis. Platelet mass index at time of peak thrombocytosis was significantly higher than at baseline and was strongly negatively correlated with hemoglobin at peak thrombocytosis. A multivariable model demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between decreasing hemoglobin and increasing platelet count at peak thrombocytosis. In conclusion, we observed reactive thrombocytosis in one-third of IDA patients, and a 2-fold thrombosis risk in patients with IDA and thrombocytosis compared with patients with IDA alone. Given the global burden of untreated and undertreated IDA, adequate IDA treatment may reduce thrombotic complications and associated morbidity and mortality.

### Thrombosis with erythropoietic stimulating agents-does iron-deficient erythropoiesis play a role? [^f973bf79]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is common in iron deficiency and resolves following iron repletion. Increased platelet number, whether from iron deficiency or from other causes, may increase the risk of thrombovascular events. One mechanism thought to mediate iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis is increased erythropoietin production. Similarly, erythropoietic stimulating agents (ESA) have long been known to increase platelet number and frequently lead to functional or absolute iron deficiency. This state of relative or absolute iron deficiency may be the mechanism whereby ESA increase the platelet count. If correct, co-administration of iron should prevent or diminish ESA-driven thrombocytosis. Data from the DRIVE trial in hemodialysis patients do, in fact, suggest that this is the case. Platelet counts in patients receiving IV iron decreased, while they remained unchanged in patients not given iron (mean change -29,000/microl vs. -0/microl; p = 0.017). Other supporting data have been observed in IV iron trials in oncology patients. The harm from higher hemoglobin targets and higher ESA doses may be mediated in part through induction of iron deficiency and thrombocytosis. The major anemia trials of ESAs have not reported platelet data, but should examine the relationship of platelet count, iron deficiency, IV iron administration, and cardiovascular events in greater detail.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^15bb66cc]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but more importantly on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

### Iron and platelets: a subtle, under-recognized relationship [^85d4288d]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of iron in the formation and functioning of erythrocytes, and to a lesser degree of white blood cells, is well established, but the relationship between iron and platelets is less documented. Physiologically, iron plays an important role in hematopoiesis, including thrombopoiesis; iron levels direct, together with genetic factors, the lineage commitment of megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors toward either megakaryocyte or erythroid progenitors. Megakaryocytic iron contributes to cellular machinery, especially energy production in platelet mitochondria. Thrombocytosis, possibly favoring vascular thrombosis, is a classical feature observed with abnormally low total body iron stores (mainly due to blood losses or decreased duodenal iron intake), but thrombocytopenia can also occur in severe iron deficiency anemia. Iron sequestration, as seen in inflammatory conditions, can be associated with early thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption and followed by reactive replenishment of the platelet pool with possibility of thrombocytosis. Iron overload of genetic origin (hemochromatosis), despite expected mitochondrial damage related to ferroptosis, has not been reported to cause thrombocytopenia (except in case of high degree of hepatic fibrosis), and iron-related alteration of platelet function is still a matter of debate. In acquired iron overload (of transfusional and/or dyserythropoiesis origin), quantitative or qualitative platelet changes are difficult to attribute to iron alone due to the interference of the underlying hematological conditions; likewise, hematological improvement, including increased blood platelet counts, observed under iron oral chelation is likely to reflect mechanisms other than the sole beneficial impact of iron depletion.

### Iron metabolism, iron deficiency, thrombocytosis, and the cardiorenal anemia syndrome [^8733836a]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

In treating moderate to severe anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), oral iron is effective only in a minority of nondialysis patients. Intravenous iron is more effective and can raise levels of hemoglobin even without the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Unfortunately, the current assays of iron status that are presently widely available are not especially helpful in predicting response. In patients on dialysis, i.v. iron is effective over a wide range of serum ferritin from < 100 ng/ml to 800 ng/ml. None of the three available randomized controlled trials comparing oral with i.v. iron showed evidence of nephrotoxicity caused by i.v. iron. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for thrombocytosis and should, wherever possible, be avoided. Optimal coadministration of iron may reduce the risk for ESA-driven cardiovascular events. Increased total body iron stores (imperfectly reflected by serum ferritin levels in CKD) do not appear to be related to such events or hospitalization in CKD; it is unclear what other risk factors and mechanisms need to be considered. In the appreciable proportion of patients with both renal and cardiac dysfunction, management is further complicated by a vicious circle (which can be characterized as cardiorenal anemia syndrome) in which CKD, heart failure, and anemia exacerbate each other. In such patients, correction of anemia appears to improve cardiac function and quality of life without a greater risk for adverse events.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^d592abc6]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Further corroborating evidence pointing to iron-restricted erythropoiesis resulting in reactive thrombocytosis and thrombosis was derived from a recently published study describing the rate, predictors, and thrombotic complications of thrombocytosis in patients with irondeficiency anemia. Utilizing queries of an institutional database containing clinical information on more than six million patients over a 40-year time period (1979–2019), supported by extensive manual chart reviews, thrombocytosis was observed in 32.6% of patients with iron-deficiency anemia, in whom 15.8% developed thrombotic complications. In contrast, thromboses occurred in 7.8% of those with iron deficiency but without thrombocytosis (Figure 1).

The etiological explanation for why iron-restricted erythropoiesis increases hypercoagulability has remained somewhat obscure. In this issue of Haematologica, Jimenez and colleagues describe an animal model of iron deficiency, using Sprague-Dawley rats, which could offer unique opportunities to explore multiple pathophysiological mechanisms for thrombocytosis and venous thrombogenesis. Furthermore, using sensitive histological and sophisticated high-frequency ultrasound techniques, the investigators were able to track the development and progression of thrombus formation. They were then able to correlate those changes with the generation of ex vivo biomarkers of platelet activation and indicators of global hemostasis. The potential use of this rat model to detect important targets that could be exploited therapeutically to mitigate the association of iron deficiency with thrombocytosis and thromboembolism is promising and encouraging.

In their elegant description of iron deficiency-induced augmentation of coagulability on thromboelastography and hemostasis following rat tail resection, prominent correlates of increased platelet adhesion and aggregation were clearly described. Using in vitro assays of platelet aggregation, the authors were able to postulate that not only is platelet activation an ongoing process in inflammatory conditions but in iron deficiency as well. Importantly, given the frequent comorbidity of iron deficiency with a number of clinical conditions with known thrombotic risk such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, this animal model clearly demonstrates that iron deficiency alone increases thrombotic tendency, consistent with the findings of aforementioned human studies. Perhaps even more importantly, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose (an intravenous iron formulation) reversed the prothrombotic changes in the rats, including thrombocytosis, changes in platelet function, and iron deficiency- associated increases in thrombus size in both venous and arterial models of thrombosis.

### Severe thrombocytopenia with iron deficiency anemia [^e35603d8]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Although severe thrombocytopenia has been reported among children with iron deficiency anemia, the presence of both anemia and thrombocytopenia can suggest serious or malignant bone marrow dysfunction, requiring further work-up. This paper reviews the management and outcomes of patients with the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia presenting with severe thrombocytopenia. The authors present 4 pediatric patients with iron deficiency anemia and severe thrombocytopenia at initial presentation. Charts were reviewed after approval by the institutional review boards at both St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and LeBonheur Children's Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee. All 4 patients' hemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts normalized within 1 to 3 weeks of initiating iron supplementation, suggesting that in such patients iron supplementation can obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. In addition, these patients all had a platelet "overshoot" phenomenon during iron therapy prior to normalization of platelet counts, the mechanism of which is still unknown. The literature exploring the mechanism behind the current clinical findings is reviewed.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^81dd9227]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In 1999, Loo and Beguin examined the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin on megakaryopoiesis, noting that iron-replete and iron-overloaded rats treated with recombinant human erythropoietin demonstrated a one-third decreased duration of thrombocytosis compared with normal rats. The putative explanation given for the increased duration in the normal rats was erythropoietin-induced, iron-deficient erythropoiesis. This provocative hypothesis was subsequently supported by the findings of a post-hoc analysisof a large prospective study of oral versus intravenous or no iron as adjunctive therapy for erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-treated patients with cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia. This study demonstrated that intravenous, but not oral, iron repletion resulted in marked improvements in hemoglobin and hematopoietic responses and also re-demonstrated the known associations of increased thromboses and thrombocytosis among patients with cancer receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Of 187 patients treated with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, 19 developed 29 venous thromboembolic events and those with platelet counts greater than 350,000 per microliter were three times more likely to develop venous thromboembolism. Notably, there was a reduced incidence of thrombocytosis and thrombotic complications in those treated with intravenous iron compared with those who were not.

### Marked reactive thrombocytosis in a female with iron deficiency anaemia [^a7af0142]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This case report presents the clinical evaluation and management of a female patient from a rural background who presented with leg pain, headache, weakness and irritability. Initial investigations revealed iron deficiency anaemia accompanied by a significantly elevated platelet count, prompting suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder. However, subsequent genetic testing ruled out these mutations, suggesting a reactive response to iron deficiency anaemia rather than an independent neoplastic process. Treatment was focused on addressing the underlying iron deficiency anaemia, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's blood profile and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up assessments demonstrated a complete normalisation of the blood profile and platelet counts, further supporting the efficacy of the treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive thrombocytosis in the context of iron deficiency anaemia and emphasises the favourable response achieved through appropriate management strategies.

### An unusual case of extreme thrombocytosis caused by iron deficiency [^cc4b3811]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis resulting in usually mild to moderately increased but sometimes even in extreme thrombocytosis (ie, > 1000×10⁹/L). We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who developed an increased platelet count of 1953×10 9 /L. Upon admission, cytoreductive therapy was initiated until an underlying chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia was ruled out. The patient had undergone bariatric surgery 5 years previously, and surprisingly, a diagnosis of reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency secondary to iron malabsorption was made. It is concluded that the degree of extreme thrombocytosis may be even fourfold to fivefold increased in patients with severe iron deficiency. Our finding emphasises the importance of regular control of possible need for iron supplementation following bariatric surgery.

### Iron deficiency alters megakaryopoiesis and platelet phenotype independent of thrombopoietin [^24967e0c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis, however, the exact pathways have not been revealed. Here we aimed to study the mechanisms behind iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis. Within few weeks, iron-depleted diet caused iron deficiency in young Sprague-Dawley rats, as reflected by a drop in hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, hepatic iron content and hepcidin mRNA in the liver. Thrombocytosis established in parallel. Moreover, platelets produced in iron deficient animals displayed a higher mean platelet volume and increased aggregation. Bone marrow studies revealed subtle alterations that are suggestive of expansion of megakaryocyte progenitors, an increase in megakaryocyte ploidy and accelerated megakaryocyte differentiation. Iron deficiency did not alter the production of hematopoietic growth factors such as thrombopoietin, interleukin 6 or interleukin 11. Megakaryocytic cell lines grown in iron-depleted conditions exhibited reduced proliferation but increased ploidy and cell size. Our data suggest that iron deficiency increases megakaryopoietic differentiation and alters platelet phenotype without changes in megakaryocyte growth factors, specifically TPO. Iron deficiency-induced thrombocytosis may have evolved to maintain or increase the coagulation capacity in conditions with chronic bleeding.

### Increased expression of HIF2 α during iron deficiency-associated megakaryocytic differentiation [^c777d437]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play a fundamental role in hemostasis and thrombosis and an emerging role in inflammation and cancer biology. Platelet production occurs at a rate of 10 11 platelets daily and may increase up to 20‐fold in response to high demand 1. Reactive thrombocytosis occurs in response to infection, tissue damage as occurs during surgery, chronic inflammation, malignancy, and post splenectomy 2 and is by far more common than primary thrombocytosis. Another well‐known cause of reactive thrombocytosis is iron deficiency (ID) 3, 4, 5, 6. While the elevation of platelet count is usually mild to moderate in ID (~ 500 × 10⁹ L⁻¹), platelet counts reaching 1000 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ have been reported 3, 4.

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully elucidated; however, animal models of ID―including a diet‐induced ID model established by our group―show that ID alone leads to increased platelet count 7, 8, 9. This is accompanied by changes in megakaryopoiesis, such as enhanced progenitor expansion, increased megakaryocyte (MEG) ploidy, and overall augmented MEG differentiation. Furthermore, platelets produced in ID had higher aggregability 9, suggesting that elevated platelet count in ID may not be entirely risk free. There are numerous case reports linking ID‐related thrombocytosis and thrombosis 10 and several case–control studies showing that ID is more common in patients with a cerebrovascular insult in comparison to controls 11, 12, 13.

Anemia is a common complication in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (6.5–73.7%) 14 and in cancer (30–90%) 15; in both cases, ID appears to be the predominant cause 14, 15, 16, 17. Thrombocytosis is not uncommon in either condition 18, 19, and both cancer and IBD patients have increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) 20, 21, 22, 23, for which, in the case of cancer, high platelet count is an independent risk factor 20, 21. Iron replacement therapy in patients with IBD and ID anemia normalizes platelet count and reduces platelet activity 24, 25. While it is unclear if this affects risk for thromboembolic events in the long term, anemic cancer patients have a diminished incidence of VTE if erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents are administered with intravenous iron 26 as opposed to no‐iron therapy. This suggests that ID‐related thrombocytosis may be of relevance in the clinical setting as well.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^39d6fc0f]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are the classical BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These blood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with constitutively activated physiologic signal-transduction pathways. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, bone marrow erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, fatigue, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly. Complications of PV include a significantly increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (41%) and the potential for evolution to MF (10–20%) and MPN-blast phase (3–10%), significantly reducing survival. Most patients with PV present with iron deficiency at diagnosis, even prior to the onset of therapeutic phlebotomy, the mainstay of treatment. Iron deficiency is often exacerbated by repeated phlebotomies, a desired effect thought to limit the accelerated erythropoiesis by restricting a necessary component of hemoglobin synthesis. This can lead to symptoms such as cognitive impairment and fatigue, even in the absence of anemia. Recent studies demonstrate that available therapies might improve PV-related symptoms in part by reversing iron deficiency. The genesis of iron deficiency in PV and its effect on disease manifestations and natural history have been explored to a limited extent. In this review, we focus on what is known about iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in PV. In addition, we build on recent advances in understanding the regulation of iron metabolism to enhance our understanding of PV pathophysiology and ultimately propose alternative therapeutic options.

### Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients independent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use: a retrospective cohort study [^ef7dab7e]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study implies that intravenous iron is associated with reduction in platelet counts independent of ESA use. However, without a control group not receiving IV iron, causation cannot be confirmed. Adequately powered studies are needed to establish an association between thrombocytosis, iron deficiency and thromboembolic events in ND CKD patients.

### Iron deficiency generates secondary thrombocytosis and platelet activation in IBD: the randomized, controlled thromboVIT trial [^121c7ebc]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary thrombocytosis is a common clinical feature. In patients with cancer, it is a risk factor for venous thromboembolic events. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), thrombocytosis is so far considered a marker of active disease and may contribute to the increased thromboembolic risk in this population. Observed effects of iron therapy on normalization of platelet counts led us to hypothesize that iron itself may regulate megakaryopoiesis. Here, we want to test the effect of iron replacement on platelet count and activity in IBD-associated thrombocytosis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L). Changes in platelet counts, hemoglobin, iron parameters, disease activity, megakaryopoietic growth factors, erythropoietin, and platelet activity were assessed. Patients received placebo or up to 1500 mg iron as FCM. Endpoints were evaluated at week 6.

Results

A total of 26 patients were included in the study, 15 patients were available for the per protocol analysis. A drop in platelets > 25% (primary endpoint) was observed in 4 of 8 (50%, iron group) and 1 of 7 patients (14%, placebo group, P = 0.143). Mean platelet counts dropped on FCM but not on placebo (536 G/L to 411 G/L versus 580 G/L to 559 G/L; P = 0.002). Disease activity and megakaryopoietic growth factors remained unchanged and hemoglobin and iron parameters increased on FCM. The normalization of platelet counts was associated with a decrease in platelet aggregation and P-selectin expression.

Conclusion

FCM lowers platelet counts and platelet activation in patients with IBD-associated secondary thrombocytosis.

### Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients independent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use: a retrospective cohort study [^e44e5110]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Secondary thrombocytosis is associated with many conditions, including acute or chronic inflammation, hyposplenism, and iron deficiency. Although generally regarded as a benign condition, secondary thrombocytosis has been identified as an independent risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer. Similarly, iron deficiency with and without thrombocytosis has been linked to venous thrombosis and stroke. Thus, it is biologically plausible that reactive thrombocytosis, induced by ESA or the resulting iron depletion, may have contributed to the higher-than-expected rates of cerebrovascular accidents and thrombotic events reported in clinical trials of ESA in CKD patients (e.g. the cardiovascular risk reduction by early anemia treatment with epoetin beta [CREATE] trial, a trial of end-stage renal disease patients that compared the effects of normal as compared with low hematocrit values in patients with cardiac disease who were receiving hemodialysis and epoetin, and a trial to reduce cardiovascular events with Aranesp therapy [TREAT]) as postulated by Streja et al. In their retrospective analysis of more than 40 000 hemodialysis patients, Streja et al. noted relative thrombocytosis in 15% (defined as platelet count > 300 000 ± 109 000/L), and this was associated with a 30% greater weekly dose of ESA, lower TSAT, and lower serum ferritin concentration. This pattern is reflective of functional iron deficiency at the bone marrow level.

Coagulation defect

The bleeding risk, and subsequently the risk of developing IDA, is also increased by coagulation defects, usually associated with CLD. There is impaired synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and X, inhibitors of these factors, thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function, increased fibrinolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Although usually a "rebalance" in hemostasis can be observed, in some cases a bleeding tendency that facilitates the development of IDA may occur, significantly increasing both morbidity and mortality.

### Critical role of iron in epoetin alfa treatment of chemotherapy-associated anemia [^7ee0fa37]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Underuse of intravenous iron may have contributed to the higher rate of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) in the EPO group. EPO can cause functional iron deficiency. Failure to use intravenous iron when administering EPO results in an increased rate of nonresponders and a requirement for higher doses of EPO. Iron deficiency as well as functional iron deficiency is associated with thrombocytosis and increased rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. Higher target hemoglobin levels are also associated with an increased risk of TVE. Red cell transfusion is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. All patients in the EPO group were treated with EPO to a target hemoglobin of 12 g/dL. Had the BSC group been treated with transfusion to the same hemoglobin target, a higher percentage of patients would have been exposed to the thrombotic risk of red cell transfusion. Risk of TVE in the BSC group is underestimated because a lower target hemoglobin was used. In this study, we think the target hemoglobin in the EPO and BSC groups should have been the same to compare TVE as an adverse outcome in the two groups.

We disagree with the authors' conclusions that RBC transfusion should be the preferred approach for the management of anemia during first- or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. This recommendation does not take into account the risks of allogeneic red cell transfusion that may be missed in a small study. The independent review committee–determined primary outcome of progression-free survival met the study criteria of noninferiority. Finally, the difference in TVE as a secondary outcome is likely explained by the higher target hemoglobin in the EPO group, combined with suboptimal iron replacement and EPO-induced functional iron deficiency.

### Association between thrombocytosis and iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease [^52186dc0]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombocytosis and iron deficiency anemia are frequent complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytosis in IBD patients.

Methods

A total of 198 consecutive IBD patients and 102 healthy controls participated in the study. The parameters investigated were: platelets (PLT), mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, plateletcrit, hematocrit (HCT) levels, hemoglobulin (Hb) levels, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), ferritin levels, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels, the sTfR-F index (sTfR-F = sTfR/log10 ferritin), and vitamin B12 and folate levels. Thrombocytosis was defined as an absolute number of PLT greater than 400k/μl. Disease activity indices (Crohn's Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index for ulcerative colitis) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) were also correlated with the study parameters.

Results

The IBD patients demonstrated decreased HCT levels, Hb levels, MCV, mean platelet volume, and ferritin levels and an increased absolute PLT count, RDW, platelet distribution width, plateletcrit, sTfR and sTfR-F index (P < 0.0001) compared with healthy controls. Twenty-seven patients exhibited thrombocytosis (13.6%). The median value for PLT (interquartile range) was 289 (228–355)k/μl, for Hb levels was 13.4 (12.0–14.7) g/dl, for ferritin levels was 36.6 (19.7–80.7) ng/ml, and for sTfR-F was 0.82 (0.61–1.37) mg/l. The PLT in IBD patients correlated with HCT levels, Hb levels, MCV, RDW, Fe levels, ferritin levels, sTfR, sTfR-F, CRP levels, Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (Spearman's ρ correlation). In the multivariate analysis, only Hb levels, RDW, CRP levels, ferritin levels, and sTfR-F remained significant (P < 0.05). None of the aforementioned was observed in the control group.

Conclusion

The absolute PLT count seems to correlate with iron deficiency anemia parameters and disease activity in IBD patients. Controlling the inflammation and managing iron deficiency could lead to reversal of thrombocytosis in IBD patients.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^ce2d402e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Full blood count

The approach begins with the full blood count (FBC). Hb determination is the most widespread screening method for IDA and the World Health Organization places the lower limit of normal for Hb concentration at 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, below 11 g/dL in pregnant women and 13 g/dL for men. However, FBC has many limitations when used alone, because of its low specificity and sensitivity. For that reason, in the diagnostic workup of anemia, erythrocyte parameters such as MCV, MCH and RDW are measured and evaluated in combination with Hb. For example hypochromia and microcytosis combined with low ferritin makes the diagnosis of IDA fairly easy, but in patients with cirrhosis MCV is increased because of vitamin deficits and membrane deposition of lipoproteins. In a cross-sectional study of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis Intragumtornchai et al found that 48% of patients with ID, proved by bone marrow aspiration, had an MCV greater than 100 fL.

Another parameter of erythrocytes that is often used together with the MCV results is the RDW, which depicts the variation of red blood cell width. Unfortunately, this tool is also not useful in cirrhotic patients, as was shown by a retrospective study of 241 patients with liver cirrhosis and anemia. In this study Milic et al did not manage to prove any clinical value of RDW in the differentiation of anemia, or any statistically significant increase of RDW in relation to the severity of the disease.

Likewise, the thrombocytosis that exists in both IDA and anemia of inflammatory conditions, due to the effect of erythropoietin and interleukin-6 on megakaryocytes, is not seen in patients with CLD and portal hypertension because of spleen sequestration.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients independent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use: a retrospective cohort study [^efb1b629]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Megakaryopoiesis is regulated by various cytokines. The pathophysiologic mechanism behind reactive thrombocytosis in iron deficiency is complex and incompletely understood. Akan et al. demonstrated that the correction of iron deficiency anemia and resolution of thrombocytosis do not alter cytokine levels that are typically elevated in reactive thrombocytosis (IL-6, IL-11, and thrombopoietin). Although the levels of endogenous erythropoietin significantly decreased during correction of iron deficiency, the same response was observed in those with and without thrombocytosis, indicating that erythropoietin is not the principal regulator of thrombocytosis.

Studies of intravenous iron undertaken in predialysis chronic renal failure that evaluated hematologic parameters have not reported the effect on platelet counts. This observational study evaluated the effect of intravenous LMWID on platelet counts in iron deficient anemic ND-CKD patients with and without concomitant ESA use. We also evaluated the relationship between baseline platelets and iron storage parameters, as well as the relationship between changes in iron storage parameters and platelets. In response to iron administration, a statistically significant decrease occurred in platelet counts of about 50 000/mm 3, suggesting a mechanistic link between iron deficiency and platelet counts in patients with ND-CKD. The effect of iron repletion on platelet count was observed in those who did and did not receive ESAs suggesting that the effect of iron repletion on platelet counts is independent of ESA use.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^573be17a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic liver disease (CLD) of any cause is frequently associated with hematological abnormalities. Among these, anemia is a frequent occurrence, seen in about 75% of patients with advanced liver disease. The etiology of anemia, especially in cirrhotic patients, is complex and multifactorial.

The liver performs a major role in iron homeostasis. It is the main organ for the production of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, expressed in iron excess conditions as well as in cases of inflammation, blocking the absorption of iron from the enterocytes. The role of hepcidin in liver diseases, with or without cirrhosis, is still under investigation, but is probably one of the contributing factors to the anemia of chronic disease present in a variety of liver conditions.

Hemolysis also represents a common cause of anemia in patients with liver disease, especially of alcoholic cause, and is usually attributed to spur-cell anemia. It is related to abnormal cholesterol loading of the red blood cell membrane, which results in spiculated erythrocytes with a short lifespan, called acanthocytes.

In patients with chronic hepatitis C, the standard of care until recently, namely treatment with pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, can also cause significant anemia. Interferon treatment has been associated with bone marrow toxicity, while ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia is a well-recognized, dose-dependent side effect of the drug.

Anemia in alcoholic liver disease is also associated with a direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow, causing reversible suppression of hematopoiesis and subsequently anemia with impaired platelet production and function. Moreover, the majority of the patients with chronic alcohol abuse also present with malnutrition, resulting in iron, folate, vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency.

One of the major, and potentially treatable, causes of anemia in patients with liver cirrhosis is acute or chronic blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract, often resulting in iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The hemorrhage is usually secondary to complications of portal hypertension such as gastroesophageal variceal rupture, gastropathy, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) or peptic ulcers, more common in patients with cirrhosis. The fact that patients with liver disease have also had impaired coagulation is a contributing factor to the tendency of bleeding, as well as the thrombocytopenia due to spleen enlargement.

### Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients independent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use: a retrospective cohort study [^3e60c257]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. Its retrospective nature makes it subject to selection and information bias. Selection bias was constrained by including all patients within the prespecified dates; however, some patients were excluded because of a lack of follow-up or intercurrent events. Moreover, given the retrospective design, patients with undocumented intercurrent events in our records such as gastrointestinal bleed, infection and surgery may have been included in the study and caused bias in the point estimate of the correlation. However, an uncertainty analysis that was performed with the exclusion of those who did not have any improvement in their TSAT yielded similar results. Additionally, by design, we could not fully control information bias; however, any observer bias was limited by data abstraction from the anemia management database. This study suggests that iron replacement is associated with reduction in platelet counts in iron deficient ND-CKD patients independent of ESA use and extends the observation of Eschbach's study, where it was noted that almost half of their 333 study patients developed iron deficiency with platelet counts increasing following erythropoietin administration to anemic end-stage renal disease patients. Aggressive iron therapy reversed this increase in platelets.

Another limitation was the absence of data regarding inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and for this reason, we could not adjust for the effect of inflammatory status, if any, on platelet count change. Furthermore, the majority of our patients did not have thrombocytosis (median = 284 000, interquartile range = 236–359). The decrease in platelet count following LMWID could only be extrapolated to patients within the specified platelet count range in our cohort. Whether iron administration could induce a more pronounced change in platelet count in iron deficient patients with thrombocytosis warrants further investigation.

### Profound anaemia and thrombocytosis due to hidradenitis suppurativa [^597c1868]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

It is known that HS is significantly associated with an increased diagnosis of anaemia. However, the studies that have explored the aetiologies of the anaemia showed unclear results.HS has been linked to increased odds of chronic inflammatory anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia. In our case, the aetiology of the anaemia was likely a combination of chronic inflammation and iron deficiency. The patient's haemoglobin nearly normalised after iron infusion and treatment of her HS. In fact, HS is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to an increase in hepcidin. The increase in this hormone level suppresses iron release from ferritin stores, resulting in microcytic anaemia of chronic disease. In contrast, hepcidin levels are low in iron deficiency anaemia. Even though the aetiology behind the anaemia in patients with HS could be unclear, the treatment of both conditions is advised, as it was found that patients with both HS and anaemia tended to have a longer length of stay and higher cost of care when admitted for management of HS. In conclusion, there is a well-documented association between HS and anaemia, particularly iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease. Screening for anaemia in patients with HS is crucial, and treatment should address both the underlying iron deficiency and the chronic inflammation associated with HS.

### Iron status influences the response of cord blood megakaryocyte progenitors to eltrombopag in vitro [^167f4b43]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

In clinical trials, these concentrations typically raise platelet counts, and studies so far have not shown any evidence of dose-dependent negative effects of ELT on megakaryopoiesis. This may reflect the fact that the highest doses of ELT are frequently used in patients with aplastic anemia, who are typically iron overloaded as a result of chronic red cell transfusions and likely benefit from the iron-chelating effects of ELT without becoming iron-depletedand from the iron chelation-induced increased numbers of HSCs. Patients with ITP, in contrast, usually respond to lower doses, which effectively stimulate megakaryopoiesis.

Iron deficiency, which is highly prevalent among children and women of childbearing age in low-income settings, is most commonly associated with thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytopenia. In a recent study using genetic and dietary murine models of iron deficiency that develop anemia and thrombocytosis, Xavier-Ferrucio et al found that iron deficiency in the bone marrow environment induced decreased proliferation of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) accompanied by a bias of these MEPs toward the MK lineage at the expense of bipotent or erythroid-committed progenitors. This MK commitment bias was secondary to a MEP molecular reprogramming characterized by decreased ERK signaling, downregulation of MAPK/ERK target genes, and altered metabolic pathways such as asparagine and cholesterol biosynthesis and b-alanine degradation. Consistent with reports that vascular endothelial growth factor is elevated in iron deficiency, the investigators also showed that vascular endothelial growth factor stimulation decreased phospho-ERK in murine MEPs to levels similar to those seen in their models. Taken together, these findings suggested that low iron in the bone marrow environment affects MEP metabolism, slows proliferation, causes lower ERK phosphorylation, and biases cell commitment toward the MK lineage. Of note, this molecular reprogramming seems to occur in vivo in response to signals from an iron-deficient bone marrow environment because decreasing the iron content in the culture medium in vitro markedly impaired MEP survival without reproducing the MK bias, similar to our findings. Prior studies also demonstrated that the thrombocytosis observed in iron-deficiency anemia is independent of TPO and its receptor.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^91cea4a5]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DISCUSSION

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a common cause of referral to the hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological point of view, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on the true hematological disease), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious (Table 1). As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, it is widely accepted in common clinical practice to search, at first, for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on the present and past illness and recent surgical intervention (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). In addition, a comprehensive and updated list of current medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted (thrombocytosis caused by administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin mimicking drugs).

Iron deficiency anemia with or without thrombocytosis

The second possible contributor to thrombotic events in CD is iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with or without concomitant thrombocytosis. However, its mechanism of action is still unknown. The reactive thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency is generally considered benign. However, it was shown that reactive thrombocytosis can cause prothrombotic states that may lead to severe and even fatal complications. A rare case of simultaneous thrombosis of a cerebral artery and cerebral venous sinus was reported by Ho et al. in a young female patient with iron deficiency anemia. However, the patient had a uterine myoma causing her iron deficiency in addition to cryoglobulinemia and acquired protein C and S deficiency caused by previous therapy with warfarin.

Hartfield et al. reported a series of six children with ischemic strokes and venous thrombosis in whom iron deficiency anemia (6 of 6) and thrombocytosis (4 of 6) were the only positive laboratory findings in common.

Two cases of multiple peripheral and pulmonary thromboembolisms and cerebrovascular thrombosis were described in the literature, both cases were attributed to reactive thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency anemia. A review of the published literature on thrombosis and thrombocytosis associated with iron deficiency anemia was conducted by Keung et al. 26 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis and ischemic infarcts (12 pediatric and 14 adult cases) were identified and the cause of IDA was reported.

Central nervous system vasculitis associated with CD

The third incriminated factor contributing to a hypercoagulable state in CD is the presence of serum autoantibodies and central nervous system vasculitis in CD patients. Lerner and his colleagues conducted a study to investigate the thrombophilic complex of serum autoantibodies in celiac disease. They studied the two thrombogenic antibodies: antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) and antiprothrombin. An increased incidence of antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin aPS/PT IgG was detected in the CD group compared to the control group. Moreover, patients with CD were found to have higher activity rates for aPS/PT IgM and prothrombin IgG autoantibodies compared to the control group. Therefore, thrombophilic serum autoantibodies are operative in CD and are a significant contributor to the hypercoagulability tendency of the disease.

### Iron repletion is associated with reduction in platelet counts in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients independent of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use: a retrospective cohort study [^c548cf36]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombocytosis may be the result of a clonal disorder or secondary to a reactive process such as acute or chronic inflammation, hyposplenism, malignancy, or iron deficiency. The mechanism of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency related anemia is not completely understood. Thrombocytopoiesis is orchestrated by a complex interplay between growth factors and cytokines. Thrombopoietin is the primary growth factor and regulator of megakaryopoiesis; however, several other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-3, IL-6, IL-11 and tumor necrosis factor are involved in this process. Erythropoietin shares some structural features with thrombopoietin and may exhibit synergistic effect on platelet production. However, the small degree of functional overlap is not mediated by cross-reactivity at the level of mpl receptor expressed on the surface of megakaryocytes. Treatment with exogenous erythropoietin may increase platelet count. It may be that the mechanism of synergy is mediated through the expression of erythropoietin receptors on megakaryocyte progenitors. It has also been suggested that the mechanism by which erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) increase platelet count may be through the induction of a state of functional iron deficiency. Some have suggested that reactive thrombocytosis, induced by ESA or the resulting iron depletion, may have contributed to the higher-than-expected rates of cerebrovascular accidents and thrombotic events reported in clinical trials of ESA in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. At the Henry Ford Hospital Chronic Kidney Disease Clinic, low molecular weight iron dextran (LMWID) in conjunction with ESA is used for non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) anemia management using a computerized algorithm for dosing. We undertook the present study to evaluate the temporal effect of intravenous iron administration on platelet counts in iron deficient ND-CKD patients and determine if the effect is dependent on concurrent ESA administration.

### Clinical significance of reactive thrombocytosis in the course of acute pancreatitis [^8c26c25e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to their well-known functions of hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets have been reported to play a proinflammatory role. The enhancement of inflammation by platelet activation has been previously described in models of systemic inflammation, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In particular, the mean platelet volume (MPV), a parameter of platelet activation, has been shown to reflect the inflammatory burden and disease activity in inflammatory diseases, such as gastrointestinal diseases with inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis; metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity and starvation; infection; thyroid diseases; and cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, tissue damage and the release of inflammatory mediators resulting from the onset and progression of AP have been reported to result in platelet activation and influence MPV. These reactions consume platelets, but in less severe cases, the platelet count is maintained at a constant level by hyperplasia in the bone marrow. In more severe cases, platelet count is shown to be decreased and correlates negatively with CRP concentration. On the other hand, it is known that a pro-inflammatory state mediated by cytokines, particularly promotion of thrombus formation by IL-6, can lead to reactive platelet proliferation. Reactive thrombocytosis occurs secondary to systemic infections, inflammatory conditions, bleeding, iron deficiency anemia and tumors, and reactive thrombocytosis in SAP has been reported. However, there are few clinical reports of this process, which causes systemic inflammation, in AP. The prevalence, characteristics, timing and impact of thrombocytosis in AP are not well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of reactive thrombocytosis during hospitalization for AP.

### Central retinal vein occlusion secondary to severe iron-deficiency anaemia resulting from a plant-based diet and menorrhagia: a case presentation [^05def390]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

CRVO secondary to IDA has previously been reported in the literature, but this is the first case with use of anti-VEGF in such a setting.

A variety of underlying mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the thrombotic events in IDA including a direct process of reactive thrombocytosis, and other mechanisms following the principles of Virchow's triad mainly endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. Iron functions to regulate platelet numbers and function by inhibiting thrombopoiesis. In a state of iron-deficiency, there is a reactive thrombocytosis, thus leading to hypercoagulability. Red cell deformability is reduced in microcytic iron-deficient cells, resulting in an increased viscosity and furthermore contributing to the hypercoagulable state. It has been hypothesized that anemic hypoxic injury to the retino-choroidal circulation causes endothelial cell dysfunction and a weaker anti-oxidant defence in the IDA state, results in increased platelet aggregation.

Visual loss from CRVO is commonly secondary to macular oedema and treatment with IVI anti-VEGF with strong evidence backing the practice. However, from our literature review, this is the first instance that anti-VEGF has been used in the context of macular oedema secondary to IDA-induced CRVO.

Dietary and lifestyle factors can affect the retina health and this has investigated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) studies. The AREDS and AREDS2 studies found a supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin to be helpful in reducing the risk of developing advanced AMD in the high-risk group. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids abundant in dark leafy vegetables. Further studies have found that people with high intake of vegetables had a lower risk for AMD compared to those with low intakes. Studies have also shown the converse of high meat intake increasing the risk of AMD.

We conducted logistic regression and survival analyses in a retrospective cohort of long-term hemodialysis patients to examine the hypothesis that the induced iron depletion with resultant relative thrombocytosis may be a possible contributor to the link between the high rHuEPO dose-associated hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL or greater and mortality.

Setting & Participants

The national database of a large dialysis organization (DaVita) with 40,787 long-term hemodialysis patients during July to December 2001 and their survival up to July 2004 were examined.

Predictors

Hemoglobin level, platelet count, and administered rHuEPO dose during each calendar quarter.

Outcomes & Other Measurements

Case-mix-adjusted 3-year all-cause mortality and measures of iron stores, including serum ferritin and iron saturation ratio.

Results

Higher platelet count was associated with lower iron stores and greater prescribed rHuEPO dose. Compared with a hemoglobin level of 12 to 13 g/dL, a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL or greater was associated with increased mortality in the presence of relative thrombocytosis, ie, platelet count of 300,000/microL or greater (case-mix-adjusted death-rate ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence limits, 1.02 to 1.44; P = 0.03) as opposed to the absence of relative thrombocytosis (death-rate ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence limits, 0.98 to 1.08; P = 0.1). A prescribed rHuEPO dose greater than 20,000 U/wk was associated with a greater likelihood of iron depletion (iron saturation ratio < 20%) and relative thrombocytosis (case-mix-adjusted odds ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence limits, 2.37 to 2.69; and 1.36; 95% confidence limits, 1.30 to 1.42, respectively; P < 0.001) and increased mortality during 3 years (death-rate ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence limits, 1.54 to 1.65; P < 0.001).

Limitations

Our results may incorporate uncontrolled confounding. Achieved hemoglobin level may have different mortality predictability than targeted hemoglobin level.

Conclusions

Iron depletion and associated relative thrombocytosis might contribute to increased mortality when administering high rHuEPO doses to achieve hemoglobin levels of 13 g/dL or greater in long-term hemodialysis patients. Randomized trials are needed to test these observational associations.

### Thrombocytosis… [^8ffbf987]. seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

This neoplasm is not reportable. Name Thrombocytosis Reportability This neoplasm is not reportable Alternate Names Chronic thrombocytosis Reactive thrombocytosis Secondary thrombocytosis Thrombocythemia, NOS. Definition Thrombocytosis and thrombocythemia are conditions in which the blood has a higher than normal number of platelets. Thrombocytosis is caused when another disease or condition causes a high platelet count. This condition is often called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Thrombocythemia is when the cause of a high platelet count isn't known. The condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis or thrombocythemia by themselves are not reportable. If they are referred to as primary/essential thrombocytosis or primary/essential thrombocythemia, then this is reportable.

### Extreme thrombocytosis is associated with critical illness and young age, but not increased thrombotic risk, in hospitalized pediatric patients [^fe5943cf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT, platelet count > 1000 × 10³/μL) is an uncommon but potentially clinically significant finding. Primary EXT in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders is linked to thrombotic and/or bleeding complications more frequently than secondary EXT, which typically occurs in reaction to infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency. However, comorbidities have been reported in adults with secondary EXT. Clinical implications of EXT in children are not well defined, as prior studies targeted small and/or specialized pediatric populations.

Objectives

Our objectives were to determine etiologies and sequelae of EXT in a hospitalized general pediatric patient population.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed EXT cases from a single-center pediatric cohort of ~80 000 patients over 8 years.

Results

Virtually all cases (99.8%) were secondary in nature, and most were multifactorial. Many cases of EXT occurred in children under 2 years old (47%) and/or during critical illness (55%). No thrombotic or bleeding events directly resulted from EXT, confirming a paucity of clinical complications associated with EXT in pediatric patients. There were indications that neonatal hematopoiesis and individual genetic variation influenced some cases, in addition to certain diagnoses (eg, sickle cell anemia) and clinical contexts (eg, asplenia).

Conclusion

Our findings confirm that thrombotic events related to EXT are rare in pediatric patients, which can inform the use of empiric anti-platelet therapy.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^2dff955d]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Impact on clinical practice

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true ET in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. In this regard, one must carefully examine the complete blood count (anemia or leukocytosis suggest early/prefibrotic MF), peripheral blood smear (increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume that is not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF), serum lactate dehydrogenase (increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF) and JAK2 V617F allele burden (diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of > 25% allele burden).

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF because of the increased baseline risk of bleeding. In general, we recommend avoidance of prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially in the presence of a bleeding history. This is different from our treatment approach in WHO-defined ET, in which we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy in the absence of clear contraindications, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET, but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Central retinal vein occlusion secondary to severe iron-deficiency anaemia resulting from a plant-based diet and menorrhagia: a case presentation [^fd699382]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disease, following diabetic retinopathy.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a known cause of CRVO, with previously documented cases in the literature. The underlying mechanism of thrombosis in IDA is the result of: 1) reactive thrombocytosis (e.g. increased platelet count, and activity); 2) hypoxia from anaemia leading to injury of endothelial cells in the retino-choroidal circulation; and 3) dysregulation of coagulation (e.g. fibronlysis). Life-threatening complications of iron deficiency anaemia have also been reported with cases of cerebral vascular accidents, pulmonary thromboembolism, and cerebral venous thrombosis also arising.

Iron is essential in retina metabolism but a state of haemostasis needs to exist as high levels of iron contribute to a range of disorders.

Plant-based diets have gained widespread popularity globally in the last decade, with reports of 70% of the world population actively reducing meat consumption, a trend backed by the millennials. In Australia, 11.2% of the population have identified with veganism in 2016, up from 9.7% in 2014. Similar trends have been observed in America, United Kingdom, Germany and Asia.

In this case presentation, we present a young vegan patient who developed a CRVO secondary to severe IDA attributable to menstrual losses and limited iron intake.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — pediatric hematology recommendations identify 5 hematologic tests and treatments that health care providers and patients should question, including: (1) avoid routine preoperative hemostatic testing in an otherwise healthy child with no previous personal or family history of bleeding; (2) avoid platelet transfusion in asymptomatic children with a platelet count > 10 × 10³/μL unless an invasive procedure is planned; (3) avoid thrombophilia testing in children with venous access-associated thrombosis and no positive family history; (4) avoid packed red blood cells transfusion for asymptomatic children with iron deficiency anemia and no active bleeding; and (5) avoid routine administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for prophylaxis of children with asymptomatic autoimmune neutropenia and no history of recurrent or severe infections. The Task Force stated these items should be questioned because they are not supported by evidence and/or they involve risks of medical and financial costs with low likelihood of benefit, and it recommends that health care providers carefully consider the anticipated risks and benefits of these identified tests and treatments before performing them.

### Incidence of cancer among adults with thrombocytosis in Canada… [^f12833c4]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, an increased platelet count was associated with an increased risk of cancer for at least 2 years. The results suggest that individuals with unexplained thrombocytosis should be offered screening for several cancers. Platelets are thought to have a role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression, including angiogenesis and metastases. 6–8 It has been shown that some ovarian cancers produce interleukin 6, which in turn upregulates platelet formation in the liver through local production of thrombopoietin.
9. The relative risk for developing a hematologic cancer during the 5-year follow-up period among those with thrombocytosis vs controls was 4.
03. In this retrospective cohort study, we found a statistically significant association between a high platelet count and the development of a solid tumor within 5 years of the detection of thrombocytosis.

The relative risks were most pronounced for lung cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, and gastrointestinal malignant tumors. The relative risk was greatest during the 6-month period after the diagnosis of thrombocytosis and decreased rapidly thereafter. This finding suggests that thrombocytosis may be a clinical marker for the presence of an existing cancer rather than being a factor associated with increased cancer risk and that cancer may lead to thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytosis being associated with the risk of developing a new cancer. If thrombocytosis is associated with cancer, instead of being a marker of cancer, the risk period would likely be more prolonged. In this study, for cancers associated with an increased short-term mortality rate, such as pancreatic and esophageal cancer, the risk of cancer after a diagnosis of thrombocytosis decreased rapidly.

The risk of pancreatic cancer was 3. 8-fold higher than that expected during the first 6 months after a diagnosis of thrombocytosis but was

1. 3-fold higher from 6 months to 5 years after the diagnosis. This cohort study found that an increased platelet count among individuals with normal platelet levels in the prior 2 years was associated with an increased risk of cancer. Increased risk of a solid-tumor diagnosis was predominant among lung, ovarian, kidney, and gastrointestinal malignant tumors. The findings suggest that individuals with unexplained thrombocytosis should be offered screening for several common cancers.

### Bilateral segmental testicular infarction secondary to iron deficiency anemia: a case report [^6e694028]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Segmental testicular infarction (STI) is an idiopathic testicular disease with a low incidence. Accurately diagnosing and treating this disease presents a challenge for clinicians. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a relatively common blood disorder and is generally accompanied by thrombocytosis, which increases the risk of thrombosis. In the present study, we report a 38-year-old man who suffered from a rare bilateral STI, which may be related to IDA. After conservative treatment and timely administration of iron supplementation, we observed an improvement in the patient's IDA and bilateral STI. Ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and laboratory tests helped us to accurately diagnose the disease and avoid unnecessary surgery. Following a month of follow-up, continuous ultrasound monitoring showed that the patient's lesions had completely disappeared, with no indications of recurrence. Therefore, ultrasound is a useful tool for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of this type of disease.

Red blood cell transfusion

It is advised that transfusions should be reserved for patients with severe anaemia, haemodynamically unstable and/or have associated comorbid conditions. However, while severe anaemia is defined as Hb < 70 g/dL, many of these patients may be haemodynamically stable and rather have chronic anaemia, remaining asymptomatic. Although a unit of blood contains approximately 200 mg of iron, these patients are very likely to require further iron supplementation to adequately replenish their iron stores, particularly if the cause for their anaemia is chronic and not easily treatable, for example, advanced malignancy or haematological disease.

Clinicians are rightly reluctant to transfuse patients unnecessarily as it is associated with not insignificant risks. These include an increased mortality with liberal blood transfusion in the setting of upper GI bleeding. There is also increased incidence of transfusion-related reactions. This includes the risk of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury, which is one of the most serious reactions, the incidence of which is approximately 1 in 5000 transfusions. Furthermore, there remains a small risk for transmitting infections, both viral and bacterial.

Considerations in management

Comorbidities

IDA occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure (CCF), CKD and IBD (table 2). To complicate matters, symptoms such as fatigue are commonly seen in these conditions, which can mimic and be confused with symptoms of IDA. Consequently, the management of IDA can often be overlooked. Untreated IDA can have greater consequences in these conditions causing an exacerbation of the underlying disease.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^21e45e1c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Identification and management of iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department [^315a9e69]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in the United States and worldwide. Yet, clinical guidelines for the identification and management of this disorder in the emergency department are lacking.

Objective Of Review

This clinical review examines strategies for identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department, with a focus on the role of oral iron therapy, intravenous iron therapy, as well as red blood cell transfusion. The article highlights both the available evidence on this topic and the need for future research.

Discussion

The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has important clinical implications and, although testing is generally straightforward, it may be under-recognized. The scant literature available describing emergency department practice patterns for iron deficiency anemia suggests there is room for improvement. In particular, intravenous iron may be underutilized and red blood cell transfusions administered too liberally.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency anemia is common and many patients can be treated effectively with oral iron. For selected patients with moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron is safe and more effective than oral iron. Red blood cell transfusions should be used rarely for hemodynamically stable patients with iron deficiency irrespective of hemoglobin levels.

### Dietary composition influences incidence of Helicobacter pylori-induced iron deficiency anemia and gastric ulceration [^9b6f08c4]. Infection and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic studies have provided conflicting data regarding an association between Helicobacter pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in humans. Here, a Mongolian gerbil model was used to investigate a potential role of H. pylori infection, as well as a possible role of diet, in H. pylori-associated IDA. Mongolian gerbils (either H. pylori infected or uninfected) received a normal diet or one of three diets associated with increased H. pylori virulence: high-salt, low-iron, or a combination of a high-salt and low-iron diet. In an analysis of all infected animals compared to uninfected animals (independent of diet), H. pylori-infected gerbils had significantly lower hemoglobin values than their uninfected counterparts at 16 weeks postinfection (P < 0.0001). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum ferritin values were significantly lower in H. pylori-infected gerbils than in uninfected gerbils, consistent with IDA. Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were also detected in infected gerbils, indicating the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. In comparison to uninfected gerbils, H. pylori-infected gerbils had a higher gastric pH, a higher incidence of gastric ulcers, and a higher incidence of fecal occult blood loss. Anemia was associated with the presence of gastric ulceration but not gastric cancer. Infected gerbils consuming diets with a high salt content developed gastric ulcers significantly more frequently than gerbils consuming a normal-salt diet, and the lowest hemoglobin levels were in infected gerbils consuming a high-salt/low-iron diet. These data indicate that H. pylori infection can cause IDA and that the composition of the diet influences the incidence and severity of H. pylori-induced IDA.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^3698beee]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Table II
Proposed lower limits of normal for haemoglobin concentration of the blood for white and black adults.

Table I
Current definitions of anaemia used in Gaucher disease therapeutic goals and monitoring guidelines.

In Gaucher disease, ferritin levels are generally elevated without other biochemical evidence of iron overload consistent with anaemia of chronic disease, whereas typical iron deficiency anaemia is characterized by low serum iron, low transferrin saturation and low ferritin levels. In chronic inflammation, normal iron homeostasis is disrupted by the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines with possible dysregulation of hepcidin, a key liver-derived iron regulator. Certain proinflammatory cytokines that are likely to increase hepcidin, such as interleukin (IL) 6, may be increased in the serum of patients with Gaucher disease but effects on hepcidin levels have not been evaluated.

As well as reduced red cell quantity there is also evidence of decreased red cell quality in Gaucher disease. While this might be expected in patients without a functioning spleen, increased cell aggregation has been demonstrated in both asplenic and spleen-intact Gaucher patients. No correlation between red cell aggregation index and disease severity, plasma fibrinogen concentration, genotype or history of enzyme therapy has been found.

Thrombocytopenia

Of patients enroled in the ICGG Gaucher Registry, 15% demonstrated severe thrombocytopenia with platelet counts less than 60 × 10 9 /l, 45% demonstrated moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets > 60– < 120 × 10 9 /l) and 40% demonstrated mild thrombocytopenia (platelets > 120– < 150 × 10 9 /l) at diagnosis (ICGC Registry 2005 Annual Report, unpublished observations). As with anaemia, thrombocytopenia is related to hypersplenism and/or infiltration of bone marrow with Gaucher cells but, again, there is no direct correlation with splenomegaly. Complicating factors, such as immune thrombocytopenia, may result in persistently low-platelet counts.

Bleeding tendency may not always be related to absolute platelet counts but may be influenced by coagulation factor deficiencies or abnormal platelet function. Acquired coagulation factor deficiencies have been demonstrated in Gaucher disease. The mechanism involved is unclear but may include low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation or sequestration of coagulation factors by substrate loaded cells. Specific inherited coagulation factor deficiencies exist among certain ethnic groups, for example, factor XI deficiency amongst Ashkenazi Jews, a group that also demonstrates increased incidence of Gaucher disease. Some patients with relatively high platelet counts and normal coagulation tests have haemorrhagic episodes that may be associated with abnormal platelet aggregation.

### Germline JAK2 R564Q variants presenting as hereditary thrombocytosis: case report [^44dde019]. BJC Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 1

The first proband is a 41-year-old woman with a long-standing history of unexplained thrombocytosis and intermittent leukocytosis. Over a 14-year period, her platelet count fluctuated between 311 × 10 9 /L and 750 × 10 9 /L. Other pertinent past medical history included recurrent early pregnancy loss, low protein S activity, psoriatic arthritis, and iron deficiency anemia. She had no history of known thrombotic events. The patient's thrombocytosis was initially believed to be secondary to iron deficiency anemia and/or autoimmune disease. She was placed on oral iron supplementation, but no anti-thrombotics. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated a variably cellular bone marrow (~ 50%) with trilineage hematopoiesis, no dysplasia, and mildly increased numbers of megakaryocytes, without any pathologic diagnosis rendered. NGS analysis of the bone marrow sample was notable for a JAK2 R564Q variant at a variant allele frequency (VAF) of 51%, highly suggestive of a germline variant. Variants in CALR and MPL were not identified. The patient was referred for genetic counseling and confirmatory testing. A skin biopsy was performed, and comprehensive germline cancer risk testing on DNA derived from cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed the JAK2 R564Q variant to be germline, with a classification as a variant of unknown significance (VUS). The patient's one-year old daughter was also found to have thrombocytosis (700 × 10 9 /L), but germline testing was declined by the patient. Additional family members declined cascade testing. The patient was treated with prophylactic low-dose aspirin during pregnancy but otherwise is being managed with observation alone.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^4676ac6f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### JAK2 p.R564 germ line variants associated with hereditary thrombocythemia and hematologic neoplasms [^6c2b8342]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

It appears that variants in JAK2 at p.R564 are associated with HT and potentially other myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders. While this is a small case series, it is of interest that all the females with p.R564 variants had clear HT phenotypes. On the other hand, many of the males did not demonstrate overt thrombocytosis, but rather other hematologic manifestations. The precise mechanisms behind these observations warrant further investigation. One could hypothesize that heightened recognition of iron deficiency and reactive thrombocytosis among females leads to a higher proportion of women being tested and diagnosed with thrombocytosis, potentially indicating a bias in testing and identification practices. Secondly, it is plausible that the augmented risk of MF and malignancy observed in males may skew the timing of identification toward the onset of MF or malignancy.

Lastly, in terms of management, to date, there are no management guidelines or consensus protocols to direct the treatment of pathogenic germ line variants in JAK2. Although these are distinct from the common p.V617F variant, they may still enhance cell growth similar to the somatic p.V617F lesion. The germ line variants have kinase activity similar to p.V617F; the degree of growth-promoting effects due to counterregulatory mechanisms may differ, however. Although discrete management guidelines are a current unmet need, adopting management approaches from JAK2 p.V617F-positive MPNs (including symptom-directed therapeutic options such as JAK inhibitors) can be a feasible strategy to manage non–p.V617F MPN-associated JAK2 pathogenic variants. In Table 2, we provide our approach to the management of patients with germ line pathogenic variants in JAK2. The presence of germ line JAK2 mutations and a suggestive phenotype (cytosis) emerging as early as year 2 in our series further supports the recommendation that patients with early-onset MPNs should be offered genetic counseling and potentially germ line genetic testing. Overall, it is prudent for individuals with JAK2 germ line variants and their families to work closely with a multidisciplinary health care team, including genetic counselors, hematologists, cardiologists, and other specialists, to develop a personalized and comprehensive management plan, preferably at a major academic center.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^2e8e9319]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Because the treatment of iron deficiency in HF does not depend on characterization of its pathogenesis, efforts to distinguish between absolute and functional iron deficiency at one particular point in time in a patient's clinical course have little therapeutic relevance. There is no rationale for identifying the relative contribution of specific pathophysiologic mechanisms for iron deficiency in clinical practice, and there is no reliable noninvasive means of achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the finding of meaningful hypoferremia together with a hypochromic microcytic anemia might prompt a diagnostic workup for a gastrointestinal malignancy.

### Iron status influences the response of cord blood megakaryocyte progenitors to eltrombopag in vitro [^7726e03f]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Romiplostim (ROM) and eltrombopag (ELT) are Food and Drug Administration–approved thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics used in adults and children with chronic thrombocytopenia of different etiologies. In a study assessing responses of neonatal and adult human megakaryocyte (MK) progenitors to TPO, ROM, and ELT, we observed that both TPO and ROM increased the number of MKs generated in vitro in a similar, dose-dependent manner. In contrast, we found that ELT stimulated megakaryopoiesis at low concentrations but had inhibitory effects at concentrations > 6 µM and induced significant cell death at 30 µM. These findings were consistent with a prior study showing that ELT concentrations of 6 µg/mL (13.6 µM) profoundly reduced the number of cord blood (CB)–derived MKs generated in vitro.

The mechanisms underlying these observations have not been previously investigated. Given an increased recognition of the potent iron-chelating effects of ELT on leukemia cells, cardiomyocyte cell lines, osteoclasts, and neonatal hippocampal neurons, this study was designed to evaluate whether ELT-induced iron chelation mediates some of the toxic effects of ELT in CB-MK progenitors. As a secondary objective, we aimed to establish whether iron availability and the cellular iron status of MK progenitors influence the responses to ELT in vitro. This is clinically relevant because the iron status of patients treated with ELT is extremely variable, ranging from significant iron deficiency in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and frequent bleeding to iron overload in patients with aplastic anemia who are red cell transfusion dependent.

In addition, although iron deficiency is commonly associated with thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia has been reported in children and adults with severe iron deficiency anemia, which resolved following treatment with iron administration or red cell transfusion. Thus, we also explored whether iron deficiency affected TPO-induced megakaryopoiesis in vitro, independently of ELT. These studies demonstrated that severe iron deficiency significantly impaired the expansion of differentiated MK progenitors (CD41 + cells) in response to high TPO concentrations, revealing a potential biphasic role for iron on megakaryopoiesis, particularly in the setting of thrombopoietic stimulation.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^7fbc6abd]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Current treatment approaches for polycythemia vera patients

The primary goals of treating PV patients are to ameliorate symptoms, reduce the risk of thrombosis, and prevent transformation to MF and/or MPN-blast phase. Aspirin is universally administered to all eligible PV patients without a contraindication as thrombosis prophylaxis based on evidence from Italian investigators who demonstrated a strong trend toward decreased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes in aspirin-treated PV patients. Furthermore, normalization of the hematocrit (HCT) levels of PV patients correlates with reduced risk of thrombosis and represents the primary therapeutic goal given the frequency of thrombotic complications and the high consequent morbidity and mortality. This can be achieved by therapeutic phlebotomy alone or in combination with cytoreductive agents, including hydroxyurea, interferon alpha, or busulfan. Recently, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (i.e. Jakafi) was approved for PV patients intolerant of or refractory to hydroxyurea. Although the majority of patients exhibit clinical responses to ruxolitinib (e.g. HCT normalization, alleviation of systemic symptoms, and reduction of splenomegaly), ruxolitinib therapy, like treatment with other cytoreductive agents, has not been shown to alter the natural history of the disease. As a consequence, patients who are < 60 years of age with no history of thrombosis (low-risk PV) are maintained on therapeutic phlebotomy alone, often for many years.

The beneficial effect of phlebotomy in PV may depend not only on removing excess red blood cells (RBCs) to reduce the risk of thrombosis, but also on the resulting iron deficiency that inhibits erythropoiesis. Iron restriction decreases hemoglobin synthesis, and thereby decreases mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which in part alone accounts for the decreased HCT after phlebotomy. However, iron deficiency also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of erythroblasts by a mechanism not yet fully elucidated. What we do know is that the "iron restriction response" employs multiple iron-sensitive molecular pathways to inhibit the differentiation and proliferation of erythroblasts and cause anemia in iron-deficient states. The proposed mechanisms involve mitochondrial aconitase enzymes, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), and scribble-mediated EpoR regulation, as well as effects on the erythroblast cell cycle. It is possible that the disease process causes erythroblasts in PV to be less sensitive to iron deficiency, allowing them to differentiate and proliferate despite iron restriction.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^952d5f09]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

In total, the target HCT goal of < 45% is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular complications. However, controlling HCT has not been clearly shown to decrease symptom burden or the risk of disease progression. In fact, repeated phlebotomy may exacerbate iron deficiency-related symptoms and has been associated with worsening of disease-related symptoms such as pruritus. Furthermore, a high phlebotomy requirement (> 4 per year) is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, but whether this is due to worsening iron deficiency, other consequences of phlebotomy, or to the underlying disease remains poorly understood. High phlebotomy requirements often indicate the need for initiating cytoreductive therapy which may reverse symptoms of iron deficiency possibly by decreasing the frequency of phlebotomy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^409646b6]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^d35369d9]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. Virtually all PV patients are iron deficient at presentation and/or during the course of their disease. The co-existence of iron deficiency and polycythemia presents a physiological disconnect. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, is regulated by circulating iron levels, erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone, and inflammation. Both decreased circulating iron and increased erythroferrone levels, which occur as a consequence of erythroid hyperplasia in PV, are anticipated to suppress hepcidin and enable recovery from iron deficiency. Inflammation which accompanies PV is likely to counteract hepcidin suppression, but the relatively low serum ferritin levels observed suggest that inflammation is not a major contributor to the dysregulated iron metabolism. Furthermore, potential defects in iron absorption, aberrant hypoxia sensing and signaling, and frequency of bleeding to account for iron deficiency in PV patients have not been fully elucidated. Insufficiently suppressed hepcidin given the degree of iron deficiency in PV patients strongly suggests that disordered iron metabolism is an important component of the pathobiology of PV. Normalization of hematocrit levels using therapeutic phlebotomy is the most common approach for reducing the incidence of thrombotic complications, a therapy which exacerbates iron deficiency, contributing to a variety of non-hematological symptoms. The use of cytoreductive therapy in high-risk PV patients frequently works more effectively to reverse PV-associated symptoms in iron-deficient relative to iron-replete patients. Lastly, differences in iron-related parameters between PV patients and mice with JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations suggest that specific regions in JAK2 may influence iron metabolism by nuanced changes of erythropoietin receptor signaling. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical consequences of iron deficiency in PV, provide a framework for understanding the potential dysregulation of iron metabolism, and present a rationale for additional therapeutic options for iron-deficient PV patients.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^529e7de2]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

We anticipate that the cause of iron deficiency in PV is a composite of multiple concurrent factors, most likely an aberrant iron restriction response in conjunction with altered hypoxia regulation of iron absorption.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^24d2dc9e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^bac5d8cd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^8bd648aa]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.
