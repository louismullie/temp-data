## Question

For borderline low vitamin B12, what laboratory tests aside from homocysteine should be considered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to consider when serum vitamin B12 is borderline low, specifically what to order beyond homocysteine and how to interpret them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "borderline low" is defined and the role of clinical context. Then, I should verify the essential first-line labs to obtain. Next, I will examine second-line functional markers, and I need to check which of MMA, holotranscobalamin, and homocysteine adds the most diagnostic value. After that, I should confirm how confounders like renal function and medications affect interpretation. Then, I will review etiologic testing such as anti–intrinsic factor antibodies. Finally, I need to integrate all this into a practical, safety-focused algorithm and clarify when to treat empirically without delay, especially in the presence of neurological features.

> Let me first confirm what "borderline low" B12 means and why the clinical picture matters most. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) defines deficiency when B12 is less than 148 pmol/L (approximately 200 ng/L) or below the local lower limit of normal, while acknowledging a grey zone above this threshold in which true deficiency may still exist, particularly with compatible symptoms and signs, and it emphasizes that there is no gold standard and the clinical picture should guide decisions, especially to avoid delays that risk neurologic harm [^111jsvta] [^112TSbGP]. Hold on, let me verify the practical ranges: many laboratories consider roughly 148–221 pmol/L as low-normal or borderline; in this zone, I should double-check for functional deficiency rather than rely on total B12 alone [^1119yqiD].

> Next, I should review the essential baseline tests before moving to specialized markers. I need to ensure a complete blood count with blood film is obtained to look for macrocytosis, oval macrocytes, and hypersegmented neutrophils, while remembering that neurological symptoms from cobalamin deficiency can occur even when MCV is normal, so I should not over-rely on MCV alone [^117WuFCr] [^116cWQXh]. I also need to check serum folate in parallel to distinguish isolated B12 deficiency from folate deficiency or combined states, because both cause megaloblastic anemia and overlapping cytopenias, and serum folate is acceptable as first-line rather than red cell folate in most settings [^111KL6H1] [^112TSbGP]. The AAFP also supports CBC plus serum B12 as initial assessment in at-risk patients, followed by confirmatory metabolites when suspicion persists despite low-normal B12 [^112tjkkV] [^1154xs65].

> Now to second-line functional markers, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. I was about to anchor on homocysteine as the core functional test, but wait, methylmalonic acid (MMA) is more specific for cellular B12 insufficiency and should be prioritized when serum B12 is borderline and clinical suspicion persists, with elevations supporting a functional deficiency even if total B12 appears low-normal [^1154xs65] [^112TSbGP]. Let me think about cut-offs: a serum MMA above roughly 280–300 nmol/L suggests suboptimal cobalamin status in younger patients with normal renal function, but I should double-check kidney function before interpreting elevations because renal impairment raises MMA independent of B12 status [^115i7Tip] [^112TSbGP].

> I will now examine holotranscobalamin (holoTC) as an early marker and to refine equivocal cases. HoloTC reflects the biologically active, transcobalamin-bound fraction of B12 and may detect deficiency earlier than total B12; if available, it can be considered when total B12 is greater than 148 pmol/L but there is strong clinical suspicion, and it may be particularly useful in pregnancy where total B12 falls physiologically and is less reliable, although I should confirm local availability and interpret within clinical context because no single test is definitive [^1122MFVF] [^116cZtCK] [^114rnp3w]. Hold on, I should verify the test performance: comparative data suggest holoTC often outperforms total B12 for identifying MMA-defined deficiency, but it is not perfect and should be integrated with metabolites and the clinical picture [^113WenGk] [^112TSbGP].

> But wait, what about homocysteine? Homocysteine can rise in both folate and B12 deficiency and is therefore less specific than MMA for cobalamin deficiency; it remains useful when MMA is unavailable or when I need to evaluate suspected remethylation disorders, yet I need to consider multiple non–B12 causes of elevation before attributing it to cobalamin deficiency [^112TSbGP]. I should double-check for other contributors to hyperhomocysteinemia such as renal impairment, hypothyroidism, B6 deficiency, and inborn errors of one-carbon metabolism, keeping in mind that tHcy is the frontline biochemical hallmark for suspected remethylation disorders and requires careful pre-analytical handling [^111bSo5m] [^116tiKQc].

> Next, I should review confounding factors that distort interpretation of these markers. I need to ensure kidney function is checked because both MMA and homocysteine accumulate with reduced eGFR, which can mimic functional deficiency; age itself is less explanatory than renal function for elevations in these metabolites in the elderly [^114Twg2C]. I should also scrutinize medications and conditions that lower B12 or alter markers, including metformin, proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers, and in complex malabsorption states such as short-bowel syndrome, paradoxical patterns of high B12 with high MMA may occur, requiring cautious interpretation and sometimes empiric parenteral repletion to resolve incongruence [^114GZbL6] [^111x7sbU] [^115MpXif].

> Once biochemical deficiency is established, I should confirm etiology, and pernicious anemia is a priority consideration. I need to obtain anti–intrinsic factor antibodies because they are highly specific for pernicious anemia, while recognizing their modest sensitivity and that a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis, particularly if clinical features or gastritis history are suggestive; in diabetics with low B12, this testing is still indicated, and I should not be reassured by a single negative antibody assay if suspicion remains high [^112yFs6M] [^115GowHv]. Hold on, if the antibodies are negative but suspicion is high, I should reconsider gastric pathology evaluation and monitor response to cobalamin therapy rather than delaying treatment [^112TSbGP].

> Now I need to integrate the data into management, and I should not delay therapy when neurological features are present or when labs are discordant but suspicion is strong. Because there is no gold standard and neurological injury can be irreversible, treatment should proceed based on the clinical picture supported by functional markers such as MMA; intramuscular therapy leads to faster improvement and is preferred in severe deficiency or with neurological involvement, whereas high-dose oral therapy is effective for many without malabsorption or with reliable adherence [^112TSbGP] [^112FxXC7] [^114ij34x]. I should confirm dosing: without neurological involvement, BSH suggests hydroxocobalamin 1,000 mcg intramuscularly three times weekly for two weeks; with neurological involvement, 1,000 mcg intramuscularly every two days until improvement plateaus, and I should avoid using serum biomarkers to titrate injection frequency or to monitor symptom recovery since they do not track clinical improvement reliably [^1155r3od] [^1129gYP1] [^116HYE4W].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm clearly, while checking that I am prioritizing the right markers beyond homocysteine. Start with CBC, film, serum B12, and serum folate; if serum B12 is borderline and suspicion persists, prioritize MMA to confirm functional deficiency and consider holoTC if available, using homocysteine as supportive but less specific evidence; confirm etiology with anti–intrinsic factor antibodies when deficiency is established, and treat without delay when neurological features or strong clinical suspicion are present, recognizing that no single test is definitive [^117XBUaq] [^1154xs65] [^112yFs6M] [^112TSbGP]. Hold on, I should verify context-specific nuances: after bariatric surgery or in pregnancy, I need heightened vigilance and may prefer holoTC for assessment, and I should continue to reassess for confounders such as renal function and medications throughout the diagnostic and treatment course to avoid misclassification [^112qtT8d] [^114rnp3w] [^114Twg2C].

For borderline low B12 (148–221 pmol/L), **methylmalonic acid (MMA)** is the most specific test for functional deficiency and should be measured when B12 is borderline or clinical suspicion is high [^1154xs65] [^114rbYbd]. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) is an **early marker** that can detect deficiency before total B12 falls, and a CBC with blood film may show macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils even with borderline B12 [^117WuFCr] [^112tjkkV]. Consider **anti–intrinsic factor antibodies** if pernicious anemia is suspected, and interpret all results in clinical context, as no single test is definitive [^112TSbGP] [^112yFs6M].

---

## Methylmalonic acid (MMA)

- **Specificity**: MMA is a specific marker of B12 deficiency, rising when B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is impaired [^1154xs65] [^114wg4C9].

- **Clinical utility**: Measure MMA when serum B12 is borderline or clinical suspicion persists despite normal B12 [^1154xs65] [^114wg4C9].

- **Interpretation**: MMA > 280 nmol/L suggests functional B12 deficiency, especially with normal renal function [^115i7Tip].

---

## Holotranscobalamin (holoTC)

- **Early marker**: HoloTC ("active B12") declines before total B12, detecting early deficiency [^114nWhuF].

- **Clinical utility**: Consider holoTC when available, particularly in borderline B12 or pregnancy, where total B12 is less reliable [^1122MFVF] [^114rnp3w].

- **Interpretation**: Low holoTC supports early B12 deficiency, even with normal total B12 [^114nWhuF].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and blood film

Hematological findings include **macrocytosis (elevated MCV)**, oval macrocytes, and **hypersegmented neutrophils** that can occur even with borderline B12 levels [^117WuFCr] [^111KL6H1]. Clinical utility — CBC and blood film are **first-line tests** for suspected B12 deficiency, especially when anemia or neurological symptoms are present [^111KL6H1].

---

## Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies

Pernicious anemia — test for **anti–intrinsic factor antibodies** when pernicious anemia is suspected, even in the absence of anemia or malabsorption [^112yFs6M]. Clinical utility — positive results support **pernicious anemia** as the cause of B12 deficiency [^112yFs6M].

---

## Clinical context and interpretation

Clinical correlation — interpret laboratory results alongside symptoms and risk factors, as **no single test is definitive** [^111jsvta]. Empiric treatment — consider **empiric B12 therapy** when clinical suspicion is strong, even if laboratory findings are inconclusive [^111jsvta].

---

## Summary of laboratory tests for borderline low B12

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical utility** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Methylmalonic acid (MMA) | Specific marker of functional B12 deficiency | Elevated (> 280 nmol/L) indicates deficiency |
| Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) | Early marker of B12 deficiency | Low levels indicate early deficiency |
| Complete blood count (CBC) and blood film | Detects hematological abnormalities | - Macrocytosis <br/> - Hypersegmented neutrophils |
| Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies | Identifies pernicious anemia | Positive indicates pernicious anemia |

---

For borderline low B12, **prioritize MMA** for specificity, use holoTC for early detection, and assess the CBC and blood film for hematologic clues; integrate results with the clinical context and consider empiric treatment when clinical suspicion is high.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results assessing cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues. Local reference ranges should be established.

In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in diagnosis and risk assessment from infancy to adolescence [^114rbYbd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in serum and plasma is elevated in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies, whereas methylmalonic acid (MMA) in serum, plasma, or urine is a specific marker of cobalamin function. The combined measurement of both metabolites is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these deficiency states. In addition, tHcy is elevated under various pathologic states (e.g. renal failure), and hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Biochemical background**: The diagnostic utility of tHcy and MMA concentrations as markers of folate and cobalamin deficiencies in healthy and diseased children has been documented. This article briefly summarizes the biochemical background of tHcy and MMA and the associations of tHcy and MMA with various disease states. It focuses on novel data obtained in infants, children, and adolescents, with emphasis on cobalamin status in infants. The utility of tHcy and MMA as indicators of cobalamin and folate deficiencies in adults can be extended to infants and older children. Furthermore, as in adults, tHcy is related to unhealthy lifestyle factors and is a risk factor for vascular disease. High MMA concentrations in newborns, occasionally denoted as benign methylmalonic aciduria, may reflect impaired cobalamin function.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency — an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

This article represents an update on the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency, such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases.

Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis, followed by the measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unresolved cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and the measurement of holoTC is currently being introduced in the clinical setting.

There is no consensus concerning the evaluation of the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons of the different tests, mainly aiming at the evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa, are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed, efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 months or by a daily dose of 1 mg of vitamin B12.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses):

- **Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis**: (Outcome: timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)

- **Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis**: (Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)

- **How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage**: (Outcome: survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical)

- **How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment**: (Outcome: visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical)

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors, who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics of "clinical signs and symptoms", "differential diagnosis", "laboratory/biochemical parameters", "disease course and outcome", and "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (ranging from case reports and case series to meta-analyses) were included; randomized controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations were accomplished by moderated, consensus-oriented discussions.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older individuals. Several risk factors contribute to vitamin B(12) deficiency, including the prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency. However, screening may be warranted for high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders.

The initial laboratory assessment for suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, so measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12). Therefore, patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements rather than relying solely on dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency [^111hVKBh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Biochemical diagnosis (statement #4: grade of recommendation C)

Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) should be the frontline test for the diagnosis of CBS deficiency. Plasma free homocystine (fHcy) only becomes detectable at tHcy concentrations above approximately 50–60 μmol/L; its measurement is not recommended because of its low sensitivity and reproducibility, and the demanding pre-analytical requirements. In untreated patients with CBS deficiency, tHcy concentrations are usually above 100 μmol/L, but they may be lower. The diagnosis is very likely if elevated tHcy is accompanied by high or borderline-high plasma Met concentrations and further supported if sensitive methods demonstrate low plasma cystathionine concentrations with an increased Met-to-cystathionine ratio.

CBS deficiency is characterized biochemically by an accumulation of Hcy, decreased synthesis of cystathionine and cysteine, and usually by increased Met. However, the classical pattern is not always observed in all variants of CBS deficiency.

Two indices of plasma homocysteine levels have been widely used: the free homocystine (fHcy) — the concentration of non-protein-bound disulfide homocystine — and the total homocysteine (tHcy) — the sum of all free and bound homocysteine species after treating plasma with a reducing agent. Measurement of fHcy has been possible since the 1960s, whereas tHcy has only been widely available since the late 1990s. The plasma fHcy determined by an AA analyzer is an insensitive marker of CBS deficiency.

### Fewer US adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status based on the novel combined indicator of vitamin B12 status compared with individual, conventional markers, NHANES 1999–2004 [^1119yqiD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) and/or total homocysteine (tHcy), as well as low serum vitamin B12 and/or holotranscobalamin (holoTC), are indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency. Combined indicators (cB12), which pool some or all four markers into an index, may be a more reliable diagnostic tool to overcome inconclusive diagnoses with individual markers.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to describe different cB12 score combinations and estimate the prevalence of low or transitional vitamin B12 status compared with individual markers.

- **Design**: Using cross-sectional data for B12, MMA, and tHcy in persons ≥ 20 years participating in NHANES 1999–2004 (n = 12,335), we examined raw and covariate-adjusted regression models to assess determinants of 3cB12 (all three markers) and combinations of 2cB12 (two markers).

- **Results**: 3cB12 was significantly associated with B12 (Spearman r = 0.75), MMA (r = -0.70), and tHcy (r = -0.59). The 3cB12 reference interval (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) was -0.538 to 1.60. In covariate-adjusted models, we found no association of 3cB12 with age; adult females and users of B12 supplements had higher, while adults with advanced chronic kidney disease had lower 3cB12 levels regardless of race-Hispanic origin group (self-reported). Only 2.7% of adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status using the proposed cB12 cutoff of ≤ -0.5, while the prevalence of low (or low-normal) status depended on the selected individual marker and its cutoff: 2.2% and 13% for B12 < 148 and 148–222 pmol/L, respectively; 6.0% for MMA exceeding an age-specific cutoff (250–320 nmol/L).

### Laboratory testing for cobalamin deficiency in megaloblastic anemia [^115oLWwy]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia in Western populations. Laboratory evaluation of megaloblastic anemia frequently includes the assessment of patient cobalamin and folate status. Total serum cobalamin measurements are performed in the clinical laboratory with competitive binding luminescence assays, whose results may not always accurately reflect actual cobalamin stores. Surrogate markers of cobalamin deficiency, such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, have been utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, the specificity of these tests by themselves is rather low.

- **Measurement methods**: Measurement of the biologically active fraction of cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, has been proposed as a replacement for total cobalamin assays. Although holotranscobalamin measurements appear to have slightly better sensitivity, the specificity of this assay remains to be determined.

- **Discussion**: The relative merits and demerits of commonly available methods to assess cobalamin deficiency in patients with suspected megaloblastic anemia are discussed.

### Holotranscobalamin, a marker of vitamin B-12 status: Analytical aspects and clinical utility [^113WenGk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately one-quarter of circulating cobalamin (vitamin B-12) binds to transcobalamin (holoTC) and is thereby available for the cells of the body. For this reason, holoTC is also referred to as active vitamin B-12. HoloTC was suggested as an optimal marker of early vitamin B-12 deficiency over 20 years ago. This suggestion led to the development of suitable assays for measurement of the compound and to clinical studies that aimed to demonstrate the benefit of measuring holoTC rather than vitamin B-12 alone.

Today, holoTC can be analyzed by three methods: direct measurement of the complex between transcobalamin and vitamin B-12, measurement of vitamin B-12 attached to transcobalamin, or measurement of the amount of transcobalamin saturated with vitamin B-12. These three methods yield similar results; however, direct measurement of the holoTC complex is preferable in clinical settings from a practical perspective.

HoloTC measurement has been proven useful for identifying the few patients who suffer from transcobalamin deficiency. Additionally, holoTC is part of the CobaSorb test and is therefore valuable for assessing vitamin B-12 absorption. Clinical studies comparing the ability of holoTC with that of vitamin B-12 to identify individuals with vitamin B-12 deficiency (elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid) suggest that holoTC performs better than total vitamin B-12.

At the time of writing, holoTC has not been used for population-based assessments of vitamin B-12 status, but we suggest that holoTC is a better marker than total vitamin B-12 for such studies.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: A prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^114b1m5h]. BMC geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

	- **Vitamin B12 and surrogate markers**: Spearman rank correlations revealed statistically insignificant associations between vitamin B12 or holoTC and progressing years of age (p = 0.56 and p = 0.68). Total vitamin B12 serum levels and holoTC in the entire cohort thus remained stable over three arbitrarily defined age groups of 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years. However, there were significant sex differences of holoTC in the age groups of 60–69 (p < 0.001) and 70–79 years (p < 0.001), whereas no such differences could be detected in persons ≥ 80 years (p = 0.77).

	- A common reference interval for elderly persons could be determined for those aged ≥ 80 years as 21.3 (90% confidence interval, 19.3–24.0) – 118.2 (90% CI 97–125.3) pmol/L. Sex-specific reference intervals can be given for persons aged 60–79 years: 24.0 (90% CI 21.0–25.6) – 115 (90% CI 107.9–119.0) pmol/L for females and 22.3 (90% CI 21.0–24.5) – 94.4 (90% CI 85.4–106.2) pmol/L for males.

	- Because the 90% CI overlaps in both age groups and among both sexes, a combined lower limit of the reference interval might be justifiable and useful for practical purposes. Given that the upper limit of the reference interval is of minor clinical importance and differences among age and sex groups can be regarded as minor, the same practical considerations can be extrapolated to the common upper limit of the reference interval. A combined reference interval for both sexes and persons ≥ 60 years can thus be determined at 23 (90% CI 21.9–24) – 109.3 (90% CI 105–115) pmol/L.

### A population-based intervention study on elevated serum levels of methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine in elderly people: Results after 36 months of follow-up [^111b4ktX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To study the effects of vitamin B12 and folic acid treatment on haematological measures, reported symptoms, and clinical findings over a 3-year period, a longitudinal two-cohort study was conducted in a mid-Swedish community. A 20% random sample of persons aged 70 years or older in a defined geographical area was invited to a survey (n = 266). Sixty-nine individuals with serum cobalamin levels ≤ 148 pmol L(-1), serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) ≥ 0.37 micromol L(-1), or serum total homocysteine (tHcy) ≥ 15 micromol L(-1) who were not receiving vitamin B12 or folic acid substitution were selected for treatment.

The main outcome measures included serum cobalamin, folate, MMA, and tHcy levels; the presence of gastrointestinal, neurological, psychiatric, and other symptoms obtained by questionnaire; and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, vibration sense measurement, and findings at physical examination.

Results showed that after combined vitamin B12-folic acid treatment, all participants normalized their serum tHcy and MMA levels, with effects persisting after 3 years. The study design allowed for the distinction between pure vitamin B12 deficiencies and folate or combined deficiencies. There was a tendency towards improvement in vibration sense, especially in long nerve paths, along with improvement in neurological symptoms and oral mucosa findings. However, no improvement was observed in other symptoms, reflex activity, or MMSE score.

The study concluded that vitamin treatment in the early phases of the condition in elderly people may reverse damage that could otherwise become irreversible. If initiated, the treatment should be combined.

Vitamin B12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism, particularly in DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency, characterized by classic hematological and neurological manifestations, is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects 2.5% to 26% of the general population, depending on the definition used, although its clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals of all ages, but it is most prevalent among the elderly. Infants, children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is limited.

The causes of deficiency include inadequate intake, insufficient bioavailability, or malabsorption. Intracellular deficiency can result from disruptions in B12 transport in the blood or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism. Diagnostic biomarkers for assessing B12 status include reduced levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, along with elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the precise cut-off values for distinguishing clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated.

Management of B12 deficiency involves supplementation, either through high-dose oral routes or parenteral administration. This primer elaborates on the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency and emphasizes improvements in diagnostic methods, as well as evolving concepts regarding the prevalence, causes, and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Association of vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocystinemia with acute coronary syndromes - A case series [^113BNSr7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are the most common presentation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in the emergency department. Numerous risk factors, such as smoking, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, metabolic syndrome, high triglycerides, and diabetes, have been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease and ACS. The management tools, instead of focusing on the reversal of the above risk factors, rely on lipid-lowering drugs. Our series of patients suffering from ACS shows a possible association with low serum vitamin B12, high homocysteine, high triglyceride, low HDL, low cholesterol, and low LDL levels. There needs to be a paradigm shift in managing patients with ACS and the advice prescribed to them at the time of discharge. It would be prudent for emergency physicians to test for vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels in ACS patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning patients on hormone therapy, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend that further investigation should be avoided in asymptomatic female patients on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy who have mildly reduced serum vitamin B12. Instead, these patients should be advised to review their dietary intake of cobalamin-rich foods and consider initiating cobalamin supplements.

### Vitamin B [^116HYE4W]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

**What you need to know**: The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of results of blood tests assessing cobalamin (B12) status because there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency. Neurological symptoms resulting from B12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement, and neither is the titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment. Self-administration of intramuscular B12 injections can lead to greater patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.

### Age dependency of plasma vitamin B12 status markers in Dutch children and adolescents [^112EhgiQ]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

It is known that individuals with cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency may exhibit variable abnormalities in plasma vitamin B12 status markers. It is not uncommon to observe within-reference total Cbl or holo transcobalamin (holoTC) concentrations alongside elevated concentrations of either plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) or total plasma homocysteine. This scenario, combined with non-specific symptoms and the lack of a gold standard, makes the diagnosis of Cbl deficiency particularly challenging.

Many studies on biochemical markers have been performed in adults. However, plasma vitamin B12 status markers, particularly holoTC concentrations, in children are less well described. Therefore, this study aimed to examine plasma MMA, holoTC, and total Cbl in children and adolescents aged 0–18 years and to derive age-dependent reference intervals.

### Neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency and its treatment [^111RQfgA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

In developed countries, vitamin B12 deficiency usually occurs in children who are exclusively breast-fed by mothers on vegetarian diets, leading to low stores of vitamin B12. Symptoms of deficiency typically appear during the second trimester of life and include failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and arrest or regression of developmental skills. Megaloblastic anemia can also be present.

Half of the infants exhibit abnormal movements before the start of treatment with intramuscular cobalamin, which disappear 1 or 2 days after initiation of therapy. More rarely, movement disorders appear a few days after treatment, despite other neurological symptoms improving. These abnormal movements can persist for 2 to 6 weeks. Untreated vitamin B12 deficiency may result in lasting neurodisability.

Efforts should be concentrated on preventing deficiency in pregnant and breast-feeding women adhering to vegan diets and their infants by administering vitamin B12 supplements. In cases where preventive supplementation has failed, it is critical to promptly recognize and treat infants presenting with failure to thrive and delayed development.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^111ygkZd]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L, as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay. We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

- **Results**: Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22; p = 0.015).

- **Interpretation**: Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend acknowledging that low serum vitamin B12 levels may be seen in the presence of folate deficiency or due to technical issues with measurement. Additionally, neurological symptoms due to cobalamin deficiency may occur even when the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal.

### Post renal transplant anemia: severity, causes and their association with graft and patient survival [^116tnmDh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a concern as total serum vitamin B12 is not a reliable biomarker of vitamin B12 availability. We chose to define vitamin B12 deficiency as levels below 300 pmol/L, a definition suggested by others for borderline cases and deficiency. Graft failure was defined as chronic (≥ 3 months) treatment with hemodialysis, re-transplantation, or death with a functioning graft. Acute rejection was determined by renal biopsy showing rejection with a Banff score of 1A or higher. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to the KDIGO criteria.

- **Data collection**: Patients' characteristics were collected at baseline. We documented all available episodes of anemia for each patient. An episode of anemia was defined as the first time a decreased level of hemoglobin (Hb) was documented, according to WHO criteria. For each episode of anemia, a full laboratory workup was collected. For patients without anemia, laboratory data were collected six months after transplantation. Acute infections based on culture, serological results, and biopsy-proven acute graft rejections were extracted from the electronic chart. All possible causes of anemia for each episode were reviewed by two researchers, and in cases of disagreement, a third researcher evaluated the case.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was the composite endpoint of graft failure (return to dialysis or re-transplantation) and all-cause mortality by the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included death-censored graft failure, defined as the re-establishment of long-term dialysis therapy or the need for re-transplantation, and all-cause mortality with a functioning graft.

### Serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine in major depressive disorder, part 1: Predictors of clinical response in fluoxetine-resistant depression [^115pNtzc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

In the present study, we assessed the relationship between serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels and clinical response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had previously failed to respond to open treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day. The patients were enrolled in a 4-week, double-blind trial of either (1) fluoxetine dose increase, (2) lithium augmentation of fluoxetine, or (3) desipramine augmentation of fluoxetine.

Fifty-five outpatients (mean ± SD age = 41.7 ± 10.6 years; 50.9% women) with MDD, assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R and enrolled in the double-blind trial, had serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine measurements completed at baseline (prior to fluoxetine treatment initiation). Folate levels were classified as either low or normal (≥ 13.2 micromol/L). Using logistic regression, we then assessed the relationship between (1) low or normal folate levels, (2) normal or low B12 levels, and (3) elevated or normal homocysteine levels and clinical response to double-blind treatment. The study was conducted from November 1992 to January 1999.

Low serum folate levels (χ² = 3.626, p = .04), but not elevated homocysteine (p > .05) or low vitamin B12 levels (p > .05), were associated with poorer response to treatment. The response rates for patients with (N = 14) and without (N = 38) low folate levels were 7.1%…

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^111SHLLV]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The distribution of the fractions of B12 measured in the blood adds complexity to understanding the neurological manifestation of B12 deficiency. Once cobalamin is absorbed, the transport proteins haptocorrin (HC) and transcobalamin (TC) bind it with great affinity and act as transporters in circulation. Since only TC has a specific receptor (CD320) for cellular uptake, Holo-TC is usually considered to be biologically available for cells ("active"). On the other hand, Holo-HC hypothetically represents the fraction of B12 that is not immediately available to tissues ("inactive"); it can only bind non-specific asialoglycoprotein receptors on liver cells for reuptake, degradation, and excretion in the bile.

In this work, we hypothesized that lower total B12 levels within the specified normal range may still be associated with subtle functional and structural neurological deficits if the active fraction of plasma B12 (Holo-TC) is too low to sustain adequate cellular B12 needs. To that end, we evaluated the association of B12 concentrations with markers of myelin integrity (multifocal VEP; mfVEP), cognitive performance, blood biomarkers of neuronal and glial integrity, as well as quantitative brain MRI analyses across a spectrum of measurable B12 levels and the active fraction of the plasma B12.

When screening and diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning diagnostic criteria, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency when vitamin B12 levels are less than 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L) or if vitamin B12 levels fall below the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the local reference range, especially in the presence of a strong clinical suspicion.

### Serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine in major depressive disorder, part 2: Predictors of relapse during the continuation phase of pharmacotherapy [^112KoPhc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

In the present study, we assessed the relationship between serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels on the rate of relapse in outpatients with remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) during a 28-week continuation phase of treatment with fluoxetine.

- **Method**: Seventy-one outpatients (mean ± SD age = 40.2 ± 11.1 years; 56.3% women) with MDD (as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R) who had remitted and who were enrolled in the continuation phase of treatment with fluoxetine had serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine measurements completed at baseline (prior to acute-phase treatment). Patients were followed for 28 weeks of continued treatment with fluoxetine 40 mg/day to monitor for depressive relapse. Folate levels were classified as either low (≤ 13.2 micromol/L) or normal. With the use of separate logistic regressions, we then assessed the relationship between folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine level status and relapse. The study was conducted from November 1992 to January 1999.

- **Results**: The presence of low serum folate levels (p = .004), but not low B12 (p > .05) or elevated homocysteine levels (p > .05), was associated with relapse during continuation treatment with fluoxetine. The relapse rates for patients with (N = 7) and without (N = 64) low folate levels were 42.9% versus 3.2%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Low serum folate levels were found to plac

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: A prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^114Twg2C]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Our study on subjectively healthy elderly Caucasian participants from a circumscribed geographical region shows for the first time that holoTC, but also vitamin B12 levels from 60 years onwards, remain within RIs set by international expert panels with people from all ages, whereas serum folate concentrations — though not RBC folate — recede to some extent. It could be shown that MMA, Hcy, as well as Fedosov's wellness quotient, are more associated with kidney function than with age. Finally, we were able to present reference intervals and decision limits for the different investigated markers in the elderly.

An overwhelming proportion of the literature implies that, with progressing age, vitamin B12 and folate levels in senior citizens fall short of currently validated RIs, a finding that is challenged by our data obtained from participants apparently in good health and with a relatively uniracial background. Most other studies, on meta-analysis, reveal cohorts comprised of study subjects seeking treatment, already ill, or even subject to multimorbidity. The recruitment of study subjects apparently devoid of cognitive impairment might further augment the proportion of those with maintained vitamin B12 and folate levels now known to impinge on cognitive performance. With the recent discoveries regarding the indispensable functions of vitamin B12 and folate in living organisms, it comes as little surprise that vitamin B12 and, to a lesser extent, folate, maintain their levels throughout our life cycle, or else the participating subjects would not have been…

### Vitamin B12 deficiency in the aged: A population-based study [^1151Xb4r]. Age and Ageing (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in the aged population, but it is controversial whether only some risk groups should be investigated rather than screening the entire aged population.

- **Objectives**: To describe the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the Finnish aged population and to determine if subjects especially prone to vitamin B12 deficiency could be identified by risk factors or clinical correlates.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional, population-based study of 1,048 aged subjects (age 65–100 years) was conducted. Data on lifestyle factors and clinical conditions were collected, physical examinations were conducted, and laboratory variables related to vitamin B12 were measured.

- **Results**: Vitamin B12 deficiency had been previously diagnosed in 27 (2.6%) subjects, and a laboratory diagnosis (total vitamin B12 or ≥ 15 micromol/l) was made for 97 (9.5%) subjects. Low serum total vitamin B12 (or ≤ 75), older age (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.4), and refraining from milk products (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.4) increased the probability of vitamin B12 deficiency. Anemia (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.7–2.3) or macrocytosis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7) did not predict vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency is remarkably common in the aged population, but no specific risk group for screening can be identified. Thus, biochemical screening of unselected individuals is necessary.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116rzU6b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population-based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained. Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often-reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo-TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo-TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system.

### The homocysteine controversy [^113dPwKP]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, independent from classical atherothrombotic risk factors. In the last decade, a number of large intervention trials using B vitamins have been performed and have shown no benefit of homocysteine-lowering therapy in high-risk patients. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies failed to convincingly demonstrate that a genetic polymorphism commonly associated with higher homocysteine levels (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C > T) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Together, these findings have cast doubt on the role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, and the homocysteine hypothesis has turned into a homocysteine controversy. In this review, we attempt to find solutions to this controversy. First, we explain that the Mendelian randomization analyses have limitations that preclude final conclusions. Second, several characteristics of intervention trials limit the interpretation and generalizability of their results. Finally, the possibility that homocysteine lowering is in itself beneficial but is offset by adverse side effects of B vitamins on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. As we explain, such side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid) or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

### Vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels predict different outcomes in early Parkinson's disease [^116TNUAC]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In moderately advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), low serum vitamin B12 levels are common and associated with neuropathy and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about B12 in early PD. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of low vitamin B12 status in early PD and whether it is associated with clinical progression.

Methods involved measuring vitamin B12 and other B12 status determinants (methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and holotranscobalamin) in 680 baseline and 456 follow-up serum samples collected from DATATOP participants with early, untreated PD. Borderline low B12 status was defined as serum B12 < 300 pmol/L with homocysteine > 15µmol/L. Outcomes included the UPDRS, ambulatory capacity score (sum of UPDRS items 13–15, 29 & 30), and MMSE, calculated as annualized rates of change.

Results showed that at baseline, 13% of participants had borderline low B12 levels, 7% had elevated homocysteine, while 2% had both. Elevated homocysteine at baseline was associated with worse scores on the baseline MMSE. Analysis of study outcomes indicated that participants in the low B12 tertile (< 234 pmol/L; 317 pg/mL) developed greater morbidity, as assessed by greater annualized worsening of the ambulatory capacity score. Elevated homocysteine was associated with a greater annualized decline in MMSE (-1.96 vs. 0.06; P = 0.001). Blood count indices were not associated with B12 or homocysteine status.

In conclusion, the study found that low B12 status was common in early PD. Low B12 at baseline predicted greater worsening of mobility, whereas elevated homocysteine was associated with cognitive decline.

### Diabetes as a cause of clinically significant functional cobalamin deficiency [^1132PvLs]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Research design and methods**: Laboratory methods - Because tHcy levels increase in many settings, MMA was used as a more specific index of Cbl deficiency. Serum Cbl and MMA were measured as previously described (normal reference ranges: 200–1,100 pg/mL and 90–250 nmol/L, respectively). When MMA and Cbl were measured on more than one occasion within a 4-week period without a change in treatment, the average values were used for analysis. Functional Cbl deficiency was defined as MMA levels > 250 nmol/L when serum Cbl values were > 400 pg/mL.

- **Patients**: A retrospective review of the medical records of all ambulatory community-dwelling patients evaluated for Cbl deficiency between 1 August 1993 and 30 June 2005 was conducted as previously described. In a preliminary analysis of nondiabetic subjects with Cbl values > 400 pg/mL, the geometric mean MMA value in subjects aged 1.4 mg/dL were excluded from analysis. For a brief period, normal MMA values were reported as "less than 400 nmol/L", and these patients were also excluded from analysis (n = 19).

ConCbl and MMA values were obtained in 370 individuals on 432 occasions, including 47 individuals with type 2 diabetes evaluated on 59 occasions. Fifty-four patients who were not included in the analysis were removed for clarity.

### Cumulative incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with Alzheimer disease [^115BbuF2]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Although vitamin B12 is routinely measured in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) at the time of the initial diagnosis, it is not known if repeat vitamin B12 measurements are indicated to detect new deficiency cases. We aimed to determine the incidence of de-novo vitamin B12 deficiency over a period of 3 years in a cohort of AD patients without a prior diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and with initial vitamin B12 levels greater than 350 ng/L.

- **Methods**: Vitamin B12 levels were measured at the time of AD diagnosis and repeated 3 years later in 102 consecutive patients unless a diagnosis of B12 deficiency was made in the interim.

- **Results**: Vitamin B12 deficiency was diagnosed in 7 patients, corresponding to a cumulative incidence in the cohort studied of 7.6% after 3 years of follow-up. Statistical comparison of initial and repeat vitamin B12 measurements in patients that completed follow-up showed a significant reduction in levels (p = 0.003). Among the 79 subjects with follow-up, 17 patients (22%, 95% CI, 13%-32%) had a repeat level less than 350 ng/L. No significant correlates of deficiency incidence were identified.

- **Conclusion**: Our pilot data indicate that vitamin B12 levels decreased in this cohort of AD patients, putting a substantial percentage at risk of deficiency and reaching a deficiency state in a meaningful number of patients. Repeat screening for B12 deficiency after approximately 2 years of follow-up seems warranted in order to prevent hematological and neurological manifestations that may significantly alter their quality of life.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of the cobalamin-related remethylation disorders cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG, cblJ and MTHFR deficiency [^113enpz1]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

MTHFR deficiency mainly presents in early childhood but can potentially present at any age with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. Neonates and young infants often manifest with feeding difficulties, decreased consciousness, hydrocephalus, and muscular hypotonia. Apnea is a frequent complication.

Older infants and children frequently manifest with seizures and cognitive impairment, often displaying acquired microcephaly. With increasing age, peripheral neuropathy, gait abnormalities, and spasticity may become evident, and some older patients manifest with additional or even isolated behavioral or psychiatric disorders.

Individuals with MTHFR deficiency do not usually present with hematological abnormalities. There are just a few reports of older children and adults with megaloblastic anemia in association with long-standing neurological manifestations.

- **Outcome: Timely clinical diagnosis**: We strongly recommend consideration of an acquired or genetic disorder of remethylation in the case of neurological, visual, and/or hematological symptoms (Quality of the evidence: moderate). We also strongly recommend considering an acquired or genetic disorder of remethylation in the case of unexplained thrombosis, spinal cord degeneration, and/or atypical HUS (Quality of the evidence: moderate).

### Laboratory assessment of vitamin B12 status [^115i7Tip]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and correction of vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency prevent megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. B12 status is commonly estimated using the abundance of the vitamin in serum, with approximately 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L) typically set as the threshold for diagnosing deficiency. Serum B12 assays measure the sum of haptocorrin-bound and transcobalamin-bound (known as holotranscobalamin) B12. It is only holotranscobalamin that is taken up by cells to meet metabolic demand.

Although receiver operator characteristic curves show holotranscobalamin measurement to be a moderately more reliable marker of B12 status than serum B12, both assays have an indeterminate range. Biochemical evidence of metabolic abnormalities consistent with B12 insufficiency is frequently detected despite an apparently sufficient abundance of the vitamin. Laboratory B12 status markers that reflect cellular utilization rather than abundance are available.

Two forms of B12 act as coenzymes for two different reactions. Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin for the remethylation of methionine from homocysteine. A homocysteine concentration greater than 20 μmol/L may suggest B12 deficiency in folate-replete patients. In the second B12-dependent reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase uses adenosylcobalamin to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In B12 deficiency, excess methylmalonyl-CoA is hydrolyzed to methylmalonic acid. A serum concentration greater than 280 nmol/L may suggest suboptimal status in young patients with normal renal function.

### Vitamin b12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels.

A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is the measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Cobalamin-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting: Unreliability of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine testing [^112wjH6s]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Early recognition of cobalamin (Cbl)-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting is essential to prevent irreversible neurologic deficits. However, diagnostic algorithms using Cbl, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine (HCys) measurements reflect studies in academic centers, and their negative predictive values have not been established. Records of 456 ambulatory patients evaluated for Cbl deficiency at a staff model HMO were reviewed. Pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values in individual patients varied by 23%, 23%, and 17%, respectively, over 2 to 6 weeks.

Hematologic or neurologic responses to pharmacologic doses of Cbl occurred in 37 of the 95 evaluable patients. In these patients, pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values were normal in 54%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. If therapy had been restricted to symptomatic patients with both low or intermediate Cbl levels and increased metabolite values, 63% of responders would not have been treated. Twenty-five patients did not respond to treatment, including 5 of 11 patients (45%) with low Cbl, 22 of 49 patients (45%) with high MMA, and 13 of 30 patients (43%) with high HCys values.

It is concluded that Cbl, MMA, and HCys levels fluctuate with time and neither predict nor preclude the presence of Cbl-responsive hematologic or neurologic disorders.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^117XBUaq]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

For the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA), the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend further evaluation with MMA, serum total homocysteine, or holotranscobalamin in patients with serum cobalamin levels greater than 148 pmol/L when there is a strong clinical suspicion of cobalamin deficiency. In such cases, a trial of hydroxocobalamin should be administered to determine any clinical improvement.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: a prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^1154TzaD]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Whereas the vitamin B12 and holoTC levels remain steady after 60 years of age, we observed a significant increment in MMA levels accompanied by increments in Hcy; the latter is better explained by age-related reduced kidney function than by vitamin B12 insufficiency. Total serum folate levels, but not RBC folate levels, decreased with progressing age. The present work evaluated decision limits for the use of these parameters in the elderly.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin deficiency: Importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^1137q35K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

- **Methods**: A retrospective record-review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and measurement of MMA.

- **Results**: When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < .01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

- **Conclusion**: In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when three or more oxidant risks are present.

### Paradoxical elevation of both serum B12 and methylmalonic acid levels in assessing B12 status in children with short-bowel syndrome [^115MpXif]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin B12 (B12) levels is routinely used to monitor B12 sufficiency. However, its accuracy may not be reliable in patients with short-bowel syndrome (SBS). The presence of elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels can also be used as a marker for B12 deficiency. Therefore, our aim was to analyze serum B12 and MMA levels simultaneously in a cohort of children with SBS to evaluate the accuracy of these markers in the assessment of B12 status.

- **Methods**: Children ages 1–18 with intestinal failure were eligible for enrollment. MMA and B12 levels were checked simultaneously in all patients, with 93 sets of labs obtained over two years. Fifty percent of the patients were receiving parenteral nutrition. B12 injections were administered to 14 patients who had simultaneously elevated MMA and B12, and a repeat MMA level was measured 4–6 weeks after injection. Data were collected retrospectively.

- **Results**: Forty-eight percent of the lab pairs showed evidence of both elevated MMA and high or normal B12, which contradicted the expected inverse relationship of these markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean MMA values after treatment with B12 injections (412.7 vs 1037.5, P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Paradoxical elevation of MMA with normal or elevated serum B12 is common in children with SBS. Caution should be used when interpreting serum B12 and MMA values in this setting. This may be related to effects of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, a condition commonly seen in these patients.

### Nascobal [^116PAaeS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to beginning treatment with Nascobal, it is essential to obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)].

In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, consider administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to using Nascobal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended initial dose of Nascobal is one spray (500 mcg) administered in one nostril once weekly. Administer Nascobal at least one hour before or one hour after ingesting hot foods or liquids since hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer use of Nascobal in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until after symptoms have subsided.

- **Monitoring, dosage modifications, and treatment duration**:
	- **Monitoring for response and safety**: Monitor serum B12 levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of therapy. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
	- **Dosage modifications**: If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment with Nascobal, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^115GowHv]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically concerning the evaluation for pernicious anemia, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining anti-intrinsic factor antibodies for probable concurrence of pernicious anemia in patients with T2DM and a low serum cobalamin. Do not exclude antibody-negative pernicious anemia if negative.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of the cobalamin-related remethylation disorders cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG, cblJ and MTHFR deficiency [^116tiKQc]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

- **Outcome: Valid, timely laboratory diagnosis**: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is the hallmark of remethylation disorders. We strongly recommend that investigations in patients with a suspected remethylation disorder should start with the measurement of total homocysteine in blood. The blood sample for tHcy should be centrifuged within an hour and kept at +4°C or frozen until analysis. Immunoassays or chromatographic methods are suitable for tHcy measurement.

- **Recommendation 3**: We strongly recommend against measuring free homocysteine instead of total homocysteine (quality of the evidence: moderate).

- **Recommendation 4**: In the case of high total homocysteine, plasma and urine samples for determination of methylmalonic acid (MMA), methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 should be obtained before treatment is started (quality of the evidence: moderate).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^112HHdyc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). High credibility.

To determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations but no other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms daily for 1 month.

The study was carried out in two geriatric hospitals located in the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia. Participants included thirty-one inpatients with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L, without PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illness. The mean age of participants was 81.4 years.

After providing informed consent, participants underwent a comprehensive medical and drug history assessment and completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A dietitian evaluated their oral cobalamin intake. Blood samples were collected for serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate assay, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine. Participants were then randomized to receive 10 micrograms oral cyanocobalamin, 50 micrograms oral cyanocobalamin, or placebo treatment for 1 month. At the end of the treatment period, the investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

Percentage changes in the level of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters, as well as absolute changes in MMSE scores, were calculated and compared between the groups. The groups were further analyzed based on the number of responders who demonstrated a 20% improvement in their level of B12. Chi-square calculations were performed on the changes in serum vitamin B12 levels.

### Hydroxocobalamin [^112BAFUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

- **Precautions**: The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy. Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid, and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis. Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy. Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility have not been performed with hydroxocobalamin.

- **Pregnancy**: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroxocobalamin. It is also not known whether hydroxocobalamin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hydroxocobalamin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Holotranscobalamin — a first choice assay for diagnosing early vitamin B deficiency [^114nWhuF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The performance of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was compared with other markers of vitamin B12 deficiency, and the influence of age, renal function, and thyroid status was examined.

- **Design and interventions**: We examined 937 individuals not treated with vitamin B12 but in whom vitamin B12 deficiency was suspected due to a plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) level above 0.28 micromol L(-1) within the past 4 years. Besides laboratory tests, a structured interview and a neurological examination were performed on 534 individuals. Among these, 140 individuals qualified for a randomized trial (MMA 0.40–2.00 micromol L(-1)). They were randomized to receive injections of vitamin B12 or placebo and were re-examined after 3 months.

- **Setting**: Conducted at one university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.

- **Results**: The ROC curves indicate that holoTC (AUC: 0.90) compared favorably with plasma vitamin B12 (AUC: 0.85) for identifying individuals likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency (MMA ≥ 0.75 micromol L(-1) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) ≥ 15 micromol L(-1)), suggesting that holoTC (AUC: 0.91) could potentially replace combined testing with plasma vitamin B12 and the metabolites. No association was observed between the biochemical markers and symptoms or signs possibly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. HoloTC, TC saturation, plasma vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy were significantly associated with plasma creatinine (all with P < 0.001). Only tHcy was significantly associated with thyroid stimulating hormone (P = 0.02).

HoloTC shows promise as a first-line test for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Maternal B12, folate and homocysteine concentrations and offspring cortisol and cardiovascular responses to stress [^1142DWGW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Offspring of mothers with low B12 status exhibited significantly lower baseline cortisol concentrations compared to those of mothers with normal B12 levels (median: 6.3 ng/mL [interquartile range 4.8–8.2] vs. 7.1 ng/mL [5.1–9.8] in the normal B12 group; adjusted P = 0.03). There were no significant associations between maternal folate or homocysteine concentrations and offspring baseline cortisol concentrations.

In a mixed model analysis, maternal low B12 status was associated with a higher cortisol response to stress (0.36 SD [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.57 SD] increase from baseline in peak cortisol response at 30 minutes in the maternal low B12 group, compared to the normal B12 group; P < .001). Maternal B12 concentration, as a continuous outcome, was negatively associated with cortisol response (–0.13 [–0.22, –0.03] P = 0.01), although this association was nonsignificant when tested at the Bonferroni adjusted significance level of P = 0.001.

### Efficacy of B vitamins in lowering homocysteine in older men: Maximal effects for those with B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia [^113oVPpr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

A higher plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies, largely in younger individuals, have shown that B vitamins lowered tHcy by substantial amounts and that this effect is greater in people with higher tHcy and lower folate levels.

- **Methods**: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 299 men aged ≥ 75 years. The treatment involved a daily tablet containing 2 mg of folate, 25 mg of B6, and 400 microg of B12, compared with a placebo. The study groups were balanced regarding age (mean ± SD, 78.9 ± 2.8 years), B vitamins, and tHcy at baseline.

- **Results**: Among the 13% with B12 deficiency, the difference in mean changes in treatment and control groups for tHcy was 6.74 micromol/L (95% CI, 3.94 to 9.55 micromol/L) compared with 2.88 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.07 to 5.69 micromol/L) for all others. Among the 20% with hyperhomocysteinemia, the difference between mean changes in treatment and control groups for men with high plasma tHcy compared with the rest of the group was 2.8 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9 micromol/L). Baseline vitamin B12, serum folate, and tHcy were significantly associated with changes in plasma tHcy at follow-up (r = 0.252, r = 0.522, and r = -0.903, respectively; P = 0.003, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) in the vitamin group.

- **Conclusions**: The tHcy-lowering effect of B vitamins was maximal in those who had low B12 or high tHcy levels. Community-dwelling older men, who are likely to be deficient in B12 or have hyperhomocysteinemia, may benefit from this treatment.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^116Kpc4h]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hemopoetic, neuro-cognitive, and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations ranging from impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia, and pancytopenia. This review article offers a perspective on:

- **Physiological roles of vitamin B12**: The micronutrient is vital for several body functions.

- **Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency**: Understanding these mechanisms helps in identifying and managing the deficiency.

- **Screening for vitamin B12 deficiency**: Regular screening could be crucial for early detection, especially among patients with diabetes mellitus.

- **Vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus**: Investigates if supplementation is necessary and justified for this group.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^117JpGBz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

**Study cohort**: We identified 352,831 persons without prevalent cancer who had plasma Cbl levels ≥ 200 pmol/L. Of these, 19,164 patients were receiving Cbl therapy at the time of plasma Cbl measurement and were therefore excluded. Of the patients included in the study, 19,665 (6%) had levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). The total number of person-years of follow-up was 1,421,512, with a median follow-up time of 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.9–6.2 years). The median age was 55.1 years (IQR = 40.2–69.2 years). The distribution of outpatients and inpatients was 276,229 (83%) and 57,438 (17%), respectively. A total of 22,652 (7%) patients in the study cohort subsequently developed cancer during the period from 1998 to 2010.

### The homocysteine controversy [^111gJnSV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Awaiting the results of upcoming studies, what should we do with our high-risk patients? Clearly, an evidence-based recommendation is impossible. The evidence collected so far indicates that a single high-dose B-vitamin therapy in all patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) does not reduce events after five years. In view of our discussion, the following policy may be considered:

- **Do not screen** routinely for hyperhomocysteinemia in high-risk patients, but only if:
	- An inborn error of 1-carbon metabolism is suspected based on the clinical phenotype.
	- CVD occurs prematurely (i.e. before 50 years, with the cutoff depending on the conventional risk factor profile) in the patient or their family.
	- B-vitamin depletion is suspected based on history or comorbidity.

- **Do not treat** mild hyperhomocysteinemia routinely, but only if fasting levels exceed a certain threshold of 20–25 μmol/l, for example.

- **Upon decision to treat**:
	- Do not use high-dose B-vitamin preparations routinely.
	- Start with a multivitamin containing moderate amounts of folate, B12, and B6.
	- Switch to high-dose B vitamins only if homocysteine levels remain clearly elevated.

- **Keep an eye on** the literature.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years.

Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms.

Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^114rnp3w]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend recognizing that serum cobalamin levels fall during pregnancy and are less reliable in determining underlying deficiency. Consider obtaining holotranscobalamin, if available, rather than serum cobalamin in determining vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnancy.
