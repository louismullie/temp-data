## Question

Will increasing cinacalcet lower calcium levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether increasing cinacalcet will lower calcium levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism of cinacalcet and whether it predicts a dose-dependent calcium effect. Then, I should verify pharmacodynamic data on the relationship between cinacalcet exposure, PTH suppression, and serum calcium changes. Next, I will review randomized trials and observational cohorts for dose–response evidence. After that, I need to check regulatory labeling for dose-titration guidance and hypocalcemia management. Finally, I will consider special populations and safety thresholds before synthesizing a clear answer with practical monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get that wrong, everything else will be off. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that allosterically sensitizes the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor to extracellular calcium, which suppresses PTH synthesis and secretion; importantly, the FDA label explicitly states that the reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium, establishing a mechanistic expectation that higher cinacalcet effect should lower calcium further [^112oDpvv].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacodynamics before jumping to conclusions. The nadir in iPTH occurs about 2–6 hours post-dose and correlates with cinacalcet plasma concentrations; after steady state (about 7 days following a dose change), serum calcium remains relatively constant over the dosing interval, but the overall effect is downward on calcium as dose increases, consistent with a concentration-dependent suppression of PTH and calcium [^1115ckDg].

> Next, I should review randomized trials for dose–response evidence. In hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, cinacalcet titrated from 30 to 180 mg reduced iPTH by about 43% and lowered serum calcium and the calcium–phosphorus product compared with placebo. In CKD not on dialysis, 62% of cinacalcet-treated patients had two consecutive calcium values less than 8.4 mg/dL versus 1% on placebo, indicating a robust calcium-lowering signal with therapeutic dosing [^114ep5B8] [^1176Z3Vt].

> Hold on, I should verify whether higher doses translate to greater calcium reductions in hypercalcemic states. In primary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid carcinoma, cinacalcet titration (often up to 90 mg four times daily) consistently normalizes or substantially reduces serum calcium in a majority of patients, with mean calcium reductions of roughly 1–2 mg/dL in trials and case series, reinforcing a dose–response relationship for calcium lowering as the dose is escalated to effect [^115TFaG1] [^112nLEAA] [^114mHjs1].

> I need to check real-world and discontinuation data to ensure this isn't just a trial artifact. After cinacalcet is stopped, calcium tends to rise and PTH increases, whereas during treatment calcium remains lower; large dialysis cohorts show sustained biochemical control with cinacalcet and prompt loss of control after discontinuation, which indirectly supports the causal calcium-lowering effect of ongoing therapy and dose exposure [^1161FLmU] [^115VpgLw] [^116D3G6d].

> Let me consider the regulatory position, because that often codifies the clinical dose–calcium relationship. FDA labeling directs dose titration every 2–4 weeks through 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg to a PTH target in dialysis, with explicit instruction to monitor calcium frequently and manage hypocalcemia by adding calcium, vitamin D, or temporarily withholding cinacalcet; initiation is contraindicated if calcium is below normal, underscoring the expected calcium-lowering effect and the need for surveillance during uptitration [^114KL14M] [^1117qSjs] [^112GZpuR].

> But wait, what about special populations where the calcium drop might be more pronounced. In CKD not on dialysis, hypocalcemia occurs more frequently, with about 80% experiencing calcium less than 8.4 mg/dL in a phase 3 study, so dose increases there carry a higher risk of low calcium and warrant closer monitoring; conversely, in parathyroid carcinoma or severe primary hyperparathyroidism, higher doses are often required to achieve meaningful calcium reductions, reflecting disease severity rather than loss of effect [^1176Z3Vt] [^113QPnHu] [^114mHjs1].

> I should double-check safety thresholds and management steps so the clinical advice is actionable. Mild to moderate hypocalcemia is common and often manageable with calcium supplementation, calcium-based phosphate binders, or vitamin D; severe hypocalcemia (for example, less than 7.5 mg/dL) warrants holding cinacalcet and reassessing the regimen, and patients at risk of QT prolongation or seizures require vigilant calcium monitoring because hypocalcemia can precipitate arrhythmias and seizures in susceptible individuals [^116CGi3N] [^114uY6WL] [^114Jpd3J].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, increasing cinacalcet generally lowers serum calcium in a dose-dependent fashion via enhanced CaSR sensitivity and PTH suppression. The magnitude varies with baseline PTH, calcium, and kidney status, but the direction is consistent across mechanistic, clinical trial, observational, and regulatory sources, so dose uptitration should proceed with scheduled calcium checks and a plan to prevent or treat hypocalcemia [^112oDpvv] [^11219uM8] [^114KL14M].

---

Increasing cinacalcet dose **lowers serum calcium** by enhancing calcium-sensing receptor sensitivity [^112oDpvv], suppressing PTH [^1115ckDg], and reducing calcium release from bone and intestinal absorption. Clinically significant hypocalcemia is common, especially in CKD not on dialysis [^113QPnHu], and **requires close monitoring** [^116CGi3N] and dose adjustment to prevent symptoms and complications [^114uY6WL].

---

## Mechanism of action and calcium-lowering effect

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that **increases CaSR sensitivity** [^112oDpvv], suppressing PTH secretion and thereby reducing calcium release from bone, intestinal absorption, and renal reabsorption [^1115ckDg]. This mechanism directly lowers serum calcium, with the effect proportional to dose and PTH suppression [^112oDpvv].

---

## Clinical evidence of dose-dependent calcium reduction

Multiple studies demonstrate a **dose-dependent reduction in serum calcium** with cinacalcet:

- **Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in CKD on dialysis**: Cinacalcet titrated from 30 to 180 mg reduced calcium by ~0.5–1.0 mg/dL, with 66% experiencing calcium < 8.4 mg/dL and 29% < 7.5 mg/dL in 26-week trials [^111Xwgcd].

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)**: In patients unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, cinacalcet normalized calcium in 75.8% vs 0% with placebo, with a median dose of 60 mg/day [^116kwi25].

- **Parathyroid carcinoma**: Cinacalcet reduced calcium by ~1.7 mg/dL in open-label studies, with doses up to 90 mg four times daily [^112nLEAA].

---

## Incidence and severity of hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia is a common adverse effect, and its **risk increases with higher doses**:

| **Clinical population** | **Incidence of hypocalcemia** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| CKD on dialysis | 66% < 8.4 mg/dL; 29% < 7.5 mg/dL | Mild to severe |
| CKD not on dialysis | 80% < 8.4 mg/dL; 12% < 7.5 mg/dL | Mild to severe |
| Primary HPT | 6.1% < 8.4 mg/dL | Mild to moderate |
| Parathyroid carcinoma | 88% ≥ 1 mg/dL reduction | Mild to severe |

---

Most cases are **asymptomatic or mild** [^1138xek9], but severe hypocalcemia can cause paresthesia, muscle spasms, seizures, and QT prolongation [^113QPnHu].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **careful monitoring and dose adjustment** to prevent hypocalcemia:

- **Monitoring**: Measure serum calcium within 1 week of initiation or dose change [^114KL14M]; once stable, monitor monthly for dialysis and every 2 months for PHPT or parathyroid carcinoma [^116CGi3N].

- **Management of hypocalcemia**: Increase calcium intake, calcium-based phosphate binders, or vitamin D sterols; reduce or hold cinacalcet if calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL or symptoms occur [^116CGi3N] [^114uY6WL].

- **Contraindications**: Do not initiate if serum calcium is below normal [^112GZpuR].

---

## Factors influencing the magnitude of calcium reduction

Several factors influence the **degree of calcium reduction** with cinacalcet:

- **Baseline PTH and calcium**: Higher baseline PTH and calcium predict greater calcium reduction [^notfound].

- **Renal function**: Lower baseline calcium in CKD not on dialysis increases hypocalcemia risk [^113QPnHu].

- **Concomitant medications**: Vitamin D analogs and calcium supplements can mitigate hypocalcemia [^116CGi3N].

---

## Clinical implications and patient management

Clinicians should anticipate **hypocalcemia** when increasing cinacalcet and adjust therapy accordingly:

- **Patient education**: Teach symptoms of hypocalcemia and when to seek care [^114uY6WL].

- **Dose titration**: Adjust slowly and monitor calcium frequently during titration [^114KL14M].

- **Combination therapy**: Use calcium supplements, phosphate binders, or vitamin D to maintain calcium within target ranges [^114uY6WL].

---

Increasing cinacalcet dose **reliably lowers serum calcium** through PTH suppression; **close monitoring and proactive management** are essential to prevent clinically significant hypocalcemia [^114KL14M].

QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia

Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to cinacalcet tablets. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Seizures

In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of cinacalcet-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Concurrent Administration with Other Calcium-Lowering Drug Products

Concurrent administration of cinacalcet tablets with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving cinacalcet tablets and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels.

Patient Education and Hypocalcemia Treatment

Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Cinacalcet tablet dose reduction or discontinuation of cinacalcet tablet may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

14.1 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

Three 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of similar design were conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis. A total of 665 patients were randomized to cinacalcet tablets and 471 patients to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 54 years, 62% were male, and 52% were Caucasian. The average baseline iPTH level by the Nichols IRMA was 712 pg/mL, with 26% of the patients having a baseline iPTH level > 800 pg/mL. The mean baseline Ca × P product was 61 mg²/dL². The average duration of dialysis prior to study enrollment was 67 months. Ninety-six percent of patients were on hemodialysis and 4% on peritoneal dialysis. At study entry, 66% of the patients were receiving vitamin D sterols and 93% were receiving phosphate binders. Cinacalcet tablets (or placebo) was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and titrated every 3 or 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve an iPTH of ≤ 250 pg/mL. The dose was not increased if a patient had any of the following: iPTH ≤ 200 pg/mL, serum calcium < 7.8 mg/dL, or any symptoms of hypocalcemia. If a patient experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia or had a serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL, calcium supplements and/or calcium-based phosphate binders could be increased. If these measures were insufficient, the vitamin D dose could be increased. Approximately 70% of patients in the cinacalcet arm and 80% of the patients in the placebo arm completed the 6-month studies. In the primary efficacy analysis, 40% of the patients on cinacalcet tablets and 5% of placebo-treated patients achieved an iPTH ≤ 250 pg/mL (p < 0.001) (Table 7, Figure 1). These studies showed that cinacalcet tablets reduced iPTH while lowering Ca x P, calcium, and phosphorus levels (Table 7, Figure 2). The median dose of cinacalcet tablets at the completion of the studies was 90 mg. Patients with milder disease typically required lower doses.

### The calcimimetic cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium in subjects with primary hyperparathyroidism [^112ts3ed]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Calcimimetics increase the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) to circulating serum calcium, reducing the secretion of PTH and the serum calcium concentration. We evaluated the calcimimetic cinacalcet, a novel therapy for the management of primary hyperparathyroidism. In this randomized, double-blind, dose-finding study, patients (n = 22) with primary hyperparathyroidism were given cinacalcet (30, 40, or 50 mg) or placebo twice daily for 15 d and observed for an additional 7 d. Serum calcium, plasma PTH, and 24-h and fasting urine calcium were measured. Baseline mean serum calcium was 10.6 mg/dl for the combined cinacalcet-treated patients (normal range, 8.4–10.3 mg/dl), compared with 10.4 mg/dl for the placebo group. Mean PTH at baseline was 102 pg/ml (normal range, 10–65 pg/ml) for the combined cinacalcet-treated patients, compared with 100 pg/ml in the placebo group. Serum calcium normalized after the second dose on d 1 and remained normal through d 15 in all cinacalcet dose groups. Maximum decreases in PTH of over 50% occurred 2–4 h after dosing in all cinacalcet-treated groups. The fasting and 24-h urine calcium to creatinine ratios were similar in the cinacalcet and placebo groups. This study demonstrates that cinacalcet safely normalized serum calcium and lowered PTH concentrations without increasing urinary calcium excretion in the study subjects, indicating the potential benefit of cinacalcet as a medical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism.

12.1 	Mechanism of Action

The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion. Cinacalcet, the active ingredient in cinacalcet tablets, is a calcimimetic agent that directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels.

12.2 	Pharmacodynamics

Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD. The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet. After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.

Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT.

12.3 	Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Distribution

After oral administration of cinacalcet, Cmaxis achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours. Cinacalcet Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)were increased by 82% and 68%, respectively, following administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers. The Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)of cinacalcet were increased by 65% and 50%, respectively, when cinacalcet was administered with a low-fat meal compared with fasting.

After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of approximately 6 hours and a terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 7 days, and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration. The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration. The AUC and Cmaxof cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 mg to 180 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 mg to 180 mg. The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L, indicating extensive distribution. Cinacalcet is approximately 93% to 97% bound to plasma protein(s). The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0.80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng/mL.

### Pediatric clinical studies of sensipar suspended after report of death… [^117PwS91]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has placed a clinical hold on all pediatric clinical studies of Sensipar after the company that makes the drug, Amgen, suspended the studies after the recent death of a 14-year-old patient in a study. FDA continues to gather information on the circumstances surrounding the patient's death. Sensipar is a medication used to decrease the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland. Sensipar lowers high PTH levels leading to lower calcium levels in the blood; when calcium levels are too low it can result in health problems. FDA has approved Sensipar for use in adults but not in children, and the clinical studies were underway to determine if the drug is effective and can be used safely in children.
- Sensipar lowers calcium levels in the blood. Patients should be monitored for the development of low serum calcium levels.
- The potential signs of low serum calcium levels include muscular problems such as muscle cramping, tetany, convulsions, paresthesias, and myalgias.
- If serum calcium levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of a calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with Sensipar.
- Serum calcium levels should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar. Once a maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured monthly.
- The most frequently reported side effects in adult clinical trials of Sensipar were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. FDA has not approved Sensipar for use in children. Sensipar is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist indicated in adults for:

- Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis
- Hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid cancer
- Severe hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy We urge both health care professionals and patients to report adverse events involving Sensipar to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the "Contact FDA" box at the bottom of the page.

### Efficacy and safety of cinacalcet compared with other treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease: a meta-analysis [^114rDEBL]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) occur frequently. CKD patient population experiences a high burden of cardiovascular mortality etyjhigher than general population. There are many causes of CV disease in chronic kidney disease, but mineral and bone disorder (MBD), including hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and vascular calcification. SHPT frequently occurs in patients with chronic renal failure. It is well developed before patients enters ESRD and as hemodialysis progresses, the patient's parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels gradually increase. Traditional SHPT therapies generally includes Vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders. Although Vitamin D sterols can be effective in reducing serum intact PTH (iPTH) levels, it also increases serum levels of calcium and phosphorus, but also leading to hypercalcemia and an elevated serum calcium–phosphorus product. Percutaneous ethanol injection and parathyroidectomy therapies, have potential complications including throat necrosis, laryngeal recurrent nerve injury lead to weakness or paralysis of vocal cord, impaired healing, prolonged pain, and other issues related to surgical intervention.

Cinacalcet, an orally administered calcimimetic agent was originally approved in 2004 for the treatment of SHPT in patients with ESRD. Cinacalcet acts by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on parathyroid cells to extracellular calcium ion levels, thereby decreasing serum PTH without increasing serum calcium, phosphate or the calcium phosphate product (Ca × P) in SHPT patients. In addition, cinacalcet lowers serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) levels in haemodialysis patients.

The difference of effective and safety of cinacalcet in treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD or ESRD with other treatments is controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis and systematic review to quantitatively assess this relationship.

### Pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet over 48 hours in patients with controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism: useful data in clinical practice [^111DVZYw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Cinacalcet induces immediate changes in serum PTH levels, but the pharmacodynamic effect throughout the daily dosing interval in controlled patients is unknown. Also, in patients with reduced PTH, it is unknown what happens in the first 24 hours after withdrawal.

Objective

Our aim was to describe the effect over 48 hours of cinacalcet in hemodialysis patients with controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Design

This was a phase 4, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, single-center clinical trial.

Setting

The study was conducted at a public hospital (Hospital Perpetuo Socorro, Alicante, Spain).

Patients

We included 10 patients on cinacalcet for 6 months or longer with intact PTH (iPTH) levels 100–400 pg/mL [8 men, mean age of 66 years (range 39–82 years)], chronically treated with 30 mg (n = 6), 60 mg (n = 3), or 90 mg (n = 1) of cinacalcet.

Intervention

A single dose (30–90 mg) was administered at baseline.

Main Outcome Measures

iPTH (Duo Kit Scantibodies and Elecsys Roche), PTH 1–84, ionized calcium, phosphorus (P), and calcitonin were determined at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours.

Results

There was a significant reduction in iPTH between 1 and 6 hours, and values returned to baseline at 24 hours [maximum mean (95% confidence interval) percent change from baseline: -50%(-34; -66) at 3 hours]. A transient increase in calcitonin and a decrease in P were also observed, with no changes in calcium. At 48 hours, there was a significant increase in iPTH [+51% (26; 76)] and P. Changes in PTH were similar with the 3 determination methods.

Conclusions

In hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism controlled by cinacalcet, a transient (1–6 hours) reduction in PTH and P and an increase in calcitonin are observed after each daily dose, with return to baseline at 24 hours. After calcimimetics discontinuation, PTH was significantly increased at 48 hours. The assay used to measure PTH does not influence relative changes induced by cinacalcet.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^1112ALFk]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

OPTIMA methodology

A detailed description of the OPTIMA study methods has been presented elsewhere. Briefly, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients with iPTH 300–799 pg/mL, stratified by baseline serum calcium-phosphorus ion product (Ca x P; > 55 vs ≤ 55 mg²/dL²) and baseline vitamin D use, were randomized to receive either a cinacalcet-based regimen or conventional care (vitamin D and/or phosphate binders) in open-label fashion. For patients randomized to conventional care, investigators were allowed flexibility in using a non-cinacalcet regimen (with no specific criteria for vitamin D analogue dosage) to attain KDOQI targets for iPTH, phosphorus, calcium and Ca x P. For those assigned to the cinacalcet-based regimen, dosages of cinacalcet, vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders were optimized over the first 16 weeks, using a predefined treatment algorithm to achieve KDOQI targets.

The starting dose of cinacalcet 30 mg once daily was increased stepwise (maximum 180 mg) if iPTH was > 300 pg/mL (biointact PTH > 150 pg/mL), unless precluded by hypocalcaemia (corrected serum calcium < 8.0 mg/dL) or adverse events. Cinacalcet dose was to be reduced if iPTH was < 150 pg/mL and vitamin D sterols were not being given, or could not be further reduced. If iPTH was < 150 pg/mL and/or calcium and phosphorus exceeded KDOQI targets, vitamin D dosage was reduced by approximately 50%, in sequential steps, until a minimum dose was reached (intravenous calcitriol 0.5 μg, alfacalcidol 1 μg or paricalcitol 2 μg 3 times per week [TIW] or oral calcitriol 0.25 μg TIW or alfacalcidol 0.25 μg/day). Vitamin D dose was increased if iPTH was > 300 pg/mL on the maximum cinacalcet dose, or in the event of hypocalcaemia not resolving with oral calcium supplementation.

### Cinacalcet hydrochloride maintains long-term normocalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Jt4UT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Calcimimetics increase the sensitivity of parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors to extracellular calcium, thereby reducing PTH secretion. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the ability of the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet HCl to achieve long-term reductions in serum calcium and PTH concentrations in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Patients (n = 78) were randomized to cinacalcet or placebo. Cinacalcet was titrated from 30–50 mg twice daily during a 12-wk dose-titration phase. Efficacy was assessed during 12-wk maintenance and 28-wk follow-up phases. The primary endpoint was the achievement of normocalcemia [serum calcium ≤ 10.3 mg/dl (2.57 mmol/liter)] with at least 0.5 mg/dl (0.12-mmol/liter) reduction from baseline. Plasma PTH, serum and urine biochemistry, biochemical measures of bone turnover, bone mineral density, and safety were also assessed. Seventy-three percent of cinacalcet-treated patients vs. only 5% of placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint (P < 0.001). Fasting predose plasma PTH decreased 7.6% in cinacalcet patients but increased 7.7% in placebo patients (P < 0.01). Bone mineral density was unchanged by cinacalcet, but bone resorption and formation markers increased (P < 0.05). Adverse events were mild and similar between treatment groups. Cinacalcet rapidly normalizes serum calcium and reduces PTH in patients with primary HPT, and these effects are maintained with long-term treatment. Cinacalcet may be an effective, nonsurgical approach for management of primary HPT.

14.3 Patients with Hypercalcemia Due to Primary Hyperparathyroidism

Seventeen patients with severe hypercalcemia due to primary HPT, who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy, participated in an open-label, single-arm study. The study consisted of two phases, a dose-titration phase and a maintenance phase. In this trial, severe hypercalcemia was defined as a screening serum calcium level of > 12.5 mg/dL. Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and then were titrated every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg 4 times daily. Dosage escalation during the variable-length (2 to 16 weeks) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), the patient reached the highest possible dosage, or adverse events precluded further dosage increases.

Seventeen patients entered the study. The median exposure to cinacalcet was 270 days (range: 32 to 1,105). At baseline the mean (SE) serum calcium was 12.7 (0.2) mg/dL. At the end of the titration phase the mean (SE) serum calcium was 10.4 (0.3) mg/dL, which is a mean reduction of 2.3 (0.3) mg/dL from baseline. Figure 4 illustrates mean serum calcium (mg/dL) over time for all patients still on study at each time point from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80. Daily dose during the study ranged from 30 mg twice a day to 90 mg four times a day.

### Cinacalcet (sensipar) provides no measurable clinical benefits for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and may accelerate bone loss with prolonged use [^116B6Cfs]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cinacalcet (Sensipar) has been shown to decrease calcium levels in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT); however, few other endpoints have been studied and long-term effects are not known.

Methods

At the discretion of a referring doctor, 70 patients began Cinacalcet as an alternative to surgery for PHPT. Patients were followed as long as the drug was tolerated at which time all underwent parathyroidectomy.

Results

Before treatment, serum calcium levels averaged 11.7 ± 0.5 (range, 11.0–15.1) and PTH averaged 156 ± 42 (range, 88–815); 93% had two or more classic parathyroid symptoms (average, 5.3; range, 0–9). Cinacalcet was discontinued in 19 patients (26%) within 4 months because of nausea/vomiting. The remainder (n = 51) were treated from 8 to 28 months. Calcium levels decreased in all patients but remained variable. PTH levels decreased in 80% of patients but always remained elevated. Only 3 (6%) had symptom relief (p = 0.8), whereas 11 (21.6%) felt worse (p < 0.05). Twenty-three patients took Cinacalcet for > 1.5 years, 14 of which showed significant (> 1 SD) decreases in bone density (p < 0.05), and none had increases in bone density. All had curative outpatient parathyroid surgery followed by partial or complete resolution of symptoms within 3 months in 88% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium but is not tolerated by many patients. Cinacalcet does not provide symptom relief of PHPT and more commonly increases subjective symptoms. Prolonged use is associated with continued bone loss in some patients, possibly due to persistent elevated PTH levels. With very few exceptions, pHPT can be cured via a quick outpatient operation, which remains the treatment of choice.

2.1 Administration

Cinacalcet tablets should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.

Cinacalcet tablets are administered orally and should always be taken whole and not chewed, crushed, or divided.

2.2 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg once daily. Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Cinacalcet tablets should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg/mL. Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet tablets.

Cinacalcet tablets can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and/or phosphate binders.

During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg twice daily.

The dose of cinacalcet tablets should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, and 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels. Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 67 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels, but who are unable to undergo surgery, the most common adverse reactions are listed in Table 4.

Hypocalcemia

In 26-week studies of patients with secondary HPT and CKD on dialysis 66% of patients receiving cinacalcet tablets compared with 25% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL, whereas, 29% of patients receiving cinacalcet tablets compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis in which patients were treated for up to 64 months (mean duration of treatment was 21 months in the cinacalcet group), 75% of patients receiving cinacalcet tablets compared with 29% of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL and 33% of cinacalcet patients compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most of the cases of severe hypocalcemia less than 7.5 mg/dL (21/33 = 64%) occurred during the first 6 months. In this trial, 1.1% of patients receiving cinacalcet tablets and 0.1% of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia.

During a placebo-controlled part of a 52-week study in patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), serum calcium less than 8.4 mg/dL was observed in 6.1% (2/33) of cinacalcet -treated patients and 0% (0/34) of placebo-treated patients.

### Cinacalcet hydrochloride [^111HT7vm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion. Cinacalcet, the active ingredient in cinacalcet tablets, is a calcimimetic agent that directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD. The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet. After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.

Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT.

Absorption and Distribution

After oral administration of cinacalcet, Cmaxis achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours. Cinacalcet Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)were increased by 82% and 68%, respectively, following administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers. The Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)of cinacalcet were increased by 65% and 50%, respectively, when cinacalcet was administered with a low-fat meal compared with fasting.

After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of approximately 6 hours and terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 7 days, and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration. The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration. The AUC and Cmaxof cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg. The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L, indicating extensive distribution. Cinacalcet is approximately 93% to 97% bound to plasma protein(s). The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0.80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng/mL.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet HCl in participants with CKD not receiving dialysis [^1176Z3Vt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is observed in patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet for secondary hyperparathyroidism in participants with CKD not receiving dialysis.

Study Design

Double-blind, randomized, 32-week, phase 3 study.

Setting & Participants

404 participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD from 73 centers in 9 countries.

Interventions

Cinacalcet:placebo (3:1 ratio).

Outcomes & Measurements

Proportion of participants with a mean decrease of 30% or greater in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level, proportion with iPTH level of 70 or less or 110 or less pg/mL (stage 3 and 4 CKD, respectively), and mean percentage of iPTH change from baseline, all during the efficacy-assessment phase.

Results

A greater proportion of cinacalcet than placebo participants achieved a 30% or greater decrease in iPTH level (74% versus 28%; P < 0.001), corresponding to a 43.1% decrease in iPTH level from baseline (cinacalcet) compared with a 1.1% increase (placebo). At week 32, serum calcium levels were 8.9 ± 0.8 mg/dL (-8.9%; cinacalcet) and 9.9 ± 0.6 mg/dL (+0.8%; placebo), phosphorus levels were 4.5 ± 1.0 mg/dL (+21.4%) and 4.0 ± 0.7 mg/dL (+6.8%), and calcium-phosphorus product values were 40.1 ± 8.3 mg²/dL² (+18.9%) and 38.9 ± 6.9 mg²/dL² (+17.1%), respectively. During the study course, 62% (cinacalcet) and 1% (placebo) of participants experienced 2 consecutive serum calcium concentrations less than 8.4 mg/dL. They generally were asymptomatic and without significant clinical consequences. Treatment generally was well tolerated, and most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

Limitations

The study was not designed to assess the effects of cinacalcet on vascular calcification, bone histomorphometric parameters, or other clinical outcomes. It is not known whether the observed differences in changes in iPTH levels are clinically more important than observed differences in changes in serum calcium or phosphorus levels or dosages of vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders.

Conclusions

These data show that cinacalcet treatment in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis can decrease plasma iPTH levels, but with frequent (albeit generally asymptomatic) serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL and increases in serum phosphorus levels.

The probability of discontinuation by month 4 was 56% and by month 12 was 73%. Of those who discontinued (N = 12,521), 76.3% (N = 9,558) reinitiated cinacalcet. The mean time to reinitiation was 4.0 months. Predictors of cinacalcet discontinuation and reinitiation are presented in Table 2. All covariates considered can be found in Additional file 1: Table S5. Baseline PTH, calcium, and phosphorus serum levels were not associated with discontinuation; however, levels most proximal to discontinuation were. Low proximal levels of PTH (< 150 pg/mL) were associated with discontinuation, HR 1.23 (95% CI 1.12, 1.36). There was a slight association between calcium (< 7.5 mg/dL) and discontinuation, HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91, 1.32). Increasing levels of PTH and calcium over time, based on changes in quintile distributions, were also associated with discontinuation, HR 1.15 (95% CI 1.07, 1.23) and HR 1.24 (95% CI 1.16, 1.32), respectively. The dose of cinacalcet most proximal to discontinuation also predicted discontinuation in this population. Compared to 30 mg, a recent dose of 60 mg of cinacalcet slightly predicted discontinuation, HR 1.07 (95% CI 1.00, 1.15), while a recent dose of 90 mg compared to 30 mg had a stronger association, HR 1.15 (95% CI 1.03, 1.29). Other factors associated with discontinuation included increasing copay, in the follow-up period, HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02, 1.07); time spent in the hospital, HR 2.02 (95% CI 1.84, 2.22); being in the Medicare Part D gap period, HR 1.09 (95% CI 1.03, 1.16); and a diagnosis of stroke during follow-up, HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.06, 1.60). Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were not common in our study given the limitation of ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify these outcomes, N = 1,308 30-day intervals (1.2%) and were only slightly predictive of discontinuation, HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91, 1.32). Proximal PTH values in all categories examined did not predict reinitiation of cinacalcet. Both increasing and decreasing levels of PTH over time, based on changes in quintile distributions, were both associated with reinitiation of PTH, HR 1.08 (95% CI 1.03, 1.14) and HR 1.12 (95% CI 1.06, 1.19), respectively. Proximal calcium levels both lower and higher were predictive of cinacalcet reinitiation; however, the results of the sensitivity analysis, which used the calcium value 14 days prior to the date of the laboratory value most proximal to reinitiation, showed that only higher calcium levels were associated with reinitiation, HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.19, 1.33), Additional file 1: Table S6. All other sensitivity analysis results were not greatly changed when prior laboratory values were used to predict reinitiation. Other predictors of reinitiation included low-income subsidy, HR = 1.32 (95% CI 1.22, 1.43), African American race, HR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.03, 1.13), and higher albumin level, HR = 1.23 (95% CI 1.10, 1.36).

### Effects of cinacalcet and concurrent low-dose vitamin D on FGF23 levels in ESRD [^113U6wiv]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in ESRD and have been associated with adverse outcomes. The effects of various treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism on FGF23 levels in ESRD have not been examined in a clinical trial.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We assessed intact FGF23 levels in 91 subjects over the course of the ACHIEVE trial, which was designed to compare escalating doses of Cinacalcet plus fixed low-dose calcitriol analogs (Cinaclcet-D) with titration of calcitriol analogs alone (Flex-D) to suppress parathyroid hormone. Between-group and within-group changes in log-transformed FGF23 levels were analyzed. Factors associated with change in FGF23 were assessed using a multiple regression model.

Results

Intact FGF23 levels were markedly elevated in subjects at baseline. A statistically significant difference in percent change in log FGF23 levels was observed between treatment groups (P < 0.002). The Cinacalcet-D group had a significant decrease in percent change in log FGF23 levels (corrected P = 0.021), whereas FGF23 levels trended toward an increase in the Flex-D group. Change in FGF23 level was significantly associated with changes in levels of phosphate (P < 0.0001) and calcium (P = 0.0002) but not parathyroid hormone.

Conclusions

Treatment with Cinacalcet plus low-dose calcitriol analogs results in lower FGF23 levels compared with a treatment regimen using calcitriol analogs alone in ESRD. The mechanisms underlying the differential effects of these treatment regimens on FGF23 levels and the clinical impact of these changes on FGF23 remain to be defined.

### Effect of cinacalcet availability and formulary listing on parathyroidectomy rate trends [^114utQtB]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

This study reports on changes of PTX trends over time, but cannot establish a causal link between cinacalcet and lower PTX rates. A stronger design would have been to compare PTX rates in patients receiving cinacalcet with rates in patients who did not. However, in the absence of available PTH levels, it was not possible to identify a control group that would have had the same severity of hyperparathyroidism and did not receive cinacalcet. Therefore, results would have suffered from an indication bias. Change in rates may be due to other factors occurring simultaneously with the introduction of cinacalcet. For example, following the publication of the KDOQI Guidelines use of more aggressive treatments such as higher doses of phosphate binders and vitamin D may explain lower PTX rates with time. Decreased use of calcium-based phosphate binders may also explain decreased PTX rates by decreasing serum calcium, which would allow increase vitamin D use. Another explanation would be a change of indication or physician attitude toward PTX. For example, physicians may now tolerate higher PTH level thresholds before considering a PTX. However, these clinical practice changes are usually not acute in time and cinacalcet introduction remains the most probable explanation for the reduction in PTX rates observed. Despite the fact that the drop in PTX rates is visually convincing during the intervention period, we tested six different intervention dates and statistically significant results may be due to chance by multiple testing (limited power precluded applying correction factors such as Bonferroni). The unadjusted PTX rates are presented, since small numbers precluded standardization. An aging population may lead to lower PTX rates while an increasing proportion of prevalent patients may increase PTX rates. However, the population characteristics did not change much during the study years and the same PTX trend pattern was seen among subgroups (Figure 3). Moreover, adjusting PTX rates in the Li et al. study did not make a significant difference in the time period of the current study.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^111TXn91]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the acute setting, PTH-independent hypercalcemia is typically treated with anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid or denosumab. When these agents are no longer able to control hypercalcemia, several case reports have shown the utility of cinacalcet. However, it is not known if cinacalcet can be effective in patients naïve to anti-resorptive therapy or how cinacalcet ameliorates the hypercalcemia.

Case Presentation

A 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis was admitted for left cheek bleeding and swelling from an infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. On admission, he was found to have an elevated albumin-corrected serum calcium of 13.6 mg/dL, a serum phosphorus of 2.2 mg/dL and an intact PTH of 6 pg/mL (normal 18–90) with a PTHrP of 8.1 pmol/L (normal < 4.3), consistent with PTHrP-dependent hypercalcemia. Aggressive intravenous saline hydration and subcutaneous salmon calcitonin were initiated, but his serum calcium remained elevated. Given tooth extractions scheduled for the next day and possible irradiation to the jaw in the near future, alternatives to antiresorptive therapy were sought. Cinacalcet was initiated at 30 mg twice daily then increased to 60 mg twice daily the following day. The albumin-corrected serum calcium level decreased from 13.2 to 10.9 mg/dL within 48 h. The fractional excretion of calcium increased from 3.7 to 7.0%.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates the utility of cinacalcet for the treatment of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia without prior anti-resorptive therapy via increased renal clearance of calcium.

### Cinacalcet for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving hemodialysis [^114ep5B8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D and calcium in patients receiving dialysis is often complicated by hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease and adverse clinical outcomes. Calcimimetics target the calcium-sensing receptor and lower parathyroid hormone levels without increasing calcium and phosphorus levels. We report the results of two identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet hydrochloride.

Methods

Patients who were receiving hemodialysis and who had inadequately controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment were randomly assigned to receive cinacalcet (371 patients) or placebo (370 patients) for 26 weeks. Once-daily doses were increased from 30 mg to 180 mg to achieve intact parathyroid hormone levels of 250 pg per milliliter or less. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with values in this range during a 14-week efficacy-assessment phase.

Results

Forty-three percent of the cinacalcet group reached the primary end point, as compared with 5 percent of the placebo group (P < 0.001). Overall, mean parathyroid hormone values decreased 43 percent in those receiving cinacalcet but increased 9 percent in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The serum calcium-phosphorus product declined by 15 percent in the cinacalcet group and remained unchanged in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Cinacalcet effectively reduced parathyroid hormone levels independently of disease severity or changes in vitamin D sterol dose.

Conclusions

Cinacalcet lowers parathyroid hormone levels and improves calcium-phosphorus homeostasis in patients receiving hemodialysis who have uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism.

QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia

Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet HCl. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to cinacalcet HCl. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving cinacalcet HCl.

Seizures

In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of cinacalcet HCl-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving cinacalcet HCl.

Concurrent Administration with Other Calcium-Lowering Drug Products

Concurrent administration of cinacalcet HCl with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving cinacalcet HCl and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels.

Patient Education and Hypocalcemia Treatment

Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur. If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Cinacalcet HCl dose reduction or discontinuation of cinacalcet HCl may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Experience with cinacalcet in primary hyperparathyroidism: results after 1 year of treatment [^117TQmmt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the characteristics of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) treated with cinacalcet and to evaluate its efficacy in reducing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations after 1 year of treatment.

Methods

The study included 20 patients with PHPT who had completed at least 12 months of treatment with cinacalcet (eight patients for refusal of parathyroidectomy, three for surgery not possible due to comorbidities and nine for progressive hypercalcemia prior to surgery). We recorded clinical and biochemical data at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. We also monitored adverse events. Cinacalcet was administered in increasing doses until normal serum calcium was reached or side effects preventing a further increase occurred.

Results

After 3 months of treatment, serum calcium significantly decreased (11.73 ± 0.85 versus 10.71 ± 1.63 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and serum phosphorus significantly increased (2.41 ± 0.48 versus 2.63 ± 0.70 mg/dl, p = 0.004) while no significant change occurred in PTH (181.91 ± 102.37 versus 195.47 ± 111.71 pg/ml, p = 0.695). No further variation was observed after 6 months compared with 3 months of follow up. However, after 12 months of treatment, there was a significant decrease in PTH concentrations compared with baseline (181.91 ± 102.37 versus 152.47 ± 70.16 pg/ml, p = 0.028) as well as serum calcium (11.73 ± 0.85 versus 10.20 ± 0.95 mg/dl, p < 0.001); serum phosphorus significantly increased (2.41 ± 0.48 versus 2.71 ± 0.43 mg/dl, p = 0.01). Normocalcemia (S-Ca < 10.2 mg/dl) was achieved in 55% of patients. The medication was usually well tolerated (83.4%). Most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting, especially at the beginning of therapy.

Conclusion

Cinacalcet rapidly reduced serum calcium in patients with PHPT and this reduction remained stable after 1 year of treatment. We also observed a decrease in PTH. Cinacalcet is an effective alternative in nonsurgical treatment of PHPT and may be useful in the preoperative hypercalcemia management.

### Association of aberrant mineral metabolic markers with fracture risk in chronic kidney disease: a comprehensive meta-analysis [^112mQ9bL]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, our meta-analysis reveals that elevated serum phosphate, iPTH, and FGF23 are associated with an increased risk of fractures, while low phosphate and low iPTH also contribute to an elevated risk of fractures in CKD population. Regarding calcium levels, while higher calcium levels showed a trend towards reducing fracture risk, this finding was not statistically significant. Similarly, lower calcium levels tended to increase fracture risk, but again, this was not statistically significant. To better understand the relationship between these factors and fracture risk, further research is warranted, particularly regarding the impact of calcium levels on fracture risk in CKD patients. Future studies should consider larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to validate these trends and explore potential clinical intervention strategies. Given the limited data available on non-dialysis CKD populations, future research should focus on conducting trials specifically targeting this group to better understand the efficacy of treatments such as phosphate binders, cinacalcet, and vitamin D analogs in non-dialysis patients. Addressing this gap will provide valuable insights and guide clinical decision-making in the management of mineral bone disorders in this population.

Sixty-seven patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to cinacalcet and 34 patients randomized to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years, 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Blacks. The study started with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range. During the efficacy period a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated patients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% vs 0%, p < 0.001) and ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% vs 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of cinacalcet at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

Calcimimetics

Calcimimetics allosterically modify the CaSR in the parathyroid gland, increasing sensitivity to calcium levels, thus reducing PTH. Calcimimetics can reduce serum PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels; increase BSAP; and diminish osteocalcin and the rate of parathyroidectomy in SHPT CKD patients without increasing the rate of total adverse events. Oral cinacalcet therapy with or without vitamin D analogs are recommended in patients with end-stage CKD, as multiple studies have proved its efficacy and safety in controlling SHPT in patients undergoing dialysis. The indications for cinacalcet therapy in parathyroid disorders are included in Table 4. The multicenter study BONAFIDE assessed the skeletal response to cinacalcet in adult dialysis patients with SHPT and high turnover bone disease. Long-term treatment with cinacalcet resulted in decreased PTH and bone turnover, and generally improved bone histology. Although the large control clinical trial EVOLVE didn't meet the primary endpoints of reduction of all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular event risk, the secondary analyses showed that cinacalcet demonstrated significant reduction in the risk of severe unremitting SHPT in dialysis patients. Moreover, post hoc unadjusted intention-to-treat analyses showed that cinacalcet has no effect on the risk of clinical fractures, although it did show a substantial reduction in the risk of fracture when analyses were adjusted for age: it favored the older ones. In a retrospective cohort study including 25 hemodialysis patients with SHPT, 1-year treatment with cinacalcet increased BMD at the femoral neck by 7.3%, whereas in the control group, there was a reduction of 6.2%. In the cinacalcet group, serum ALP levels but not PTH levels were significantly negatively correlated with the changes in BMD. Furthermore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has shown that cinacalcet is also effective in controlling SHPT in nondialysis patients. In addition to the predialysis state, there are some preliminary data suggesting that treatment with cinacalcet is beneficial in controlling persistent SHPT after renal transplantation. Hence, more data are required to receive approval for extended use in these latter conditions.

### Cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) [^117Jyrky]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 		 	Mechanism of Action

The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion. Cinacalcet, the active ingredient in Sensipar, is a calcimimetic agent that directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels.

12.2 		 	Pharmacodynamics

Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD. The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet. After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.

Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT.

12.3 		 	Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Distribution

After oral administration of cinacalcet, Cmaxis achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours. Cinacalcet Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)were increased by 82% and 68%, respectively, following administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers. The Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)of cinacalcet were increased by 65% and 50%, respectively, when cinacalcet was administered with a low-fat meal compared with fasting.

After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of approximately 6 hours and terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 7 days, and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration. The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration. The AUC and Cmaxof cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg. The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L, indicating extensive distribution. Cinacalcet is approximately 93% to 97% bound to plasma protein(s). The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0.80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng/mL.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^111X1mrj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Case reports and pertinent lab values

Other cases of cinacalcet being used in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia have been described, but did not report PTHrP levels after cinacalcet treatment. O'Callaghan reported a 71-year-old with hypercalcemia of malignancy initially controlled with zoledronic acid and denosumab. He had a suppressed PTH and a mildly elevated PTHrP. Cinacalcet was started at 30 mg twice a day and eventually titrated to 60 mg twice a day resulting in normal serum calcium levels until he succumbed to an acute stroke 10 months later. In a case of presumed PTHrP-induced hypercalcemia from metastatic breast cancer, Asonitis reported that treatment with cinacalcet decreased serum calcium levels from 13.2 mg/dL to 9.6 mg/dL in one month. Two weeks after stopping cinacalcet therapy, serum calcium rebounded to 10.8 mg/dL. As a proof of concept, cinacalcet was restarted, and two weeks later, calcium decreased to 9.2 mg/dL.

There have been two cases of cinacalcet used successfully in patients where both PTHrP and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were elevated – one reported by Christensen and the other by Sheehan. Finally, Valdes-Socin reported a case of hypercalcemia associated with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that had an increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and was responsive to cinacalcet, but PTHrP was not measured. Of note, there is also a case report of hypercalcemia associated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D elevation but with normal PTHrP that responded to cinacalcet treatment.

In all cases, cinacalcet was used in the doses we initiated, and that was followed with improvement in serum calcium within 1 week after dose escalation. Our case is consistent with these prior reports – showing that cinacalcet can reduce hypercalcemia downstream of PTHrP. In fact, on HD 23, PTHrP remained elevated at 7.4 pg/L while the albumin-corrected serum calcium was frankly low. Instead, the dramatic reduction in PTHrP occurred after cinacalcet was discontinued.

Sixty-seven patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to cinacalcet HCl and 34 patients randomized to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years, 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Blacks. The study started with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range. During the efficacy period a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated patients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% vs 0%, p < 0.001) and ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% vs 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of cinacalcet HCl at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

### Cinacalcet reduces the set point of the PTH-calcium curve [^117HFTxZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The calcimimetic cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor to calcium and therefore should produce a decrease in the set point of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-calcium curve. For investigation of this hypothesis, nine long-term hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were given cinacalcet for 2 mo, the dosage was titrated per a protocol based on intact PTH and plasma calcium concentrations. Dialysis against low- and high-calcium (0.75 and 1.75 mM) dialysate was used to generate curves describing the relationship between PTH and calcium. Compared with precinacalcet levels, cinacalcet significantly reduced mean serum calcium, intact PTH and whole PTH (wPTH; all P < 0.001). The set points for PTH-calcium curves were significantly reduced, and both maximum and minimum levels of PTH (intact and whole) were significantly decreased. The calcium-mediated inhibition of PTH secretion was more marked after cinacalcet treatment. In addition, cinacalcet shifted the inverse sigmoidal curve of wPTH/non-wPTH ratio versus calcium to the left (i.e., less calcium was required to reduce the wPTH/non-wPTH ratio). In conclusion, cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of the parathyroids to calcium, causing a marked reduction in the set point of the PTH-calcium curve, in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Longitudinal changes in bone and mineral metabolism after cessation of cinacalcet in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^116D3G6d]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A change in prescribing patterns following cinacalcet withdrawal were observed. At baseline 76% of patients (n = 39) were on calcitriol, which reduced to 57% (n = 29) by 12 months (p = 0.03). Four patients were commenced on calcitriol de novo. Calcitriol doses increased over the study period (1.3 mcg/week versus 1.7 mcg/week at baseline and 12 months respectively, p = 0.04). Of 21 patients on a calcium-based phosphate binder at baseline, 12 continued this therapy at 12 months (p = 0.05). Seventy-six percent of patients (n = 39) were on a non-calcium based phosphate binder at baseline, 59% of patients (n = 30) remained on therapy at study completion (p = 0.06). No patients were on magnesium supplementation. There were 12 episodes of hypercalcemia (serum corrected calcium > 2.60 mmol/L), with 9 episodes occurring by 6 months. There were no episodes of hypercalcemia in the control arm. The dosage or number of patients taking nutritional vitamin D supplementation did not significantly change over the year (12 at baseline versus 10 at 12 months, p = 0.63).

Biochemical outcomes

Baseline levels of PTH, phosphate, calcium and ALP were similar across the two groups (Table 2). In the cinacalcet withdrawal cohort, there was an increase in PTH from 42.2 pmol/L (27.8–94.6 pmol/L) at baseline to 114.8 pmol/L (83.9–159.1 pmol/L) at 12 months (p < 0.001). The highest rate of change in PTH occurred at 1 month with a mean PTH increase of 93% from baseline (p < 0.001). Serum calcium also increased from 2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L over 12 months (p < 0.001). There was no change in PTH or serum calcium in the control group over 12 months. Phosphate remained unchanged in the cinacalcet withdrawal group (p = 0.8) and the control group (p = 0.6) over the 12-month study period. Table 2 summarizes baseline, 6- and 12-month values for biochemical outcomes in the control and cinacalcet withdrawal cohorts.

### Predictors of cinacalcet discontinuation and reinitiation in hemodialysis patients: results from 7 European countries [^1161FLmU]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the 12 months after discontinuation of cinacalcet, we observed a sustained trend of increasing PTH levels that stands in contrast to the modest increase (with gradual return to baseline) in calcium levels and generally stable phosphorus levels. Although we did not attempt to adjust our estimates of post-discontinuation CKD-MBD laboratory value trajectories for changes in IV or oral vitamin D agents that would influence laboratory values and might trigger cinacalcet reinitiation (and therefore censoring from the analysis), we found no substantial differences in laboratory value trajectories when excluding patients who restarted cinacalcet within 12 months. Our laboratory findings are consistent with the results of a European cohort study of incident hemodialysis patients from 2007 to 2009 that showed a sustained (but faster) PTH increase over 12 months and similarly modest trends in calcium and phosphorus levels. In contrast, a study of US Medicare claims from 2007 to 2010 linked with clinical data from a large dialysis provider reported an initial PTH increase after cinacalcet discontinuation that returned to baseline, and an increase in calcium levels that was sharp and sustained. The reasons for this juxtaposition of results are unclear. A patient's failure to take cinacalcet as prescribed (non-adherence), which was not directly captured in our study, would result in delayed capture of removal of cinacalcet from the patient's medication list (discontinuation, as defined in our study). In this case, the immediate effect of discontinuing cinacalcet on levels of CKD-MBD biomarkers may have already occurred by the observed time of discontinuation, thus diminishing the potential for observing stronger post-discontinuation trends. Additionally, the observed trends may be impacted by our choice to censor patients at the reinitiation of cinacalcet; patients with greatly increased PTH levels would be excluded in later follow-up months, potentially restricting the observable magnitude of change among the remaining patients. We also note that our study includes more recent data through 2015 that may reflect changes in the international CKD-MBD clinical practice guidelines for SHPT management published in 2009 that liberalized the upper maintenance range for PTH.

### A randomized trial of cinacalcet versus vitamin D analogs as monotherapy in secondary hyperparathyroidism (PARADIGM) [^111iUBBD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Direct comparison of cinacalcet and vitamin D analogs as monotherapies to lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels has not been undertaken.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a prospective, multicenter, phase 4, randomized, open-label study that enrolled participants from 2010 to 2012. Adult participants (n = 312) on hemodialysis with PTH > 450 pg/ml were randomized 1:1 to 12 months of treatment with either cinacalcet (n = 155) or vitamin D analogs (n = 157) to evaluate the mean percentage change in plasma PTH level (primary end point) and the proportion of participants achieving plasma PTH < 300 pg/ml or a ≥ 30% decrease in PTH (secondary end points). A preplanned analysis to determine whether there were important region-by-treatment interactions was also undertaken.

Results

Baseline mean PTH was 846 pg/ml (n = 155) for cinacalcet and 816 pg/ml (n = 157) for vitamin D analog therapy. The mean (95% confidence interval) percentage change from baseline in PTH was -12.1% (-20.0% to -4.1%) in the cinacalcet arm and -7.0% (-14.9% to 0.8%) in the vitamin D analog arm, a difference of -5.0% (-15.4% to 5.4%) (P = 0.35). Similarly, there was no difference in achievement of secondary efficacy end points between arms (19.4% and 15.3% of participants with PTH ≤ 300 pg/ml and 42.6% and 33.8% of participants had a PTH reduction > 30% in the cinacalcet and vitamin D analog arms, respectively). A prespecified analysis revealed a large treatment-by-region interaction, with nominally greater response to cinacalcet compared with vitamin D analogs in non-United States participants (US versus non-US participants, P < 0.001). Hypocalcemia was more common in the cinacalcet arm, whereas hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occurred more often in the vitamin D analog arm.

Conclusions

Participants had similar modest reductions in PTH with either cinacalcet or vitamin D analog monotherapy over 52 weeks of treatment, but effects varied by region. Treatments differed with regard to effect on calcium and phosphorus levels.

### Simultaneous control of PTH and caxP is sustained over three years of treatment with cinacalcet HCl [^115CJuF2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Objectives

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly complicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), leading to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. SHPT is a progressive disease often requiring long-term therapy to control parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mineral imbalances. Vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders, used as traditional therapies to lower PTH and phosphorus, may provide inadequate long-term control for many dialysis patients. Cinacalcet, by simultaneously lowering PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus levels, may maintain PTH and mineral balance in these individuals. However, as with traditional therapies, long-term data are limited. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENT: Dialysis subjects from at least one of five lead-in studies (double-blind placebo-controlled, including one extension trial) completing up to 52 wk of either cinacalcet or placebo were eligible for this open-label extension study, including an 8-wk dose titration (initiated at 30 mg/d), followed by 24-wk maintenance and up to 132 wk of follow-up. Final efficacy analysis was at week 180.

Results

Three hundred thirty-four of 589 enrolled subjects received cinacalcet from the beginning of the lead-in study. Weekly median PTH values were ≤ 300 pg/ml (weeks 16 through 180) and median CaxP values were ≤ 55 mg²/dl² (weeks 4 through 180). Similar results were exhibited in the 255 subjects who initially received placebo. Among the patients exposed to cinacalcet from the beginning of the lead-in study, 3% of subjects exhibited treatment-related serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Cinacalcet effectively maintained PTH, Ca and P reductions in dialysis subjects for up to 180 wk.

### Clinical and practical use of calcimimetics in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113mZBwt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

CKD and CKD-related mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBDs) are associated with high cardiovascular and mortality risks. In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), no single drug intervention has been shown to reduce the high mortality risk in dialysis patients, but several robust secondary analyses point toward important potential beneficial effects of controlling CKD-MBD-related factors and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The advent of cinacalcet, which has a unique mode of action at the calcium-sensing receptor, represented an important step forward in controlling CKD-MBD. In addition, new RCTs have conclusively shown that cinacalcet improves achievement of target levels for all of the metabolic abnormalities associated with CKD-MBD and may also attenuate the progression of vascular and valvular calcifications in dialysis patients. However, a final conclusion on the effect of cinacalcet on hard outcomes remains elusive. Tolerance of cinacalcet is limited by frequent secondary side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia and oversuppression of parathyroid hormone, which may cause some management difficulties, especially for those lacking experience with the drug. Against this background, this review aims to summarize the results of studies on cinacalcet, up to and including the publication of the recent ADVANCE and EVOLVE RCTs, as well as recent post hoc analyses, and to offer practical guidance on how to improve the clinical management of the most frequent adverse events associated with cinacalcet, based on both currently available information and personal experience. In addition, attention is drawn to less common secondary effects of cinacalcet treatment and advisable precautions.

### A randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of cinacalcet on bone and cardiovascular parameters in haemodialysis patients with advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism [^115VSYGv]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is probably a beneficial role for both cinacalcet and vitamin D analogues, however cinacalcet allows control of secondary hyperparathyroidism to be achieved more easily in patients. The PARADIGM study was a randomised open label study to assess effect of cinacalcet versus vitamin D on biochemical parameters. This showed that both classes of therapy can reduce iPTH to a similar target but that their effects on calcium and phosphate concentrations differ. There is data to suggest that cinacalcet may lower blood pressure, improve cardiac morphology and lower FGF23 and our study has also shown trends consistent with these studies. St. Peter et al. found no relationship between short term change in iPTH due to cinacalcet use and cardiovascular outcomes although this was after only one year and so any beneficial changes may not have had time to take effect. The relationship between cinacalcet and patient survival has been investigated in the largest study of CKD-MBD, the EVOLVE study. The primary end-point of the trial was negative with intention-to-treat analysis but when baseline demographic variations were included in the analysis an improvement in survival was suggested. In pre-specified secondary analyses older patients have been shown to have improved survival and reduced cardiovascular events if taking cinacalcet. Although no difference in mortality was seen during long term follow up in our study, we recognise that the study was markedly underpowered to demonstrate this.

High iPTH levels have also been shown to be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in haemodialysis patients and the relationship between iPTH and LVH is thought to be independent of blood pressure. A reduction in LVMI was seen in both arms of our study with no significant difference between treatment arms. These data are interesting as this occurred despite progression of vascular stiffness and vascular calcification, and without changes in any other key parameters such as blood pressure or dialysis duration and suggests that tighter control of phosphate and/or iPTH may be associated with a reduction in LVMI. The trend to greater improvement observed in the cinacalcet arm may be explained by a number of mechanisms including the presence of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), identified on cardiac myocytes, which has been shown to affect DNA synthesis and may affect cell remodelling and growth An overall reduction in CIMT was also seen in this study when data in the two arms were aggregated.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of cinacalcet may lead to hypocalcemia. In the event of overdosage, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia and appropriate measures taken to correct serum calcium levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Since cinacalcet is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not an effective treatment for overdosage of cinacalcet tablets.

### The OPTIMA study: assessing a new cinacalcet (sensipar / mimpara) treatment algorithm for secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111wW65v]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cinacalcet, a novel calcimimetic, targets the calcium-sensing receptor to lower parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorus levels in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). This study compared the efficacy of a cinacalcet-based regimen with unrestricted conventional care (vitamin D and phosphate binders) for achieving the stringent National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) targets for dialysis patients.

Study Design

In this multicenter, open-label study, hemodialysis patients with poorly controlled SHPT were randomized to receive conventional care (n = 184) or a cinacalcet-based regimen (n = 368). Doses of cinacalcet, vitamin D sterols, and phosphate binders were adjusted during a 16-wk dose-optimization phase with the use of algorithms that allowed cinacalcet to be used with adjusted doses of vitamin D. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with mean intact PTH ≤ 300 pg/ml during a 7-wk efficacy assessment phase.

Results

A higher proportion of patients receiving the cinacalcet-based regimen versus conventional care achieved the targets for PTH (71% versus 22%, respectively; P < 0.001), Ca x P (77% versus 58%, respectively; P < 0.001), calcium (76% versus 33%, respectively; P < 0.001), phosphorus (63% versus 50%, respectively; P = 0.002), and PTH and Ca x P (59% versus 16%, respectively, P < 0.001), and allowed a 22% reduction in vitamin D dosage in patients receiving vitamin D at baseline. Achievement of targets was greatest in patients with less severe disease (intact PTH range, 300 to 500 pg/ml) and the cinacalcet dose required was lower in these patients (median = 30 mg/d).

Conclusions

Compared with conventional therapy, a cinacalcet-based treatment algorithm increased achievement of KDOQI treatment targets in dialysis patients in whom conventional therapy was no longer effective in controlling this disease.

### First-and second-generation immunometric PTH assays during treatment of hyperparathyroidism with cinacalcet HCl [^113SkTS4]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

First-generation immunometric assays for "intact" parathyroid hormone (iPTH) also measure large N-terminally truncated PTH fragments, whereas second-generation assays, such as the "bio-intact" PTH (biPTH) assay, measure only full-length biologically active PTH(1–84). This study compared iPTH and biPTH assays during cinacalcet treatment in subjects with secondary HPT receiving dialysis.

Methods

Four hundred and ten subjects were enrolled in a 26-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral cinacalcet (or placebo), 30 to 180 mg once daily, and efficacy was assessed using biPTH and iPTH assays.

Results

Compared with control treatment, cinacalcet improved the management of secondary HPT. Both biPTH and iPTH decreased by 38% ± 3% during weeks 13 to 26 in the cinacalcet group; biPTH increased by 23% ± 4% and iPTH increased by 9.5% ± 3% in the control group (P < 0.001). Fifty-six percent of cinacalcet subjects and 10% of control subjects had a ≥ 30% reduction in biPTH, and 61% and 11%, respectively, had a ≥ 30% reduction in iPTH. Significant correlations between biPTH and iPTH levels were observed throughout the study. Both assays correlated similarly with bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels. The ratio of biPTH to iPTH was maintained at 56% ± 1% after treatment in both treatment groups. Increasing serum calcium levels were associated with a decreasing ratio of biPTH to (iPTH-biPTH).

Conclusion

These data show that PTH can be monitored with either iPTH or biPTH assays during therapy with cinacalcet, and that cinacalcet therapy does not exert a major influence on the ratio between PTH(1–84) and large, N-terminally truncated PTH fragments.

2.1 		 	Administration

Sensipar should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.

Sensipar tablets are administered orally and should always be taken whole and not chewed, crushed, or divided.

2.2 		 	Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg once daily. Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Sensipar should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg/mL. Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with Sensipar.

Sensipar can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and/or phosphate binders.

During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Treatment

Treatment with cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily. Doses were titrated upwards sequentially at 4-week intervals as tolerated to 60, 90, or 120 mg/day or to a maximum of 180 mg/day if PTH values were ⩾300 pg/ml and serum calcium levels were ⩾8.0 mg/dl. The objective was to achieve and maintain PTH between > 150 and < 300 pg/ml. If PTH was < 150 pg/ml, doses were reduced to the next lowest dose or withheld for subjects already receiving the lowest dose of cinacalcet. Cinacalcet also was withheld if serum calcium was < 7.5 mg/dl or symptoms of hypocalcemia developed. Dosing was resumed when PTH levels again exceeded 300 pg/ml.

Concurrent treatment with vitamin D sterols was allowed throughout the study. Although not permitted during screening, adjustments to the dose of vitamin D could be made thereafter based upon measured values for PTH, serum calcium, phosphorus, and Ca x P. Changes to the doses of calcium supplements and/or phosphate-binding agents were made at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with existing standards of clinical practice.

The study was conducted at 30 sites located in the United States and Europe in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at each study site, and written informed consent obtained from all participants.

### Is serum phosphorus control related to parathyroid hormone control in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism? [^112F5LkK]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

It has long been known that phosphorus loading in experimental renal failure can contribute to the elevated PTH levels and parathyroid gland hyperplasia that characterize SHPT. Much less appreciated is the concept that SHPT-induced dissolution of bone mineral may be a significant contributor to the development of hyperphosphataemia, as highlighted in a recent review. A recent KDOQI commentary also noted that PTH-induced mobilization of phosphorus from bone, and potentially other tissues, may contribute to hyperphosphataemia and that this pathophysiological process would not be ameliorated by phosphate binders.

Vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders, together with dietary phosphate restriction, have traditionally been the cornerstone of SHPT management. With traditional vitamin D-based treatments there is a trade-off between controlling PTH on one hand and elevating calcium and phosphorus on the other hand, making it difficult to achieve simultaneous control of these parameters. Vitamin D sterols promote intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus and, in excess, can mobilize calcium from bone. Thus, excessive calcium loading from calcium-based phosphate binders and high doses of vitamin D sterols can promote hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, which can necessitate treatment interruptions. This is reflected in the small proportion of dialysis patients who succeed in achieving and maintaining the targets recommended by KDOQI for serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium.

The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet (Mimpara®/Sensipar®, Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) has a different mechanism of PTH-lowering action from vitamin D, with opposite effects on serum calcium and phosphorus levels. By enhancing the sensitivity of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors to extracellular calcium, cinacalcet suppresses PTH synthesis and secretion. When added to a conventional treatment regimen, cinacalcet is effective in lowering serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium levels in dialysis patients. The phase 3 OPTIMA (Open-Label, Randomized Study Using Cinacalcet to Improve Achievement of KDOQI Targets in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease) study showed that a cinacalcet-based regimen can allow reduction of vitamin D dosage while improving mineral metabolism compared to conventional treatment.

We conducted a post hoc analysis of OPTIMA data to explore the relationship between the control of PTH and that of serum phosphorus in dialysis patients with SHPT.

Cinacalcet and hypocalcemia — EVOLVE trial findings and KDOQI cautions are summarized as follows: In hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, cinacalcet versus placebo in 3,883 patients did not significantly affect the primary composite end point but did reduce serum calcium; the KDIGO update notes that "no negative signals were associated" and "suggests that hypocalcemia can be tolerated", which the KDOQI group supports for individualized therapy while stating that additional studies are needed. The KDOQI work group "cautions against use of low dialysate calcium concentration for calcium reduction" due to links with arrhythmia and heart failure and "does not endorse use of calcimimetics specifically for calcium lowering".

2.5 		 	Monitoring for Hypocalcemia

Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis, and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

2.1 Administration

Cinacalcet tablets should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.

Cinacalcet tablets are administered orally and should always be taken whole and not chewed, crushed, or divided.

2.2 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg once daily. Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Cinacalcet tablets should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg/mL. Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet tablets.

Cinacalcet tablets can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and/or phosphate binders.

During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg twice daily.

The dose of cinacalcet tablets should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, and 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels. Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Cinacalcet use patterns and effect on laboratory values and other medications in a large dialysis organization, 2004 through 2006 [^117DTUT5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cinacalcet was introduced in mid-2004 to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. We aimed to characterize adult patients who received cinacalcet prescriptions and to determine (1) dosage titration and effects on laboratory values, active intravenous vitamin D use, and phosphate binder prescriptions and (2) percentage who achieved National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative targets for serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus and experienced biochemical adverse effects.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This observational study evaluated 45,487 prevalent patients from a dialysis organization database linked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services End-Stage Renal Disease database. Patient characteristics, laboratory values (albumin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus), intravenous vitamin D, and oral medication (cinacalcet, phosphate binders) prescriptions were evaluated for cinacalcet patients.

Results

By June 2006, almost 32% of patients had received cinacalcet prescriptions. Mean baseline corrected calcium was 9.8 mg/dl and phosphorus was 6.3 mg/dl, and median parathyroid hormone was 577 pg/ml, versus 9.5 mg/dl, 5.3 mg/dl, and 215 pg/ml, respectively, for noncinacalcet patients. Patients with cinacalcet prescriptions for ≥ 6 mo had corrected calcium reduced by 4.2%, phosphorus by 7.0%, and parathyroid hormone by 29.9% by 12 mo. More cinacalcet patients attained Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative targets with less hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia but more hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. Over 12 mo, vitamin D use and use consistency increased, phosphate binder dosages increased, and mean cinacalcet daily dosage reached 55 mg.

Conclusions

Patients with cinacalcet prescriptions exhibited more severe hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatemia than noncinacalcet patients. Positive effects were less dramatic than in Phase III clinical trials, possibly as a result of modest, slow dosage titration.

5.1 	Hypocalcemia

Cinacalcet HCl lowers serum calcium and can lead to hypocalcemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Significant lowering of serum calcium can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet HCl, including in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of cinacalcet HCl have not been established in pediatric patients [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].

Cinacalcet HCl is not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1)]. In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis, the long-term safety and efficacy of cinacalcet HCl have not been established. Clinical studies indicate that cinacalcet HCl-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with cinacalcet HCl-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels. In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of cinacalcet HCl-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.

### Cinacalcet treatment experience in hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets [^111iVdyK]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets (HVDRR) is a bone disorder characterized by a phenotype of rickets with onset at early stage of life with elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism and elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) as a consequence of the resistance of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the VDR of the vitamin D receptor have been characterized by a lack of response to traditional treatment with calcium and calcitriol. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypophosphatemia are the main factors in its pathogenesis. Cinacalcet is a calciomimetic drug that reproduces the action of calcium by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensitive receptors (CASR) of the parathyroid glands that regulate the secretion of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). Case presentation We describe its effectiveness and safety in a patient with HVDRR and review other published report cases in the literature. According to published experience, cinacalcet could be used as an adjunctive treatment for the HVDRR with mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the VDR refractory to traditional treatment. Due to lack of knowledge of possible effects of cinacalcet on CASR in the skeleton, long-term use should be avoided. Conclusions The optimal dose of cinacalcet for treatment of HVDRR ranges between 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/day. Serious side effects of cinacalcet have not been published in this type of patient, although we considered that a close monitoring is necessary in order to detect hypocalcemia.

14.2 	Parathyroid Carcinoma

Twenty-nine patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma were enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. The study consisted of two phases, a dose-titration phase and a maintenance phase. Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and then were titrated every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily. Dosage escalation during the variable-length (2 to 16 weeks) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), the patient reached the highest possible dosage, or adverse events precluded further dosage increases.

Twenty-nine patients entered the study. The median exposure to cinacalcet was 229 days (range: 1 to 1051). At baseline the mean (SE) serum calcium was 14.1 (0.4) mg/dL. At the end of the titration phase, the mean (SE) serum calcium was 12.4 (0.5) mg/dL, which is a mean reduction of 1.7 (0.6) mg/dL from baseline. Figure 3 illustrates mean serum calcium (mg/dL) over time for all patients still on study at each time point from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80. Daily dose during the study ranged from 30 mg twice daily to 90 mg four times daily.

### Cinacalcet hydrochloride is an effective treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis [^115hLZFT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism develops early in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney/Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative emphasize the need to control parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorus levels in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis to reduce poor outcomes. This phase 2 study evaluated the effects of the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet hydrochloride in patients with CKD not on dialysis therapy.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-week study enrolled adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 50 mL/min/1.73 m² (0.25 to 0.83 mL/s/1.73 m²) and an intact PTH (iPTH) level greater than 130 pg/mL (ng/L). Cinacalcet (or placebo) was titrated from 30 to 180 mg once daily to obtain a 30% or greater reduction in iPTH levels from baseline.

Results

Baseline mean iPTH levels were 243 pg/mL (ng/L) in the cinacalcet group (n = 27) and 236 pg/mL (ng/L) in the control group (n = 27). At baseline, 28% of subjects were being administered vitamin D sterols and 43% were being administered phosphate binders or calcium supplements. The addition of cinacalcet significantly decreased iPTH concentrations compared with controls during the efficacy-assessment phase: 56% versus 19% of subjects achieved a 30% or greater reduction in iPTH levels (P = 0.006), and mean iPTH levels decreased by 32% in the cinacalcet group, but increased by 6% in the control group (P < 0.001). Mean serum calcium and phosphorus levels remained within normal range throughout the study. Cinacalcet generally was well tolerated; the most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal.

Conclusion

This preliminary study provides evidence that cinacalcet is efficacious for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects with CKD not receiving dialysis.

Sixty-seven patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to cinacalcet tablets and 34 patients randomized to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years, 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Blacks. The study started with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^115DmE8W]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We report a challenging case of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia of malignancy that was refractory to intravenous saline hydration and calcitonin. Because of tooth extractions and planned jaw lesion irradiation, hypercalcemia was successfully managed with cinacalcet until chemotherapy reduced the PTHrP production by the tumor.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic that activates parathyroid CaSRs which are negatively coupled to PTH secretion. Lower PTH levels reduce calcium reabsorption by the kidney, and bone resorption. Activation of renal CaSRs also enhance calcium excretion. Several case reports support the use of cinacalcet in treating PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia. Bech described a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia whose serum calcium declined with cinacalcet treatment. However, chemotherapy was given concurrently with cinacalcet, and PTHrP levels also decreased suggesting the hypothesis that cinacalcet might decrease calcium by decreasing PTHrP secretion by the tumor.

Paradoxically, in several in vitro models of PTHrP secreting tumors, increasing CaSR signaling increased PTHrP secretion. In fact, most case studies have not noted dramatic changes in PTHrP with cinacalcet treatment (Table 1). Sheehan reported an 81 year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer with hypercalcemia refractory to pamidronate. Cinacalcet was titrated to 60 mg orally twice a day resulting in a reduced serum calcium despite her PTHrP remaining elevated. Sternlicht reported a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who, despite fluids, calcitonin, and a bisphosphonate, remained hypercalcemic at 14.2 mg/dL. After ten weeks of cinacalcet treatment, calcium levels decreased to 10.1 mg/dL while her PTHrP remained elevated.

### Efficacy and safety of cinacalcet compared with other treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease: a meta-analysis [^114AyVqv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

SHPT and MBD are common in many patients with CKD. Due to increased risk of CVD, occurrence of fractures and mortality, two clinical conditions bring a large amount medical burden. Management of SHPT and MBD in patients with CKD is made by controlling the triggering factors. Sometimes these measures are not effective, and maybe even have adverse effects. As the main physiological factors of the two entities, the calcium agent provides a therapeutic advantage. Firstly, they reduce the level of serum PTH by inhibiting their secretion, and secondly, they stimulate the synthesis of the vitamin D receptor in the parathyroid gland, which increases the sensitivity to vitamin D and subsequently inhibits PTH. At present, focus has moved to the effect of cinacalcet on hard clinical end point, and ADVANCE and EVOLVE, two randomized controlled trials, have been performed to assess the impact of cinacalcet on CV calcification and the risk of CV events and mortality. Although the initial analysis of the two trials did not reveal significant effects of cinacalcet, the advantage of cinacalcet was proposed to analyze the potential problems considered in the test. These positive results and experimental studies showed that the good effects of cinacalcet on bone metabolism and vascular calcification.

Meanwhile, some limitations should be noticed in this meta-analysis: First, there was a significant heterogeneity. Selection criteria for different patients and control treatment options are possible explanations for heterogeneity. Second, language can also produce a bias. Specifically, we only choose English or exclude other qualified research. Third, several studies of small sample sizes, may reduce the statistical power. Finally, our results were based on unadjusted assessment of RRs, which might influence the results. Based on these limitations, the results should be considered carefully.

### Cinacalcet (KRN1493) effectively decreases the serum intact PTH level with favorable control of the serum phosphorus and calcium levels in Japanese dialysis patients [^1145CmmV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (KRN1493) acts on the parathyroid calcium receptors to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, and is already in wide use in the United States and the European countries. In this study, we examined the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in Japanese patients on maintenance haemodialysis.

Methods

One hundred forty-four patients with serum intact PTH (iPTH) levels ≥ 300 pg/ml were enrolled and randomly allocated to two groups assigned to receive either cinacalcet or placebo for 14 weeks. Cinacalcet was started at the dose of 25 mg/day and titrated up to 100 mg/day to achieve the target iPTH level of < 250 pg/ml.

Results

Cinacalcet significantly decreased the median iPTH level from 606.5 pg/ml to 241.0 pg/ml, despite the mean dialysis vintage being 2.4 times longer (14.3 ± 7.1 years) and the proportion of patients receiving vitamin D sterols being higher, than in the phase 3 studies conducted in the US/EU. The target iPTH level was achieved in 51.4% of the patients in the cinacalcet group, in sharp contrast to only 2.8% in the placebo group. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with both the serum calcium and phosphorus levels within the target range in the K/DOQI guidelines increased from 4.2% to 26.4% by cinacalcet.

Conclusions

These results suggest that lower dose levels of cinacalcet, as compared to those in US/EU studies, may be sufficient effectively suppress the serum iPTH levels and allow favourable management of the serum calcium and phosphorus levels in Japanese patients, having a longer average dialysis vintage.

### Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations in patients with intractable primary hyperparathyroidism [^114mHjs1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with persistent primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) after parathyroidectomy or with contraindications to parathyroidectomy often require chronic treatment for hypercalcemia.

Objective

The objective of the study was to assess the ability of the calcimimetic, cinacalcet, to reduce serum calcium in patients with intractable PHPT.

Design

This was an open-label, single-arm study comprising a titration phase of variable duration (2–16 wk) and a maintenance phase of up to 136 wk.

Setting

The study was conducted at 23 centers in Europe, the United States, and Canada.

Patients

The study included 17 patients with intractable PHPT and serum calcium greater than 12.5 mg/dl (3.1 mmol/liter).

Intervention

During the titration phase, cinacalcet dosages were titrated every 2 wk (30 mg twice daily to 90 mg four times daily) for 16 wk until serum calcium was 10 mg/dl or less (2.5 mmol/liter). If serum calcium increased during the maintenance phase, additional increases in the cinacalcet dose were permitted.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing a reduction in serum calcium of 1 mg/dl or greater (0.25 mmol/liter) at the end of the titration phase.

Results

Mean ± sd baseline serum calcium was 12.7 ± 0.8 mg/dl (3.2 ± 0.2 mmol/liter). At the end of titration, a 1 mg/dl or greater reduction in serum calcium was achieved in 15 patients (88%). Fifteen patients (88%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, none of which were serious. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias.

Conclusions

In patients with intractable PHPT, cinacalcet reduces serum calcium, is generally well tolerated, and has the potential to fulfill an unmet medical need.

### Association of drug effects on serum parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and calcium levels with mortality in CKD: a meta-analysis [^115hpDXg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphorus, and calcium levels are surrogate outcomes that are central to the evaluation of drug treatments in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review evaluates the evidence for the correlation between drug effects on biochemical (PTH, phosphorus, and calcium) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality end points in adults with CKD.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Adults with CKD.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized trials reporting drug effects on biochemical and mortality end points.

Intervention

Drug interventions with effects on serum PTH, phosphorus, and calcium levels, including vitamin D compounds, phosphate binders, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin.

Outcomes

Correlation between drug effects on biochemical and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Results

28 studies (6,999 participants) reported both biochemical and mortality outcomes and were eligible for analysis. Associations between drug effects on surrogate biochemical end points and corresponding effects on mortality were weak and imprecise. All correlation coefficients were less than 0.70, and 95% credible intervals were generally wide and overlapped with zero, consistent with the possibility of no association. The exception was an inverse correlation between drug effects on serum PTH levels and all-cause mortality, which was nominally significant (-0.64; 95% credible interval, -0.85 to -0.15), but the strength of this association was very imprecise. Risk of bias within available trials was generally high, further reducing confidence in the summary correlations. Findings were robust to adjustment for age, baseline serum PTH level, allocation concealment, CKD stage, and drug class.

Limitations

Low power in analyses and combining evidence from many different drug comparisons with incomplete data across studies.

Conclusions

Drug effects on serum PTH, phosphorus, and calcium levels are weakly and imprecisely correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular death in the setting of CKD. Risks of mortality (patient-level outcome) cannot be inferred from treatment-induced changes in biochemical outcomes in people with CKD. Similarly, existing data do not exclude a mortality benefit with treatment. Trials need to address patient-centered outcomes to evaluate drug effectiveness in this setting.

### Frequent monitoring of mineral metabolism in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism: associations with achievement of treatment goals and with adjustments in therapy [^117XvLGy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding the appropriate frequency of serum calcium/phosphorus measurements, our present results are partially consistent with frequencies found in the guidelines of JSDT. When the serum calcium/phosphorus levels exceed the target ranges, the JSDT guideline recommends more frequent measurements (than biweekly or monthly). In the present study, weekly — but not biweekly — calcium/phosphorus measurement was associated with increased likelihood of achieving target ranges, though only for serum calcium. When serum calcium/phosphorus values are already within the target ranges, the JSDT guidelines recommend biweekly or monthly measurement, which is consistent with our finding that measuring calcium/phosphorus more frequently than monthly was not associated with a higher likelihood of maintaining target ranges for both serum calcium and phosphorus.

The relationship between increased frequency of calcium monitoring and greater likelihood of achieving the target range was also supported in part by our findings that increased frequency of calcium/phosphorus measurement was associated with greater likelihood of cinacalcet initiation. Given that cinacalcet has a calcium-lowering effect in addition to its PTH-lowering effect, Japanese dialysis physicians will likely prescribe cinacalcet to SHPT patients on the basis of serum calcium values, as serum calcium is measured more frequently than serum PTH. This notion is further supported by our finding that likelihood of cinacalcet initiation dose dependently increased with increased frequency of serum calcium/phosphorus measurements, but not with increased frequency of serum PTH measurements. In contrast to findings for serum calcium, however, likelihood of achieving the target range for serum phosphorus was not associated with measurement frequency, even when serum phosphorus values exceeded the target range. Although the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, it may be associated with difficulties in serum phosphorus management due to excessive dietary phosphorus intake.

5.1 Hypocalcemia

Cinacalcet tablets lowers serum calcium and can lead to hypocalcemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Significant lowering of serum calcium can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets, including in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of cinacalcet tablets have not been established in pediatric patients [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].

Cinacalcet tablets are not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1)]. In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis, the long term safety and efficacy of cinacalcet tablets have not been established. Clinical studies indicate that cinacalcet-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with cinacalcet-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels. In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of cinacalcet-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion. Cinacalcet, the active ingredient in cinacalcet tablets is a calcimimetic agent that directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD. The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet. After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.

Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Distribution

After oral administration of cinacalcet, Cmaxis achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours. Cinacalcet Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)were increased by 82% and 68%, respectively, following administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers. The Cmaxand AUC(0-infinite)of cinacalcet were increased by 65% and 50%, respectively, when cinacalcet was administered with a low-fat meal compared with fasting.

After absorption, cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with an initial half-life of approximately 6 hours and terminal half-life of 30 to 40 hours. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 7 days, and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration. The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration. The AUC and Cmaxof cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg. The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L, indicating extensive distribution. Cinacalcet is approximately 93% to 97% bound to plasma protein(s). The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0.80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng/mL.

### Dynamics of cinacalcet use and biochemical control in hemodialysis patients: a retrospective new-user cohort design [^114G8JyS]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Average PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels following cinacalcet initiation in our study were consistent with the 2009 KDIGO guideline update, despite a portion of the follow-up period occurring prior to the release of the guidelines. These guidelines suggest a PTH level in the range of approximately 2 to 9 times the upper reference limit for the assay, which corresponds to approximately 130 to 600 pg/mL, taking into account variability in commercial assays. In our study, average serum calcium levels were maintained in the reference range, in which the recommended upper level of the range is 10.0 mg/dL to 10.5 mg/dL, depending on the assay used. Average phosphorus levels in our study decreased toward the reference range, which is 2.4 to 4.1 mg/dL, differing slightly among assays. For patients who remained on cinacalcet, biochemical control persisted for up to one year of follow-up. Our results are also similar to those from a recent retrospective cohort study that showed decreases in all three biochemistries that were sustained for 1-year following cinacalcet initiation, although we did not assess dose-titration and its impact on control. Following discontinuation of cinacalcet in the current study, biochemical values increased quickly then leveled off or decreased slightly, Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The slight decreases in biochemical levels are likely due to a selection effect that would result from patients with higher levels restarting treatment and thus being censored from the analysis. Similar to a prior study, vitamin D doses in our population decreased following cinacalcet initiation and increased following cinacalcet discontinuation, Additional file 1: Figure S4.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^114Zh1cm]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Epidemiological evidence linking higher calcium concentrations to increased mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in adults with CKD has accumulated since the KDIGO guideline on CKD-MBD from 2009. On this basis the grade of this guideline has changed from 2D to 2C. This is still a relatively weak evidentiary base, due to the lack of prospective studies targeting higher calcium concentrations with the aim to improve clinical outcomes. Although the original guideline suggested maintaining serum calcium in the normal range, correction of hypocalcemia carries a risk of inducing a positive calcium balance, and persistently low calcium levels in subjects treated with cinacalcet in the EVOLVE study was not harmful. Therefore, the KDIGO committee considered it reasonable to consider low serum calcium within an individualised perspective, refraining from a generalised suggestion as in the previous of the KDIGO guideline to maintain calcium in the normal range for all CKD patients as mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia (e.g. in the context of calcimimetic treatment) can be tolerated in order to avoid inappropriate calcium loading in adults.

The previous Renal Association guideline suggested that albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels are kept within the normal reference range for the laboratory used and ideally maintained between 2.2 and 2.5 mmol/l, with avoidance of hypercalcaemic episodes (2D).

RA recommendation

In patients with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest avoidance of hypercalcaemia, maintaining serum calcium below the upper limit of the reference range for the laboratory used. Hypocalcaemia should be managed in an individualised way as over-correction may also lead to patient harm.

2009 KDIGO guideline

4.1.3: In patients with CKD G5D, we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration between 1.25 and 1.50 mmol/l (2.5 and 3.0 mEq/l) (2D).

2017 KDIGO update

4.1.4: In patients with CKD G5D, we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration between 1.25 and 1.5 mmol/l (2.5 and 3.0 mEq/l) (2C).

### Paricalcitol versus cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D therapy for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving haemodialysis: results of the IMPACT SHPT study [^113ojrvD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Similarly, secondary analyses revealed significantly higher proportions of subjects achieving iPTH reduction of ≥ 30 and ≥ 50% from baseline with IV paricalcitol compared with cinacalcet and higher proportions achieving these reductions with oral paricalcitol compared with cinacalcet. The lack of significant differences in treatment effects between paricalcitol and cinacalcet in the oral stratum may reflect, in part, differences in inherent subject characteristics across IV and oral strata. Doses of oral paricalcitol used during the evaluation period were substantially lower than corresponding IV paricalcitol doses.

Paricalcitol-based therapy was more effective in achieving optimal control of calcium than cinacalcet with concurrent low-dose vitamin D while keeping iPTH within target levels. Although cinacalcet-based therapy effectively prevented hypercalcaemia, more than half of the subjects in the cinacalcet arm (across strata) experienced hypocalcaemia during the evaluation period. In contrast, hypercalcaemia, a common side effect of non-selective VDR activators, occurred in only 7.7% of the subjects who received IV paricalcitol and did not occur in the oral paricalcitol group. These findings are consistent with those seen in previous randomized controlled studies of IV and oral paricalcitol in haemodialysis patients demonstrating effective iPTH reduction with no significant increase in the risk of hypercalcaemia when used within the specified dose ranges. Increased risk of hypocalcaemia with cinacalcet-based therapy previously was suggested by the results of a randomized controlled study showing that cinacalcet with concurrent low-dose vitamin D lowered calcium and was associated with a 7% rate of hypocalcaemia in patients with SHPT on dialysis. To treat cinacalcet-induced hypocalcaemia in clinical practice, physicians may increase calcium supplementation through increased dietary intake, the use of calcium-containing phosphate binders or by incremental adjustment of dialysate calcium, all of which may increase calcium load.

Chronic kidney disease stage G5D — implementation and challenges note that no studies have demonstrated that lowering PTH with medical treatments translates to reductions in mortality or cardiovascular events, yet historical declines in extremely high PTH levels and parathyroidectomies after routine use of calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues support heeding the recommendation; in the United States, the high cost of cinacalcet may limit its use and the uptake of etelcalcetide remains to be determined.

### A randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of cinacalcet on bone and cardiovascular parameters in haemodialysis patients with advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114xyFo8]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies have shown that derangements of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), phosphate and calcium are linked to increased mortality. A higher iPTH has also been associated with increased calcification and cardiomyopathy. Cinacalcet enabled increasing numbers of patients to achieve targets for CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), although there is continued restriction on its use. Since the start of this trial there has been some evidence that calcimimetics may reduce progression of vascular calcification. Calcification progression has been studied with cinacalcet and other CKD-MBD medications but the few randomised trials have allowed a disparity of parathyroid hormone or phosphate control between arms so that uncertainty has remained regarding whether it is the medication or the control that has been beneficial.

The primary aim of this study was to determine if cinacalcet treatment and standard therapy attenuated progression of vascular calcification compared to standard therapy in haemodialysis patients when equivalent control of secondary hyperparathyroidism was achieved between treatment arms. Our trial is different from the ADVANCE trial in that we aimed for equivalent biochemical targets in the treatment arms and did not specify a maximum vitamin D dose.

The KDIGO guidelines published in 2009 suggest aiming for an iPTH level within the range of 2–9 times the upper limit of normal. A subsequent observational study by Floege et al. showed a survival benefit in patients achieving the tighter KDOQI iPTH target of 150–300 pg/mL along with the targets for calcium (2.10–2.37 mmol/L) and phosphate (1.13–1.78 mmol/L). In light of this we performed a post-hoc analysis investigating the whole trial population to determine if any differences in endpoints were associated with changes in PTH, phosphate and other biomarkers.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^114o8Qbf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

The other unique contribution of our case is showing that cinacalcet increased urinary calcium excretion. We propose that this is due to activation of renal CaSRs. CaSRs are most highly expressed in the thick ascending limb of Henle. Here, CASRs inhibit the NKCC2 sodium–potassium–chloride cotransporter and the ROMK channel, thereby increasing urinary calcium excretion. Therefore, lasix, which also inhibits NKCC2, may have synergized with cinacalcet. In addition to acting at the apical membrane, CaSR also controls the expression of claudin-14 and claudin-16 at the tight junctions of the thick ascending limb, further inhibiting calcium reabsorption in the kidney. Increased fractional excretion of calcium was not seen in one other case of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia after cinacalcet treatment leading to the hypothesis that the effects are mediated by reduced intestinal absorption of calcium. However, this patient also had high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leaving open the possibility of a different mechanism of action than in pure PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia. Though we did find an increase fractional excretion of calcium, direct effects on the bone and the gut cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, we did not measure biochemical markers of bone turnover in this patient before or after cinacalcet treatment. However, the fact that cinacalcet has been effective in cases where repeated doses of denosumab and zoledronic acid have already been given suggests that an effect on osteoclasts is not necessary. Finally, we note that cinacalcet is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cinacalcet dosing instructions for Child-Pugh Class B patients do not provide specific adjustments, however they do state that drug exposure and half-life for this group are increased. Therefore, the effect of cinacalcet in this patient may have been heightened.

### Cinacalcet increases renal calcium excretion in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia: a case report [^111Ggygn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Lastly, steroids have been reported to be beneficial in improving hypercalcemia in some cases. These cases are often patients with granulomatous diseases causing hypercalcemia from enhanced intestinal calcium absorption due to increased endogenous calcitriol production. By decreasing calcitriol production, steroids have been shown to thereby reduce serum calcium concentrations. Because our patient had PTHrp-mediated hypercalcemia with a suppressed 1,25 Vitamin D level consistent with this diagnosis, steroids would not likely have benefited him and therefore were not offered.

Of importance with any therapy in an individual with so many co-morbidities, the treatment was well-received and tolerated by the patient, especially given limitations of other agents. He reported ease of administration, which was important given his oral comorbidities, and convenient dosing with his other medications without added burden. He denied any adverse effects of cinacalcet, and overall, he tolerated the treatment well. He was eager to share this case and treatment in hopes of helping future patients. Taken together, we suggest that cinacalcet may be useful for the treatment of PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia of malignancy especially when the patient is at higher risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Clinical experience with cinacalcet HCl [^117EyhBd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with parathyroid gland hyperplasia, increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production and secretion, disturbed bone and mineral metabolism, soft tissue calcification and an increased risk of death. The condition is an almost universal complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and currently is managed by treatment with phosphate binders and vitamin D compounds, both of which are associated with significant side effects, including hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Therapy with calcimimetics is a new approach to the treatment of SHPT. These agents act at the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), where they increase the sensitivity of the receptor to ionized serum calcium. Activation of the CaR results in a rapid reduction in PTH secretion. The calcimimetic drug cinacalcet HCl currently is undergoing clinical trials in dialysis patients who have uncontrolled SHPT, despite treatment with vitamin D compounds and/or phosphate binders. Clinical trials have confirmed that the drug rapidly reduces plasma PTH, phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P) levels, and that levels of PTH, phosphorus and Ca x P remain suppressed for up to 3 years. In clinical trials, cinacalcet HCl was a well-tolerated drug; only nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently in patients who took cinacalcet HCl than in those who took placebo, and the occurrence of transient hypocalcaemia was limited to the initial phase of the treatment. Cinacalcet HCl is therefore a potentially highly effective and well-tolerated treatment for SHPT in patients with ESRD.

### Long-term treatment with cinacalcet and conventional therapy reduces parathyroid hyperplasia in severe secondary hyperparathyroidism [^113Y8AYS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Study design

The treatment protocol integrated cinacalcet with patients' existing pharmacological sHPT therapies (calcium supplements, phosphate binders or vitamin D sterols). Treatment with cinacalcet did not require a pharmacological wash-out period. The starting dose of cinacalcet was 30 mg/day. This was increased by 30 mg every 21–30 days, until the patient reached the targets indicated in the KDOQI™ guidelines. The maximum dose of cinacalcet administered was 150 mg/day. As cinacalcet treatment was used for compassionate use before commercialization in Italy, all patients signed an informed consent form.

Conventional therapy was adjusted during follow-up according to the OPTIMA algorithm. When indicated, the dose of a vitamin D sterol was reduced by ∼50% in sequential steps until a minimum administered dose was reached: intravenous calcitriol, 0.5 μg three times per week; intravenous alfacalcidol, 1 μg three times per week; intravenous paricalcitol, 2 μg three times per week; oral calcitriol, 0.25 μg three times per week; oral alfacalcidol, 0.25 μg/day. The dose of cinacalcet was reduced if a patient was not receiving vitamin D. Phosphate binder dosages were modulated depending on serum Ca and P levels in an attempt to maintain Ca × P within the international guidelines range.

Biochemical parameters [P, Ca, Ca × P, iPTH and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] and the morphology and vascular pattern of the parathyroid glands were measured at baseline and every 6 months thereafter, for a follow-up period of 24–30 months. Changes in cinacalcet dosing and the onset of any side effects were recorded throughout this period. iPTH was measured using the Nichols IRMA method.

To prove the effect of cinacalcet on the functional behaviour of parathyroid glands, an additional experiment was performed to see whether or not serum iPTH increased immediately after an interruption of cinacalcet. In the absence of any change in other treatments, the drug was stopped for 2 weeks in three patients who had experienced the highest reductions in iPTH and gland volume and in two patients who had experienced the highest reduction in iPTH, but only mild reductions in gland volume and vascularization. iPTH was measured twice, under exactly the same conditions (i.e. at morning, before the dialysis, at the start and at the end of the test and finally 2 weeks after restarting the therapy).

### Predictors of cinacalcet discontinuation and reinitiation in hemodialysis patients: results from 7 European countries [^116VXYb8]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that can lead to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, and serum phosphorus levels. Estimates of SHPT prevalence vary substantially, with PTH levels > 300 pg/ml in 30–50% of hemodialysis patients in most countries. SHPT is associated with increased risks of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in dialysis patients and is typically managed using a variety of treatments, including changes to dietary intake or dialysis prescription, vitamin D compounds, calcimimetics, and phosphate binders.

Cinacalcet (Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA United States) is an oral calcimimetic agent used in approximately 15–20% of the European hemodialysis population. It directly reduces PTH levels with an additional resultant effect of decreasing serum calcium and phosphorus levels. As with most chronically administered medications, the putative benefits of cinacalcet therapy are thought to manifest when patients are taking it consistently as prescribed, and consequently, the benefits of cinacalcet may not be fully realized when not remaining on therapy.

Medication non-adherence – failure to follow timing, dosage, or frequency recommendations –precludes patients from attaining the greatest benefits of their prescribed therapy, and has been associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and health care costs. A very broad range in medication non-adherence has been estimated in hemodialysis patients, with estimates ranging from 3 to 80% across 19 studies, and 13 to 99% across 44 studies. Although medication non-adherence can be difficult to accurately measure, it is meaningful to understand variations across nephrologists in rates of starting and stopping cinacalcet prescriptions, and related factors. Despite evidence of the benefits of managing SHPT-related biochemistries with cinacalcet, post-marketing studies in real-world settings - largely in the US - indicate that treatment discontinuation is common, and is associated with demographic, clinical, and financial factors.

### Cinacalcet HCl, an oral calcimimetic agent for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study [^115todTe]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism is challenging with traditional therapy. The calcimimetic cinacalcet HCl acts on the calcium-sensing receptor to increase its sensitivity to calcium, thereby reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with PTH ≥ 300 pg/ml despite traditional therapy. A total of 395 patients received once-daily oral cinacalcet (260 HD, 34 PD) or placebo (89 HD, 12 PD) titrated from 30 to 180 mg to achieve a target intact PTH (iPTH) level of ≤ 250 pg/ml. During a 10-wk efficacy assessment phase, cinacalcet was more effective than control for PTH reduction outcomes, including proportion of patients with mean iPTH levels ≤ 300 pg/ml (46 versus 9%), proportion of patients with ≥ 30% reduction in iPTH from baseline (65 versus 13%), and proportion of patients with ≥ 20, ≥ 40, or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline. Cinacalcet had comparable efficacy in HD and PD patients; 50% of PD patients achieved a mean iPTH ≤ 300 pg/ml. Cinacalcet also significantly reduced serum calcium, phosphorus, and Ca x P levels compared with control treatment. The most common side effects, nausea and vomiting, were usually mild to moderate in severity and transient. Once-daily oral cinacalcet was effective in rapidly and safely reducing PTH, Ca x P, calcium, and phosphorus levels in patients who received HD or PD. Cinacalcet offers a new therapeutic option for controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^116Km3cD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Another approach is to target the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcimimetics, allosteric modulators of the CaSR, directly reduce parathyroid cell hormone secretion by binding to sites that increase the receptors' affinity for calcium. Thus, sensitivity to extracellular calcium is enhanced. A first-generation calcimimetic, R-568, was used for 2 yr in a patient with metastatic parathyroid cancer with controlled hypercalcemia. R-568 has been replaced by cinacalcet, a more potent second-generation agent with a longer half-life and more predictable hepatic metabolism. In benign PHPT, cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium and partially reduces PTH concentrations for up to 3 yr.

Recently, the results of a multicenter study of cinacalcet in 29 patients with inoperable parathyroid carcinoma were published. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients experiencing a ≥ 1-mg/dl reduction in serum calcium from baseline at the end of the titration phase. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in serum calcium, plasma PTH, bone turnover markers, and health-related quality of life variables. The dose of cinacalcet in this study was titrated from 30 mg twice daily (a dose that might be effective in benign PHPT) up to 90 mg four times daily as required to lower serum calcium levels. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 1051 days (mean, 328 ± 306 days). Cinacalcet effectively reduced hypercalcemia in about two thirds of patients with inoperable parathyroid carcinoma (Fig. 3). In the responders (18 of 29 patients), serum calcium levels declined from 15.0 ± 0.5 to 11.2 ± 0.3 mg/dl (p < 0.001), with the greatest responses seen in those patients with the highest levels of serum calcium at study entry. It was of interest that the marked reductions in serum calcium were not accompanied by a similar fall in circulating PTH. PTH levels reached a nadir 4 h after drug administration, but the decline was not pronounced, nor was it sustained. Although hypotheses abound, the reason for the discrepancy in calcium and PTH response to cinacalcet remains unclear at this time. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. Reported in more than one half of all patients receiving cinacalcet at these doses, these symptoms necessitated discontinuation of drug in some cases. Serious adverse events, including fracture and death, were not considered to be drug related. Instead, they were expected consequences of the patients' longstanding, often widely metastatic, underlying disease. There are no data suggesting that cinacalcet alters the course of the parathyroid cancer itself. Therefore, this agent should not be introduced to control hypercalcemia in a patient with a metastatic lesion that is accessible and amenable to surgical extirpation. However, the data do suggest that cinacalcet is useful in reducing calcium levels, and is tolerated in many patients at cumulative doses up to 360 mg/d. Furthermore, unlike other options for treatment of hypercalcemia, this agent can be used in patients with the renal impairment so common in patients with longstanding parathyroid cancer. Cinacalcet therefore represents an important new option for management of intractable hypercalcemia in patients with inoperable disease.

### Prescription patterns and mineral metabolism abnormalities in the cinacalcet era: results from the MBD-5D study [^111qjbsh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Prescription patterns for hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism have varied widely since market introduction of cinacalcet. This study examined associations between prescription patterns and subsequent laboratory values.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Using a Mineral and Bone Disorder Outcomes Study for Japanese CKD Stage 5D Patients subcohort, 1716 prevalent hemodialysis patients (4048 sets for repeated measures between January 2008 and July 2009) with an intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level > 180 pg/ml who used intravenous vitamin D receptor activator (VDRA) without cinacalcet were selected. Prescription patterns were defined based on cinacalcet administration (starting or not) and VDRA dosage change (decreased [< -25%], stable [-25% to 25%], or increased [> 25%]). Proportion differences (PDs) were determined for decreasing iPTH levels by at least one category (< 180, 180–299, 300–499, and ≥ 500 pg/ml) and for achieving target phosphorus (3.5–6.0 mg/dl) and calcium (8.4–10.0 mg/dl) levels, adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

The starting cinacalcet and increased VDRA patterns were associated with decreasing iPTH levels (PD, 0.25 and 0.13; 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs], 0.19–0.31 and 0.09–0.17, respectively); combination use had an additive association (PD, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.42). The starting cinacalcet and decreased VDRA combination was associated with simultaneously achieving target phosphorus (PD, 0.12; 95% CI: 0.04–0.20) and calcium (PD, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.17) levels.

Conclusions

Certain combinations of cinacalcet and VDRA were associated with decreasing iPTH and achieving targets for phosphorus and calcium. Combinations may prove advantageous versus VDRA alone in managing secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of cinacalcet hydrochloride in hemodialysis patients at doses up to 200 mg once daily [^1166uZD6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (HCl) can be used to manage the secondary hyperparathyroidism of patients with chronic kidney disease. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of cinacalcet HCl over a dose range of 25 to 300 mg/d in patients receiving dialysis.

Methods

Hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned 4:1 to receive cinacalcet HCl or placebo in this double-blind study. Cinacalcet HCl doses were escalated weekly in 25-mg increments from 25 to 300 mg/d. Noncompartmental methods were used to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters of cinacalcet (the free-base). The effects of cinacalcet concentration on plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum calcium levels were evaluated.

Results

Of 23 patients enrolled (17 patients, cinacalcet HCl; 6 patients, placebo), 10 patients (8 patients, cinacalcet HCl; 2 patients, placebo) completed the study. Plasma concentration, median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours after dosing, and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet increased with doses up to 200 mg once daily. Median oral clearance ranged from 222 to 599 L/h, and median time after dosing when C max occurred ranged from 2 to 3 hours across all doses. The pharmacokinetics were linear over the 25- to 200-mg once-daily dose range, with no substantial increase in exposure at greater than 200 mg. Changes in plasma PTH concentrations correlated inversely with cinacalcet concentration. The concentration-effect relationship was well described by an inhibitory maximal effect model. Cinacalcet HCl was reasonably tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups (76%, cinacalcet; 80%, placebo). Gastrointestinal events were noted at greater doses and may be dose related.

Conclusion

Cinacalcet HCl shows a dose-proportional increase in exposure over the range of 25 to 200 mg once daily in patients on hemodialysis therapy, and kinetics were linear up to 200 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups.

### Calcimimetics: a remedy for all problems of excess parathyroid hormone activity in chronic kidney disease? [^116sLztM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is now available for use clinically to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism among patients undergoing dialysis regularly. It acts as an allosteric activator of the calcium-sensing receptor, the molecular mechanism that controls parathyroid hormone secretion. This mechanism of action differs fundamentally from that of the vitamin D sterols, which heretofore have been the only definitive pharmacological intervention for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Recent Findings

The ability of calcimimetic agents to enhance signaling through the calcium-sensing receptor in parathyroid cells affects several important components of parathyroid gland function. Results from several large clinical trials demonstrate that cinacalcet effectively lowers plasma parathyroid hormone levels in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism when used either alone or together with vitamin D. Unlike the vitamin D sterols, which generally raise serum calcium and phosphorus levels, treatment with cinacalcet is associated with modest reductions in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. The impact of these biochemical changes on renal bone disease and on soft-tissue and vascular calcification during long-term treatment has yet to be characterized fully. Cinacalcet also diminishes parathyroid hormone gene expression, and studies in experimental animals indicate that its use retards the progression of parathyroid gland hyperplasia and increases bone mass. If confirmed in future clinical trials in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, these features represent potentially important ancillary therapeutic benefits.

Summary

Calcimimetic agents have diverse effects on parathyroid gland function that may enhance the overall medical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing dialysis regularly.

14.1 	Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

Three 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of similar design were conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis. A total of 665 patients were randomized to cinacalcet HCl and 471 patients to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 54 years, 62% were male, and 52% were Caucasian. The average baseline iPTH level by the Nichols IRMA was 712 pg/mL, with 26% of the patients having a baseline iPTH level > 800 pg/mL. The mean baseline Ca × P product was 61 mg²/dL². The average duration of dialysis prior to study enrollment was 67 months. Ninety-six percent of patients were on hemodialysis and 4% on peritoneal dialysis. At study entry, 66% of the patients were receiving vitamin D sterols and 93% were receiving phosphate binders. Cinacalcet HCl (or placebo) was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and titrated every 3 or 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve an iPTH of ≤ 250 pg/mL. The dose was not increased if a patient had any of the following: iPTH ≤ 200 pg/mL, serum calcium < 7.8 mg/dL, or any symptoms of hypocalcemia. If a patient experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia or had a serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL, calcium supplements and/or calcium-based phosphate binders could be increased. If these measures were insufficient, the vitamin D dose could be increased. Approximately 70% of patients in the cinacalcet HCl arm and 80% of the patients in the placebo arm completed the 6-month studies. In the primary efficacy analysis, 40% of the patients on cinacalcet HCl and 5% of placebo-treated patients achieved an iPTH ≤ 250 pg/mL (p < 0.001) (Table 6, Figure 1). These studies showed that cinacalcet HCl reduced iPTH while lowering Ca x P, calcium, and phosphorus levels (Table 6, Figure 2). The median dose of cinacalcet HCl at the completion of the studies was 90 mg. Patients with milder disease typically required lower doses.

### Predictors of cinacalcet discontinuation and reinitiation in hemodialysis patients: results from 7 European countries [^113jKGnM]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In our study, we found time-varying PTH levels to be highly associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of cinacalcet. Our finding of an increased rate of discontinuation at PTH < 150 pg/ml is consistent with the lower PTH target suggested by current international guidelines for hemodialysis patients (2 to 9 times the upper normal limit, approximately 130–585 pg/ml) and with approved prescribing information for cinacalcet. Similarly, our findings of an increasingly stronger association with increasingly higher PTH levels above 300 pg/ml with cinacalcet reinitiation align with PTH upper limits in European countries in the DOPPS. In DOPPS 5, 89% of facilities reported using an upper limit of 300 pg/ml or higher with a median upper limit among all facilities of 450 pg/ml. Very low serum calcium levels < 7.5 mg/dl though uncommon were associated with a higher adjusted rate of discontinuation (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 0.83–4.04) compared to patients having a serum calcium level of 8.4–10.2 mg/dl. Higher risk of discontinuation was also seen for moderately low calcium levels between 7.5 and 8.4 mg/dl (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.04–2.60). Hypocalcemia is a contraindication for cinacalcet prescription, but a report from Brunelli, et al. suggested that in most patients, calcium levels typically returned to normal levels within 90 days regardless of directed therapeutic intervention; see also Floege et al.

5.1 Hypocalcemia

Cinacalcet tablets lowers serum calcium and can lead to hypocalcemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Significant lowering of serum calcium can cause paresthesias, myalgias, muscle spasms, tetany, seizures, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets, including in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of cinacalcet tablets have not been established in pediatric patients [see Pediatric Use (8.4)].

Cinacalcet tablets are not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1)]. In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis, the long-term safety and efficacy of cinacalcet tablets have not been established. Clinical studies indicate that cinacalcet-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with cinacalcet-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels. In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of cinacalcet-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.

Calcimimetics

Cinacalcet is the first available calcimimetic drug, which increases the sensitivity of the CaSR in parathyroid cells to the circulating calcium, thus leading to a decreased synthesis and secretion of PTH, and in turn of calcium. It was first approved for patients with SHPT and consequently was available as a treatment alternative to PTX for patients with PHPT. Indications for its use in hyperparathyroidism are summarized in Table 4. Large clinical studies over the years have proven its prolonged efficacy in normalizing calcium and reducing PTH levels in PHPT patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis have recently highlighted the efficacy of this well-tolerated drug in reducing and normalizing calcium levels in nearly 90% of patients, which is accompanied by a significant increase in phosphate levels. Although PTH levels are diminished, only 10% of patients reach normalization. The results of PRIMARA study, a multicenter prospective observational study including 303 PHPT patients, confirmed the efficacy of cinacalcet in diminishing calcium levels in PHPT. Sixty percent of patients treated with a median daily dose of 30 mg experienced ≥ 1 mg/dL (> 0.25 mmol/L) reductions of calcium levels after 12 months of cinacalcet treatment. The main adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms and no significant safety concerns were reported. Cinacalcet seems to be equally effective in normalizing serum calcium over a wide range of PHPT disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic disease to end-organ complications. Low-dose cinacalcet (30 mg per day) is a well-tolerated and effective treatment of PHPT hypercalcemia and may be of choice as a bridge to surgery in PHPT patients with severe hypercalcemia and bone disease who are at risk of postsurgical HBS. Additional favorable effects of the drug regarding serum phosphorus and urinary calcium excretion have also been reported. The effect on bone turnover as measured by biochemical bone markers appears to be diverse. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and cohort studies, it was confirmed that cinacalcet normalizes serum calcium and significantly reduces PTH levels. However, cinacalcet demonstrated no beneficial effect on BMD at all sites in two nonrandomized studies, whereas RCTs reporting on the effect on BMD as a primary or secondary outcome are still missing. Therefore, combined treatment with an antiresorptive drug may be considered in PHPT patients with overt bone disease.

### Long-term treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with the calcimimetic cinacalcet HCl [^112Rq6M2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism often require therapy that provides long-term control of parathyroid hormone concentrations without increasing calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Cinacalcet modulates the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland to reduce secretion of parathyroid hormone and lower serum calcium, phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product in haemodialysis patients.

Methods

Dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [parathyroid hormone (PTH) level ≥ 300 pg/ml] who were enrolled in one of four phase 2 placebo-controlled studies were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all patients received cinacalcet. For this extension study, cinacalcet was initiated at 30 mg in all patients and the dose was escalated to a maximum of 180 mg once daily if PTH concentrations were > 250 pg/ml. Use of concomitant vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders was not restricted.

Results

The analysis of all patients (n = 59) completing 100 weeks of cinacalcet treatment showed long-term control of PTH and calcium-phosphorus product. Approximately 55% achieved a PTH concentration ≤ 300 pg/ml at the week-100 study visit, and approximately 60% had at least a 30% reduction in PTH from baseline. Serum calcium, phosphorus and the calcium-phosphorus product did not increase during the study. Concomitant vitamin D sterol and phosphate binder therapy remained stable. Cinacalcet was safe and generally well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg/day.

Conclusions

In this long-term study, cinacalcet effectively sustained reductions in PTH for up to 3 years without increasing concentrations of serum calcium, phosphorus or calcium-phosphorus product.

### Incidence, predictors and therapeutic consequences of hypocalcemia in patients treated with cinacalcet in the EVOLVE trial [^1138xek9]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

The calcimimetic cinacalcet is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving dialysis, and asymptomatic hypocalcemia is often observed following its initiation. Here we investigated the incidence, predictors and therapeutic consequences of hypocalcemia by a post hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EValuation Of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower CardioVascular Events (EVOLVE) trial. Hypocalcemia was classified as mild (total serum calcium 8.0–8.39 mg/dL), moderate (7.5–7.99 mg/dL) or severe (under 7.5 mg/dL). At least one episode of hypocalcemia developed within 16 weeks after the first administered dose among 58.3% of 1938 patients randomized to cinacalcet versus 14.9% of 1923 patients randomized to placebo. Hypocalcemia in the cinacalcet group was severe in 18.4% of the patients versus 4.4% in the placebo group. Severe hypocalcemia following administration of cinacalcet was associated with higher baseline plasma parathyroid hormone, lower corrected total serum calcium, higher serum alkaline phosphatase, geographic region (patients from Latin America and Russia had a higher risk relative to the United States) and higher body mass index. The median cinacalcet dose immediately prior to the first hypocalcemic episode was 54–58 mg/day and similar in the three hypocalcemia categories. In the majority of patients, hypocalcemia resolved spontaneously within 14 days without modification of background therapy. Among patients who received an intervention, the most common was an increase in the active vitamin D sterol dose. Thus, the occurrence of hypocalcemia is frequent following initiation of cinacalcet and the likelihood of developing hypocalcemia was related to the severity of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia was generally asymptomatic and self-limited.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterized by chronically elevated serum calcium and inappropriately normal or increased PTH.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate long-term tolerability, safety, and efficacy of cinacalcet in PHPT patients.

Design and Setting

A 4.5-yr open-label extension study was conducted at 14 study centers in the United States.

Patients Or Other Participants

Forty-five subjects with PHPT from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1-yr trial were continued into this study.

Interventions

After the parent study, all subjects were treated with 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily, increasing to 50 mg twice daily during the 12-wk titration if serum calcium levels were 10.3 mg/dl or higher and then maintained on cinacalcet for up to 4.5 yr.

Main Outcome Measures

Assessments included serum calcium, PTH, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase, and areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Vital signs, safety chemistries and hematology, and adverse events were monitored throughout.

Results

Compared with baseline, cinacalcet treatment improved biochemical measures of PHPT including reducing serum calcium and PTH and increasing serum phosphate with slight increases in alkaline phosphatase. No changes in z-scores of aBMD at spine, hip, or wrist were seen with annual percent changes, consistent with reports for untreated postmenopausal women or PHPT patients. Safety biochemistries remained normal, and adverse events (most commonly arthralgia, myalgia, diarrhea, respiratory infection, and nausea) were mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Treatment of PHPT patients with cinacalcet for up to 5.5 yr maintained normocalcemia, reduced plasma PTH, increased serum phosphate and alkaline phosphatase with no significant effects on aBMD, and was well tolerated.

Cinacalcet effects on serum BUN, creatinine, calcium and phosphorous

Uremic induction following 5/6 Nx in rats resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in BUN and creatinine indicative of CKD (Table 1). Treatment (cinacalcet or vehicle) had no effect on these biomarkers of uremia in either sham or 5/6 Nx rats (Table 1).

Cinacalcet significantly decreased serum calcium (Figure 6) and increased serum phosphorous (Figure 7) in 5/6 Nx rats treated daily for 6 weeks compared with vehicle-treated 5/6 Nx animals. This effect did not persist after discontinuation of cinacalcet treatment; serum calcium and phosphorous returned toward vehicle-treated control levels by Weeks 7, 8 and 9 corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, after treatment termination (Figures 6 and 7). This is in contrast to the persisting effect in 5/6 Nx rats treated continuously with cinacalcet for the whole 9-week period (Figures 6 and 7). In sham-operated rats, 9-week cinacalcet treatment significantly decreased serum calcium and increased serum phosphorous compared with sham animals treated with vehicle for the same duration (Figures 6 and 7).

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### Long-term outcomes of cinacalcet and paricalcitol titration protocol for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1137Ly8j]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Long-term outcomes of combined cinacalcet and paricalcitol therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients failing traditional therapies with phosphate binders and active vitamin D compound analogs are not well described. We implemented a titration protocol for cinacalcet and paricalcitol and assessed its long-term effects on bone metabolism and disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Thirty-five patients were started on 30 mg of cinacalcet daily. After 12 months, median cinacalcet dose was 60 mg. There was a 33% increase in number of patients receiving paricalcitol. Average corrected serum calcium (Ca) decreased from 9.5 to 8.8 mg/dl (p = 0.003, 95% CI 0.34–1.04); phosphorus (P) from 6.2 to 5.5 mg/dl (p = 0.047, 95% CI 0.01–1.34); Ca x P product from 58 to 48 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 4.2–15.7); and intact PTH (iPTH) from 426 ± 274 to 300 ± 228 pg/ml (p = 0.03, 95% CI 19.3–401.7). Number of patients achieving three or more K/DOQI criteria increased by 29% (p = 0.009).

QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmia

Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia. Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with cinacalcet tablets.

Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to cinacalcet. Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving cinacalcet.

Seizures

In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of cinacalcet-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients. While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear, the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels. Monitor serum calcium levels in patients with seizure disorders receiving cinacalcet tablets.

Concurrent Administration with Other Calcium-Lowering Drug Products

Concurrent administration of cinacalcet with calcium-lowering drugs including other calcium-sensing receptor agonists could result in severe hypocalcemia. Closely monitor serum calcium in patients receiving cinacalcet and concomitant therapies known to lower serum calcium levels.

Patient Education and Hypocalcemia Treatment

Educate patients on the symptoms of hypocalcemia and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

If corrected serum calcium falls below the lower limit of normal or symptoms of hypocalcemia develop, start or increase calcium supplementation (including calcium, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and/or vitamin D sterols or increases in dialysate calcium concentration). Cinacalcet tablets dose reduction or discontinuation of cinacalcet tablets may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
