## Question

Treatment for shingles

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for shingles (herpes zoster). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and when to treat empirically. Then, I should verify the timing window for antiviral therapy and which agents to choose. Next, I will review dosing, duration, and renal adjustments, followed by special populations and complications. After that, I need to examine pain management strategies, including acute and chronic phases. Finally, I should consider prevention with vaccination and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the urgency to treat. Shingles is typically a clinical diagnosis defined by a unilateral, dermatomal vesicular rash with neuropathic pain; atypical cases without rash (zoster sine herpete) can occur, and PCR can confirm VZV when the diagnosis is uncertain or in immunocompromised hosts, so I should not delay therapy while waiting for labs if the presentation is classic and the patient is within the treatment window [^23a18fec] [^b876ed7d] [^1139dfea].

> Wait, let me verify the timing for antivirals because this is critical. The benefit is greatest when started within 72 hours of rash onset; beyond 72 hours, treatment is still reasonable if new lesions are appearing, pain is severe, or the patient is immunocompromised, but efficacy wanes with delay, so I should act promptly whenever possible [^23a18fec] [^1ec410f1] [^1139dfea].

> I need to check which antivirals are first-line and why. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are all FDA-approved for shingles; valacyclovir and famciclovir offer improved oral bioavailability and more convenient dosing, which can aid adherence, while acyclovir remains effective and is often less expensive; choice can be individualized based on cost, access, and renal function [^3c2c706e] [^14807a1c] [^d405dcf5] [^23a18fec].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and duration to avoid errors. Standard regimens are valacyclovir 1,000 mg orally three times daily for 7 days, famciclovir 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days, or acyclovir 800 mg orally five times daily for 7–10 days; in immunocompromised patients or those with slow lesion resolution, extending therapy to 10–14 days is reasonable, and IV acyclovir is indicated for severe disease or visceral involvement [^0a0afe9f] [^3b049968] [^4abe2e40].

> I should double-check renal dosing because accumulation is a key safety issue. Both valacyclovir and famciclovir require dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance, and acyclovir dosing should also be modified in renal impairment; I need to calculate eGFR and adjust accordingly to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk, especially in older adults or those with CKD [^4abe2e40] [^6390688e].

> Next, I should review special populations and complications. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, transplant, or on immunosuppressive therapy, preferred therapy is valacyclovir or famciclovir for localized disease, with IV acyclovir for extensive cutaneous or visceral involvement; for herpes zoster ophthalmicus, I should involve ophthalmology and consider topical steroids for stromal keratitis or anterior uveitis alongside systemic antivirals; in pregnancy, oral acyclovir is considered safe and should be used when indicated, balancing maternal benefit and fetal risk [^0a0afe9f] [^3b049968] [^2d4b58de] [^notfound].

> Let me consider pain management in the acute phase, and I should confirm what is evidence-based. Early systemic analgesia following the WHO ladder is appropriate; for moderate-to-severe pain or risk factors for PHN, adding a tricyclic antidepressant such as nortriptyline or an anticonvulsant such as gabapentin or pregabalin can be reasonable despite limited acute-phase data, and I should monitor for sedation and falls in older adults; corticosteroids may modestly reduce acute pain and improve function but do not reduce PHN incidence, so I should reserve them for select cases without contraindications and avoid relying on them for PHN prevention [^a13fbcd4] [^5ccd6c33] [^1ec410f1] [^925a2ac7].

> I will now examine postherpetic neuralgia management because this drives long-term morbidity. First-line options include gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline, and topical lidocaine patches; tramadol or other opioids can be considered for refractory pain, and combination therapy is often needed; I should set expectations, titrate slowly, and reassess efficacy and tolerability regularly [^b876ed7d] [^5a0670c4] [^c7d6a242].

> But wait, what about prevention, since that changes the calculus for future risk. Recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is preferred and recommended as a two-dose series 2–6 months apart for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older, and for immunocompromised adults aged 19 years and older; it substantially reduces shingles and PHN incidence, and even in those who develop shingles after vaccination, disease tends to be milder; I should counsel on local and systemic reactogenicity and coordinate timing around immunosuppressive therapies [^23a18fec] [^abc9a0b8] [^b3ec2380].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. For immunocompetent adults within 72 hours of rash onset, start valacyclovir or famciclovir for 7 days, extend if needed, and manage pain with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, escalating to gabapentinoids or TCAs if pain is moderate-to-severe; for immunocompromised patients or severe disease, use IV acyclovir initially and step down to oral therapy to complete 10–14 days; for ophthalmic involvement, add ophthalmology co-management and topical steroids when indicated; for all patients, discuss vaccination once the acute episode resolves to prevent recurrence and PHN [^23a18fec] [^0a0afe9f] [^3b049968].

> Hold on, I should verify key takeaways to ensure nothing is missing. Early antiviral therapy within 72 hours is the cornerstone to reduce acute pain, accelerate healing, and likely reduce PHN risk; valacyclovir and famciclovir are preferred for convenience and adherence; pain management should be proactive and multimodal; and vaccination is the most effective strategy to prevent shingles and PHN, with Shingrix as the current standard of care in eligible populations [^23a18fec] [^1ec410f1] [^b3ec2380].

The cornerstone of shingles treatment is **early antiviral therapy** with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, ideally within 72 hours of rash onset, to reduce viral replication, hasten healing, and lower the risk of complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) [^23a18fec] [^1ec410f1]. Valacyclovir and famciclovir are preferred for their **convenient dosing** and superior bioavailability, while acyclovir remains effective and is often used in immunocompromised patients or when cost is a concern [^bb0af722] [^0a0afe9f]. Pain control follows the WHO ladder, escalating from acetaminophen or NSAIDs to gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, or opioids as needed [^5ccd6c33] [^a13fbcd4]. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended and should be reserved for select cases with severe pain or complications, given limited benefit and potential risks [^925a2ac7]. Prevention is critical: **recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix)** is recommended for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years and immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years, significantly reducing shingles and PHN risk [^23a18fec] [^abc9a0b8] [^b3ec2380].

---

## Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is the **foundation of shingles treatment**, with greatest benefit when started within 72 hours of rash onset [^23a18fec] [^1ec410f1].

| **Antiviral agent** | **Standard dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | 800 mg orally five times daily for 7–10 days | - Effective <br/> - Lower cost <br/> - Requires frequent dosing [^3c2c706e] |
| Valacyclovir | 1,000 mg orally three times daily for 7 days | - Convenient dosing <br/> - Superior bioavailability [^14807a1c] [^af7237d7] |
| Famciclovir | 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days | - Convenient dosing <br/> - Effective alternative [^d405dcf5] [^69d62609] |

---

Initiating antivirals after 72 hours may still be beneficial if new lesions are appearing or if the patient is immunocompromised [^1ec410f1] [^3b049968]. Intravenous acyclovir is indicated for **severe disease**, immunocompromised patients, or complications such as encephalitis or disseminated infection [^3b049968] [^2c93148a].

---

## Pain management

Pain control is essential in shingles management and should follow the **WHO analgesic ladder**, escalating therapy based on pain severity [^5ccd6c33] [^a13fbcd4].

- **Mild pain**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs.
- **Moderate pain**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline).
- **Severe pain**: Tramadol or other opioids.

Gabapentin and pregabalin are particularly effective for **neuropathic pain** and may reduce the risk of PHN [^b876ed7d] [^5ccd6c33].

---

## Role of corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are **not routinely recommended** for shingles due to limited evidence of benefit and potential risks. They may be considered in select cases of severe pain or complications, such as Ramsay Hunt syndrome, but should be used cautiously and in combination with antiviral therapy [^925a2ac7] [^1ec410f1].

---

## Management of complications

- **Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)**: Persistent neuropathic pain lasting > 90 days after rash onset. Management includes gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine patches, or capsaicin cream [^b876ed7d] [^5a0670c4].
- **Herpes zoster ophthalmicus**: Ophthalmology consultation and topical corticosteroids may be required for ocular involvement [^3b049968].
- **Disseminated shingles**: Intravenous acyclovir and close monitoring are indicated [^3b049968] [^2c93148a].

---

## Preventive strategies

Prevention is critical to reduce shingles incidence and complications. The **recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix)** is recommended for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years and immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years, significantly reducing shingles and PHN risk [^23a18fec] [^abc9a0b8] [^b3ec2380].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Require aggressive antiviral therapy, often intravenous acyclovir, and careful monitoring for complications [^3b049968] [^2c93148a].
- **Pregnant patients**: Acyclovir is considered safe and should be used when indicated [^notfound].
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are necessary for antiviral agents, particularly valacyclovir and famciclovir [^4abe2e40] [^af7237d7].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

- **Diagnose**: Clinical diagnosis based on unilateral dermatomal rash and pain [^23a18fec].
- **Initiate antivirals**: Within 72 hours of rash onset when possible [^23a18fec].
- **Pain management**: Follow WHO analgesic ladder, escalating as needed [^5ccd6c33].
- **Monitor for complications**: Especially PHN, ocular involvement, and disseminated disease [^23a18fec].
- **Prevention**: Vaccinate eligible patients with Shingrix [^23a18fec].

---

Effective shingles management centers on **early antiviral therapy**, appropriate pain control, and prevention through vaccination, with treatment individualized based on patient factors and complications.

Importance Of The Field

Herpes zoster or shingles is a condition with the potential to result in severe debilitation. It affects approximately 10–30% of the population. Until recently there were only treatments to shorten the duration and lessen the symptoms of herpes zoster, but no practical or approved method of prevention for susceptible immunocompetent adults. The live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck & Co, Inc.) is effective in preventing shingles in individuals 60 years of age and older and recommended by the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Areas Covered In This Review

Literature related to the live attenuated zoster vaccine is reviewed from its beginnings in the early 1970s through to the present.

What The Reader Will Gain

Background information on herpes zoster and up to date information on the live attenuated zoster vaccine including pharmacology, efficacy and safety are covered. New areas of research in zoster vaccination are also discussed.

Take Home Message

The live attenuated zoster vaccine is an effective and well-tolerated method of preventing zoster and the potentially debilitating sequelae and is recommended for immunocompetent patients 60 years of age and older. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating new means of effective prevention.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^57e3d7af]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^20f02a7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug–drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

### Immune therapy for age-related diseases [^e145fd91]. Trends in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Human aging is reaching epidemic proportions as life expectancy increases and birth rate decreases. These demographic trends have led to a sharp increase in the diseases of aging, and an understanding of immune senescence promises to limit the development and progression of these diseases. In this review, we discuss three of the most important diseases of aging: shingles, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. All of these diseases have significant immunological components in either their etiology and/or progression, suggesting that appropriate immune intervention could be used in their prevention or treatment. Indeed, recent clinical studies have already demonstrated that vaccination can reduce the incidence of shingles and might prove effective in patients with Alzheimer's disease and artherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^b876ed7d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Transforaminal vs interlaminar epidural steroid injection for acute-phase shingles: a randomized, prospective trial [^e9d2bb2e]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The acute phase of shingles is characterized by severe pain, and one of the complications of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is associated with prolonged pain. Although factors predicting the development of PHN, as well as its preventative measures, have been investigated, there is no single treatment effective for PHN. Some studies showed effectiveness of epidural injection to alleviate pain associated with acute-phase shingles. In these studies, epidural injection was performed by interlaminar (IL) approach. However, transforaminal (TF) approach may be more effective as it enables injection of steroids and local anesthetics closer to the dorsal root ganglion where inflammation primarily occurs. There have not been any studies comparing the analgesic effects of epidural injection approaches for pain associated with acute-phase shingles.

Objective

We compared the analgesic effects of IL and TF epidural injection approaches for pain associated with acute-phase shingles.

Study Design

We conducted a randomized prospective trial.

Setting

Nara Medical University Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology.

Methods

Forty patients with acute-phase shingles were randomly assigned to receive epidural steroid injections by TF or IL approaches. Patients were evaluated at the baseline, as well as at 1 month and 3 months after the treatment using the VAS and SF-36 scores. Patients with VAS score of over 40 at the 3-month follow-up were considered as having PHN, and the number of patients with PHN was compared between the IL and TF groups.

Results

Except the mental component of the SF-36 score and severity of skin rash, patient characteristics were not significantly different between the groups. VAS scores at 1 and 3-month follow-up were significantly lower than those at the baseline, and there was no difference between the groups. All SF-36 scores were not significantly different between groups at 1- and 3-month. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of PHN between the groups.

Limitations

We had a small sample size that did not reach the number of patients needed by the power analysis in the study. Then, our follow-up period of 3 months was relatively short.

Conclusions

VAS scores, the SF-36 RCS and MCS scores improved in both groups, however, there was no difference in the analgesic effects of the IL and TF epidural steroid injections at 1 and 3 months for acute-phase shingles patients.

Key Words

Shingles epidural steroid injection interlaminar approach; transforaminal approach, fluoroscopic, postherpetic neuralgia, VAS, SF-36.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^0a0afe9f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles), acute localized dermatomal, treatment in people with HIV: Preferred therapy is valacyclovir 1,000 mg PO 3 times a day (AII), or famciclovir 500 mg PO 3 times a day (AII); alternative therapy is acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times daily (BII). Duration is 7 to 10 days; longer duration should be considered if lesions resolve slowly.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^c7d6a242]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^3b049968]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) — preferred therapy for acute localized dermatomal disease is valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg three times a day (AII) for 7–10 days, with consideration of longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve. For extensive cutaneous lesion or visceral involvement, preferred therapy is acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement is evident (AII), with a switch to PO therapy (valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir) after clinical improvement to complete a 10- to 14-day course (BIII). In patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus who have stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation may be necessary, and the role of ART has not been established in these cases.

### A rapidly-growing, heme-crusted lesion [^8fe3ef89]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is true regarding the first-line treatment for this case?
A. The treatment of choice is surgical removal.
B. One possible side effect of the first-line drug of choice is hyperpigmentation on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
C. No treatment is required. The lesion will heal in 3–6 weeks.
D. The first-line drug of choice requires activation by a viral enzyme.
E. The first-line drug of choice inhibits phospholipase A2 and can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Answers:
A. The treatment of choice is surgical removal – Incorrect. Surgical removal would be the standard of care to treat a basal cell carcinoma. However, because the underlying cause is a viral infection, treatment with antiviral medication is recommended.
B. One possible side effect of the first-line drug of choice is hyperpigmentation on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet – Incorrect. This answer refers to the use of emtricitabine, a drug commonly used to treat HIV. While emtricitabine may appropriately be used to treat this patient's HIV, the first-line treatment should be focused on treating the HSV infection before treating the HIV infection.
C. No treatment is required. The lesion will heal in 3–6 weeks – Incorrect. While there is no cure for HSV, antiviral therapy is recommended for HSV infections, especially in patients who are immunocompromised.
D. The first-line drug of choice requires activation by a viral enzyme – Correct. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir each require phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase in order to be activated and can each be used to treat HSV infections. Any one of these three drugs can be considered appropriate first-line treatment for this patient.
E. The first-line drug of choice inhibits phospholipase A2 and can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency – Incorrect. This answer is describing prednisone, a drug commonly used to increase quality of life for shingles infections. Prednisone may also be used to treat HSV encephalitis, but because there are no signs of HSV encephalitis, prednisone is not indicated in this case.

### Famciclovir [^69d62609]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

Two randomized, double-blind trials, 1 placebo-controlled and 1 active-controlled, were conducted in 964 immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated herpes zoster. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of first lesion appearance and was continued for 7 days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were treated with either famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135) or placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was 5 days among famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients as compared to 7 days in placebo-treated patients. The times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts were shorter for famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients in the overall study population. The effects of famciclovir were greater when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset; it was also more profound in patients 50 years of age or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least 1 positive viral culture, famciclovir treated patients had a shorter median duration of viral shedding than placebo-treated patients (1 day and 2 days, respectively).

There were no overall differences in the duration of pain before rash healing between famciclovir-and placebo-treated groups. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing (postherpetic neuralgia) between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (44.4% of total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was shorter in patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg than in those treated with placebo (63 days and 119 days, respectively). No additional efficacy was demonstrated with higher dose of famciclovir.

In the active-controlled trial, 545 patients were treated with 1 of 3 doses of famciclovir three times daily or with acyclovir 800 mg five times daily. Times to full lesion crusting and times to loss of acute pain were comparable for all groups and there were no statistically significant differences in the time to loss of postherpetic neuralgia between famciclovir and acyclovir-treated groups.

### Lidocaine plasters for postherpetic neuralgia? [^5a0670c4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, about 1 in 2,500 people experiences neuropathic pain that is still present 3–6 months after acute herpes zoster (shingles). This condition, known as postherpetic neuralgia, is the most common complication of herpes zoster and can be chronic, intractable and distressing. Treatments used in an attempt to reduce postherpetic neuralgia include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline — an unlicensed indication), antiepileptics (e.g. gabapentin) and opioid analgesics, as well as topical treatments such as capsaicin. However, such treatments may only provide partial pain relief, and tolerability can be a problem, particularly in older patients. Versatis (Grunenthal Ltd), a topical preparation of lidocaine formulated in a plaster, has recently been licensed for treating patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Does it offer useful benefit?

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^5569c129]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing's syndrome — optimal adjunctive management — We recommend providing education to patients and their family/caretaker(s) about their disease, treatment options, and what to expect after remission (Ungraded best practice statement). We recommend that all patients receive monitoring and adjunctive treatment for cortisol-dependent comorbidities (Ungraded best practice statement), and we recommend that a multidisciplinary team, including an experienced endocrinologist, takes patient values and preferences into consideration and provides education about the treatment options to the patient (Ungraded best practice statement). We suggest evaluating CS patients for risk factors of venous thrombosis (2|⊕⊕◯◯) and, in patients with CS undergoing surgery, we suggest perioperative prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (2|⊕⊕◯◯). We recommend that clinicians discuss and offer age-appropriate vaccinations to CS patients — particularly influenza, Herpes zoster, and pneumococcal vaccinations — due to an increased risk of infection (Ungraded best practice statement). Evidence notes that severe hypercortisolism impairs immunity and predisposes to severe, systemic infection and/or sepsis due to bacterial, fungal, and opportunistic pathogens; hypercortisolism alters coagulation-factor profiles for up to 1 year after a surgical cure and carries an increased risk of venous thrombosis, especially in the 4 weeks after surgery; clinicians should consider anticoagulation treatments, and immunization against influenza, shingles, and pneumonia is suggested.

### Herpes zoster [^7c16a2ae]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) or 'shingles' is a painful vesicular rash resulting from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that also causes chickenpox. The incidence of HZ infection (HZI) increases with age and the degree of immunosuppresssion. Post herpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of HZ, occurs after the zoster rash has resolved. Conventional therapies include antivirals, corticosteroids and analgesics, both oral and topical. Here we report a case of HZ in an 80-year-old woman involving maxillary nerve and the article also reviews various treatment modalities available for the management of HZI.

### Clinical overview of shingles (herpes zoster) [^23a18fec]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and can be prevented with Shingrix vaccine.
- Herpes zoster is hard to diagnose in children and younger adults, especially if the clinical presentation is mild.
- Older adults and people who are immunocompromised are at high risk for shingles complications. Clinical features People with herpes zoster can have pain, itching, or tingling in the area where the rash will develop. People with herpes zoster have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes. The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome or on the face. It usually does not cross the body's midline and heals in 2 to 4 weeks. Shingles complications include postherpetic neuralgia, hearing or vision loss, encephalitis, and pneumonia. The signs and symptoms of herpes zoster are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash appears.

However, clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster might not be possible in the absence of a rash. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy. Varicella vaccines contain live attenuated VZV, which results in latent infection. Although herpes zoster has always been uncommon among children, the rate in U. S. children has declined since the routine varicella vaccination program started in 1995.
- Children vaccinated against varicella have lower rates of herpes zosterwhen compared to children who had natural infection with varicella. Treatment and recovery Diagnose and treat early.

There are three preferred antiviral drugs available for the initial treatment of shingles:

- Acyclovir
- Valacyclovir
- Famciclovir These antivirals accelerate the resolution of lesions; reduce the development of new lesions and viral shedding; and decrease the severity of acute pain. Discuss treatment options with your patient to provide a specific treatment plan based on their condition.

Chickenpox and shingles can be more severe and occasionally life threatening in immunosuppressed patients. As such, some groups warrant a more detailed history, serological testing and consideration of prophylaxis following contact with the virus. Active disease may also require more aggressive treatment with antivirals. Guidance for the use of varicella zoster immunoglobulin has recently been updated by Public Health England with important implications for rheumatology patients.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^5bf6ce3f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### A 70-year-old woman with shingles: review of herpes zoster [^dd4b0e8f]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Herpes zoster is a common late complication of varicella-zoster virus exposure and can be further complicated by postherpetic neuralgia. Ms A is a 70-year-old woman with shingles and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome who presented to the emergency department with a few days of earache followed by pain in the back of her head. Using her case as a springboard, the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent older adults are reviewed, in addition to the effectiveness of the herpes zoster vaccine.

### Postherpetic neuralgia after shingles: an under-recognized cause of chronic vulvar pain [^04ace492]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvar shingles, an uncommon presentation of a common disease, probably affects 1.5 million American women during their lifetime and leaves about 150,000 with postherpetic neuralgia, a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can minimize pain severity and duration.

Cases

The case of an 88-year-old woman with sacral shingles is described. Complications led to her demise. A 35-year-old with a 6-year history of disabling vulvar pain and many diagnostic procedures was ultimately diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia.

Conclusion

Shingles needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of vulvar rashes because it is a modifiable risk factor for chronic vulvar pain. The possibility of postherpetic neuralgia must be considered in women with unexplained vulvar dysesthesia.

### Shedding light on shingles: the power of prevention [^b3d7fabd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Shingles, or herpes zoster (HZ), is a common secondary infection caused by a reactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV). More than 95% of immunocompetent individuals aged at least 50 years are seropositive for VZV and are therefore at risk for developing HZ. Age-related increased incidence of HZ and its complications are thought to be related to the decline in cell-mediated immunity. Complications of HZ, which create a significant patient and economic burden, may be neurological, ophthalmological, dermatological, or visceral. HZ vaccination is essential for the prevention of HZ and its consequences. This CME activity reviews the clinical presentations and complications of HZ as well as discusses strategies for prevention (Online access: http://courses.elseviercme.com/shingles/626).

5.2 Immunosuppressive therapy

Good Practice Recommendation 14. All IBD patients to be initiated on immunosuppressive therapy should receive written information regarding the benefits, risks, side effects and monitoring of treatment (Agreement: 97.9%).

It is important that all patients receive written information prior to starting treatment, in addition to counselling regarding the risks of treatment and how these are minimised by monitoring. Patients have differing perceptions regarding treatment and this can significantly influence drug adherence. No study has addressed the impact of specific patient information, but a recent survey of IBD patients showed that patients access a wide variety of information sources about IBD and its treatment. Of these, information from the IBD team and written patient information material were the most widely used, and the most trusted by patients. Information can be provided by IBD teams in written form or by sign posting to official patient support websites that provide high-quality drug information for patients.

5.2.1 Prevention of infection related to IBD and immunosuppressive therapy

If evidence of active HBV, latent or active TB, HCV or HIV infection, seek specialist input prior to commencing immune modifying therapy.

Statement 78. We suggest that blood tests for thiopurine methyltransferase status and screen for HBV, HCV and HIV (and VZV if no history of chicken pox, shingles or varicella vaccination) may be arranged once diagnosis is confirmed for all Crohn's disease and moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 88.9%).

Statement 79.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those on immunosuppressive medications, suffer a high incidence of, and worse clinical outcomes relating to, herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation. We report on the presentation and management of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe perianal HZ after starting azathioprine and oral budesonide treatment. The zoster vaccine may prevent such zoster reactivation in patients with IBD. The zoster vaccine is effective in decreasing the risk of HZ in older adults but its role in younger adults and those with IBD has not been tested prospectively. A review of the potential risks and benefits of this live vaccine in patients with IBD and an approach to further determining its role in this patient population is discussed.

### Do herpes zoster patients receive antivirals? A Dutch national survey in general practice [^24a669c1]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The main complications of herpes zoster (HZ) are postherpetic neuralgia and, in case of HZ ophthalmicus, eye disorders. Antiviral treatment may modify the course of disease and reduce the risk of complications.

Objective

To assess which doctors' and patients' characteristics were related to prescription of antiviral therapy for HZ.

Methods

Ninety general practices (358 008 patients) in The Netherlands registered all patient contacts in a database for one year as part of the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. The present study used ICPC code S70 to search that database for patients with a new diagnosis of HZ. The full-text medical records of the selected patients were then reviewed and the potential determinants for the prescription of antiviral drugs (including characteristics of patients, GPs, and practices) analysed using multilevel logistic regression modelling.

Results

Of the 1129 patients diagnosed with HZ (incidence 3.2/1000 patients/year), 22.5% received antiviral drugs. Independent determinants for prescription of antiviral therapy were age [45–54 years: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.9 (95% CI 1.6–5.0); 55–64 years: OR 4.2 (95% CI 2.4–7.6); 65–74 years: OR 5.1 (95% CI 2.7–9.6); ≥ 75 years: OR 8.1 (95% CI 4.4–15.1)], ophthalmic localisation of the shingles (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.7), and the presence of asthma/COPD (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.6). GPs who reported to strongly adhere to professional guidelines prescribe more frequently antiviral drugs (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.1).

Conclusions

A minority of HZ patients were prescribed antiviral treatment. Increasing age, ophthalmic localisation, presence of asthma/COPD, and adherence to professional guidelines were factors favouring prescription. More information on the determinants of GPs' treatment decisions is necessary for successful implementation of HZ guidelines.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control [^b68761f7]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### Herpes zoster and tofacitinib: clinical outcomes and the risk of concomitant therapy [^d8282aec]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Shingles, also known as herpes zoster (HZ), is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and is a common and potentially debilitating illness 1, 2. Approximately one‐third of the general population will develop HZ within their lifetime 1, and ∼10% of these patients develop postherpetic neuralgia, which can last for months to years and cause significant pain and morbidity 3. Rarely, but especially in immunosuppressed patients, reactivation can result in disseminated or visceral disease, such as encephalitis, or other complications 1. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 1.5‐fold to 2‐fold higher risk of HZ compared with similarly aged individuals in the general population 4, 5. This risk is related in part to the disease itself but can be further increased by RA treatments 4.

Glucocorticoids (GCs), including prednisone, are well‐documented risk factors for HZ 6, 7, and more recently, use of JAK inhibitors, including both tofacitinib and baricitinib, has been associated with a higher rate of HZ (8–10). In addition, although not all studies have documented an increased risk attributable to biologic therapies 11, 12, a recent systematic review suggested an increased risk of HZ associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist treatment 13, and a theoretical risk is associated with various conventional synthetic disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX) and chloroquine 14, 15. Given the increased risk of HZ observed among patients with RA compared with the general population and the risk associated with RA therapies, it is possible that the risk of HZ may be further increased when such therapies are combined.

Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. We recently reported an increased risk of HZ with tofacitinib therapy compared with placebo during the tofacitinib global clinical development program for RA 8. Although the risk of HZ was increased throughout the global program, this risk varied by geographic region, with significantly higher rates reported in Japan and Korea. Many of the patients in the phase III program also used concomitant csDMARDs as well as GCs 8. We undertook the current analysis to better characterize the clinical aspects of HZ events with longer periods of follow‐up and exposure, and to evaluate whether the risk of HZ is greater in patients receiving tofacitinib and concomitant MTX and GCs.

### Issues in the treatment of neurological conditions caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) [^63947eb5]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous neurotropic human herpesvirus. Primary infection usually causes varicella (chicken pox), after which virus becomes latent in ganglia along the entire neuraxis. Decades later, virus reactivates to produce herpes zoster (shingles), a painful dermatomally distributed vesicular eruption. Zoster may be further complicated by postherpetic neuralgia, VZV vasculopathy, myelitis, and segmental motor weakness. VZV reactivation has also been associated with giant cell arteritis. This overview discusses treatment of various conditions that often require both corticosteroids and antiviral drugs. Treatment for VZV-associated disease is often based on case reports and small studies rather than large-scale clinical trials. Issues that require resolution include the optimal duration of such combined therapy, more effective treatment for postherpetic neuralgia, whether some treatments should be given orally or intravenously, the widening spectrum of zoster sine herpete, and the role of antiviral therapy in giant cell arteritis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing herpes zoster (shingles) — HIV adults and adolescents: RZV (Shingrix) is preferred over attenuated ZVL (Zostavax) for prevention of herpes zoster (AIII). RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 50 years, regardless of CD4 count, with a schedule of RZV 0.5 mL IM injection (2 dose series) at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII), and RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are virologically suppressed on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine. If RZV is not available or cannot be given because of allergy or intolerance, ZVL can be administered (0.65 mL SQ for 1 dose) (BIII), but ZVL is contraindicated for persons with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (AIII).

### Safety of herpes zoster vaccine in the shingles prevention study: a randomized trial [^bee51b57]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent older adults. However, its safety has not been described in depth.

Objective

To describe local adverse effects and short- and long-term safety profiles of herpes zoster vaccine in immunocompetent older adults.

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with enrollment from November 1998 to September 2001 and follow-up through April 2004 (mean, 3.4 years). A Veterans Affairs Coordinating Center generated the permutated block randomization scheme, which was stratified by site and age. Participants and follow-up study personnel were blinded to treatment assignments. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00007501)

Setting

22 U.S. academic centers.

Participants

38 546 immunocompetent adults 60 years or older, including 6616 who participated in an adverse events substudy.

Intervention

Single dose of herpes zoster vaccine or placebo.

Measurements

Serious adverse events and rashes in all participants and inoculation-site events in substudy participants during the first 42 days after inoculation. Thereafter, vaccination-related serious adverse events and deaths were monitored in all participants, and hospitalizations were monitored in substudy participants.

Results

After inoculation, 255 (1.4%) vaccine recipients and 254 (1.4%) placebo recipients reported serious adverse events. Local inoculation-site side effects were reported by 1604 (48%) vaccine recipients and 539 (16%) placebo recipients in the substudy. A total of 977 (56.6%) of the vaccine recipients reporting local side effects were aged 60 to 69 years, and 627 (39.2%) were older than 70 years. After inoculation, herpes zoster occurred in 7 vaccine recipients versus 24 placebo recipients. Long-term follow-up (mean, 3.39 years) showed that rates of hospitalization or death did not differ between vaccine and placebo recipients.

Limitations

Participants in the substudy were not randomly selected. Confirmation of reported serious adverse events with medical record data was not always obtained.

Conclusion

Herpes zoster vaccine is well tolerated in older, immunocompetent adults.

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German dermatology society (DDG) [^1139dfea]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia and can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease of quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risks for severe complications, involving the eye, the peripheral and the central nervous system (prolonged pain, postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications occur with and without cutaneous symptoms. The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines in order to guarantee updated management to anyone affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients. Therapy has become very effective in the last years. Systemic antiviral therapy is able to shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, to prevent or to alleviate pain and other acute and chronic complications, particularly, when given within 48 h to a maximum of 72 h after onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients beyond the age of 50 years and in patients at any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications are severe herpes zoster on the trunk and on the extremities, herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and severe ekzema. Only relative indications for antiviral therapy exist in patients younger than 50 years with zoster on the trunk and on the extremities. In Germany acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and brivudin are approved for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster. These compounds are all well tolerated by the patients and do not differ with regard to efficacy and safety. Brivudin has a markedly higher anti-VZV potency than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir and thus offers a simpler dosing regimen. It must be given only once daily during 7 days in comparison to three and five times dosing per day of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, respectively. Brivudin is an antiviral agent with no nephrotoxic properties, which is an advantage when compared to acyclovir. The most important aim of therapy of herpes zoster is to achieve painlessness. Appropriately dosed analgesics in combination with a neuroactive agent (i.e. amitriptylin) are very helpful when given together with antiviral therapy. The additive therapy with corticosteroids may shorten the degree and duration of acute zoster pain, but has no essential effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a very difficult condition to treat. Thus early presentation to a pain therapist is recommended in specific cases.

### A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia [^0fec2ebb]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Third, to investigate whether antiviral treatment during a shingles episode was associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia relative to not receiving treatment during a shingles episode, we restricted our study population to those individuals who received a diagnosis of shingles at any time after 1 January 2000 and had not received a diagnosis of dementia before 1 January 2000. Our exposure of interest in this analysis was whether or not an individual received a prescription of antiviral medication (acyclovir, famcyclovir, valacyclovir or inosine pranobex) within three months of the first shingles diagnosis. Individuals were followed up from the date of first shingles diagnosis until either the date of death, moving out of Wales, GP deregistration or end of data availability (1 March 2022). We then used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to regress diagnoses of dementia made after the date of the first recorded shingles episode onto whether or not the patient received an antiviral medication prescription for the first shingles episode. In a robustness check, we required that a new diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after the date of the first shingles diagnosis. We adjusted our regressions for gender, restricted cubic splines (with three knots) of age at the first shingles infection, and the 12 variables in Supplementary Fig. 1 (excluding past breast and prostate cancer diagnoses).

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^663f6759]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus

Similar to HSV, CMV often causes an asymptomatic primary infection in immunocompetent individuals but can cause disease on primary infection or reactivation following drug or infection‐induced immunosuppression and in older patients with immunosenescence. Cytomegalovirus colitis, retinitis, hepatitis and pneumonitis are all reported and, while most common in immunocompromised patients, can occur in the apparently immunocompetent who are immunonaïve or immunosenescent. In mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, CMV reactivation in respiratory secretions is common. It is not clear, however, that the associations with prolonged length of ICU stay and mortality are causal and randomised trials of CMV treatment have not demonstrated benefit. As with HSV, this lack of benefit may reflect a failure to identify patients with genuine CMV pneumonitis rather than incidental reactivation. Where patients are at high risk of CMV reactivation, such as solid organ transplantation from a CMV‐positive donor to a CMV‐negative recipient, antiviral prophylaxis with ganciclovir is indicated. The presence of CMV viraemia or convincing evidence of CMV tissue pathology may require biopsy to distinguish from incidental reactivation and should prompt treatment. Ophthalmology review for CMV retinitis should be undertaken in patients with evidence of disseminated CMV infection, including CMV viraemia.

Varicella zoster virus

Varicella zoster virus causes chicken pox as primary infection, and reactivation leads to shingles in the immunosuppressed and immunosenescent. While neither of these are likely to result in ICU admission, shingles can develop as a painful and distressing consequence of critical illness and may benefit from early antiviral treatment. Shingles can transmit infection to the immunonaïve or immunocompromised and careful attention to infection control is required. In immunocompetent but varicella zoster virus‐naïve adults, varicella zoster virus can cause a severe pneumonitis with consequent respiratory failure. Acyclovir is used and prompt treatment may reduce severity of symptoms. The use of steroids remains uncertain and not backed by strong evidence. Varicella zoster virus can also cause encephalitis and should be looked for in patients without other identified pathogens.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^c7daf2f5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective, parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV‐100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients, ≥ 50 years of age, diagnosed with HZ within 72 h of lesion appearance who had HZ‐associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7‐day course of either FV‐100 200 mg QD (n = 117), FV‐100 400 mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID (n = 117). Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the burden of illness (BOI; Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores); incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP); pain scores; incidence and severity of post‐herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing. Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE)/SAE profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms. The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV‐100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar and no untoward signals or trends were evident. These results demonstrate a potential for FV‐100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

### Herpes zoster presentation, management, and prevention: a modern case-based review [^dd4fc1cc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

### Adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine decreases herpes zoster-associated pain and the use of pain medication across 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^cb5dea0f]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is caused by reactivation of the varicella–zoster virus (VZV) and is characterized by a painful dermatomal rash. The pain can be acute or can evolve into postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a neuropathic pain that usually persists for several months after the rash has resolved. Other serious complications of HZ include a disseminated rash, encephalitis, HZ ophthalmicus, secondary bacterial infection, and neurological, visceral, and vascular diseases.

Herpes zoster and HZ-associated pain can greatly diminish the patients' quality of life (QoL), interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs), and have a negative impact on the patients' social life and mental health status.

Older or immunocompromised (IC) adults are at increased risk for developing HZ and HZ-associated complications because of the decrease of VZV-specific T-cell immunity. Moreover, both in older adults and in IC individuals, HZ rash severity and duration of HZ episodes tend to be increased and disease recurrence is higher.

### Herpes zoster in pregnancy: clinical outcomes and treatment patterns from a multicenter retrospective cohort [^6f88ec2b]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster is a worldwide health concern, with an incidence rate of 3 to 5 cases per 1000 person-years in the United States. Over the past several decades, the incidence has been rising, although the underlying causes of this increase remain unidentified. The etiological agent responsible for herpes zoster is the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).VZV, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is classified under the Herpesviridae family and is formally designated as Human Herpesvirus Type 3 (HHV-3).VZV has only one serotype in nature, and humans are its sole reservoir. The virus can manifest as two distinct clinical conditions: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, after which the virus becomes latent in the cerebral and dorsal root ganglia. Upon a decline in cell-mediated immunity, VZV can reactivate within T lymphocytes residing in the ganglia, resulting in extensive viral replication and the manifestation of herpes zoster. Two to three days prior to the onset of the rash, patients typically exhibit prodromal symptoms, including fatigue, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations such as itching, burning, and prickling. During the active phase, herpes zoster manifests at the affected dermatome with the appearance of a rash accompanied by pain. This condition frequently results in a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Approximately 20% of patients continue to experience pain during the chronic phase after the rash has resolved, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. In contrast to primary infection, herpes zoster can cause prolonged discomfort and chronic pain.

### Papulovesicular lesions near the right breast [^421c3cac]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is most commonly associated with the development of these lesions?
A. Surgery and radiation therapy
B. Breast cancer
C. Infection
D. Older age
E. Immunocompromised state

Answers:
A. Surgery and radiation therapy – Correct. Surgery and radiation therapy for malignancy are the most common causes of ACL. Pathogenesis involves the destruction of previously normal lymphatics. The congestion and resulting superficial lymphatic dilation manifest as the lesions of ACL, which have been reported to develop as late as 25 years after the causative factor.
B. Breast cancer – Incorrect. Breast cancer is the most common cause of carcinoma telangiectodes and is the most common cause of cutaneous metastases in women.
C. Infection – Incorrect. Infection-related complications (eg, tuberculosis-associated scarring)have been associated with ACL, but they are not a common cause. However, rupture of ACL lesions can create a portal of entry for bacteria, and this can give rise to complications such as cellulitis.
D. Older age – Incorrect. Older age is a risk factor for developing shingles, which is most common in individuals over the age of 50.
E. Immunocompromised state – Incorrect. Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk for the development of shingles and viral warts, which are lesions that ACL may mimic.

Question 3: Which is an appropriate option for the management of this patient's lesions?
A. Wide local excision
B. Oral antivirals
C. Chemotherapy
D. Oral antibiotics
E. Observation

Answers:
A. Wide local excision – Incorrect. This is an option for Stewart-Treves syndrome, though the prognosis remains poor given the disease's aggressive course.
B. Oral antivirals – Incorrect. This is the treatment for uncomplicated herpes zoster.
C. Chemotherapy – Incorrect. This would be an option for treating an underlying primary malignancy such as breast cancer.
D. Oral antibiotics – Incorrect. This patient does not have an infection, though topical mupirocin may be used to prevent superinfection of any ruptured ACL lesions.
E. Observation – Correct. ACL lesions are generally stable, chronic, asymptomatic, and do not require treatment. Treatment options that have been reported with varying efficacies include cryotherapy, electrodessication, laser therapy, surgical excision, and sclerotherapy.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^fba5ed56]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

2 STUDY DESIGN

This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel‐group, comparative study of FV‐100 versus valacyclovir in patients with HZ conducted at 90 centers in the United States between May 2009 and December 2010. Patients who presented within 72 h of zoster rash and met all eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: 1) FV‐100 200 mg QD; 2) FV‐100 400 mg QD; or 3) valacyclovir 3000 mg (1000 mg TID). Patients were centrally randomized by an interactive web response system and stratified by 1) age category (< 65 vs. ≥ 65); and 2) Visit 1/Day 1 ZBPI worst pain in the last 24 h score (< 6 vs. > 6). Sites were blinded to all ZBPI subset pain scores throughout the study.

The primary endpoint was the reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC, a standardized score measuring the overall severity of pain experienced by study subjects during the 30 days after the first dose of study drug (see section 2.3). A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100 treated group compared to the valacyclovir‐treated group. Estimates of BOI‐30 AUC and SD (constant SD across treatment arms) were extrapolated from the Zostavax Shingles Prevention Study and the ZBPI validation study. 21, 24, 25

All eligible patients were treated for 7 days and followed through Day 30. Patients who continued to have HZ‐associated pain or whose rashes had not healed by Day 30 were followed through Day 90 or until their rash healed and they had two documented Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) worst pain scores of 0, whichever occurred first.

The study was approved by a central institutional review board (IRB) or local IRBs and conducted in accordance with the International Committee on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. 26, 27 This study was registered on(NCT00900783).

Herpes simplex

The mechanisms behind reactivation of Herpes simplex and Varicella zoster virus are similar, and JAK inhibition associates with an increased susceptibility to both primary and reactivated HSV infections. Herpes simplex events are reported less often than zoster in trial data and overall has received less attention. These infections are an important consideration as they may be recurrent events and sometimes misdiagnosed as shingles.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^5c9a41e6]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?
A. Reassurance and supportive garments
B. Surgical referral
C. Antiviral therapy
D. Oral corticosteroids
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

Answers:
A. Reassurance and supportive garments – Correct. The prognosis for postherpetic pseudohernia is good with a mean recovery time of 4.9 months with conservative management. Management should include supportive garments and analgesia if required.
B. Surgical referral – Incorrect. A pseudohernia lacks a fascial defect and results from muscle weakness due to nerve dysfunction. Therefore it does not require surgical intervention. Enhanced recognition of this rare complication amongst dermatologists can prevent unnecessary investigations and surgical referral.
C. Antiviral therapy – Incorrect. Antiviral therapy for herpes zoster is most effective if started within 72 hours after the onset of acute cutaneous eruption. In our case, the patient had already been promptly treated with famciclovir by his family physician at the onset of the shingles rash. If a patient were to present acutely with cutaneous herpes zoster accompanied by pseudohernia, then there would be a role for antiviral therapy.
D. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. There is no evidence that oral corticosteroids improve outcomes or reduce symptom duration in postherpetic pseudohernia.
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation – Incorrect. While there are case reports of electrical stimulation used in herpes zoster radiculopathy, it is most helpful in managing sensory disturbance, as seen in postherpetic neuralgia rather than the motor weakness itself.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^c3674385]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Vaccination may reduce the burden of HZ disease

Current treatment strategies for HZ and PHN are only partially effective, so reducing the burden of HZ disease remains an area of considerable need. A solution is for proactive strategies to focus on HZ prevention. At least one study has shown that, compared with people who have not experienced HZ, those who have had HZ or PHN place higher value on preventing this disease. In this study, both groups questioned (community members and patients with HZ or PHN) said that they would be willing to pay substantial amounts of money to prevent HZ.

The clinical rationale for the development of an HZ vaccine has centred on reducing the severity of HZ and PHN. Studies have shown that the live attenuated Oka/Merck VZV vaccine ('zoster vaccine') also reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN in addition to burden of illness (a severity-by-duration measure of the total pain and discomfort associated with a disease). Evidence that the zoster vaccine reduces HZ burden in an ageing population is derived from the Shingles Prevention Study. The Shingles Prevention Study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and assessed HZ burden of illness and PHN incidence (pain rated as ≥ 3 on a 0–10 scale ≥ 90 days after rash onset) in > 38,000 people aged ≥ 60 years who received zoster vaccine or placebo. Compared with placebo, vaccination significantly reduced HZ burden of illness by 61.1%. Vaccine recipients had a significantly reduced incidence of HZ (-51%) and PHN (-67%) compared with placebo. HZ symptoms in the vaccine group were, in general, milder and of shorter duration than those in the placebo group. Vaccination reduced PHN incidence defined using alternative cut-off times for the duration (persistence) of pain; the reduction in incidence was 72.9% at 180 days (Figure 5). Although the reduction in HZ incidence with vaccine compared with placebo was less apparent in patients who were aged ≥ 70 years versus those aged 60–69 years, the reductions in HZ burden of illness and PHN were preserved in the older population.

Research needs for zoster prevention and treatment — The report notes that the zoster vaccine "remains only partially efficacious and is not licensed for all populations and age groups at risk", and that "Improved prevention and treatment strategies, including better vaccines, are needed to reduce the disease burden of zoster". It further specifies that "ZOSTAVAX® or other active or inactive formulations of zoster vaccine should be evaluated in additional cohorts of persons (e.g., persons aged 50–59 years and immunosuppressed persons at the highest risk for zoster and its complications)", adds that "Persons infected with HIV, with or without AIDS, could benefit substantially from the prevention of zoster", and highlights that "A better understanding of immunologic correlates of protection against zoster would help facilitate the development and evaluation of such new zoster prevention strategies".

### Longitudinal effects of herpesviruses on multiple cognitive outcomes in healthy elderly adults [^6cfd225b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of anti-herpesvirus drug use was in line with a previous study of a Swedish cohort and slightly lower than in a French database. Among HSV-1 carriers in our sample, anti-herpesvirus drug use was not associated with very early cognitive changes, except in interaction with HSV IgM carriage, which was associated with worse performance on the clock drawing test. This finding may indicate that potential benefits of anti-herpesvirus treatment (previously observed for the AD risk) are mainly not captured by early changes in cognitive performance, or that more sensitive cognitive evaluations are needed. As information on treatment indications was unavailable for our sample, we do not know whether treatments were received for HSV-1 or other herpesvirus symptoms, such as shingles; this lack of knowledge compromises the validity of the treatment data. Anti-herpesvirus drug prescriptions were more common among HSV carriers than among non-carriers, suggesting that a portion of HSV carriers received treatment for HSV symptoms. The interpretation of suspected treatment indications based on the adherence of prescription dosages to the manufacturer's guidelines revealed that a portion of prescriptions likely were issued for HSV symptoms and not all treatment effects should be attributed to VZV. Future studies could examine anti-herpesvirus treatment in relation to verified HSV reactivation to better distinguish potential treatment effects.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^8cff8938]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease — primary varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster therapy indicates that for uncomplicated primary varicella, initiate as soon as possible after symptom onset and continue for 5–7 days with valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII); for severe or complicated cases, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days (AIII), with the option to switch to oral valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir after defervescence if no evidence of visceral involvement (BIII). Alternative therapy for uncomplicated chickenpox is acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII) for 5–7 days. For herpes zoster (shingles) acute localized dermatomal disease, treat for 7–10 days and consider longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve, with acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII). In managing ocular disease, consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in VZV retinitis is strongly recommended; duration of therapy for VZV retinitis is not well defined and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses and ophthalmologic responses; optimization of ART is recommended for severe and difficult-to-treat VZV infections (e.g., retinitis, encephalitis) (AIII).

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^1a72e2e4]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Common viral related neuropathic pain conditions

Neuropathic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system", and is recognized as being mechanistically distinct from nociceptive pain and nociplastic pain. Viral infections can lead to neuropathic pain by creating lesions in the peripheral or central nervous system, producing cytokines that sensitize nociceptors, or eliciting an immune response that attacks organ systems. Although viruses can also cause nociceptive pain (eg, arthritis), pathogenesis is varied and pathogen specific.

Varicella zoster virus

Varicella zoster virus is responsible for chickenpox and shingles. After a primary infection, it lies dormant in a dorsal root or cranial ganglion and reactivates upon a decline in immunity. Pain can be spontaneous, paroxysmal, or evoked (eg, allodynia), and acute reactivation typically causes nociceptive (vesicular rash) and neuropathic (acute radiculitis) pain.

Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common and one of the most serious complications of acute infection with varicella zoster virus, and is defined as pain persisting more than 90 days after the onset or healing of the vesicular rash. Mechanisms include nerve root inflammation and ectopic discharges, peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization (eg, loss of inhibitory neurons, glial cell activation), deafferentation in the affected dermatome, and central nervous system reorganization (eg, alterations in brain metabolism, decreased grey matter, and sympatho-afferent coupling).

Postherpetic neuralgia can eventually develop in approximately half of the individuals infected with varicella zoster virus. Risk factors include older age, prodromal pain, severe acute pain or rash, marked immunosuppression, and diabetes. Because greater acute pain and rash severity might indicate increased neural damage, treatment of varicella zoster virus and resultant acute pain could reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Strategies have included antiviral treatment, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, neuropathic analgesics, local anesthetics, epidural steroids, and neuromodulation. However, these treatments have yielded mixed results for the prevention and treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing postherpetic neuralgia, reducing risk by up to 67%, and vaccinated patients who do develop the disorder have less severe symptoms.

### Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome [^d2c06df8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

After compiling approved drug–disease treatment pairs, we remove treatments for which drugs rely on binding to non-human proteins (i.e. viral or bacterial proteins) to induce their effect. The multiscale interactome only models human proteins and biological functions. The multiscale interactome is thus not designed to model treatments which rely on binding to viral or bacterial proteins. To remove such treatments, we map all disease UMLS CUIDs to their corresponding Disease Ontology ID. We then remove diseases corresponding to the "disease by infectious agent category" of the Disease Ontology. The Disease Ontology does not map many UMLS CUIDs to corresponding Disease Ontology IDs. We thus manually curate the final list of diseases to remove additional infectious diseases: malaria, bacterial septicemia, fungal infection, coccidiosis, gonorrhea, gastrointestinal roundworms, shingles, lice, gastrointestinal parasites, tapeworm, syphilis, genital herpes, lungworms, fungicide, fungal keratosis, yeast infection, laryngitis, enterocolitis, protozoan infection, African trypanosomiasis, sepsis, Chagas disease, mites, bacterial vaginosis, scabies, pinworm, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), microsporidiosis, and ringworm.

Finally, we filter approved drug–disease treatment pairs to only include drugs with at least one known target in DrugBankor the Drug Repurposing Huband diseases with at least one associated gene in the curated version of DisGeNetas these are the only drugs and diseases that the multiscale interactome represents (see the "Methods" subsection Drug–protein interactions, Disease–protein interactions).

Ultimately, we achieve a dataset of 5,926 approved drug–disease pairs, exceeding the largest prior network-based study by 10X. All approved drug–disease pairs are provided in Supplementary Data 6.

### What's old is new: valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^dbefdc79]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Seasonal variations and clustering in close communities suggest an infectious agent as the inciting factor for PR. Although human herpesviruses (HHVs) (HHV-6 and HHV-7) have often been implicated in a causal relationship with PR, the exact cause remains unknown. Additionally, PR-like eruptions have been reported with COVID-19, vaccinations (ie, bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, influenza, diphtheria, smallpox, hepatitis B, and COVID-19), and medications (ie, gold, barbiturates, captopril, and clonidine).

There are case reports of successful treatment of PR with acyclovir based on the theory of the pathogenic involvement of HHV-6 and HHV-7, particularly when administered within the first week of symptom onset. There are additional but fewer reports of using valacyclovir (known pharmaceutically as Valacyclovir), which is the prodrug of acyclovir. The efficacy of valacyclovir as treatment for PR has so far been reported in 1 case series of 3 patients: while watchful waiting led to worsening symptoms, treatment with valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 1 week led to resolution of the condition within 2 to 3 weeks. The authors have proposed valacyclovir as an alternative therapeutic option due to its less frequent dosing and a more favorable safety profile when compared with those of acyclovir. The dosing schedule of valacyclovir used in this series was adapted from the established treatment regimen for herpes zoster infection (shingles), which consists of oral valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 7 days, which is the standard dose without renal adjustment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^abc9a0b8]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus prevention in adults with HIV — recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV): Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) is the only available vaccine for prevention of shingles in the United States, and attenuated zoster vaccine live (ZVL, Zostavax) is no longer available for use in the United States. RZV is recommended in adults with HIV aged ≥ 18 years, regardless of CD4 count, as RZV 0.5 mL IM injection — 2-dose series at 0 and then at 2 to 6 months (AIII). RZV should not be given during an acute episode of herpes zoster (AIII). Following initiation of ART, some experts would delay RZV vaccination until patients are suppressed virologically on ART (CIII) or until CD4 count recovery (CIII) to maximize immunologic response to the vaccine.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^b3ec2380]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of ageing is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older adults to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production avoiding viral reactivation. Two types of herpes zoster vaccines are currently available. One of them is the single-dose live attenuated zoster vaccine (LZV), which contains the same live attenuated virus used in the chickenpox vaccine, but it has over 14-fold more plaque-forming units of the attenuated virus per dose. The other is the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) which does not contain the live attenuated virus, but rather a small fraction of the virus that cannot replicate but can boost immunogenicity. The recommended schedule for the RZV is two doses two months apart. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010, and updated in 2012, 2016, and 2019.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

Search Methods

For this 2022 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1948 to October 2022), Embase (2010 to October 2022), CINAHL (1981 to October 2022), LILACS (1982 to October 2022), and three trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included studies involving healthy older adults (mean age 60 years or older). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine (any dose and potency) versus any other type of intervention (e.g. varicella vaccine, antiviral medication), placebo, or no intervention (no vaccine). Outcomes were cumulative incidence of herpes zoster, adverse events (death, serious adverse events, systemic reactions, or local reaction occurring at any time after vaccination), and dropouts.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included two new studies involving 1736 participants in this update. The review now includes a total of 26 studies involving 90,259 healthy older adults with a mean age of 63.7 years. Only three studies assessed the cumulative incidence of herpes zoster in groups that received vaccines versus placebo. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America and included healthy Caucasians (understood to be white participants) aged 60 years or over with no immunosuppressive comorbidities. Two studies were conducted in Japan and one study was conducted in the Republic of Korea. Sixteen studies used LZV. Ten studies tested an RZV. The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate, which indicates that the intervention probably works. Most data for the primary outcome (cumulative incidence of herpes zoster) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and dropouts) came from studies that had a low risk of bias and included a large number of participants. The cumulative incidence of herpes zoster at up to three years of follow-up was lower in participants who received the LZV (one dose subcutaneously) than in those who received placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.56; risk difference (RD) 2%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; moderate-certainty evidence) in the largest study, which included 38,546 participants. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups for serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21) or deaths (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; moderate-certainty evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher cumulative incidence of one or more adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.11; RD 23%; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.3) and injection site adverse events (RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.93 to 7.21; RD 28%; NNTH 3.6; moderate-certainty evidence) of mild to moderate intensity. These data came from four studies with 6980 participants aged 60 years or older. Two studies (29,311 participants for safety evaluation and 22,022 participants for efficacy evaluation) compared RZV (two doses intramuscularly, two months apart) versus placebo. Participants who received the new vaccine had a lower cumulative incidence of herpes zoster at 3.2 years follow-up (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.23; RD 3%; NNTB 33; moderate-certainty evidence), probably indicating a favourable profile of the intervention. There were no differences between the vaccinated and placebo groups in cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03) or deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; moderate-certainty evidence). The vaccinated group had a higher cumulative incidence of adverse events, any systemic symptom (RR 2.23, 95% CI 2.12 to 2.34; RD 33%; NNTH 3.0), and any local symptom (RR 6.89, 95% CI 6.37 to 7.45; RD 67%; NNTH 1.5). Although most participants reported that their symptoms were of mild to moderate intensity, the risk of dropouts (participants not returning for the second dose, two months after the first dose) was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39; RD 1%; NNTH 100, moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study reported funding from a non-commercial source (a university research foundation). All other included studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. We did not conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LZV (single dose) and RZV (two doses) are probably effective in preventing shingles disease for at least three years. To date, there are no data to recommend revaccination after receiving the basic schedule for each type of vaccine. Both vaccines produce systemic and injection site adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. The conclusions did not change in relation to the previous version of the systematic review.

### Herpes zoster and tofacitinib therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^66f61486]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), also known as herpes zoster (HZ) or shingles, is of substantial public health importance, as up to one-third of adults in the US will develop HZ within their lifetime. Nearly 100% of individuals in the US age 40 years or older have been exposed to this virus, and its reactivation is related to diminished VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity associated with increasing age and immunosuppressive conditions. Among patients who develop HZ, postherpetic neuralgia occurs in ∼15%, causing long-term disability. More rarely, disseminated forms of HZ occur, potentially leading to encephalitis and death. In the US, the annual incidence rates (IRs) of HZ vary between 0.4 and 1.1 per 100 patient-years in patients ages 50–80 years, with the highest rates seen in women. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the risk of HZ is elevated 2–3-fold.

Although certain disease-modifying therapies, such as anti–tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNFα) therapies, have been linked to further increases in risk, studies evaluating this have produced conflicting results. To date, only prednisone has been consistently shown to increase the risk of shingles by an additional 1.5–2-fold. Furthermore, although disseminated HZ is much more common in immunosuppressed populations, it is unclear whether RA and/or its disease-modifying therapies increase the risk.

Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. Tofacitinib preferentially inhibits JAK-3 and/or JAK-1, modulating the immune response via down-regulation of several cytokines (e.g. interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21) that are integral to lymphocyte development and function. Given its mechanism of action and the increased baseline risk of HZ among patients with RA, an increased risk of HZ is a theoretical concern. Accordingly, we undertook a retrospective evaluation of HZ cases as reported within the Tofacitinib RA Development Program, with the objectives of describing the outcomes of and identifying risk factors for HZ among tofacitinib-treated patients, as well as evaluating the relative incidence of HZ in tofacitinib-treated patients as compared with those receiving placebo.

### Understanding pain in herpes zoster: an essential for optimizing treatment [^b3c7596c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

After herpes zoster, immunocompetent persons frequently experience chronic pain and considerable suffering. Zoster-associated pain has a complex pathophysiology that begins with viral damage and increased sensitization of peripheral sensory neurons. The enhanced afferent barrage from these neurons sensitizes spinal neurons and leads to loss of synapses from descending inhibitory fibers, resulting in central neuropathic pain and allodynia. Antiviral therapy of acute zoster limits this sequence of pathophysiologic mechanisms. There is no clear consensus regarding the optimal means of determining the benefits of antiviral therapy in the management of pain of herpes zoster. A novel statistical approach utilizing rates of disappearance of pain of differing pathophysiologic mechanisms is proposed.

### Regarding "Enhancing predictive accuracy for acute herpetic neuralgia treatment: a fresh perspective on pulsed radiofrequency therapy research" [response to letter] [^ad594341]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

In response to a recently published article, I am representing all authors to address the constructive comments and suggestions provided by Hong et al.

Firstly, we acknowledge the variations in pain intensity and characteristics associated with shingles in different anatomical locations. Thus, it is more appropriate to categorize herpes zoster based on different sites. However, we have considered the significant differences in Current Perception Threshold (CPT) across sites, noting the prevalence of herpes zoster on the thoracic dorsal trunk. To mitigate heterogeneity, our initial exploration included only patients with thoracic dorsal herpes, as detailed in the methods section. Subsequently, we have factored in the site and nature of pain in our larger-scale studies, aligning with the recommendation by Hong et al.

Secondly, we recognize the validity of Hong et al's concerns regarding variable covariance. We also accounted for this when screening the variables. We applied stepwise regression to minimize the effect of multiple covariances between variables, as described in the Results section. Of course, the suggestion by Hong et al to employ the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for assessing covariance between variables significantly contributed to our results. Therefore, we supplemented the VIF of multivariate logistic regression variables and the results show that no covariance problems were found among them (VIF < 5). (Table 1)

Table 1
Variance Inflation Factor of Multivariate Logistic Regression Variables

Furthermore, we fully support Hong et al's perspective on the collaborative multidisciplinary approach to managing patients with herpes zoster. Managing herpetic neuralgia poses a complex challenge that has long perplexed healthcare professionals. Particularly, managing patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) presents unique difficulties. Therefore, the collaboration of pain physicians, dermatologists, neurologists, and psychologists is crucial to enhancing patient outcomes by leveraging their respective expertise. The proposal to establish a multidisciplinary management team is not only reasonable but also urgently required.

In conclusion, we express our gratitude to our readers for recognizing our research findings and offering valuable suggestions. We appreciate the opportunity to address and refine our study to ensure the accuracy of our results. By contributing to clinical decision-making for patients with herpes zoster neuralgia, we aim to facilitate more precise and personalized treatment approaches.

### Medical emergency: rash, headache and spinal cord injury [^c5de0b1b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 49-year-old consultant medical oncologist, with a medical history of complete T5 spinal cord injury (March 1992) and long-term paralysis from the chest down, presented with shingles affecting the T7 dermatome. He also had a dull frontal headache, a feeling of agitation and increased blood pressure of 135/90 on a home blood pressure machine (higher than his usual blood pressure of 90/70). Having been taught about autonomic dysreflexia at the time of his initial spinal cord injury, he self-diagnosed autonomic dysreflexia caused by the noxious stimulus of shingles below his level of spinal cord injury. He self-administered a nifedipine 5 mg sublingual capsule to decrease his blood pressure before urgently seeing his general practitioner. Treatment of the shingles with acyclovir and analgesia successfully managed the problem and avoided hospital admission. This case highlights key aspects in treating autonomic dysreflexia and the value of doctor-patient partnership in doing so.

### Herpes zoster and tofacitinib therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^282060a1]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for herpes zoster (HZ) (i.e. shingles). The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with tofacitinib increases the risk of HZ in patients with RA.

Methods

HZ cases were identified as those reported by trial investigators from the databases of the phase II, phase III, and long-term extension (LTE) clinical trials in the Tofacitinib RA Development Program. Crude incidence rates (IRs) of HZ per 100 patient-years (with 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]) were calculated by exposure group. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential risk factors for HZ (e.g. age, prednisone use).

Results

Among 4,789 participants, 239 were identified as having tofacitinib-associated HZ during the phase II, phase III, and LTE trials, of whom 208 (87%) were female and whose median age was 57 years (range 21–75 years). One HZ case (0.4%) was multidermatomal; none of the cases involved visceral dissemination or death. Twenty-four patients with HZ (10%) permanently discontinued treatment with tofacitinib, and 16 (7%) were either hospitalized or received intravenous antiviral drugs. The crude HZ IR across the development program was 4.4 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 3.8–4.9), but the IR was substantially higher within Asia (7.7 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 6.4–9.3). Older age was associated with HZ (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.5–2.6), and IRs for HZ were similar between patients receiving 5 mg tofacitinib twice daily (4.4 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3.2–6.0) and those receiving 10 mg twice daily (4.2 per 100 patient-years, 95% CI 3.1–5.8). In the phase III trials among placebo recipients, the incidence of HZ was 1.5 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0.5–4.6).

Conclusion

In the Tofacitinib RA Development Program, increased rates of HZ were observed in patients treated with tofacitinib compared with those receiving placebo, particularly among patients within Asia. Complicated HZ among tofacitinib-treated patients was rare.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^2c5ef659]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Addition of a second drug (usually azathioprine) allows reduction of the steroid dose and might further improve survival. Mycophenolate is a promising alternative to azathioprine but cannot be used in pregnancy. Patients taking AIH treatment need regular blood tests. They might also need interventions to maintain bone health.

Around the time of starting treatment patients need to be up to date with their vaccinations against infections such as influenza, pneumococcus and chickenpox/shingles.

Improvement in symptoms and in liver blood tests usually indicate a good response to treatment. A follow-up liver biopsy to confirm that AIH has gone into remission is no longer recommended routinely but might sometimes be helpful in guiding management.

Options for patients who do not improve on treatment include, reconsidering the diagnosis, and assessing adherence to treatment. This should be done in a respectful, non-confrontational and non-stigmatising manner. Other options include changing the steroid, checking that the azathioprine dose is adequate (by checking its blood levels) and changing to another drug, such as mycophenolate, tacrolimus or rituximab. Experience with these treatments is very limited, so expert advice is often helpful here.

When normal blood test — so called 'complete biochemical response' — has been achieved (and confirmed 2–4 weeks later), we recommend that steroid dose should be reduced gradually to zero.

If remission is maintained over 2–3 years, the second drug (usually azathioprine) can sometimes be stopped (under medical guidance and with regular continued monitoring). There is a risk of disease relapse but (if promptly treated and if the patient does not have cirrhosis) relapses are usually without symptoms and are rarely dangerous. Relapses can be retreated with steroids and then, a longer-term treatment to prevent further relapse (usually azathioprine) can be considered. However, patients with AIH have a slightly increased risk of cancer, which might be related to these drugs damping down the immune system. Thus, in all patients without cirrhosis, we recommend at least one attempt to stop medication.

### A protracted, postherpetic neuralgic ulcer treated with risperidone and intranasal butorphanol [^e7649e70]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) represents a type of peripheral neuropathic pruritus that occurs after an episode of shingles and is characterized by localized pain, paresthesia, and itch, termed postherpetic itch (PHI); all may simultaneously exist within the same dermatomal distribution. Although PHI has been reported to affect up to 58% of patients with shingles, its exact pathophysiologic mechanism is poorly understood, and there are no proven specific treatments. Herein, we describe the case of a patient who presented with a painful and severely pruritic ulcer located on the left side of the neck that developed in the setting of PHN refractory to conventional treatments. Although many standard treatments moderately reduced the associated pain, successful treatment of the pruritus and scratching frequency was achieved only with risperidone and intranasal butorphanol, which ultimately led to the resolution of the ulcer.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^6390688e]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Several drugs, including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, have demonstrated minimal efficacy in terms of pain control for patients with HZ. 17 Additionally, a significant proportion of these patients (∼20‐40% and sometimes more) go on to develop PHN. 3, 18 These drugs require multiple doses of medication each day. 19, 20, 21 Furthermore, doses of these antiviral agents must be modified for patients with renal impairment. It is evident that a drug with greater antiviral activity, better pain relief, and a more simplified dosing regimen represents a significant unmet medical need. Brivudine is also available in some countries for treating shingles. 22

FV‐100 is a prodrug for the bicyclic nucleoside analogue CF‐1743. 23 CF‐1743 demonstrates high potency against clinical VZV isolates (EC 50 ∼440 pM). The inhibitory activity of FV‐100 and CF‐1743 is highly specific for VZV. Renal clearance for FV‐100 and CF‐1743 was demonstrated to be low for all doses tested (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg QD), indicating that renal elimination is not likely to be an important pathway for either compound. In light of these results, a Phase 2 clinical trial was undertaken in patients with HZ in order to evaluate the efficacy of once‐daily (QD) FV‐100 at both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses, compared with valacyclovir 3000 mg administered three times daily (1000 mg TID) in reducing the acute herpes zoster burden of illness (BOI) and reducing the incidence of PHN.

This case describes an uncommon presentation of herpes zoster in an adolescent with viral meningitis and concomitant genital shingles. A 15-year-old immunocompetent girl with background of well-controlled Graves' disease presented with 3 days of fever, frontal headache, terminal neck stiffness and photophobia. This was preceded by 4 days of pain and itch over vaginal and anal region. She had one dose of varicella vaccination at 18 months old and developed mild primary varicella infection around 5 years of age. Varicella zoster virus DNA was detected both in cerebrospinal fluid and in vesicles over her right labial majora. While there is no international consensus on the recommended duration of treatment for zoster with neurological complications, she was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 10 days with good clinical response. Her fever, headache and neck stiffness resolved after 2 days and genital lesions resolved after 9 days of antiviral therapy.

5.2.1.3 Vaccination

Statement 82. We recommend that a vaccination history should be obtained and vaccinations updated for all patients with Crohn's disease, those with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis at diagnosis, and prior to commencing immunomodulator or biologics in all patients. Live vaccinations may be given at least 4 weeks before starting and at a minimum of 3 months after stopping, but not while receiving immunosuppressive therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93%).

Statement 83. We recommend that IBD patients receiving immunomodulators or biologics should receive influenza vaccination each autumn, and pneumococcal vaccination with a booster after 5 years (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.5%).

A vaccination history should be taken both at diagnosis and prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy (see box 4). General advice regarding vaccination is given in box 5.

Box 5
General considerations regarding vaccination

Live vaccines are contraindicated if your patient is on immunosuppression or with significant protein calorie malnutrition: live vaccines include BCG, attenuated (oral) influenza vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), polio, rotavirus, oral typhoid Ty21a, varicella zoster, yellow fever. Immunosuppressive therapies include: glucocorticoids (prednisolone ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent for 2 weeks or more), thiopurines, methotrexate, biological therapy and tofacitinib.
Shingles vaccination (current UK age recommendation is at age 70 years or up to the age of 79 years if not given at age 70 years) may be administered to those on low-level immunosuppression (defined as ≤ 20 mg prednisolone/day for > 14 days, either alone or in combination with low-dose non-biological oral immunomodulators (methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day).
Immunomodulators should be withheld for 4 weeks after live vaccine administration.
Live vaccines should be avoided for at least 3 months after discontinuing treatment with immunosuppressive therapies above.
Infants exposed to biologics in utero should not receive live vaccines for 6 months after birth.
IBD patients on immunosuppressant therapy should receive pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza vaccination (prior to starting treatment if possible) with a single pneumococcal booster at 5 years.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2018 [^9817ae09]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Changes in the 2018 Adult Immunization Schedule

Zoster Vaccination. On October 20, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of RZV (SHINGRIX, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) for adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its complications. On October 25, ACIP recommended the use of 1) RZV among immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications, 2) RZV among adults aged 50 years or older who previously received the zoster vaccine live (ZVL) (ZOSTAVAX, Merck and Co.), and 3) either RZV or ZVL for adults aged 60 years or older (RZV is preferred). On October 26, 2017, ACIP recommended the following in the 2018 adult immunization schedule:

Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults aged 50 years or older regardless of past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of ZVL.
Administer 2 doses of RZV 2–6 months apart to adults who previously received ZVL at least 2 months after ZVL.
For adults aged 60 years or older, administer either RZV or ZVL (RZV is preferred).

The clinical trials for RZV excluded pregnancy and confirmed or suspected immunocompromising conditions that can result from disease (e.g. malignancy, HIV infection) or therapy (e.g. cancer chemotherapy, treatment for autoimmune disorders). Therefore, no ACIP recommendation currently exists for use of RZV among pregnant women (health care providers should consider delaying administration of RZV for pregnant women) or adults with immunocompromising conditions, including HIV infection (additional discussions and recommendations by ACIP on the use of RZV in adults with immunocompromising conditions are pending).

Safety of dupilumab and primary malignancy progression

Dupilumab was well tolerated, and no patients reported an adverse event directly attributed to dupilumab treatment. However, infections during dupilumab treatment were recorded for two patients. One patient was hospitalized for pneumonia and the other received treatment with valacyclovir for shingles. Both patients were receiving concurrent systemic corticosteroids at the time their infections were diagnosed complicating attribution of these adverse events. Progression of primary malignancy on ICI was identified in five (29%) patients before dupilumab treatment for irBP. By the cutoff date, five additional patients (29%) exhibited progression of primary malignancy after starting dupilumab for irBP. The median time to first progression after start of dupilumab for irBP was 49 days (range = 20–295) for the cohort. Three patients (18%) died during the follow-up period with all deaths attributed to progression of primary malignancy.

Discussion

Sustainable and effective treatment for moderate-to-severe AD has historically been recognized as challenging due to the limited treatment options available. The treatment of AD is further complicated by patients' increased propensity for systemic comorbidities, including bacterial and viral skin infections. Since 2017, the Food and Drug Administration has approved promising new treatments, including biologic agents, such as dupilumab and tralokinumab, and targeted therapies, such as upadacitinib and abrocitinib. Biologics, which target the Th2 cytokine pathway in AD by blocking specific IL signaling, are recognized for particularly mild side effect profiles and improved effectiveness compared with classical systemic treatments. More recently, approved targeted JAK-1 selective inhibitors are powerful agents that inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway to decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the AD pathogenesis.JAK-1 inhibitors, when compared with biologics, have been shown to have greater effectiveness but a broader immunosuppressive profile. Literature has suggested that JAK-1 inhibitors contribute to impairments in interferon-mediated antiviral responses, which can increase susceptibility to viral infections. In phase III trials, upadacitinib was more commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections compared with dupilumab and a small percentage of patients developed eczema herpeticum or herpes zoster.

Our patient received shingles vaccines prior to starting upadacitinib, given his history of remote shingles infections, and, fortunately, has not developed shingles. However, he experienced an exacerbation of his HPV infection involving flat warts on his face. The clinical examination and patient's self report suggested that the distribution of warts was limited to his face and he endeavored to limit the spread by avoiding shaving. To our knowledge, HPV outbreaks have not been previously cited as a side effect associated with JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib, abrocitinib, or tofacitinib, nor have they been systematically studied. Although the warts were relatively resistant to several treatments, including sinecatechins 10% ointment, 0.025% tretinoin in an emollient cream base, and imiquimod 5% cream, they responded quickly and completely to tazarotene 0.045%. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the upadacitinib-induced HPV exacerbation may help inform more effective and prompt management of the resultant flat warts.

### Recent topics in the management of herpes zoster [^7e28ab65]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is a disease caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that has been latently infecting the body and is more common among the elderly. In Japan, the incidence of herpes zoster has been increasing steadily and is expected to increase further in the future. In 2016, the varicella vaccine was expanded to include prevention of herpes zoster, and a new subunit vaccine was also launched in 2020. In recent years, anti-herpesvirus drugs with novel pharmacological effects have also been introduced, and the environment surrounding the treatment of herpes zoster is entering a new era.

Research Hotspots and Fronts

Based on the analysis of co-cited references, high-frequency keywords, keyword clusters and keyword burst, we believe that the research hotspots in the HZ field are mainly focused on: (1) Drug Therapy; (2) Immunoprophylaxis; (3) Complications. In this study, the top four keywords were counted according to the frequency of research in each hotspot and displayed in Table 6. Acyclovir, vaccine, and PHN were the most important research items in each research hotspot.

The Top Four Keywords in Three Research Hotspots

Drug Therapy

Prompt administration of antiviral drugs within 72 hours of the onset of the rash can reduce viral replication, shorten the duration of symptoms, and prevent complications. Studies have shown that the main antiviral drugs currently used in clinical practice for HZ are valacyclovir and famciclovir, while the frequency of acyclovir use is gradually decreasing. Acyclovir was first mentioned in 1974 by Nick Oliverand then its antiviral properties were first discovered by Peter Collins and John Bauer of Wellcome Laboratories in Beckenham, the UK. The anti-herpetic activity of acyclovir is achieved by inhibition of herpes-specific replicative DNA polymorphases. Acyclovir has been shown to be significantly more effective against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 than against varicella virus. The duration of maximum drug concentration for intravenous acyclovir and initial oral doses is approximately one hour and two hours, respectively. Compared with placebo, oral administration of aciclovir within 47 hours after the onset of the disease reduced the average time to the last day of new lesion formation by 0.5 days, 1.8 days, and 2.2 days. In some studies, Famciclovir has been shown to be superior to aciclovir in reducing shingles-related pain. Timely initiation of treatment with high-dose acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir may limit the severity, duration, and complications of the disease outbreak.

### Herpes zoster infection after topical steroid use in the setting of tumid lupus erythematosus [^50bf80a5]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Topical corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of a wide range of skin manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE are also known to have an increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). Here we present a rare case of recurrent HZ induced by topical corticosteroid use for the treatment of tumid lupus in the background of systemic lupus. We also review the literature on topical corticosteroid use and varicella zoster infection. For the literature review, search terms both as keywords and subject headings, included topical corticosteroids, topical steroids, corticosteroids AND systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus, cutaneous lupus AND herpes zoster, herpes virus, varicella zoster, shingles. HZ is a rare complication of topical corticosteroid use. Providers should use caution in the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) with topical steroids, as these patients are at an increased risk for HZ infection.

### Corticosteroids for herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^925a2ac7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

For some patients, herpes zoster infections not only result in acute pain but serious consequences, including postherpetic neuralgia and damage to ocular tissues. Some authors have recommended corticosteroids for the treatment of these acute symptoms and complications. The literature concerning the use of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, however, either provides conflicting results or includes recommendations based on clinical experience rather than clinical trials. The author performed a search of the literature to address the question of whether corticosteroids are well tolerated and effective for the treatment/prevention of the acute pain of herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, and/or the ocular complications resulting from herpes zoster. While smaller trials found oral corticosteroids beneficial for preventing postherpetic neuralgia, larger, better designed trials have not found oral corticosteroids to be more efficacious than placebo in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Trials investigating the effect of oral corticosteroids for the acute pain of herpes zoster have found that corticosteroids provide a statistically significant improvement. Whether these improvements are clinically significant is uncertain. Thus, oral corticosteroids may confer a slight benefit for initial symptoms as long as the patient is not at risk for complications resulting from corticosteroid therapy. Most trials of topical and injectable corticosteroids are limited by several shortcomings. Therefore, topical and most forms of parenteral corticosteroids have yet to be proven effective for the treatment of acute pain or prevention of complications. Two controlled, blinded trials investigating the use of intrathecal corticosteroid administration for intractable postherpetic neuralgia suggest that corticosteroid administration results in a significant improvement in pain. Despite this, several authors have voiced concern over possible serious adverse events with the intrathecal administration of corticosteroids. Intrathecal corticosteroids may provide a benefit for intractable postherpetic neuralgia, but because of risks of serious complications, this is a last-line option and should only be administered by experienced personnel.

### Herpes zoster-induced urologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction with residual neurogenic detrusor underactivity [^6d26ba60]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

VZV is managed with antiviral agents such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. VZV-associated urinary retention can be managed with urethral catheterization in the acute setting and intermittent self-catheterization in the outpatient setting. An α-adrenergic blocker specific to α-1a in the smooth muscle of the genitourinary tract, bladder neck, and various regions of the pelvic floor may be trialed to shorten the duration. Urodynamic investigations are recommended, if symptoms fail to improve within 6–8 weeks from onset. Since antiviral therapy has no ability to prevent long-term sequelae, two doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine are recommended to prevent disease and related complications in adults' ≥ 50 years of age, whether or not a previous episode is reported. There is no formal recommendation on the wait period, though the consensus is to wait for the acute episode and symptoms to resolve. Fortunately, shingles vaccination among adults ≥ 60 years of age has increased from 6.7% in 2008 to 34.5% in 2018. Our elderly patient had not received the shingles vaccine due to lack of regular medical care prior to this presentation. Although dermatologists have not played a central role in the recommendation and administration of vaccines historically, a more active role has been encouraged to improve patient education and access to herpes zoster vaccination.

In conclusion, this case highlights rare and notable herpes zoster-related urologic and gastrointestinal complications. Sacral dermatome involvement should raise suspicion for these potential complications with a thorough assessment of gastrointestinal/genitourinary systems and prompt treatment to prevent long-term sequelae.

### Extensive longitudinal acute transverse myelitis complicated by pulseless ventricular tachycardia and recent shingles vaccination [^afd29814]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This case describes a 50-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of ascending bilateral lower extremity paresthesia one week following a shingles vaccine. MRI of the patient's spine was significant for longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintensity involving the lower cervical spine with extension into the upper thoracic spine suggestive of acute transverse myelitis (ATM). The patient's hospital course was complicated by a self-limiting episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness. Initial treatment included IV solumedrol, however due to lack of clinical improvement after a 5-day steroid treatment, plasmapheresis was initiated. The patient's condition improved with plasmapheresis and he was subsequently discharged to a rehab facility with a diagnosis of ATM of unclear etiology. Extensive serology, cardiac and CSF studies failed to determine the cause of this patient's myelitis or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The following case report explores the potential factors that may have contributed to this patient's symptoms.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^bb0af722]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^5aab3294]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster disease and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia, are associated with significant morbidity in the elderly. The zoster vaccine boosts cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes both varicella and herpes zoster. This vaccine has demonstrated the ability to reduce the zoster-related burden of illness and the incidence of both zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in a randomized, controlled trial conducted in individuals aged 60 years and older, an age group at increased risk of herpes zoster. Widespread use of this vaccine could prevent as many as a quarter of a million cases of zoster disease each year. The design and outcomes of the Shingles Prevention Study, which examined the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and the rationale for widespread immunization against varicella-zoster virus, are presented here.

### Risk of herpes zoster in patients prescribed inhaled corticosteroids: a cohort study [^108df066]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are being increasingly used in the treatment of patients with asthma and with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These medications are systemically absorbed and may have systemic adverse effects such as cataracts and fractures. The use of high doses of ICS has recently been found to increase the risk of severe pneumonia in patients with COPD. Information on other infectious complications of ICS therapy is scant but low doses of oral corticosteroids with similar systemic potency have been linked to an excess of serious infections. Moreover, ICS are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system which is involved in biotransformation of the vast majority of all drugs currently available. Therefore patients often find themselves taking several medications competing for the same enzymes required for their biotransformation into inactive compounds which can then be excreted.

Herpes zoster (shingles) results from reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. The lifetime risk of zoster is estimated to be 10–30% and incidence increases markedly with age, affecting up to 50% of people who live up to 85 years. The most common complication of zoster is chronic pain due to post herpetic neuralgia. The risk of this complication can be reduced by the prompt administration of anti-viral agents; however, 20% of people older than 50 years who receive treatment still experience pain six months after rash onset. Factors responsible for the majority of cases occurring in apparently well individuals have not been identified.

Given the impairment in cell mediated immunity associated with the use of corticosteroids and the systemic activity of ICS, especially at higher doses, a study of the link between use of ICS and herpes zoster appears warranted. We therefore undertook a study in a large primary care clinical database in order to assess the risk of herpes zoster in relation to use of ICS in a general population of adults and to evaluate whether this risk is increased by the concomitant use of ICS and drugs which inhibit CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for the hepatic inactivation of corticosteroids.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1ec410f1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — antivirals and corticosteroids: Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are approved by the FDA for zoster in immunocompetent patients, and trials indicate that when taken orally they reduce viral shedding and lesion formation, shorten time to rash healing, and decrease acute zoster pain and the risk for progression to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Many experts recommend that treatment should be considered for all eligible patients with zoster and specifically recommend treatment for persons aged ≥ 50 years who have moderate or severe pain, moderate or severe rash, or involvement of noncranial dermatomes. In clinical trials, treatment has been initiated within 72 hours of rash onset and the benefits of later treatment have not been studied; if treatment cannot be initiated within 72 hours, experts recommend that it should be initiated as soon as possible, particularly in the presence of new vesicle formation or of complications. Two clinical trials assessed corticosteroids with acyclovir; a 3-week tapering course diminished acute zoster pain and decreased time to cutaneous healing, cessation of analgesic therapy, and return of uninterrupted sleep and normal daily activities, but no evidence indicated that use of corticosteroids prevented development of PHN; combinations with valacyclovir or famciclovir have not been studied in clinical trials. No evidence indicates that topical antiviral therapy or corticosteroids without systemic antiviral therapy have a role in treatment of zoster.
