## Question

Is CT or MRI the best imaging for thoracic and cervical spine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CT or MRI is the "best" imaging for the thoracic and cervical spine across clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about trauma versus non-trauma scenarios. Then, I should verify adult versus pediatric pathways. Next, I will consider which tissues we need to evaluate — bone versus ligaments, disc, cord, and epidural space. After that, I need to check practical factors like speed, availability, and radiation. Finally, I should align the answer with guideline-backed algorithms and summarize a scenario-based recommendation rather than a single "best" test.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there is no single best modality across all situations, and I need to ensure I frame this by indication and patient characteristics because what is optimal in adult trauma may not be optimal in pediatric neck pain or infection suspicion, and the choice often hinges on whether bone injury or soft-tissue/neural elements are the priority, as well as logistics such as speed and radiation exposure.

> Let me first confirm the adult cervical blunt trauma algorithm in awake patients: if low-risk decision rules like NEXUS or Canadian C-Spine Rule are fully met, no imaging is recommended, and I should double-check that this applies to patients aged 16 to under 65 per ACR guidance, which it does [^112PTPBX] [^113A66DS]; but if imaging is indicated, I should verify that high-quality cervical CT is first-line rather than radiographs, which both ACR 2019 and AANS/CNS 2013 explicitly endorse, and CT outperforms plain films for osseous injury detection [^113Hdkag] [^115wqsxB] [^114YfCwq] [^111CiyWx].

> Next, I should review when MRI enters the adult cervical trauma pathway, and I need to ensure I capture the key triggers: suspected ligamentous injury after CT, neurologic deficits or suspected cord injury, and obtunded patients with negative CT where MRI rarely changes management yet may reveal soft-tissue findings, which is consistent with ACR 2019 and multiple trauma series and meta-analyses [^112JMR3N] [^1169YARk] [^116sad7t] [^111PAoz5]; Wait, I initially thought MRI was routinely required to clear the cervical spine after a negative CT in obtunded patients, but the data show MRI detects additional findings in a minority and changes treatment in about 4%, with no unstable injuries missed by high-quality CT in large series, so MRI is selective rather than routine in this scenario [^116sad7t] [^111PAoz5].

> I will now examine thoracic spine trauma in adults, and I need to verify that CT is again the primary initial study, which ACR 2019 explicitly recommends, including leveraging reconstructions from chest or abdomen-pelvis CT to avoid extra radiation, and to consider whole-spine evaluation when one region is injured due to multi-level injury risk per EAST [^111tcxtj] [^113xW7Md] [^111RnWzy]; MRI becomes the next step when neurologic deficits or spinal cord injury are suspected, or when fracture characterization for surgical planning is needed, which aligns with ACR recommendations for thoracic and lumbar trauma [^114GiguK].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child, and I need to ensure radiation minimization guides the choice; for pediatric blunt trauma, clinical clearance when possible is prioritized, with AANS/CNS recommending no imaging for alert children without red flags, and when imaging is needed, X-ray or MRI are preferred with judicious CT use due to markedly higher thyroid dose and associated excess relative risk in younger children [^116ygM2x] [^115ZLJRA] [^112kQxzv]; Hold on, I should verify real-world practice variability, which indeed shows higher CT use in non-pediatric centers and greater X-ray or MRI use in pediatric trauma centers, underscoring the importance of context and expertise [^1168n29t] [^1146CgVo].

> Let me consider non-traumatic cervical and thoracic scenarios next, and I should confirm that MRI is the modality of choice when the primary question involves soft tissues such as cord, discs, marrow, infection, or tumor, including infection with contrast and malignancy-associated neck pain or radiculopathy, while for postsurgical assessment of hardware, CT or radiographs are often first-line to evaluate bony fusion and implants [^114TU3YD] [^117MvHAM] [^114rZrBw] [^112uz4a7]; I need to note that while anatomic imaging is excellent, it may not map perfectly to pain generators in degenerative disease, a nuance that tempers overreliance on imaging alone [^112wNit7].

> I should confirm vascular considerations, because if there is concern for blunt cerebrovascular injury such as vertebral artery injury suggested by fracture pattern or neurologic signs, the next step is CTA or MRA of the head and neck rather than standard spine MRI, per ACR trauma guidance, and I need to ensure this is not overlooked in high-risk mechanisms [^1153PRLG].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to persistent neck pain after a negative high-quality CT in awake adults without new neurologic deficits; ACR allows selective follow-up imaging, and options include MRI when ligamentous injury is suspected, whereas routine flexion-extension radiographs contribute little and may be safely omitted in modern CT-era clearance pathways, which aligns with contemporary practice analyses [^111CAH1g] [^1165jnMD] [^116GdWzH].

> Let me think about practical factors that often drive modality choice in the ED: CT is fast, widely available, and superb for fractures and alignment, which is why it dominates initial trauma imaging, while MRI avoids ionizing radiation and is superior for cord, ligament, epidural, and marrow pathology but may require sedation and is less available emergently, particularly relevant in pediatrics where radiation risks from CT, especially to the thyroid, are nontrivial [^1134exY7] [^112kQxzv].

> In summary, I should emphasize that in adult blunt trauma of the cervical or thoracic spine, CT is generally the initial imaging of choice due to speed and bony sensitivity, with MRI reserved for ligamentous, cord, or epidural concerns or for selected clearance questions, whereas in non-traumatic scenarios or when infection, tumor, or radiculopathy are suspected, MRI is typically preferred, and in pediatric trauma, clinical clearance or MRI/X-ray strategies are favored to minimize radiation, so the "best" modality is scenario-dependent rather than universal [^113Hdkag] [^111tcxtj] [^114TU3YD].

---

CT is best for **acute trauma** [^113Hdkag] because it rapidly detects fractures and instability with high sensitivity and specificity, and is the first-line test in most trauma protocols [^111tcxtj] [^116zKsEK]. MRI is best for **soft tissue** — spinal cord, ligaments, discs, and infection [^112JMR3N] — and is the preferred modality for neurologic deficits, suspected cord injury, or infection [^114TU3YD] [^117MvHAM]. Use CT first for acute trauma or when MRI is contraindicated [^114YfCwq]; use MRI for neurologic symptoms, suspected cord/ligament injury, or infection. The two modalities are **complementary** [^113vNxmF] and should be selected based on clinical context.

## Clinical indications and guidelines

### Cervical spine imaging

In cervical spine imaging, **CT is recommended as the initial imaging modality** [^113Hdkag] for acute blunt cervical spine trauma, particularly when clinical decision rules such as NEXUS or the Canadian C-Spine Rule indicate imaging [^113A66DS]. It is also recommended for mechanically unstable spines and for treatment planning [^112nJRE5]. MRI is recommended as the **next imaging step** [^112JMR3N] in acute blunt trauma when cervical spinal cord or nerve root injury is confirmed or suspected — regardless of CT findings [^111PAoz5] — and is indicated for suspected ligamentous, spinal cord, or nerve root injury [^112JMR3N].

---

### Thoracic spine imaging

In thoracic spine imaging, **CT is recommended as the initial modality** [^111tcxtj] for acute thoracic spine trauma, particularly to detect fractures and assess spinal stability [^111RnWzy]. MRI is recommended to evaluate **soft tissue, spinal cord, and ligamentous injuries** [^1134exY7], particularly when neurologic deficits are present or suspected [^114GiguK].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility

| **Clinical scenario** | **CT** | **MRI** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute trauma (fractures, instability) | High sensitivity and specificity for bony injuries [^113Hdkag] [^116zKsEK] | Limited sensitivity for acute fractures |
| Soft tissue injuries (ligaments, discs, spinal cord) | Limited sensitivity [^112JMR3N] | High sensitivity and specificity [^112JMR3N] [^113vNxmF] |
| Neurologic deficits, spinal cord injury | Limited utility [^112JMR3N] | Preferred modality [^112JMR3N] |
| Infection, malignancy | Limited utility [^114TU3YD] | Preferred modality [^114TU3YD] [^117MvHAM] |
| Rapid assessment, unstable patients | Preferred modality [^113Hdkag] [^114YfCwq] | Limited utility due to longer acquisition time |
| Radiation exposure | Significant [^112kQxzv] | None |
| Contraindications | None significant | Pacemakers, certain implants, severe claustrophobia [^114TU3YD] |

---

## Practical considerations

CT offers **rapid acquisition**, wide availability, and high effectiveness for acute trauma evaluation [^1134exY7]; however, it involves significant radiation exposure [^112kQxzv], which is particularly concerning in pediatric and young adult populations. MRI provides **no radiation exposure** [^114TU3YD] and superior soft tissue contrast but has longer acquisition times and contraindications, such as pacemakers, certain implants, and severe claustrophobia [^111HBUxT].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

- **Acute trauma (fractures, instability)**: CT is the preferred initial imaging modality [^113Hdkag] due to its rapid acquisition and high sensitivity for bony injuries [^116zKsEK].

- **Soft tissue injuries, neurologic deficits, spinal cord injury**: MRI is the preferred modality due to its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to detect ligamentous and spinal cord injuries [^113vNxmF] [^112JMR3N].

- **Infection, malignancy**: MRI is the preferred modality for evaluating suspected infection or malignancy due to its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to detect subtle lesions [^117MvHAM] [^114TU3YD].

- **Pediatric patients**: MRI is preferred due to the absence of radiation exposure, although CT may be used cautiously when rapid assessment is required [^112kQxzv].

---

## Conclusion

CT and MRI are **complementary imaging modalities** for evaluating the cervical and thoracic spine. CT is preferred for acute trauma and bony injuries; MRI is superior for soft tissue injuries, neurologic deficits, and suspected infection or malignancy. The choice should be guided by the clinical scenario, patient condition, and specific diagnostic needs [^113YXUND].

### How has imaging of the head, neck and spine changed over 5 years in a district general hospital [^116UnSe5]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Over recent years, MRI has become the imaging modality of choice for examination of the head, neck, and spine.

- **Objective**: The primary objective was to compare the clinical benefit of CT with MRI for children being investigated at a district general hospital. Secondary outcome measures were the change in the amount of and indications for imaging.

- **Materials and methods**: This was a retrospective case note review of two 1-year periods. Clinical benefit was determined according to the diagnostic ability of the investigation. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test.

- **Results**: In 1992–1993 (Period I), there were 74 CT scans (40 boys, median age 3.4 years, range 0–18.0 years). In 1996–1997 (Period II), there were 104 scans (50 CT, 54 MRI; 49 boys, median age 6.2 years, range 0.2–16.7 years). Imaging increased by 40% between the two periods. MRI provided enhanced clinical benefit over CT (P).

- **Conclusions**: MRI improves clinical benefit over CT. Imaging increased over 5 years with different indications for CT and MRI.

- **Limitations of fluoroscopy, CT, and US**: The use of fluoroscopy is limited by radiation exposure and an inability to directly visualize the nerve and its trajectory. Additionally, the upfront costs, including the C-arm and monitor, radiology technician, and fluoroscopic table, represent a barrier. For medial branch block (MBB), CT precludes the use of real-time contrast injection or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to detect intravascular uptake. Regarding cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA), the imaging constraints imposed by trajectory recommendations are present but less substantial than in the lumbar spine, enabling parallel or near-parallel placement of electrodes. Yet, the widespread use of CT remains limited due to substantial equipment costs, radiation exposure, lack of real-time vascular imaging, and the need for different patient positions during procedures performed at the upper and lower facet joints.

Use of ultrasound (US) may provide an alternative imaging modality for performance of MBB but is not ideal for cervical intra-articular (IA) injections or medial branch RFA that require a set trajectory. Although US is portable, can be used in pregnancy, and does not require protective garments, there are significant disadvantages of using US guidance for cervical spine interventions. US cannot visualize the entire field, including adjacent levels, thereby increasing the risk of incorrect level identification. Widespread adoption may also be limited by anatomical difficulties associated with specific anatomic levels in the neck, especially involving C7. Of note, the US-guided approach to the cervical medial branch is less commonly taught.

### Pitfalls in multidetector computed tomography imaging of traumatic spinal injuries [^116ARTw9]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has largely supplanted plain radiography as the recommended primary imaging modality for the evaluation of acute spinal injuries. Although MDCT is highly sensitive and specific for bony injuries, errors in diagnosis can still occur. Knowledge of the possible imaging pitfalls on MDCT, leading to either misdiagnosis of fractures or missed fractures, is vital in ensuring an accurate diagnosis. This paper highlights conditions that can mimic or reduce the sensitivity for the detection of acute spinal injuries and demonstrates imaging findings that aid in the detection and diagnosis of subtle spinal injuries. Review areas for clinically relevant extra-spinal findings in the context of trauma are also discussed.

### The Canadian C-spine rule for radiography in alert and stable trauma patients [^113A66DS]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR)", for cervical spine injury is a clinical decision-making tool designed for use in the emergency department to determine which patients with trauma need cervical spine imaging. This calculator is specifically applicable to alert and stable patients who have experienced trauma, with the goal of reducing unnecessary imaging procedures. The CCR is not intended for use in patients under the age of 16, those with penetrating trauma, acute paralysis, known vertebral disease, or those with a previous cervical spine surgery. The clinical utility of the CCR lies in its ability to accurately identify patients at high risk of cervical spine injury, thereby improving patient management and reducing healthcare costs.

To evaluate neck injuries using the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR), the calculator examines specific risk factors and assigns scores to assess whether imaging is required. The assessment focuses on three areas: high-risk factors, low-risk factors, and neck rotation ability. Each is given a numerical score corresponding to the presence of certain conditions.

- **High-risk factors**: include age 65 years or older, paresthesias in extremities, and dangerous mechanisms of injury such as falls from a height of 1 meter or more, axial load to the head, high-speed motor vehicle collisions, rollovers, ejections, motorized recreational vehicle accidents, or bicycle collisions. Each high-risk factor, if present, contributes to the decision-making process.

### Pediatric cervical spine injury evaluation after blunt trauma: A clinical decision analysis [^114C6MVH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although many adult algorithms for evaluating cervical spine injury use computed tomography (CT) as the initial screening modality, this may not be appropriate in low-risk children, considering radiation risks. We determine the optimal initial evaluation strategy for cervical spine injury in pediatric blunt trauma.

- **Methods**: We constructed a decision analysis tree for a hypothetical population of patients younger than 19 years with blunt trauma, using three strategies: clinical stratification, screening radiographs followed by focused CT if the radiograph result was positive, and CT. For the model inputs, we used the literature to determine the probabilities of cervical spine injury and estimate the long-term risks of malignancy after CT, as well as test characteristics of radiographic imaging. We used published utilities and conducted one- and two-way sensitivity analyses to determine the optimal strategy for evaluation of pediatric cervical spine injury.

- **Results**: In our model of a population with blunt trauma, the expected value of a clinical stratification strategy was the highest of the three strategies, making it the overall preferred management. One-way sensitivity analysis of several contributing factors revealed that the only independent factor that altered the dominant strategy was the sensitivity of clinical clearance criteria, lowering the threshold at which the screening-radiograph strategy is optimal. Within the patient population considered as having non-negligible risk by clinical stratification and thus requiring imaging, the preferred imaging mode was not included in the incomplete section provided.

### Helical computed tomography alone compared with plain radiographs with adjunct computed tomography to evaluate the cervical spine after high-energy trauma [^111CiyWx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Literature supports the use of the three-view plain-radiograph series supplemented, when necessary, with helical computed tomography to evaluate the cervical spine in patients who have sustained trauma injury. The purpose of this study was to determine if helical computed tomography alone can be used to evaluate the cervical spine for acute osseous injury following high-energy trauma, thus eliminating the need to make radiographs.

- **Methods**: Patients were prospectively evaluated with helical computed tomography scanning of the cervical spine and standard three-view plain radiography. At a later date, the plain radiographs and computed tomography scans were independently reviewed by two radiologists who were blinded to both the initial interpretation and the interpretation of the corresponding study. The radiologists documented whether the plain radiographs were adequate and whether they showed an acute process. The findings in the study were compared with the initial findings and, when necessary, with the discharge summaries to determine if an injury had been identified. The accuracy of the plain radiographs, of the plain radiographs that had been deemed adequate, and of helical computed tomography used alone was ascertained.

- **Results**: Plain radiographs and helical computed tomography scans were made for 407 patients, and traumatic injuries were identified in fifty-eight of them. Plain radiographs alone were adequate for 194 (48%) of the 407 patients. Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 45%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 74%.

### Cervical spinal clearance: A prospective Western Trauma Association multi-institutional trial [^116zKsEK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

For blunt trauma patients who have failed the NEXUS (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) low-risk criteria, the adequacy of computed tomography (CT) as the definitive imaging modality for clearance remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of CT for the detection of clinically significant cervical spine (C-spine) injury.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective multicenter observational study conducted from September 2013 to March 2015 at 18 North American trauma centers. All adult (≥ 18 years old) blunt trauma patients underwent a structured clinical examination. Patients who failed the NEXUS criteria underwent a CT of the C-spine with clinical follow-up until discharge. The primary outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of CT for identifying clinically significant injuries that required surgical stabilization, halo, or cervical-thoracic orthotic placement. This was assessed using the criterion standard of final diagnosis at the time of discharge, incorporating all imaging and operative findings.

- **Results**: A total of 10,765 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 489 patients (4.5%) were excluded due to previous spinal instrumentation or transfer from outside hospitals. A total of 10,276 patients were prospectively enrolled, consisting of 4,660 (45.3%) with unevaluable/distracting injuries, 5,040 (49.0%) with midline C-spine tenderness, and 576 (5.6%) with neurologic symptoms. The mean age of the patients was 48.1 years (range, 18–110 years). The mean systolic blood pressure was 138 mm Hg (SD, 26 mm Hg), the median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15 (IQR, 14–15), and the Injury Severity Score was 9 (IQR, 4–16). Overall, 198 patients (1.9%) had a clinically significant C-spine injury requiring intervention.

### Imaging appropriateness for neck pain [^116nfNz4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Imaging of neck pain contributes significantly to healthcare costs and is expected to increase with practices that heavily rely on radiologic studies as a diagnostic tool. Though consensus guidelines are available to assist physicians in the selection of appropriate imaging examinations for neck pain, it is unclear if ordering practices reflect their use and understanding. To investigate this, we analyzed the number and types of imaging examinations performed for neck pain at a university medical center over the past year. Trends at our institution suggest that clinicians use consensus imaging guidelines, but there is still controversy regarding when not to image the cervical spine.

To promote appropriate imaging utilization, we developed an algorithm to guide the imaging of neck pain, based on clinical presentation, referral patterns for neck pain, and a review of the literature.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: Recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC Spine Imaging Working Group [^112DVn27]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Based on the MRI data acquired, we propose qualitative/semi-quantitative image evaluation (e.g. using ordinal rating scales) using structured reporting with a predefined scoring system. This system incorporates different structures and related grading of pathology as captured by the FOV of the T1- and T2-weighted sequences, such as Modic-type endplate changes, endplate defects, intervertebral disc changes, FJ and SIJ changes, and stenosis.

- **Modic changes**: Modic-type endplate changes summarize three categories based on specific signal characteristics of vertebral BM adjacent to the endplates in MRI. Most commonly, type 1 changes are considered an inflammatory, fibrovascular stage and may indicate an ongoing active degenerative process (e.g. disruption and fissuring of endplates and formation of granulation tissue). Type 2 changes are related to fatty degenerative remodeling processes, with replacement of red by yellow BM within the vertebrae. Furthermore, type 3 changes reflect the sclerotic stage. Related to their suggested pathophysiological entity, the three different types of Modic-type endplate changes differ in their appearances using the combination of sagittal T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Modic changes type 1 typically show hypointense signal on T1- and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. Modic changes type 2 show hyperintense signal on T1- and hyper- or iso-intense signal on T2-weighted images without FS (typically relatively hypointense on T2-weighted images with FS), and Modic changes type 3 show hypointense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images.

### Spinal imaging update: An introduction to techniques for advanced MRI [^116HGs96]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The widespread use of MRI has revolutionized the diagnostic process for spinal disorders. A typical protocol for spinal MRI includes T1 and T2 weighted sequences in both axial and sagittal planes. While such an imaging protocol is appropriate to detect pathological processes in the vast majority of patients, a number of additional sequences and advanced techniques are emerging. The purpose of the article is to discuss both established techniques that are gaining popularity in the field of spinal imaging and to introduce some of the more novel 'advanced' MRI sequences with examples to highlight their potential uses.

### Age-related changes of thoracic and cervical intervertebral discs in asymptomatic subjects [^111j9uab]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

This study presents a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis focused on the degeneration of the thoracic spine in asymptomatic subjects. The objective was to investigate the incidence of degenerative MRI findings in these individuals and identify factors related to the degeneration of thoracic discs. Studies addressing age-related degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are scarce.

Ninety-four asymptomatic Japanese volunteers, comprising 48 men and 46 women with a mean age of 48.0 ± 13.4 years, participated in this study. They underwent MRI of both thoracic and cervical spine and completed a questionnaire regarding their lifestyles. The MRI evaluated the following using a numerical grading system:

- **Decrease in the signal intensity (DSI)**: A measure of the intervertebral discs' degeneration.
- **Posterior disc protrusion (PDP)**: The extent of bulging discs.
- **Anterior compression of the dural sac (ACD)**: Assessing any anterior pressure on the dural sac.
- **Disc space narrowing**: Evaluation of the reduction in space between discs.

The study examined the association between each degenerative MRI finding and various factors like age, sex, smoking, sports, body mass index, and degeneration of the cervical spine.

Findings revealed that 44 patients (46.8%) exhibited positive degenerative MRI findings at one or more thoracic intervertebral levels. Specifically, 37.2% had DSI, 30.9% had PDP, 29.8% had ACD, and 4.3% demonstrated disc space narrowing. All MRI findings showed increased prevalence with aging. Additionally, 85 patients (90.4%) had positive degenerative MRI findings in the cervical spine. DSI showed a significant association with age, evidenced by an odds ratio of 11.21 (95% confidence interval, 2.70–46.5). PDP was also associated with age, with an odds ratio of 3.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–16.6).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thoracolumbar spinal injuries, and more specifically with respect to indications for imaging, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend considering diagnostic imaging of the entire spine in patients with blunt trauma who have a known or suspected injury to the cervical spine, or any other region of the spine, given the high incidence of spinal injury at multiple levels in this patient population.

### Diagnostic imaging of cervical spine injuries following blunt trauma: A review of the literature and practical guideline [^113QAubL]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with a potential cervical spine injury can be subdivided into low-risk and high-risk categories. With a detailed history and physical examination, the cervical spine of patients in the low-risk group can be "cleared" without further radiographic examinations. X-ray imaging (3-view series) is currently the primary choice of imaging for patients in the low-risk group with a suspected cervical spine injury after blunt trauma.

For patients in the high-risk group, a computed tomography scan is primarily advised due to its higher sensitivity; alternatively, the cervical spine should be immobilized until the patient can be reliably questioned and examined again. For the imaging of traumatic soft tissue injuries of the cervical spine, magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers — a cause for concern [^1168n29t]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, despite validated clinical decision algorithms promoting cervical spine X-ray as the preferred cervical spine imaging modality for pediatric trauma patients with suspected CSI, our study found that cervical spine CT remains the most common cervical spine imaging modality in the care of pediatric trauma patients. Level I trauma centers were significantly less likely to use CT and more likely to use X-ray for the initial evaluation of younger, but not older, pediatric trauma patients. Pediatric specialty trauma centers were significantly less likely to use cervical spine CT and more likely to use cervical spine X-ray for pediatric patients of any age. They were also significantly more likely to use MRI for younger patients.

Compared with non-pediatric Level I centers, pediatric Level I centers were significantly less likely to use CT and more likely to use X-ray for the initial evaluation of both pediatric age groups; however, no significant differences were found for cervical spine MRI use. Better dissemination of and education on appropriateness criteria for evaluation of pediatric CSI may lead to improved outcomes of pediatric spinal injury with decreased cost and radiation exposure at a population level.

### Imaging of cervical spine traumas [^113vbD9N]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Spinal traumas represent a significant proportion of musculoskeletal injuries worldwide. Spinal injuries involve a complex structure with components having different traumatic susceptibility and variable healing capabilities. The interaction of numerous variables at the time of trauma creates a great variety of lesions, making it challenging to create and compare homogeneous groups. This results in difficulties in classifying spinal lesions, assessing their instability, and defining the indication and outcome of different treatment strategies.

The evolution of concepts on instability has accompanied that of trauma classification schemes and treatment strategies. Assessing instability in a spinal injury is crucial in light of newer surgical techniques and hardware. Despite a long history of attempts to classify spinal traumas, there remains some degree of controversy in describing imaging data and a wide variety of treatment strategies. Acute cervical spine injuries affect 1.9% to 4.6% of subjects reporting blunt trauma and up to 5.9% of multiple-injured patients. Most spinal cord injuries are a consequence of unstable fractures of the cervical spine. An accurate and early diagnosis is mandatory to prevent neurological damage in unstable fractures.

Classic and newer classifications are primarily based on features identifiable using conventional imaging and CT scans, which are the most available modalities at most trauma centers. Even though multidetector-CT remains superior in assessing bone injuries with high accuracy, MRI is the most sensitive.

### Comparative analysis of three imaging modalities for evaluation of cervical sagittal alignment parameters: A validity and reliability study [^115TdYXJ]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

This study was a radiologic validity and reliability study. The objective was to assess the validity and reliability of measurements from standing lateral cervical radiography (XR), reconstructed midsagittal images of supine cervical computerized tomography (CT) scans, and supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluating C2-C7 distance (C27 SVA), C2-C7 Cobb angle (CL), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), and neck tilt (NT).

XR is the criterion standard imaging modality for measuring cervical sagittal alignment parameters. However, overlapping bony structures and soft tissue often make the upper end of the manubrium and cervicothoracic junction indiscernible. CT and MRI can overcome this limitation, but their reliability and validity have not been fully elucidated.

Fifty sets of three examinations from our database were randomly selected. Three experienced spinal surgeons independently measured C27 SVA, CL, T1S, TIA, and NT. Paired t test and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the validity of CT and MRI in comparison with that of XR. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

The paired t test confirmed the similarities of all CT (except C27 SVA) and MR parameters (except C27 SVA and CL) to the XR parameters (all P > 0.05). All parameters except C27 SVA were correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.523–0.913). Correlation was highest between CT and MRI and lowest between CT and XR.

### What should an ideal spinal injury classification system consist of? A methodological review and conceptual proposal for future classifications [^117Wdojd]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A dramatic shift in the diagnostic work-up of spinal injuries has occurred over the past several years. In contrast to a decade ago, computed tomography (CT) scans of the spine are now being routinely performed during the diagnostic work-up in approximately 80% of level I trauma centers. Not without reason; increasing evidence supports the use of (multi-detector) CT of the spine rather than conventional radiography in the diagnostic work-up of patients at both high risk and low risk of spinal injuries. Moreover, with respect to clearance of the spine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is currently not indicated in the absence of CT abnormalities and neurological deficits. CT images have shown to be more accurate in the visualization of potentially prognostic spinal injury characteristics than conventional radiographs and MRI. In addition, physicians may come to different treatment decisions after examining additional CT images.

Given this brief summary of recent advances in the diagnostic work-up of spinal injuries, it is clear that the contents of a contemporary spinal injury classification should primarily be based on the increasingly routinely performed CT imaging.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^113qdkXa]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We recommend that fluoroscopy or, in providers with expertise, ultrasound (US) be used for cervical medial branch blocks (MBB). US can be useful in patients for whom radiation exposure may pose potential harm; however, the lack of training may limit widespread adoption. This is a Grade A recommendation with a moderate level of certainty.

For intra-articular (IA) injections, we recommend the use of fluoroscopic imaging as the additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit. This is a Grade C recommendation with a low level of certainty.

For cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation (RFA), we recommend the use of fluoroscopy. The additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy precludes any theoretical benefit. Whereas CT-fluoroscopy is associated with less radiation than CT alone, it is not widely available and adds significant upfront equipment costs and radiation exposure. This is a Grade A recommendation with a high level of certainty for the use of imaging, and a Grade B recommendation with a moderate level of certainty for the use of fluoroscopy instead of other imaging modalities.

### Are upright lateral cervical radiographs in the obtunded trauma patient useful? A retrospective study [^112jH4U5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is widely recognized that MRI is better suited than CT for visualization of the soft tissues. D'Alise et al. argued in favor of MRI prior to CT, citing concerns about the inability to visualize soft tissue changes in the normally-aligned spine that is imaged by CT. Conversely, Brohi and co-workers maintain that unstable disc or ligamentous injury may be detected indirectly by CT through the evaluation of malalignment or malrotation. Indeed, we have seen subtle abnormalities such as facet joint widening, which led to confirmatory MRI studies. Not surprisingly, MRI has been demonstrated to be very accurate for identifying traumatic disc herniation. However, the impact of the presence of disc herniations on the decision as to whether or not to remove an immobilization device remains unclear.

A recent effort to delineate evidence-based guidelines for the exclusion of cervical instability recommended that MRI be obtained within 48 hours to be valid. Horn et al. recently examined the use of MRI for identifying post-traumatic instability. In their series of 70 patients, whose only positive findings were soft tissue injuries on MRI, none were noted to have instability when flexion-extension radiographs were performed. This finding raises the question as to the value of MRI for identifying cervical instability, as it appears to have a high false-positive rate. Schuster and colleagues conducted a prospective comparison of MRI and CT imaging in patients presenting with blunt trauma and concluded that, for patients without obvious motor weakness, MRI was unnecessary.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cervical pain or cervical radiculopathy: 2024 update [^111HBUxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care as it ranks in the top five causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging is central to the diagnosis of cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require distinct initial imaging to maximize the diagnostic usefulness. This document addresses different cervical pain variants with a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for each specific variant.

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In cases where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may serve as the primary evidentiary source to formulate recommendations.

### Computed tomographic screening for thoracic and lumbar fractures: Is spine reformatting necessary [^113xW7Md]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Patients who sustain traumatic vertebral fractures often have multiple other associated injuries. Due to the mechanisms of injury, many of these patients routinely undergo chest computed tomographic (CCT) and/or abdominal/pelvic computed tomographic (APCT) scans to diagnose intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injuries. These scans are routinely reformatted to provide more detailed imaging of the spine. Although the patient does not incur more radiation, the charges associated with this are significant. This study compared the sensitivity of these CT modalities in detecting thoracolumbar spine fractures.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review identified blunt trauma victims admitted through the emergency department with a discharge diagnosis of thoracic or lumbar spine fracture. These patients received (1) a chest and T-spine CT, (2) an abdominal/pelvic and lumbar spine CT, or both. Final radiologic readings of these patients' CT scans were obtained, and the sensitivities of the different imaging methods were compared. Discharge diagnosis of spine fracture was considered the gold standard.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-six APCT scans with reformatting and 175 CCT scans with reformatting were available for comparison. There were 9 of 176 false-negative APCT scans vs. 3/176 false-negative lumbar spine CT scans. There were 14/175 false-negative CCT scans vs. 2/175 false-negative thoracic spine CT scans. The differences in sensitivity were significant (P < .001) for both comparisons.

- **Conclusions**: Reformatting of CCT and APCT scans gives improved sensitivity in the detection of fractures.

### Imaging, clearance, and controversies in pediatric cervical spine trauma [^115NxJ3W]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosing cervical spine injury in children can be challenging because the clinical examination can be unreliable, and evidence-based consensus guidelines for cervical spine injury evaluation in children have not been established. However, the consequences of cervical spine injuries are significant. Therefore, practitioners should understand common patterns of cervical spine injury in children, the evidence and indications for cervical spine imaging, and which imaging modalities to use. Herein, we review the epidemiology and unique anatomical features of pediatric cervical spine injury. In addition, we summarize the practice for clearance and imaging of the pediatric cervical spine in trauma.

### A pictorial review of imaging findings associated with upper cervical trauma [^113xFzsz]. Emergency Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The diagnosis of cervical spine injury in the emergency department remains a critical skill for emergency room physicians and radiologists. Such diagnoses are often associated with high morbidity and mortality unless readily identified and treated appropriately. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial in the workup of spinal injury and play a key role in arriving at a diagnosis. Unfortunately, missed cervical spine injuries are not uncommon and often precede detrimental neurologic sequelae. With the increase in whole-body imaging ordered from the emergency department, it is critical for radiologists to be acutely aware of key imaging features associated with upper cervical trauma, possible mimics, and radiographic clues suggesting potential high-risk patient populations. This pictorial review will cover key imaging features from several different imaging modalities associated with upper cervical spine trauma, explore patient epidemiology, mechanisms, and presentation, as well as identify confounding radiographic signs to aid in confident and accurate diagnoses.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on suspected spine trauma [^115G3G7G]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with suspected spine trauma is controversial. This document addresses several pertinent issues: (1) which patients need imaging, (2) how much imaging is necessary, and (3) exactly what sort of imaging is to be performed. This subject is important because conservative estimates indicate that more than 1 million blunt trauma patients, who have the potential for sustaining spine injuries, are seen annually in emergency departments in the United States.

Adult patients who satisfy any of several "low-risk" criteria for cervical spine injury need no imaging. Patients who do not fall into this category should undergo thin-section computed tomographic examinations that include sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructed images. For those patients who cannot be examined using computed tomography, 3-view radiographic examinations of the cervical vertebrae may be performed to provide preliminary assessments of the likelihood of injury until computed tomography can be performed.

Thoracic and lumbar computed tomographic images may be obtained from data collected for thorax-abdomen-pelvis studies. Radiography is recommended for children under 14 years of age. Reconstructed computed tomographic images may be used from thorax-abdomen-pelvis studies of children, if they have been obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging should be the primary modality for evaluating possible spinal cord injury or compression, as well as ligamentous injuries in acute cervical spine trauma. Flexion and extension radiography is best reserved for follow-up of symptomatic patients, after their initial assessment.

### Non-neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^114ZHSVE]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple imaging modalities can be utilized to assess the thoracic inlet, including radiography, fluoroscopy, CT, MRI, and ultrasound. In general, radiography is limited in providing spatial details; however, it is an important screening tool in a trauma setting. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are well-detected by radiographs, as well as osseous abnormalities, including conditions such as cervical osteophytes and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).

- **Fluoroscopy as a dynamic visualization tool**: Fluoroscopy is the workhorse in dynamic visualization of the esophagus. It is a helpful screening tool for esophageal abnormalities such as diverticula, ulcers, stenosis, dysmotility, and cancer.

- **CT as the gold standard**: CT provides extensive spatial resolution and is the "gold standard" for evaluating most vascular pathology, cancer staging, and as a quick evaluation tool in the setting of trauma.

- **Ultrasound for superficial structures**: Evaluation of superficial structures, such as the thyroid gland, cervical lymph nodes, and cervical vascular structures, can be easily performed with ultrasound, which has the added benefit of portability and lack of radiation exposure.

- **MRI for advanced imaging**: MRI is an advanced modality with superior soft tissue resolution, critical in the assessment of neural and lymphatic structures such as the brachial plexus and thoracic duct, which cannot be as reliably assessed with CT.

### CT versus plain radiographs for evaluation of c-spine injury in young children: Do benefits outweigh risks [^112kQxzv]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Various reports support the use of cervical spine (c-spine) CT over conventional radiography in the screening of c-spine injury. Interest now exists in diagnostic radiation-induced morbidity.

- **Objective**: To estimate the excess relative risk for developing cancer from c-spine high-resolution CT radiation exposure.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of children evaluated for c-spine injury using CT. The study population was divided into three age groups: 0–4 years (group 1), 5–8 years (group 2), and older than 8 years (group 3). Anthropomorphic 1-year-old and 5-year-old phantoms were used to measure radiation at the thyroid during radiography and CT. Excess relative risk for thyroid cancer was estimated using these measurements.

- **Results**: A total of 557 patients were evaluated with CT. The radiographic method most commonly used was head CT/c-spine CT in 363 (65%). Only 179 children (32%) had any type of prior radiography. The use of c-spine CT exposes the thyroid to 90–200 times more radiation than multiple conventional radiographs. The mean excess relative risk for thyroid cancer after CT was 2.0 for group 1 and 0.6 for group 2. There were no comparison data for group 3.

- **Conclusion**: C-spine CT is associated with significant exposure to ionizing radiation and increases the excess relative risk for thyroid cancer in young children.

### Mdct and mri evaluation of cervical spine trauma [^114wne7g]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The cervical spine is susceptible to a variety of stable and unstable injuries. Depending on the mechanism of trauma, injuries in this region are associated with high morbidity and mortality. MDCT and MRI are frequently complementary studies in trauma. MDCT is able to identify osseous injuries and assess for cervical malalignment in the acute setting. MRI can further assess injuries in patients with MDCT findings or assess for occult injury when MDCT is normal. It is critical that the radiologist is familiar with appearances of cervical spine injury on both MDCT and MRI.

### Sticking our neck out: Is magnetic resonance imaging needed to clear an obtunded patient's cervical spine [^116sad7t]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). High credibility.

Evaluating the cervical spine in the obtunded trauma patient is a subject fraught with controversy. Some authors assert that a negative computed tomography (CT) scan is sufficient, while others argue that CT alone may miss occult unstable injuries and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could alter treatment. This study examines the data in an urban county trauma center to determine if a negative cervical spine CT scan is sufficient to clear the obtunded trauma patient.

- **Methods**: Records of all consecutive patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 2000 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients directly admitted to the intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 13, contemporaneous CT and MRI, and a negative CT reading were included. The results of the cervical spine MRI were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 309 patients had both CT and MRI, 107 (35%) of whom had negative CTs. The mean time between CT and MRI was 16 days. Of those patients, seven (7%) had positive acute traumatic findings on MRI, including ligamentous injury, subluxation, and fracture. However, only two of these patients required surgical intervention. None had unstable injuries.

- **Conclusions**: In the obtunded trauma patient with a negative cervical spine CT, obtaining an MRI does not appear to significantly alter management, and no unstable injuries were missed on the CT scan. This should be considered in efforts at cost-containment in the health care system. It is one of the larger studies published at the time of writing.

### Mdct and mri evaluation of cervical spine trauma [^113vNxmF]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Cervical spine injuries following major trauma result in significant associated morbidity and mortality. Devastating neurological injuries, including complete and incomplete tetraplegia, are common sequelae of cervical spine trauma and cause profound and life-altering medical, financial, and social consequences. Most cervical spine injuries occur due to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and violence. The proliferation of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows for fast and accurate screening for potential bony and vascular injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for evaluating the supporting ligaments and the spinal cord after the patient has been stabilized.

Cervical spine injuries are approached with much caution by emergency room clinicians. Thus, it is essential that radiologists can differentiate between a stable and unstable injury on MDCT, as this information ultimately helps determine the management of such injuries.

- **Teaching points**: MDCT and MRI are complementary, and both may be needed to define injuries and determine management. MDCT rapidly evaluates the bones, and MRI is superior for detecting ligament and cord injuries. Injury to one of the three spinal columns may be stable, while injuries to more than one are unstable. Instability may cause abnormal interspinous and interpedicular distances, or cervical malalignment. Fractures of the foramen transversarium are associated with vertebral arterial dissection.

### Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine in the spinal clearance of trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^111PAoz5]. European Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the proportion of trauma patients with missed cervical spine injuries that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identifies following a negative computed tomography (CT) scan; (2) perform subgroup analyses based on age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation; and (3) evaluate treatment changes due to MRI findings.

Methods: This systematic review and meta-analyses was conducted with reference to the PRISMA guidelines. We included studies investigating cervical spine clearance in trauma patients using CT and MRI. Outcomes of interest included the number of injuries each modality identified and the number of treatment changes prompted by MRI findings. Outcomes were expressed as proportions and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Results: Thirty-six studies involving 6,784 patients were analyzed. MRI identified missed injuries in 17% of patients following a negative CT (Proportions 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.23). Subgroup analyses showed that pediatric patients (Proportions 0.32, 95% CI 0.13–0.58) were at higher risk of missed injuries compared to adults (Proportions 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.27), and that alert patients (Proportions 0.28, 95% CI 0.13–0.48) were at higher risk of missed injuries than obtunded patients (Proportions 0.14, 95% CI 0.08–0.23). Clinically significant injuries identified on MRI prompted treatment changes in 4% of patients (Proportions 0.04, 95% CI 0.02–0.07).

Conclusion: Trauma patients with a negative CT cervical spine scan had a 17% chance of missed injuries if an MRI cervical spine evaluation was not performed.

### Abusive spinal injury: Imaging and updates [^1118QseG]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Spinal imaging protocol for abuse

The skeletal survey remains the first-line imaging modality for radiologic assessment of suspected abuse. Lateral views of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spine should be obtained as part of the standard imaging protocol. Additional radiographs may be acquired as deemed necessary by a radiologist before the patient is released from the department, as is routine practice in the authors' institution. It should be noted that evaluation of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) can be particularly challenging by radiography due to overlapping structures, limited patient cooperation, and potentially fixed positioning from immobilization. If there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion for head or CCJ injury, one should have a low threshold for obtaining cross-sectional imaging. At the authors' institution, CT head imaging obtained as part of a trauma protocol includes the upper cervical spine to the level of C2 to image the CCJ and evaluate for associated injury. In addition, sagittal soft tissue reconstructions through the CCJ are valuable for detecting ligamentous injury, retroclival fluid, and prevertebral edema. Therefore, multiplanar reconstructions are invaluable for detecting injuries that may be very subtle on axial images.

- **Heterogeneity of practice**: Beyond the routinely performed skeletal survey and head CT in cases of suspected abuse, spine MRI utilization varies widely and is reported anywhere between 4.3–84.3% across the United States. Depending on findings on the initial survey, physical examination, time of presentation, and resource availability (e.g. sedation, MRI).

### Cervical ribs: Identification on MRI and clinical relevance [^1126xmCy]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of cervical ribs on cervical spine MRI and their clinical relevance, we reviewed 2,500 studies for cervical ribs and compression of neurovascular structures, comparing the results to CT when available. Brachial plexus or subclavian artery contact by a cervical rib was identified on MRI and/or CT in 12 cases, with a diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome in one case. Cervical ribs were identified on 1.2% (25/2,083) of examinations, which is lower than on CT (2%). However, MRI may offer an equivalent anatomic explanation for patient symptoms.

### An evidenced-based approach to radiographic assessment of cervical spine injuries in the emergency department [^116gfRuc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The modern approach to suspected cervical spine injuries is highly dependent on the appropriate utilization of radiographic studies. Clinical decision rules have been developed to determine individuals most likely to benefit from plain film studies, but there is confusion regarding those who should undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning. This case-based review highlights available evidence and provides a framework to guide emergency medicine providers in the treatment of patients with trauma to the cervical spine.

### Normal fetal development of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine: A postmortem study based on magnetic resonance imaging [^112qGZyd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

Before evaluating spinal pathology, it is essential to have knowledge of the normal spinal development at different gestational ages. This study aims to characterize normal spinal growth in human fetuses during the second and third trimesters.

- **Methods**: Postmortem 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 55 fetuses at 17–42 gestational weeks using three-dimensional T2-weighted sequences. Morphological changes and quantitative measurements of the fetal spine were assessed. The correlation between centrum ossification center volume (COCV) and gestational age was investigated.

- **Results**: The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar COCVs showed a positive relationship with gestational age (p < 0.05). No gender differences were found in the volumetric development of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar centrum ossification centers (COCs). The average volumetric growth rate per COC was larger in the lumbar spine than in the cervical and thoracic spine. The L1-L5 COCVs also showed a linear positive relationship with gestational age.

- **Consults**: Postmortem 3.0 T MRI clearly demonstrated spinal changes in external contour and internal structure with gestational age. These findings expand our understanding of the early growth pattern of the human spine and could be further used to assess the developmental conditions of the fetal spine.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^1146CgVo]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Our primary outcomes were the performance of any cervical spine imaging within 24 hours of presentation, including cervical spine computed tomography (CT), cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or cervical spine radiography (X-ray). Imaging performance data were extracted from the database using the DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Rev. — Clinical Modification codes: BR20ZZZ, BR201ZZ, BR200ZZ, and BR20YZZ for cervical spine CT; BR30ZZZ, BR30Y0Z, and BR30YZZ for cervical spine MRI; and BR00ZZZ and BR00ZZ1 for cervical spine X-ray.

Independent variables included hospital trauma level (labeled as I, II, or III/IV/other/not reported, according to either state or ACS designation) and pediatric specialty center status. Additional variables were also extracted, including patient age and sex, region of the country, injury severity (including Injury Severity Score [ISS] and Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), vital signs, method of injury, presence of a confounding comorbidity, and whether the presentation immediately followed an injury (initial presentation) or corresponded to an interfacility transfer. Vital signs were dichotomized as either normal or abnormal based on the patient's age group. The method of injury was categorized according to the DRG International Classification of Diseases — 10th Rev. — Clinical Modification codes as either a fall, gunshot wound, other penetrating injury, motor vehicle accident (MVA), pedestrian versus motor vehicle (peds vs. MVA), cycling injury, or motorcycle accident.

### Medical imaging of intervertebral disc degeneration: Current status of imaging [^112wNit7]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

The author reviewed literature and reports on spine imaging, selecting key articles that describe novel imaging strategies and preparing a review of currently developing imaging strategies for intervertebral disc degeneration. The objective was to provide a comprehensive review of imaging in intervertebral disc degeneration, briefly covering the methodology and describing developing techniques in detail.

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide excellent anatomic images of the spine. However, anatomic imaging does not reliably identify the source of pain in patients with intervertebral disc degeneration. Many functional imaging techniques are suited to the study of the spine. Some of these techniques will enhance our understanding of intervertebral disc degeneration and its clinical symptomatology.

The author selected reports from the literature for further review, aiming to succinctly describe the material most relevant to spine imaging. New and potentially useful imaging strategies for spine imaging include dynamic computed tomography, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography continue to offer more opportunities to investigate and diagnose back pain and intervertebral disc degeneration.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thoracolumbar spinal injuries, particularly in relation to clinical examination, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend considering the exclusion of thoracolumbar spinal injury clinically (without radiographic imaging) in patients with blunt trauma where all of the following criteria are met:

- **Absence of thoracolumbar spinal pain**: The patient reports no pain in the thoracolumbar region.
- **Absence of high-energy trauma mechanism**: The injury did not result from high-impact forces.
- **Absence of drug or alcohol intoxication**: The patient shows no signs of intoxication by drugs or alcohol.
- **Normal mental status examination**: The patient exhibits a normal mental status upon examination.
- **Normal neurological and physical examination**: Neurological and physical examinations yield normal results.

### Are flexion extension films necessary for cervical spine clearance in patients with neck pain after negative cervical CT scan [^116GdWzH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

There are variations in cervical spine (CS) clearance protocols in neurologically intact blunt trauma patients with negative radiological imaging but persistent neck pain. Guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma include options of maintaining the cervical collar or obtaining either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or flexion-extension films (FEF). We evaluated the utility of FEF in the era of routine computerized tomography (CT) for imaging the CS in trauma.

- **Materials and methods**: All neurologically intact, awake, non-intoxicated patients who underwent FEF for persistent neck pain following a negative CT scan of the CS at our level I trauma center over a 13-month period were identified. Their charts were reviewed and demographic data obtained.

- **Results**: There were 354 patients (58.5% male) with negative cervical CS CT scans who had FEF for residual neck pain. Incidental degenerative changes were seen in 37% of cases, which did not affect acute management. FEF were positive for possible ligamentous injury in 5 patients (1.4%). Two of these patients had negative magnetic resonance images, and the other three had collars removed within 3 weeks as the findings were ultimately determined to be degenerative.

- **Conclusions**: In the era where cervical CT has universally supplanted initial plain films, FEF appear to be of little value in the evaluation of persistent neck pain. Their use should be excluded from cervical spine clearance protocols in neurologically intact, awake patients.

### Interobserver agreement of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is superior to whole-body computed tomography for assessing disease burden in patients with multiple myeloma [^111iy4PR]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

For each body region, including the skull, cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis, ribs/other, and long bones, two radiologists with more than ten years of experience, blinded to clinical information and MRI findings, categorized disease burden on WB-CT using a previously described scoring system. This system assessed the number of lesions: score 4 for more than 20 lesions, score 3 for 10–20 lesions, score 2 for 5–10 lesions, score 1 for fewer than 5 lesions, and score 0 for no lesions. For lesion size, they assigned: score 3 for lesions larger than 10 mm, score 2 for 5–10 mm, and score 1 for smaller than 5 mm. The maximum dimension of lesions was measured on the window setting where the lesion was most visible. A total score was then calculated for the whole skeleton. Discrepancies were resolved by a consensus reading facilitated by a third experienced radiologist to achieve final observer scores.

At a different time, image reading was repeated for the WB-MRI data with readers blinded to clinical information and CT findings. The maximum lesion dimension was measured on the sequence in which the lesion was most readily appreciated. The image reading for WB-CT and WB-MRI was subsequently repeated by another pair of junior radiologists with less than one year of experience as a consultant.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^1153PRLG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically in the evaluation of arterial injury, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a head and neck CTA or MRA as the next imaging step. This is advised for patients aged ≥ 16 years with suspected acute blunt trauma of the cervical spine and clinical or imaging findings suggestive of arterial injury, with or without positive cervical spine CT.

### Variation in pediatric cervical spine imaging across trauma centers-a cause for concern [^115qYozr]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Nonetheless, variability in imaging performance is to be expected to a certain extent, and our findings should not be interpreted as an indictment on inadequate guideline adherence. Each of the published algorithms allows for subjective clinical assessment, physician suspicion, and physician experience to factor into individual imaging decisions. Given the gravity of missing cervical spine injury (CSI) in children, physicians, especially those at less specialized centers who are also less accustomed to caring for pediatric trauma patients, may be taking a "better safe than sorry" diagnostic approach.

Another important possibility to consider, especially in the context of older pediatric trauma patients, is that providers might have been using adult cervical spine clearance algorithms. Unfortunately, it is likely that this issue persists today. In 2016, Duane et al. published the findings from a decade-long study to determine the best practice for clearance of the cervical spine in the setting of adult trauma patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trauma team alert criteria. The authors declared that any adult trauma patient meeting the CDC trauma team alert should undergo a CT scan which captures the cervical spine. Hence, providers at adult trauma centers today who immediately request cervical spine CT scans for the initial evaluation of a pediatric trauma patient might actually be following guidelines (in)appropriately because they either lack familiarity with the pediatric-specific protocols or believe the pediatric patient is old enough to meet adult criteria.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging screening for a surgical decision regarding the approach for anterior spine fusion at the cervicothoracic junction [^116Y7RR1]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

In a study investigating the correlation between a set of designed criteria and judgments of surgical experience, 100 cervical magnetic resonance images from different patients were used.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate reliable and reproducible anatomic measurements that can aid spine surgeons in selecting surgical approaches for anterior spine fusion in the cervicothoracic region.

- **Summary of background data**: Surgical approaches to the cervicothoracic junction vary among surgeons. Whereas sternotomy provides maximum exposure, less extensive approaches are preferred to minimize surgical trauma, provided surgical goals are not compromised. No quantitative criteria currently exist to determine before surgery the least invasive surgical approach for sufficiently exposing pertinent anatomy.

- **Methods**: Thirteen geometric variables designed to be clinically practical and to expose important anatomic relations were used to evaluate 100 sagittal scout cervical magnetic resonance image sequences. An experienced spine surgeon independently rated each image for the most appropriate surgical approach to the C5-T2 region. The ratings were tested for interrater reliability using a second spine surgeon. After testing for interrater and intrarater reliability, the geometric measurements were correlated with the surgeon's selected surgical approaches for each intervertebral segment (P < 0.05).

- **Results**: Instrument manubrial thoracic distances, reflecting standardized heights of intervertebral discs above or below the superior tip of the manubrium, were the most reliable and reproducible measurements.

### Controversies in cervical spine imaging in trauma patients [^112kxmaZ]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

No area of emergency radiology has generated as much discussion in recent years as the subject of cervical spine imaging for trauma patients. This review will be in three parts:

- **Indications for cervical imaging**: This section will focus on those factors that make patients at high risk or low risk for cervical injury.

- **Merits of radiography and computed tomography**: The discussion will include the roles of each modality in the evaluation process, such as efficacy of diagnosis, duration of study, and cost.

- **Clearing the cervical spine in comatose patients**: The third part will explore the methods currently employed in this process.

### Management of pediatric cervical spine and spinal cord injuries [^112Hc5TH]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

For the management of cervical spine injury in pediatric patients, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend performing thoracic elevation or creating an occipital recess for children under 8 years of age. This is to prevent flexion of the head and neck when they are restrained supine on an otherwise flat backboard, facilitating better neutral alignment and immobilization of the cervical spine.

### Radiographic assessment [^1126WidE]. Neurosurgery (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically concerning cervical imaging, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend not obtaining cervical spine imaging in awake, asymptomatic patients (those without neck pain or tenderness) who have a normal neurological examination, are able to complete a functional range of motion examination, and do not have an injury that detracts from an accurate evaluation. Cervical immobilization should be discontinued in these patients without the need for cervical spinal imaging.

### Comparison of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebral bone quality scores for increased utility of bone mineral density screening [^1146P1bp]. European Spine Journal (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the associations among the validated lumbar vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score, and cervical and thoracic VBQ scores, radiographic records of 100 patients who underwent synchronous MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were retrieved. DEXA-validated lumbar VBQ was calculated using the median signal intensity (MSI) of the L1-L4 vertebrae and L3 CSF. VBQ was derived as the quotient of MSI L1-L4 divided by MSI CSF. Cervical and thoracic VBQ were similarly obtained using C3-C6 and C5 CSF, and T5-T8 and T7 CSF, respectively.

Paired sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences among regional VBQ scores. Independent sample t-tests were conducted to identify sex differences in VBQ. Regression models with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were constructed to identify associations among all permutations of anthropometric and regional VBQ measures.

Mean cervical, thoracic, and lumbar VBQ scores were 3.06 ± 0.89, 2.60 ± 0.77, and 2.47 ± 0.61, respectively. Mean differences of 0.127 (p = 0.045) and -0.595 (p < 0.001) were observed between thoracic and lumbar, and cervical and lumbar VBQ scores. Correlations of 0.324, 0.356, and 0.600 (p < 0.001) were found between cervical and lumbar, cervical and thoracic, and thoracic and lumbar VBQ scores. Regression with ANOVA predicting lumbar VBQ in relation to cervical and thoracic VBQ demonstrated R Square values of 0.105 and 0.360 (p < 0.001), and β coefficient values of 0.471 and 0.217 (p < 0.001), respectively.

In conclusion, thoracic VBQ provides values representative of the validated lumbar VBQ score.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^111F8xFa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, more specifically with respect to cervical imaging, the MRI guidelines from ACR 2019 recommend obtaining cervical spine MRI in patients aged ≥ 16 years with acute cervical spine injury detected on radiographs, and for treatment planning in the case of a mechanically unstable spine.

### Imaging in spinal trauma [^1134exY7]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Because it may cause paralysis, injury to the spine is one of the most feared traumas, and spinal cord injury is a major cause of disability. In the United States, approximately 10,000 traumatic cervical spine fractures and 4,000 traumatic thoracolumbar fractures are diagnosed each year. Although the number of individuals sustaining paralysis is far less than those with moderate or severe brain injury, the socioeconomic costs are significant. Since most spinal trauma patients survive their injuries, almost one out of 1,000 inhabitants in the United States are currently being cared for partial or complete paralysis.

Little controversy exists regarding the need for accurate and emergent imaging assessment of the traumatized spine in order to evaluate spinal stability and integrity of neural elements. Because clinicians fear missing occult spine injuries, they obtain radiographs for nearly all patients who present with blunt trauma. We are influenced on one side by fear of litigation and the possible devastating medical, psychologic, and financial consequences of cervical spine injury, and on the other side by pressure to reduce health care costs. A set of clinical and/or anamnestic criteria, however, can be very useful in identifying patients who have an extremely low probability of injury and who consequently have no need for imaging studies. Multidetector (or multislice) computed tomography (MDCT) is the preferred primary imaging modality in blunt spinal trauma patients who do need imaging. Not only is CT more accurate in diagnosing spinal injury, it also reduces imaging time and patient management.

### Imaging features of the postoperative spine: A guide to basic understanding of spine surgical procedures [^1137FY1j]. Insights into Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Since the evaluation of the postoperative spine is challenging, it is of utmost importance to have a basic understanding of the indications and objectives of the main surgical procedures, as well as the hardware instrumentation materials and their normal appearance through imaging. One should be familiar with the most appropriate imaging modality for each setting, including radiographs, CT, MRI, or nuclear medicine studies. Comparison with previous exams and access to surgical descriptions are always helpful and support imaging evaluation. The ultimate goal is to create efficient reports to assist the surgeon in continuous patient care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected spine trauma [^1165jnMD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cervical spine injury, specifically concerning cervical imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering CT, MRI, or X-ray of the cervical spine for patients aged 16 years or older with suspected acute blunt trauma. It is also recommended as follow-up imaging in patients who initially show no unstable injury but continue to wear a collar for neck pain and display no new neurologic symptoms, including whiplash-associated disorders.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^114iadqx]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Whereas ultrasound (US) may provide comparable accuracy and confer some advantages over fluoroscopy, several studies have revealed diminished accuracy rates for C7, which may also be more challenging to block with fluoroscopy. In one randomized study involving 50 patients, US and fluoroscopy were found to have similar accuracy rates (92–96%) and to provide comparable post-block pain relief, although the former was associated with shorter performance time and less intravascular contrast spread. It is important to recognize that even an imaging modality that permits direct visualization of neurovascular structures is not devoid of risks, with Park et al. reporting a case of permanent spinal cord injury following a C7 MBB was performed under US guidance, which reinforces the challenges at this cervical level.

- **Studies comparing imaging modalities for cervical facet injections**: Imaging for therapeutic interventions (IA steroid and RFA) involves the use of fluoroscopy, CT, and US. In the lumbar anatomic region, recent multi-society guidelines recommended fluoroscopy as the preferred imaging modality for IA injections and lumbar medial branch RFA. The use of fluoroscopic guidance is well-established for thoracic occupant nerve (TON) through C8 medial branch RFA procedures. However, the use of CT and US guidance for cervical interventions, including IA facet injections with steroid, is still in its infancy and cadaveric evaluation has yet to definitively establish comparative effectiveness and safety relative to the fluoroscopic approach.

### Trends and variation in cervical spine imaging utilization across children's hospitals for pediatric trauma [^113wCMtH]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Cervical spine (c-spine) evaluation is a critical component in trauma evaluation, and although several pediatric c-spine evaluation algorithms have been developed, none have been widely implemented. This study assesses rates of c-spine imaging use across children's hospitals, specifically focusing on temporal trends in imaging use, variation across hospitals, and the timing of magnetic resonance imaging in admitted patients.

- **Methods**: Data from the Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System, spanning from 2015 to 2020, were analyzed. Patients younger than 18 years, treated in the emergency department for trauma with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code, and who received a c-spine plain radiograph or CT were included. Data visualization and descriptive statistics were utilized to assess imaging use rates by age, year, hospital, injury severity, and day of service. Changes in imaging use rates over time were evaluated through simple linear regression.

- **Results**: In 25,238 patient encounters across 35 children's hospitals, there was an observed increase in the use of c-spine CT from 2015 to 2020, from 28.5% to 36.5%. Substantial interinstitutional variation existed in the use of plain radiographs versus CT for initial c-spine evaluation across all age groups. Notably, magnetic resonance imaging was obtained more than three days after admission in 31.5% of intensive care patients who received this imaging.

- **Conclusion**: There is an increasing use of CT and substantial interinstitutional variation in the rates of plain radiograph utilization for c-spine evaluation.

### Imaging of spine trauma [^113YXUND]. Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is fundamental to the evaluation of traumatic spinal injury. Specifically, neuroradiologic techniques show the exact location of injury, evaluate the stability of the spine, and determine neural element compromise. This review focuses on the complementary role of different radiologic modalities in the diagnosis of patients with traumatic injuries of the spine. The role of imaging in spinal trauma classifications will be addressed. The importance of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of soft tissue injury, particularly of the spinal cord, will be discussed. Last, the increasing role of advanced imaging techniques for prognostication of the traumatic spine will be explored.
