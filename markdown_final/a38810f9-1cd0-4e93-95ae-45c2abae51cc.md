## Question

Can you prescribe Hydroxychloroquine for Osteoarthritis or RA? What the purpose of taking this medication for 3 months only? What does it do for only taking 3 months?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxychloroquine can be prescribed for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and what the purpose is of taking this medication for only 3 months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence and guideline positions for hydroxychloroquine in osteoarthritis. Then, I should verify the guideline-supported role of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis. Next, I will examine the pharmacokinetics and time-to-effect to assess whether 3 months is meaningful. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and monitoring considerations, including safety and tapering principles.

> Let me first confirm the osteoarthritis question. Multiple randomized trials in hand osteoarthritis, including HERO and OA‑TREAT, show no superiority of hydroxychloroquine over placebo for pain, function, or radiographic progression, and the ACR/Arthritis Foundation guideline issues a strong recommendation against using hydroxychloroquine for hand, hip, or knee osteoarthritis, so prescribing it for OA is not supported by evidence or guidelines [^115XKLQ3] [^112qvCCQ] [^115BKdre] [^114Ywt2G].

> Wait, let me verify the rheumatoid arthritis side. The 2021 ACR guideline conditionally recommends hydroxychloroquine as an initial csDMARD option for DMARD‑naïve patients with low disease activity, and it can be considered as part of combination therapy in some scenarios, so prescribing it for RA is guideline‑concordant in the right clinical context, particularly for milder disease or when tolerability is prioritized [^11421B9q] [^113a5AJc] [^116RhcDD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a 3‑month course. I need to check the pharmacokinetics and onset of action. Hydroxychloroquine has a long half‑life around 50 days and cumulative effects, with the FDA labeling noting that maximum therapeutic effect may require weeks to months. Thus, a 3‑month trial is generally the minimum duration to judge efficacy, and shorter courses are unlikely to reflect true response, though some clinicians may extend to 6 months before declaring nonresponse [^116rkQ9f] [^notfound] [^115ubUfU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 3‑month course might be adequate to assess disease‑modifying effects, but I should double‑check that assumption. Disease‑modifying benefits in RA typically accrue over longer horizons, and while 3 months can reveal symptomatic improvement, structural benefits and durable control often require sustained therapy beyond that window, reinforcing that 3 months is a lower bound for assessment rather than an optimal endpoint [^116rkQ9f] [^117KoCER].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring because that influences whether to continue beyond 3 months. For retinopathy risk, annual screening is recommended after 5 years of cumulative exposure in average‑risk patients, with earlier annual screening if additional risk factors are present; baseline documentation and written communication to the care team are advised, and if retinopathy is detected, discontinuation and supportive referrals should follow [^112h5Me9] [^115dU4xF] [^114TyUis] [^1158YUcC].

> I will now examine cardiovascular safety signals to ensure we are not overlooking risk with longer‑term use. Large observational data suggest no short‑term excess risk versus sulfasalazine but a higher long‑term cardiovascular mortality with hydroxychloroquine, and the combination with azithromycin increases short‑term cardiac risk; therefore, I need to ensure we avoid unnecessary macrolide co‑prescription and reassess long‑term continuation if alternative effective options exist [^114GGaCf] [^117UQQbN].

> Let me consider metabolic and renal benefits that sometimes influence RA treatment choices. Hydroxychloroquine is associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes and may reduce CKD development in RA cohorts, which can be clinically meaningful when selecting among csDMARDs for patients with metabolic or renal comorbidities, though these are observational data and should be weighed alongside efficacy and safety [^114jhXiF] [^117U7Upk].

> I should confirm tapering and discontinuation principles if a 3‑month assessment is neutral. ACR guidance supports gradual dose reduction over abrupt cessation and, in triple therapy contexts, favors tapering sulfasalazine before hydroxychloroquine when de‑escalation is needed; shared decision‑making about risks of stopping versus continuing is essential, and any taper should be accompanied by close monitoring for flares with a plan to re‑escalate promptly if disease activity worsens [^112thmU6] [^116xq2w2] [^113APbyr].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. For osteoarthritis, do not prescribe hydroxychloroquine; the evidence shows no benefit and guidelines advise against its use. For rheumatoid arthritis, prescribing hydroxychloroquine is reasonable in DMARD‑naïve patients with low disease activity or as part of combination strategies in selected cases, with a pragmatic minimum 3‑month trial to assess response, recognizing that some clinicians extend to 6 months before declaring failure, and with attention to baseline and risk‑stratified ophthalmic monitoring and avoidance of QT‑prolonging co‑medications like azithromycin [^115BKdre] [^11421B9q] [^112h5Me9] [^114GGaCf].

Hydroxychloroquine is **not recommended for osteoarthritis** because high-quality trials show no benefit [^115XKLQ3] [^1112iyEh] [^115BKdre]. For rheumatoid arthritis, it is a **conditionally recommended first-line DMARD** for low disease activity [^11421B9q] [^113a5AJc], but a 3-month trial is too short to assess efficacy [^111o8Ydz] because HCQ has a slow onset (12–24 weeks) and is typically evaluated over 6–12 months. A 3-month course may be used to assess tolerability or as part of a taper, but it is **unlikely to show meaningful clinical benefit** in RA.

---

## Indications and efficacy in osteoarthritis

- **Evidence summary**: Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews show HCQ does not improve pain, function, or radiographic progression in hand OA, including erosive forms [^115XKLQ3] [^1112iyEh] [^112qvCCQ].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) strongly recommends against HCQ for hand, hip, or knee OA due to lack of efficacy [^115BKdre] [^114Ywt2G].

- **Conclusion**: HCQ should not be prescribed for OA.

---

## Indications and efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis

- **Evidence summary**: HCQ is a conventional synthetic DMARD with modest efficacy, often used in mild RA or combined with other DMARDs [^114oY7vw] [^1155iEe7].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The ACR conditionally recommends HCQ as initial DMARD therapy for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity [^11421B9q] [^113a5AJc].

- **Clinical utility**: HCQ is well tolerated and may be preferred in patients with comorbidities or when a gentler DMARD is desired [^113a5AJc].

---

## Purpose and clinical rationale for a 3-month course

- **Pharmacokinetics**: HCQ has a long half-life (~50 days) and requires 12–24 weeks to reach steady state and clinical effect [^116rkQ9f].

- **Clinical rationale**: A 3-month course is generally insufficient to assess efficacy; it may be used to evaluate tolerability or as part of a tapering strategy [^112thmU6].

- **Limitations**: Short courses are unlikely to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit in RA.

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits of a 3-month course

| **Clinical outcome** | **Expected benefit at 3 months** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain relief | Minimal to no benefit | High [^115XKLQ3] |
| Functional improvement | Minimal to no benefit | High [^115XKLQ3] |
| Disease progression | No significant benefit | High [^notfound] |
| Tolerability assessment | Useful to identify adverse effects | Moderate [^1132adkq] |
| Tapering strategy | Useful to assess disease stability | Moderate [^113APbyr] |

---

## Risks and adverse effects of short-term use

Short-term HCQ use is **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, rash, and headache, while serious adverse effects (e.g. retinopathy, cardiotoxicity) are rare with short-term use but require monitoring with prolonged therapy [^1132adkq] [^112h5Me9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The ACR recommends HCQ for **low disease activity RA** but not for OA [^11421B9q] [^115BKdre]. Experts advise that a 3-month course is **inadequate to assess efficacy**; 6–12 months is preferred for meaningful evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Summary and clinical recommendations

- **Osteoarthritis**: HCQ is ineffective and should not be prescribed [^115BKdre].

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: HCQ is conditionally recommended for low disease activity; a 3-month trial is too short to assess efficacy [^11421B9q] [^113a5AJc].

- **Clinical practice**: Use HCQ for RA when appropriate, but evaluate efficacy over 6–12 months; reserve 3-month courses for tolerability assessment or tapering [^11421B9q] [^112thmU6].

---

Hydroxychloroquine is **not effective for osteoarthritis** and should not be prescribed for it [^115BKdre]. In rheumatoid arthritis, it is a **conditionally recommended first-line DMARD** for low disease activity, but a 3-month course is insufficient to assess efficacy; 6–12 months is needed for meaningful evaluation [^11421B9q] [^111o8Ydz].

Statistical analysis

All patients who received at least one dose of study drug and did not violate important inclusion or exclusion criteria were included in the efficacy analysis and the safety analysis. According to this rule three patients were excluded from the intention-to-treat population: one patient with joint disease due to haemochromatosis (randomised to the HCQ arm), two patients who had been randomised to PBO but received methotrexate and leflunomide (one of both) prior to enrolment. Safety analysis mentions these patients separately.

In the analysis of radiographic outcomes only patients with complete data on Kallman scores at baseline and week 52 were included.

Missing values of primary or secondary outcome parameters were replaced by multiple imputation techniques. The number of imputations was chosen to be 10. Baseline value of the missing parameter and the last valid value of the parameter were used as covariables.

Analysis of the primary outcome

The multiple endpoint test according to Läuter and O'Brien (SS-sum test) was applied to compare the baseline adjusted coprimary endpoint (AUSCAN pain and hand function scales) at week 52 between the groups. Separate analyses of the AUSCAN pain and hand function scales were performed as secondary outcome tests in a second step by means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To achieve statistical significance, a one-sided p value of the SS-sum test < 0.025 and a two-sided p value of the corresponding ANCOVA test < 0.05 was needed.

Analysis of secondary outcomes

ANCOVA was used to compare clinical outcome parameters between treatment groups. As covariable, the corresponding baseline value (or where available the mean of screening and baseline value) was included in the ANCOVA models. A non-parametric ANCOVA was used to compare the radiographic endpoints. Probability plots were used to visualise radiographic outcomes.

Safety analyses

Adverse events (AE) were coded using MedDRA. The current MedDRA version available at the beginning of OA-TREAT (2nd half of 2013) was applied. Serious AE (SAE) terms are reported separately. AEs, SAEs that occurred before the application of the first study medication were not included in the analysis.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with inflammatory and erosive osteoarthritis of the hands: results of the OA-TREAT study-a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, investigator-initiated trial [^113KGwGV]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome criteria in the HERO study were pain and the AUSCAN pain score. In contrast, there were two outcome criteria in OA-TREAT: the AUSCAN score for pain, like in the HERO study, and the AUSCAN score for disability at week 52. But in summary all primary (and secondary) clinical outcome parameters showed no significantly different changes in both studies.

The most important difference between HERO and OA-TREAT was that the latter required the inclusion of at least one erosion. The (original) Kallman score describes erosions as a central collapse of the cortexand assesses them as present or not (1 or 0). A change of the erosion size cannot be recorded. Therefore, it contributes with a maximum score of 18 less than 10% of the overall score of 198 points, although the bone-destructive process is the most impressive change in EOA and the feature most likely to respond to treatment.

At the time this study was designed and approved, there were no published data for randomised controlled trial with HCQ for the treatment of hand OA. Our findings are in line with the two publications quoted above from the Netherlands and from the UK published in 2018, all showing the same result that HCQ is not superior to PBO for the treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of hand OA.

The hallmark of our study was to investigate the efficacy of HCQ in erosive OA of the hands. However, also here no treatment effect could be demonstrated clearly showing that HCQ — although usually well tolerated — is not effective to prevent structural damage in hand OA.

Weakness of this study:

Since OA is a slowly progressing disease, the observed time of 52 weeks for radiological progression may have been too short.

Results

We identified 1459 eligible patients with RA. After excluding 192 patients with prevalent CVD and 1 patient with medical record inconsistencies, 1266 patients were included in the final analysis, with 547 hydroxychloroquine users and 719 nonusers. Median observation time was 6.0 years (25th–75th percentiles 3.1–9.9 years). The median time for hydroxychloroquine exposure was 2.3 years (25th–75th percentiles 0.95–4.8 years). The median time for hydroxychloroquine onset after the RA diagnosis was 1.76 years (25th–75th percentiles 0.63–4.62 years). Patients were predominantly female (80%), 97% white, and 51% rheumatoid factor positive, with a mean age of 56.3 years (± 13.9 years). The average dose of hydroxychloroquine was 400 mg/day. 13 Patient characteristics according to hydroxychloroquine exposure are shown in Table 1.

METHODS

Study populations

The BeSt study

The BeSt study (BehandelStrategieën, Treatment Strategies, Trial registry ISRCTN32675862) is a multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised trial in DMARD-naïve RA patients (ACR 1987 classification criteria) with symptom duration ≤ 2 years. Patients were randomised to four treatment strategies: (1) sequential DMARD monotherapy, or (2) step-up combination therapy, both arms starting with methotrexate, or (3) initial combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine and high dose prednisone or with (4) methotrexate and infliximab. During 10 years' follow-up, based on three monthly assessments, treatment was intensified as long as Disease Activity Score (DAS) was > 2.4, but if DAS was ≤ 2.4 for ≥ 6 consecutive months, medication was tapered and, from t = 2.5 years, if DAS remained below 1.6, eventually stopped.

The IMPROVED study

The IMPROVED study (Trial registry ISRCTN11916566) is a multicentre, two-step randomised, assessor-blinded, clinical trial in DMARD-naïve early RA (2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, symptom duration ≤ 2 years) and undifferentiated arthritis (UA) patients, with 5 years' follow-up. Patients with UA were not included in the current analysis. All patients were treated with methotrexate and prednisone for 4 months. Patients not in remission (DAS < 1.6) after 4 months were randomised to two groups: (1) combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and (2) combination therapy with methotrexate and adalimumab. Based on four monthly assessments, treatment was intensified if DAS was ≥ 1.6, but tapered and stopped if DAS remained < 1.6.

The study protocols of both trials were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of each participating centre and all patients signed informed consent. A full description of BeSt and IMPROVED including a description of the trial protocol was previously published.

Patient and public involvement

Patient and public were not involved in design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of the research, initiation of both studies being at the time where this was not common practice.

### Effect of pre-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus using the openSAFELY platform [^112FR1dc]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Results

The study design is shown in figure 1. We identified 194 637 people who were first diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus at least 6 months before March 1, 2020 (ie, index date), for analysis (figure 2). Of these, 30 569 (15.7%) individuals received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the 6 months before the index date (median number of prescriptions 5, IQR 3–6), showing regular use. Although exposure was ascertained in the 6 months before the index date, 29 707 (97.2%) users received their first hydroxychloroquine prescription before this exposure window and 27 131 (88.8%) initiated 1 or more years before. Hydroxychloroquine users were younger (median age 63 years [IQR 53–72] for users, 66 years [55–76] for non-users) and more likely to be women (76.3% of users were women; 70.2% of non-users were women); other demographic characteristics between exposure groups were broadly similar (table). Hydroxychloroquine users were more likely to be taking other conventional synthetic DMARDs (51.5% vs 34.0%), oral corticosteroids (22.5% vs 16.3%), and NSAIDs (21.8% vs 16.3%) than non-users. Distributions of characteristics in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus populations are shown in the appendix (pp 5–8).

### Long-term safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: 5-year data from the phase 3, randomised SELECT-COMPARE study [^1156cbGQ]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

From week 26, initiation of, or change in, glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen/paracetamol were allowed at the investigator's discretion. From week 48, modification or initiation of csDMARDs was allowed at the investigator's discretion. csDMARDs were restricted to up to two of the following: MTX, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide, except for the combination of MTX and leflunomide, which was not permitted. Patients who completed the 48-week double-blind period could enter the LTE study to continue receiving upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or adalimumab 40 mg EOW (open-label after the last patient completed their week 48 visit).

Conclusion

In this study, we could confirm the data of recent publications showing that HCQ is not more effective than PBO for the treatment of (erosive) hand OA and therefore cannot be recommended as a disease modifying anti-OA drug.

Safety

Four hundred and eighty-one AE occurred during the study, 245 in the HCQ group and 236 in the PBO group. SAE (n = 22) occurred in both groups, although the PBO group presented numerically more events with 15 (68.2%) individuals compared with the HCQ group: 7 (31.8%). There were five hospitalisations in the HCQ group (knee operation, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, pneumonia, back pain, nausea), one life-threatening SAE (rash, generalised) and one death, which occurred at week 22 in the HCQ group due to hyperglycaemic coma, which does not correspond to the known opposite influence on the glycaemic profile of HCQ therapy. There were 11 hospitalisations in the PBO group (acute renal failure, OA, peripheral nerve operation, bunion operation, foot operation, positional vertigo, sleep apnoea syndrome, fall, atrial fibrillation, acquired dacryoadenitis, syncope), four SAEs were due to significant risk by investigator's judgement (age-related macular degeneration, colour blindness, maculopathy, overdose).

Out of the patients described above, five patients had their treatment discontinued (diabetic hyperglycaemic coma, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, generalised rash, syncope), one patient had to be discontinued due to study drug overdose. Six (mentioned before) had their treatment paused (14 days) because of pneumonia, and age-related macular degeneration, and less than 14 days because of acute renal failure, peripheral nerve operation, positional vertigo and atrial fibrillation). One (not mentioned before) had her treatment paused due to nausea (less than 14 days).

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^1113yBmJ]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Study period and outcomes

The study period started from Sept 1, 2000, and ended at the latest available date for all data sources in 2020. Follow-up for each of the cohorts started at an index date defined by the first dispensing or prescription of the target or comparator drug as described in the cohort definitions (appendix pp 5–8). Two periods were considered to define time at risk. For a short-term, intention-to-treat analysis, follow-up started 1 day after the index date and continued until the first of: outcome of interest, loss to follow-up, or 30 days after the index date to resemble the duration of COVID-19 treatment regimens. For a longer-term, on-treatment analysis, follow-up started 1 day after the index date and continued until the earliest of: outcome of interest, loss to follow-up, or discontinuation, with an added washout time of 14 days. Continued use of the same treatment was inferred by allowing up to 90-day gaps between dispensing or prescription records. Additional detail on the exposure cohorts is available in the appendix (pp 5–8).

Randomisation and intervention

Patients were randomised 1:1 to the treatment groups (either HCQ sulfate (200 mg/day, 200 and 400 mg every other day or 200 mg two times a day according to body weight) or matching PBO) according to a prespecified randomisation list which contained a consecutive number and the corresponding random code A or B. The patients were randomised according to the random code of next consecutive number. The pharmacy was unblinded and knew the random list with the codes A and B, however only their employees knew whether A or B referred to the active drug HCQ. The study drugs subsequently distributed were only labelled with patient numbers.

For patients weighing between 30 and 49 kg, one capsule of 200 mg HCQ or PBO was given. Patients with a body weight between 50 and 64 kg received one capsule with 200 mg HCQ or PBO as a single dose on day 1 and two capsules with 200 mg HCQ or PBO on day 2 in daily alternation. Patients with a body weight of ≥ 65 kg receive two capsules with 200 mg HCQ or PBO. PBO medication also consisted of capsules with capsule filler DAC NRF (99.5% mannitol, 0.5% high dispersible silicon dioxide) encapsulated in white opaque capsules packaged the same way as study drug (bottle)

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors versus combination intensive therapy with conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in established rheumatoid arthritis: TACIT non-inferiority randomised controlled trial [^114j4coo]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Overall evidence

In early rheumatoid arthritis three head-to-head trials have shown that combinations of disease modifying drugs achieve similar benefits to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors.RACAT, the only other trial in established active rheumatoid arthritis, showed that triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) achieved similar benefits to etanercept plus methotrexate in incomplete methotrexate responders treated for 12 months. Our trial and RACAT had comparable results, despite differences in patients and trial design. They highlight the role of head-to-head trials against effective conventional comparators to evaluate expensive treatments. Although toxicity remains a potential concern with combined disease modifying drugs because single trials like ours cannot fully assess risks, such combinations have been used for many years without evidence of major toxicity.

The current trail questions the status quo of use of biologics in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate does not achieve the required response. In these patients the clinical and economic evidence from our trial supports preferentially starting combinations of synthetic disease modifying drugs. We also believe that modernising biologic treatment regimens for rheumatoid arthritis requires more strategy trials. Increasing efficacy is important, and optimising cost effectiveness is crucial. Options include giving biologics to patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are likely to respond to specific agents, discontinuing biologics when patients do not fully respond, and tapering treatment when patients achieve sustained remissions.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Malaria

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial [see Microbiology (12.4)] and antirheumatic agent.

Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Chronic Discoid Lupus Erythematosus

The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus are not fully known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following oral administration, the whole blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine at steady state is dose proportional over a dose range from 200 mg daily to 400 mg daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients.

Absorption

Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmaxwas 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmaxwas 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmaxof 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax3.7 hours). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. Mean absolute oral bioavailability is 79% (SD: 12%) in fasting conditions.

Peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following a single dose of 155 mg intravenous infusion and from 2290 ng/mL to 4211 ng/mL (mean 3312 ng/mL) following a single dose of 310 mg intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received much scientific and public attention during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a leading therapeutic and prophylactic target. Commonly used for autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE) and inflammatory arthritis, HCQ was released for emergency use for COVID-19 due to its postulated antiviral efficacy in cellular studies. HCQ is currently being used in > 217 registered ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as of 12 June 2020. Results to date have been conflicting, with emerging data suggesting a lack of clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Case report literature suggests that chloroquine, the compound from which HCQ was derived, is associated with neurological and psychiatric side effects when used as an antimalarial treatment or prophylaxis. Similar potential side effects that have been described in the use of HCQ include neuropsychiatric side effects such as psychosis, depression and suicidal behaviour. Regulatory authorities have received reports of new-onset psychiatric symptoms associated with the increased use of high-dose HCQ during the pandemic. While chloroquine and HCQ have multiple mechanisms of action, a major action is the disruption of lysosomal functioning and autophagy. These actions to some degree mimic lysosomal storage diseases, disorders that are characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and neurodegeneration when manifested in the more common form in childhood, but also associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in adulthood.

New reports of serious side effects associated with HCQ used in COVID-19 are concerning to the rheumatology community, leading to confusion and anxiety for patients who are taking HCQ for autoimmune conditions. Given the previous reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms with HCQ, together with a plausible mechanism for such phenomena, we performed a review of the literature to determine what was already known about the potential risks of psychosis, depression and suicide associated with HCQ use from literature database inception until 14 May 2020 (Supplementary Appendix Section 1, available at Rheumatology online). Interrogation of adverse event registers have identified potential associations between HCQ and psychiatric disorders. Case reports and case series describing new-onset psychosis, bipolar disorder, seizures and depression associated with HCQ and chloroquine use for rheumatologic disorders and malaria prophylaxis can be found as early as 1964. No clinical trial or observational study was found that had investigated the incidence of new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with HCQ use.

### Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy: recommendations on monitoring [^117SAkSu]. RCOphth (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to monitoring of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to provide all patients with written information, in addition to oral communication, about hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and monitoring for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^113a5AJc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Low disease activity — DMARD-naive agent selection: Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA. Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate because it is less immunosuppressive, and the patient panel felt that many patients with low disease activity would prefer to avoid the side effects associated with methotrexate. The recommendations are conditional because methotrexate may be the preferred initial therapy in patients at the higher end of the low disease activity range and in those with poor prognostic factors (11). Methotrexate is recommended over leflunomide because of its greater dosing flexibility and lower cost.

### Hydroxychloroquine: from malaria to autoimmunity [^111ax3EZ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Quinine was first recognized as a potent antimalarial agent hundreds of years ago. Since then, the beneficial effects of quinine and its more advanced synthetic forms, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have been increasingly recognized in a myriad of other diseases in addition to malaria. In recent years, antimalarials were shown to have various immunomodulatory effects, and currently have an established role in the management of rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, skin diseases, and in the treatment of chronic Q fever. Lately, additional metabolic, cardiovascular, antithrombotic, and antineoplastic effects of antimalarials were shown. In this review, we discuss the known various immunomodulatory mechanisms of antimalarials and the current evidence for their beneficial effects in various diseases and in potential novel applications.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with inflammatory and erosive osteoarthritis of the hands: results of the OA-TREAT study-a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, investigator-initiated trial [^112eRKS4]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 220 patients screened, 76 were randomised to HCQ and 80 to PBO (figure 2). Distribution of participants per study site are shown in online supplemental figure 1. The other participants were either a screening failure (49 patients did not fulfil inclusion or fulfilled exclusion criteria) and 15 patients decided not to participate in the study (data not collected). Three patients were excluded from the analysis for not fulfilling inclusion criteria. Seventy-five patients were included in HCQ and 78 patients in PBO group. Groups were comparable, except for female gender (90.7% HCQ vs 76.9% PBO). Baseline characteristics are summarised in table 1. Only one participant was unblinded due to generalised rash. At the beginning there were many (minor) protocol violations, significant deviations resulted in three exclusions from analysis. The decision not to include data of these three patients was made before unblinding.

Trial flow. HCQ, hydroxychloroquine.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

The reliability of the radiographic scoring was only moderate. The intraclass correlation coefficients was 0.76 for the Kallman total score.

Even after taking minor mismatches of the AUSCAN scores of pain and function into account and of using a powerful multiple endpoint test no significant difference was found in the outcome of both scales between the treatment arms (table 2, p = 0.63).

Table 2
Primary outcome week 52

AUSCAN score for pain improved in both treatment groups, but there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.92). There was also some improvement in function (AUSCAN score function). However, again after taking minor mismatches at baseline into account and using ANCOVA method the outcome of the AUSCAN score for function did not differ significantly between both treatment arms (p = 0.36). Table 2 shows the results of the primary endpoint.

### COVID-19: a primer for the rheumatologist: management of patients and care settings [^1139fG6S]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are currently many unanswered questions surrounding the management of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and several 'rapid' guidelines have been released, although are subject to be updated and changed in the near future. The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent Findings

At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations.

Summary

Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks. Our recommendations and the guidelines we discuss here are based on C-level recommendations but help provide a framework for how to counsel our patients during this pandemic.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^115BKdre]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline — oral/systemic pharmacologic agents for osteoarthritis: Bisphosphonates are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and the preponderance of data shows no improvement in pain or functional outcomes. Glucosamine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA; the weight of the evidence indicates a lack of efficacy of glucosamine, though some patients exposed to glucosamine may show elevations in serum glucose levels. Chondroitin sulfate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA as are combination products that include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, but is conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA, with a single trial suggesting analgesic efficacy without evidence of harm in hand OA. Hydroxychloroquine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, with well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in erosive hand OA demonstrating no efficacy. Methotrexate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, and well-designed RCTs in erosive hand OA have demonstrated no efficacy.

### How aggressive should initial therapy for rheumatoid arthritis be? Factors associated with response to' non-aggressive' DMARD treatment and perspective from a 2-yr open label trial [^112HzqAH]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine what baseline factors might be associated with response to an initial mild treatment regimen in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Open label 2-yr study of 111 consecutive patients with early RA of duration less than 1 yr. None of the patients had previously received disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). All patients were assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) at enrollment, and could also take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prednisone. At any point during follow-up, patients not fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 criteria for improvement and/or who were taking prednisone > 10 mg/day were considered treatment failures and therapy changed to methotrexate (MTX), 7.5–20 mg/week. Clinical, laboratory and immunogenetic factors potentially predictive of treatment assignment at month 24 were evaluated.

Results

After 24 months of follow-up, a majority of patients (56/94) were either still on solo DMARD therapy with HCQ (n = 49) or off DMARD therapy with controlled/quiescent disease (n = 4), and 38 patients were taking MTX (including 11 in combination with other DMARDs). At month 24, all but 9 patients met ACR50 criteria for treatment response. Features present at enrollment which were predictors of MTX therapy at month 24 were high pain score, baseline rheumatoid factor titre > 1:40, higher number of swollen joints, and poor patient global assessment. The presence of HLA-C7xx at enrollment was also predictive of need for MTX therapy.

Conclusions

This study suggests that even milder treatment with HCQ is greatly beneficial in patients with early RA. There continue to be very few consistently reliable predictors of treatment needs in patients with this disease.

### Hydroxychloroquine and the risk of respiratory infections among RA patients [^112Y2fSg]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Key messages

The effect of hydroxychloroquine on the prevention of viral upper respiratory infections is not known.
This study showed that there is no benefit for prevention of upper respiratory infectionsfor patients with rheumatoid arthritis on hydroxychloroquine.
Given the speculation of the potential anti-viral effect of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV2, the finding of an absence of a protective effect for other respiratory infections suggests that it would be unlikely if the drug had a specific protective effect for this virus if the effect does not exist for other viral infections in this population.

### Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Sovuna) [^117VNVjV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer SOVUNA orally with food or milk. Do not crush the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

SOVUNA is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 23 kg because the lowest possible dose of 150 mg (half of the scored 300 mg tablet) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 23 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2,000 mg).
Pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 23 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2,000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8­aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with SOVUNA.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg, 300 mg or 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses

### A phase 2 trial of hydroxychloroquine in individuals at risk for rheumatoid arthritis [^113Vz9Mn]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with serum elevations of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are at increased risk for future rheumatoid arthritis (RA). No pharmacologic interventions have been approved for the prevention of RA in such 'at-risk' individuals. However, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used without supporting clinical trial evidence.

Methods

In this phase 2 randomized trial, individuals at-risk for RA with anti-CCP ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were assigned to receive HCQ or placebo for 12 months, with up to 24 months of post-drug follow-up. The primary outcome was the development of clinical RA, as defined in the protocol, at 36 months. Secondary outcomes included safety, development of inflammatory arthritis (IA), and participant-reported joint symptoms.

Results

Of 144 randomized participants, 71 were assigned to HCQ and 73 to placebo. In the modified intent-to-treat population, clinical RA occurred in 21 of 69 (30.4%) participants in the HCQ group and 24 of 73 (32.9%) in the placebo group. The risk of clinical RA at 36 months was 0.336 with HCQ and 0.394 with placebo (difference -0.058; 95% confidence interval -0.336 to 0.220; P = 0.52). Results for IA were similar. The occurrence and severity of joint symptoms were not observed to differ between groups. Adverse event incidence was similar between groups.

Conclusions

In this trial involving individuals with anti-CCP levels ≥ 2 times the ULN, 12 months of HCQ did not prevent the development of clinical RA at 36 months. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02603146.).

### "Warp speed" operations in the COVID-19 pandemic: moving too quickly? [^115wmKzg]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine: Moving Too Fast in Every Direction

Hydroxychloroquine was proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 prior to the pandemic's arrival on U.S. shores, based on proven action against another coronavirus in vitro. It has long been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved as a treatment for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus. Although not approved at the time as a treatment for COVID-19, it could be legally used "off-label", provided firm scientific rationale and sound medical evidence supported it. It has a complete supply chain in place and could be rapidly deployed. However, its toxicities include retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, seizures, liver failure, and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, it is a drug to be used with caution, particularly off-label, when risks are so significant and benefits are entirely unknown".

On March 16, 2020, a controversial French researcher associated with a significant prior publication scandal announced via an Internet video posting that he and his team had experienced success in treating 24 COVID-19 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. A few days later, President Trump touted the drug as a virtually risk-free cure to COVID, asking rhetorically, "what do you have to lose?". An almost immediate shortage of hydroxychloroquine resulted as the U.S. government stockpiled the drug, doctors began prescribing it off-label, and some patients began hoarding. Patients who needed hydroxychloroquine for its proven indications began to run out.

By March 28, hydroxychloroquine received conditional approval via the FDA's Emergency Use Pathway for treatment of COVID-19 infections, and just 3 weeks later, the FDA approved a phase III clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, sponsored by Novartis.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^1175vxE8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis — patients naive to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with moderate-to-high disease activity: Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, over biologic DMARD (bDMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) monotherapy, and over combination therapy of methotrexate plus a non–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD; methotrexate monotherapy is conditionally recommended over leflunomide, over dual or triple conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) therapy, and over combination of methotrexate plus a TNF inhibitor; initiation of csDMARD without short-term (< 3 months) glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with short-term glucocorticoids, and initiation of a csDMARD without longer-term (≥ 3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids.

### Early management of newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis by Canadian rheumatologists: a national, multicenter, retrospective cohort [^117FXLgN]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe early rheumatologic management for newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Canada.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of 339 randomly selected patients with RA diagnosed from 2001–2003 from 18 rheumatology practices was audited between 2005–2007.

Results

The most frequent initial disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) included hydroxychloroquine (55.5%) and methotrexate (40.1%). Initial therapy with multiple DMARD (15.6%) or single DMARD and corticosteroid combinations (30.7%) was infrequent. Formal assessment measures were noted infrequently, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire (34.6%) and Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (8.9%).

Conclusion

Initial pharmacotherapy is consistent with guidelines from the period. The infrequent reporting of multiple DMARD combinations and formal assessment measures has implications for current clinical management and warrants contemporary reassessment.

### Treating osteoarthritis pain: recent approaches using pharmacological therapies [^113mjqKy]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitative, painful condition with significant global burden. Pharmacological options have limited analgesic efficacy and their side-effects often restrict their use. Novel pharmacological options are needed to relieve patient symptoms and their consequent disease impact. A variety of pharmacological options have been investigated in treating OA, including existing therapies previously used for treating other arthritides (such as colchicine and hydroxychloroquine) and new therapies targeting pain (including monoclonal antibodies to nerve growth factor and intra-articular trans-capsaicin). Extended-release triamcinolone may offer more persisting analgesic effects compared to immediate-release preparations. While most studies have been unsuccessful, pharmacological therapies targeting peripheral nociceptive pathways appear promising.

### Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in hand osteoarthritis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115oxvMg]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the symptom-modifying effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in hand osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, patients with symptomatic hand OA received either HCQ 400 mg once a day or placebo during 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change of pain measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included decrease of pain at weeks 6 and 12 and change in Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 short form (AIMS2-SF) total scores.

Results

A total of 196 patients was included (placebo n = 98, HCQ n = 98). Mean ± SD age was 58.0 ± 7.6 years, and 86% were female. Baseline mean ± SD pain VAS was 44.9 ± 22.9 mm in the placebo group and 43.2 ± 22.3 mm in the HCQ group. At 24 weeks, change in pain VAS was not significantly different between both groups (imputed mean VAS 42.7 in the HCQ group versus 45.3 in the placebo group after 24 weeks), as was the case in pain VAS at weeks 6 and 12. Changes in AUSCAN total score and AIMS2-SF total score in both groups were similar between the groups. In total, 24 patients in the placebo group and 21 patients in the HCQ group reported ≥ 1 adverse event. In the HCQ group, 3 patients reported a severe allergic reaction. Fifteen patients withdrew from the study (5 placebo, 10 HCQ group) due to adverse events.

Conclusion

Treatment with HCQ at 24 weeks is not effective in reducing the symptoms of hand OA compared to placebo.

### Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy: recommendations on monitoring [^111tV2UD]. RCOphth (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to monitoring of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain automated visual field testing using either a 10–2 or 30–2 protocol, depending on the location of the structural abnormality, in patients with abnormalities on either spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence imaging should undergo. Consider obtaining visual field testing is likely at a separate visit if dilating eye drops are used for imaging, or in the setting of virtual clinics when images are reviewed after the patient visit.

### Are the current recommendations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine screening appropriate? [^116F2dEh]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

### A good response to early DMARD treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the first year predicts remission during follow up [^111QYKpB]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the frequency and duration of remission in the Utrecht rheumatoid arthritis cohort of patients followed since diagnosis, and the clinical and treatment characteristics of patients with remission v those without.

Methods

In 1990 the Utrecht rheumatoid arthritis cohort study group started a clinical trial in which patients with recent onset of rheumatoid arthritis (< 1 year) were randomised into four treatment groups: hydroxychloroquine (n = 169); intramuscular gold (n = 163); methotrexate (n = 166); and pyramid (n = 64). After two years, rheumatologists were allowed to prescribe any disease modifying antirheumatic drug. Remission was defined as: duration of morning stiffness ≤ 15 min, mean VAS pain ≤ 10 mm, Thompson joint score ≤ 10, and ESR ≤ 30 mm/h during at least six months. Cox regression analysis was used to determine baseline clinical, demographic, and treatment predictors of remission.

Results

Mean follow up duration was 62 months. Thirty six per cent achieved at least one period of remission. Median duration between diagnosis and the first remission period was 15 months for the intramuscular gold group, 18 months for the methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine groups, and 24 months for the pyramid group (NS). Predictors of remission were early response to initial treatment, less pain, rheumatoid factor negativity, and lower joint score at baseline.

Conclusions

After a mean follow up duration of 62 months, only 36% of the patients had fulfilled the remission criteria at least once. A good response to treatment during the first year seems to be independently associated with remission rather than initial treatment alone.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^1174i3vC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

We studied adult patients with SLE exposed to HCQ during the study period. Starting from the first visit with HCQ exposure, we identified patients receiving a lower dose or discontinuing HCQ at a follow‐up visit. We created 1 cohort to study patients from the time they lowered their HCQ dose: in that case, time zero was the date of the first reduction of HCQ dose. Patients were right censored if they discontinued HCQ completely (for any reason), as they then entered the cohort of patients who had discontinued HCQ (where the date of first HCQ discontinuation was defined as time zero). Patients who discontinued HCQ but started chloroquine right away were not included in the discontinuation cohort, as they were still taking an antimalarial. Patients were followed until the outcome of interest, end of the study period (February 2019), death, or loss to follow‐up (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at).

HCQ use was assumed to be constant for the entire 1‐year period between 2 adjacent visits; if, for example, a participant was taking HCQ at the first and second visits but not at the third visit, then they were considered an HCQ user during the period between the first and third visits (approximately 2 years) and a nonuser from the third visit on (unless HCQ was reintroduced, which qualified as part of our outcome of interest). However, in sensitivity analyses, we repeated the primary analysis, reassigning the date that the patients tapered/stopped HCQ (from the first study visit where the reduction/stop was originally recorded) to a date 6 months prior (i.e. half‐way between study visits).

### Hydroxychloroquine-chloroquine, QT-Prolongation, and major adverse cardiac events: a meta-analysis and scoping review [^11783qHQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Characteristics

Characteristics of the trials are summarized in Table 1. Of 41 trials, 31 investigated HCQ only, - 9 CQ only, - and 1 studied HCQ or CQ analyzed as a single arm. The mean sample size was 197 (SD = 26.7), mean 59.2% (SD = 26.6) female, and most trials (n = 38, 92.3%) reported mean or median ages of their participants to be younger than 65 years. Location of the trials was mainly North America (n = 14, 34.1%), Europe (n = 8, 19.5%), and Asia (n = 8 trials, 19.5%). The mean duration of follow-up was 26.1 weeks (SD = 39.5). Only 2 trials reported data on cardiac comorbidities at baseline. Thirteen trials (31.7%) listed at least one MACE as an outcome of interest in their methods and 8 trials (19.5%) examined QTP during the trial.

Table 1.
The Main Characteristics of Studies Included in the Meta-analysis.

Indications for the HCQ-CQ varied, the 3 most common being 15 trials for COVID-19 (n = 5844),-,-,-; 8 trials (n = 405) for patients with immune-mediated conditions, including systematic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren syndrome, and chronic spontaneous urticaria; and 6 trials (n = 802) for patients with rheumatic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, hand osteoarthritis, and knee osteoarthritis).-, Of the 41 RCTs, 34 (75.6%) used placebo as the comparator, -,-,-,-,- 5 used active standard of care medications as comparator, and 2 used nothing.

With respect to the selected domains of risk of bias in the included trials, 18 of 41 (43.9%) detailed appropriate allocation concealment procedures, but 22 of 41 (53.7%) failed to provide any details on allocation concealment. Most trials, 34 of 41 (82.9%), were at least double-blinded, and most (31/41, 75.6%) reported ≤ 15% loss to follow-up.

### Effect of pre-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus using the openSAFELY platform [^11144ubX]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), is indicated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it was suggested that hydroxychloroquine might have benefits for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has since been investigated in several clinical trials, and observational cohorts, with no evidence of therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of patients who are admitted to hospital with symptomatic COVID-19.

Evaluations of the effectiveness of pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 outcomes are scarce. One randomised, controlled trial examining hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis did not show significant benefit in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, although uncertainty in results could not exclude a possible benefit. Other trials of pre-exposure or post-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes are ongoing. In this large, population-based cohort study, we aimed to investigate whether ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use in the 6 months before March 1, 2020, considered as the start of the outbreak in England, UK (ie, analogous to pre-exposure prophylaxis) was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 mortality.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^115fUSpo]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

We have taken into consideration that patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking hydroxychloroquine might also have further autoimmune conditions such as SLE and therefore generate the potential for confounding by indication. We also investigated the incidence of hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, venous thromboembolic disease, and coronary arteriosclerosis before unblinding because of the established evidence that hydroxychloroquine improves survival in patients with SLE through antilipidaemic and antithrombotic mechanisms of action and reduces the development of diabetes in patients with SLE and those with rheumatoid arthritis. We ensured that, when investigating covariate balance after propensity score stratification and matching and before unblinding study results, we did not see unbalanced proportions of patients with a diagnosis of SLE between the groups. Negative control outcome analyses to assess for systematic error also did not identify any residual unobserved confounding in the propensity score analysis, adjusting for thousands of variables within the large-scale propensity score model. Although we have balanced for the coexistence of other conditions and medications through propensity scores, and we tested for residual unobserved confounding to ensure groups were balanced, no direct measure of severity of rheumatoid arthritis was drawn for patients at baseline. The cohort was made from patients who were new users of both hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and without medication use in the previous 365 days, but the potential for differences in baseline rheumatoid arthritis severity not recorded in routinely collected data is also a limitation of the study.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with inflammatory and erosive osteoarthritis of the hands: results of the OA-TREAT study-a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, investigator-initiated trial [^112qvCCQ]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition characterised by cartilage degradation and frequently erosive changes. Analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for symptomatic relief but are often poorly tolerated or contraindicated. Previous publications suggest hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a possible treatment for hand OA. The OA-TREAT study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HCQ in patients with inflammatory and erosive hand OA (EOA).

Methods

OA-TREAT was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial. Patients with inflammatory and EOA, according to the ACR criteria, with radiographically erosive disease were randomised 1:1 to HCQ 200–400 mg/day or PBO for 52 weeks (W52). Both groups received stable standard therapy. The primary endpoint was Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) for pain and hand disability at W52.

Results

75 patients were randomised to HCQ and 78 to PBO. At W52, mean AUSCAN pain was 26.7 in HCQ and 26.5 in PBO patients (p = 0.92). Hand disability measured by AUSCAN function (mean) was 48.1 in HCQ and 51.3 in PBO patients (p = 0.36). Changes in radiographic scores did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between treatment groups. There were 7 serious adverse events in the HCQ and 15 in the PBO group.

Conclusions

OA-TREAT is the first large randomised PBO controlled trial focusing on EOA. HCQ was no more effective than PBO for changes in pain, function and radiographic scores in the 52-week period. Overall safety findings were consistent with the known profile of HCQ.

### Window of opportunity in rheumatoid arthritis-definitions and supporting evidence: from old to new perspectives [^117KoCER]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Radiographic damage in RA

All nine RCTs included DMARD-naïve patients with a disease duration of < 2 years who fulfilled the classification criteria for RA (either the 1958 or the 1987 criteria) (table 1). Follow-up ranged between 6 months and 5 years. Different DMARDs (gold, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate [MTX] and prednisone) and different measures for radiographic damage (Larsen score, [modified] Sharp score, presence of erosions and erosion area) were used. A significant benefit for the early DMARD arm with regard to radiographic damage was shown in five RCTs, of which three were of high quality(two of these reported on the same trial). Three RCTs showed a statistically non-significant benefit for the early DMARD arm, and in one trial there was no effect. Since there were consistent findings in multiple high-quality RCTs (as well as in low-quality RCTs), there is strong evidence to conclude that early DMARD initiation results in better radiographic outcomes (figure 2). Importantly, earlier treatment resulted in lower absolute levels of joint damage and in lower progression rates (ie, less steep progression curves over time). Especially the latter finding of less rapid rise over time is suggestive of true disease modification. With respect to timelines, the early treatment group in these trials started DMARDs ~6–12 months earlier than the delayed group (table 1).

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^116xq2w2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis — DMARD discontinuation choices in combination therapy: Gradual discontinuation of sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine for patients taking triple therapy who wish to discontinue a DMARD. Gradual discontinuation of methotrexate is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients taking methotrexate plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD who wish to discontinue a DMARD. Thus, the continued use of the bDMARD or tsDMARD is more likely to maintain disease control than the continued use of methotrexate. The voting panel cautioned that many patients treated with certain monoclonal antibodies may require ongoing treatment with methotrexate to prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies.

Outcomes

Data were collected at seven time points (screening, baseline, week 13, 26, 39, 52 and at safety follow-up 4 weeks thereafter). Two coprimary endpoints were defined: Australian-Canadian OA Index (AUSCAN, German version) for pain and hand disability at week 52. Secondary outcomes included: radiographic progression from baseline to week 52 using the Kallman scoreand a modified version that was developed during this study, prior to the reading of the radiographs, to better capture erosive changes (for further details see online supplemental material figure S3); patient's global assessment of disease activity, patient's assessment of stiffness and physician's global assessment of disease activity comparison of pain, function, disability, quality of life, based on Health Assessment Questionnaire,36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Score for Assessment and Quantification of Chronic Rheumatic Affections of the Hands, from baseline to week 52; assessment and comparison of the inflammatory status using the following parameters: joint pain and joint swelling, night pain, morning stiffness, local erythema/redness, C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)-levels from baseline to week 26 and 52, comparison of the change of consumption of standard medication (NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors) within the last 7 days before each visit and safety.

Power calculation

Changes in the AUSCAN scales pain and hand function which correspond the effect sizes of 0.4 for pain and 0.25 for function were considered to be clinically relevant. Based on these assumptions a sample size of n = 101 per group is sufficient to achieve a power of 80% for the multiple endpoint test. Originally, it was planned to investigate a second endpoint, the radiological endpoint as a coprimary endpoint. However, this required much larger sample sizes (n = 255 per group), which was not achievable due to recruitment difficulties. Therefore, the study protocol was modified, and this endpoint was dropped as primary endpoint.

### Emerging preclinical evidence does not support broad use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients [^111k1nTi]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

As part of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Research and Development Blueprint response to the COVID-19 outbreak, an ad hoc working group of scientists was convened in February 2020 to encourage data sharing, to help avoid repetition of effort and to encourage reduction, refinement and replacement in animal experimentation. This WHO-led effort has resulted in an unprecedented level of international data sharing and collaboration across more than 80 countries. In the course of the 11th meeting of the WHO ad hoc working group on COVID-19 infection modelling (7th May 2020), several groups reported recent findings using different SARS-CoV-2 infection models with chloroquine (CQ) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).

HCQ is a less toxic form of CQ, as it carries an additional hydroxyl group. Both CQ and HCQ are used to prevent and treat malaria in endemic areas of the world. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, CQ and HCQ are also used to treat autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, these drugs caught the attention of the media after several reports indicated a possible association between CQ treatment and amelioration of EVD symptomatology. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, these drugs have again been brought into the spotlight as putative therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and several clinical trials have been conducted or are underway using them.

This Comment highlights five sets of important recent findings from several independent groups relating to the preclinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ, raising doubts about the putative benefit of these drugs to treat COVID-19.

Of the rheumatologists, 57 (89.1%) responded that they were aware of the 2016 AAO guidelines regarding HCQ use (table 5). The rheumatologists identified limited dosing options (35 rheumatologists, 54.7%), evidence not supporting the guidelines (37 rheumatologists, 57.8%), low patient adherence to HCQ (28 rheumatologists, 43.8%) and other issues (8 rheumatologists, 12.5%) as the foremost concerns with the AAO 2016 revised guidelines. There were 479 cases of HCQ retinal toxicity (1.05%) and 9 cases of HCQ-associated blindness (1.8 per 10 000 patients) reported.

### Rational use of new and existing disease-modifying agents in rheumatoid arthritis [^112iYrB8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Because of radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss and the inability to eliminate synovial proliferation with methotrexate, it became apparent that therapy for rheumatoid arthritis needed further advancement. Methotrexate is not a remission-inducing drug and may have dose-limiting toxicity. In the past 2 years, three new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been approved: leflunomide, etanercept, and infliximab. Each of these agents has demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in randomized, controlled studies. Because methotrexate had a dominant therapeutic role, the new drugs were also studied in combination with it. Other established DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, have also demonstrated efficacy when used together with methotrexate. The results of these combination studies clearly demonstrate that clinical responses can be meaningfully improved when new and existing DMARDs are added to methotrexate. Although toxicity remains a serious concern when powerful immune modulators and antimetabolites are used in combination, relatively few serious adverse events have been reported during 2-year treatment periods. It has also become apparent that combinations of new DMARDs and methotrexate virtually halt radiographic progression over 2 years. The new agents are expensive, but annual costs must be weighed against the personal and societal expense of joint arthroplasty, hospitalizations, disability, and diminished quality of life that accompanies poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The ultimate value of combination DMARD therapy with methotrexate will be determined by long-term data on safety, efficacy, and effects on radiographic deterioration of bone. Additional long-term observational data on the incidence of joint arthroplasty and disability will help to place the issue of societal costs in a better perspective. This will allow the value of aggressive treatment to be established with certainty.

### Risk of depression, suicide and psychosis with hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational network cohort study [^115mPGcY]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This large observational study shows that in routine healthcare treatment of RA, there is no association with the use of HCQ with acute psychosis, depression or suicide as compared with SSZ. These results are seen both in the short-term and long-term risk analyses. While an excess of psychiatric events have been reported during the COVID pandemic in those prescribed HCQ, this risk does not appear to be associated with HCQ prescribed in RA compared with those prescribed SSZ. This study uses data from three countries, with a variety of healthcare systems and modes of routine healthcare data included, enabling the study to produce more generalizable results.

Comparison with other studies

The bulk of the evidence prior to this study consisted of isolated case reports and case series, making it difficult to draw demographic comparisons with previous work. Sato et al. reported that neuropsychiatric adverse events found in the us Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system associated with chloroquine use were predominantly in females in the sixth decade of life. The increase in reporting of acute psychiatric disease during the COVID-19 pandemic may be multifactorial, with an increase in external stressors such as social isolation, financial uncertainty and increased misuse of drugs and alcohol. Considering that we find no association for HCQ use compared with SSZ with acute psychiatric outcomes in the RA population, evidence points towards external stressors being more likely involved in the aetiology of psychiatric events seen during this pandemic.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

This study is based on new users of HCQ for RA and therefore the results of this study are most directly relevant to the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects seen in the rheumatologic population. The regulatory warnings of possibly increased acute psychiatric events associated with HCQ warrant investigation in all available datasets to prevent harm in both rheumatology patients and those taking it for emergency use, especially as very few clinical trials include acute psychiatric outcomes. While the general population presenting with COVID-19 may differ from those with RA, within the context of emergency authorization or off-label use of HCQ, all available evidence must be taken into account when considering the risks associated.

Several considerations must be taken into account when interpreting these results. First, the doses used to treat RA are lower than those suggested in current clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore adverse events seen in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 may be greater if dose dependent, as is the case with cardiac adverse effects.

Methods

Study design

OA-TREAT (acronym for OA-Treat ment: a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with hydroxychloroquine in patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis of the hands) was a phase 3b investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, PBO-controlled trial. The study protocol (previously published), and its amendments (online supplemental material) were approved by the Berlin (lead site) Ethics Committee (LAGeSo) and by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN46445413) and the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT-Number 2011–001689–16). This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Patients were recruited from November 2013 to January 2017. After randomisation, they were followed up for 52 weeks (intervention period) with additional 4 weeks (safety follow-up period). All participants gave written informed consent before screening. Study design is shown in figure 1.

Study centres and participants

The study involved 47 centres in Germany. To be included, patients had to be between 40 and 80 years of age fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for inflammatory hand OAwith radiological signs of EOA in one or more finger joints confirmed by a central assessor on hand radiographs (not older than 6 months) and clinical symptoms of inflammatory

OA defined by pain on pressure and/or active joint swelling and/or redness and/or warmth in more than three finger joints despite taking analgesics and/or NSAIDs for more than 3 months. A pain score ≥ 4 on a numerical rating scale (0–10) and limitation in function defined as ≥ 26 using the Australian Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN)-function on a numerical rating scale (0–10) were required. Medication with NSAIDs/cyclo-oxygenase-2-inhibitors should be kept constant 2 weeks prior to study entry.

### Combination therapy for pain management in inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, other spondyloarthritis) [^117TVMSB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite optimal therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, many people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) continue to have persistent pain that may require additional therapy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and safety of combination pain therapy for people with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthritis (SpA)). We planned to assess differences in effects between patients on background disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy and patients on no background therapy in subgroup analyses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2008–10).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) assessing combination therapy (at least two drugs from the following classes: analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs and neuromodulators (antidepressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants)) compared with monotherapy, for adults with IA (RA, AS, PsA and other SpA). We speficically excluded studies that did not report pain or studies without a standardised pain scale as an outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials (total of 912 patients) met the inclusion criteria (22 in RA; one in a mixed population of RA and osteoarthritis); all except one were published before 1990. Most study populations were not taking DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide) and all studies were performed prior to the introduction of biologic therapies (e.g. etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab). All trials were at high risk of bias, heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, and we were only able to report a general description of results. The majority (18 studies, 78%) found no differences between the combination and monotherapy treatments they studied, while five (22%) reported conflicting results, favouring either the combination or monotherapy arms. From the 12 trials on NSAID + analgesic vs NSAID, nine reported no significant difference between the interventions, while three did: in two, the combination therapy achieved better pain control; and the third trial compared combination therapy with two different dosages of monotherapy (NSAID alone) and reported that a high dose phenylbutazone was superior to combination therapy (paracetamol + aspirin), which was superior to low dose phenylbutazone. From the five studies on the combination of two NSAIDS vs one NSAID, four reported no significant differences between interventions, and one reported significantly better pain control with combination therapy. The single trial comparing a combination of opioid + neuromodulator vs opioid reported better pain control with monotherapy. The remaining trials (NSAID + neuromodulator vs NSAID (3 trials); opioid + NSAID vs NSAID (1 trial); and opioid + analgesic vs analgesic (1 trial)) found no significant difference between combination therapy and monotherapy. Information regarding withdrawals due to inadequate analgesia and safety was incompletely reported, but in general there were no differences between combination therapy and monotherapy. No data were available that addressed the value of combination pain therapy or monotherapy for people with IA who have optimal disease suppression. There were no studies that included patients with AS, PsA or SpA.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on 23 trials, all at high risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to establish the value of combination therapy over monotherapy for people with IA. Importantly, there are no studies addressing the value of combination therapy for patients with IA who have persistent pain despite optimal disease suppression. Well designed trials are needed to address this question.

### Combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis [^116cWiGE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

It has become clear that early suppression of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is important in preventing progressive joint destruction and functional decline. To achieve this goal, many rheumatologists today advocate a more aggressive approach, using combinations of classic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-often including methotrexate-or new drugs. During the last 2 years, the combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone has been demonstrated to be more beneficial than monotherapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the superior efficacy of the combination of new tumor necrosis factor-alpha blocking agents plus methotrexate to methotrexate alone in patients with chronic disease is very promising. Most studies of combination therapy focus on the efficacy of a combination compared with monotherapy, rather than on the efficacy of a treatment strategy. Although these studies of combination therapy provide useful information about the possible synergistic action of combinations of drugs, many questions remain unanswered, and studies evaluating different treatment strategies are needed before a new approach can be suggested.

### Shining a light on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 [^111jvjhy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Until data from randomized controlled trials are available, we suggest caution utilizing hydroxychloroquine off label for patients with COVID-19. Reports of overdoses are now occurring. There are currently no evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis, but unfortunately these data are being extrapolated to the indication potentially resulting in drug shortages for patients with rheumatic diseases who require this medication. Furthermore, we caution medical and world leaders against premature comments of treatment efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such comments may exacerbate shortages for patients reliant on these medications or cause harm due to medication side effects and overdose.

Concerning the secondary endpoints, there was no statistically significant difference between HCQ and PBO, except for ESR (p < 0.01) in favour of HCQ and morning stiffness (p = 0.001) in favour of PBO at week 52 (table 3). At week 26, there was no meaningful change in any parameter (online supplemental tables S1 and S2).

Table 3
Secondary outcome week 52

Also, regarding radiological progression (Kallman total score, erosions, osteophytes, joint space narrowing, lateral deformity, subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cysts) after 52 weeks of treatment there was no statistically significant difference between HCQ and PBO (table 4, figures 3 and 4, online supplemental table S3 and figure S2).

Table 5 summarises the changes in NSAID/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor consumption. A total of 15 patients had an increase in the equivalent NSAID/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor dose between baseline and week 52 with 7 individuals in the HCQ versus 8 in the PBO group. Nine patients in total had ≥ 50% NSAID/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor increase (HCQ: n = 4 vs PBO: n = 5). Therefore, it was concluded that the administration of NSAIDs/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors had no statistical impact on the results of the study. At week 52, 57 patients had a decrease in NSAID/cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor administration, 41 took the same dose, and in 40 patients no data are available because they stopped the study prematurely.

### Possibilities for personalised medicine in rheumatoid arthritis: hype or hope [^112iPoe5]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Also in RA− strategy trials comparing different initial treatment strategies are sparse. Previously, Choi et al showed that treatment response in RA− was better compared with patients with RA+ when given similar DMARD therapy. Another trial showed that combination DMARD therapy was only necessary to prevent radiological progression in RA+. Finally, a meta-analysis showed that patients with RA+ respond better to rituximab than patients with RA−. However, none of these studies compared different treatment strategies in RA−, but recently such a trial was published. This study showed a similar efficacy, including disease activity, functional ability and radiological progression, between initial hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, while glucocorticoids were not indicated for this phenotype. However, hydroxychloroquine was better tolerated than methotrexate.

To summarise, early (rheumatoid) arthritis can be subdivided into three clinical phenotypes, namely UA, RA− and RA+, because of a distinct pathophysiology and different prognosis. These features are prerequisites for personalised treatment, but more importantly growing evidence is showing that UA and RA− can be treated with less intensive treatment compared with RA+.

### Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in early arthritis [^113jAn9R]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Finnish early RA cohorts are used as examples of how early and active treatment strategies have improved over time with increasing variety of available DMARDs. Therapy goals of early RA include remission to prevent severe long-term outcomes of RA. Remission can be achieved in a third of patients with early RA using a combination of conventional DMARDs, including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone. Of patients with early RA, 20% to 30% do not improve enough with conventional treatments and should be identified at early phases to consider institution of biologic agents.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a frequently used DMARD (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug) therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory conditions. It plays an important role in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue disorders. In RA, it is used mostly in patients with a milder disease course and as a coadjuvant therapy to other DMARDs like methotrexate. Originally, it was used in malaria prevention and treatment.

In 1995 a retrospective study with eight patients with EOA refractory to treatment with NSAIDs showed an effect on pain, synovitis and morning stiffness in six of the eight patients. Other small studies with 7 and 15 patients reported a beneficial effect of HCQ in EOA, whereas another study comparing the use of HCQ and clodronate in patients with EOA could not confirm an effect. In 2018, the HERO (Hydroxychloroquine Effectiveness in Reducing symptoms of Osteoarthritis) Study with 248 patients from the UK showed no significant difference in pain between patients treated with HCQ and placebo (PBO) after 6 months. Also, in 2018 a randomised, double-blind, PBO-controlled trial with HCQ in 196 patients with symptomatic hand OA in the Netherlands found no effect on hand OA symptoms. These results were not available at the beginning of our trial. Nevertheless, OA-TREAT provides important confirmatory and new data, since it focused exclusively on hand EOA and included measurement of radiographic progression in this subgroup of patients that is especially at risk for structural damage.

### Hydroxychloroquine and risk of diabetes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^114jhXiF]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hydroxychloroquine, a commonly used antirheumatic medication, has hypoglycemic effects and may reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus.

Objective

To determine the association between hydroxychloroquine use and the incidence of self-reported diabetes in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A prospective, multicenter observational study of 4905 adults with rheumatoid arthritis (1808 had taken hydroxychloroquine and 3097 had never taken hydroxychloroquine) and no diagnosis or treatment for diabetes in outpatient university-based and community-based rheumatology practices with 21.5 years of follow-up (January 1983 through July 2004).

Main Outcome Measures

Diabetes by self-report of diagnosis or hypoglycemic medication use.

Results

During the observation period, incident diabetes was reported by 54 patients who had taken hydroxychloroquine and by 171 patients who had never taken hydroxychloroquine, with incidence rates of 5.2 per 1000 patient-years of observation compared with 8.9 per 1000 patient-years of observation, respectively (P < .001). In time-varying multivariable analysis with adjustments for possible confounding factors, the hazard ratio for incident diabetes among patients who had taken hydroxychloroquine was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.92) compared with those who had not taken hydroxychloroquine. In Poisson regression, the risk of incident diabetes was significantly reduced with increased duration of hydroxychloroquine use (P < .001 for trend); among those taking hydroxychloroquine for more than 4 years (n = 384), the adjusted relative risk of developing diabetes was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.50; P < .001), compared with those who had not taken hydroxychloroquine.

Conclusion

Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes.

### Risk of depression, suicide and psychosis with hydroxychloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational network cohort study [^111xNeTd]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Meaning of the study

Exponential growth in research into the best treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is generating rapidly evolving evidence for the relative efficacy of pharmaceutical agents. For the rheumatologic community, media attention previously surrounded HCQ as a strong frontrunner in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment. The results of the RECOVERY trial, showing that dexamethasone reduced mortality in intensive care patients, have now overtaken HCQ as the leading rheumatologic drug for the pandemic, but the concerns regarding HCQ safety remain for those who take the drug for conventional indications. Cardiovascular safety and reports that it might lack efficacy for both treatment and prophylaxis have halted major HCQ clinical trials. The identification of acute psychiatric events associated with HCQ use has raised the need to clarify the risk within general rheumatologic use. Our study identifies no increased risk in RA patients when compared with SSZ and provides evidence to users and clinicians alike that the reports presented during the pandemic are likely to be related to further causes aside from HCQ.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^116yPYNs]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine, which is most commonly used as the first-line treatment in patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), has gained extensive media coverage as a potential antiviral agent for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Unfortunately, the exponential generation of research into hydroxychloroquine has led to confusion in the rheumatological community regarding the safety implications of hydroxychloroquine within its traditional uses.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, publicity focused on a study from Franceshowing faster recovery and reduction in viral load in patients treated with high-dose hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, compared with patients receiving standard treatment available at the time. This report led to widespread use of high-dose hydroxychloroquine either alone or with azithromycin. Subsequently, serious cardiac adverse events associated with QT segment prolongation that could lead to potentially lethal arrhythmia and cardiovascular-related death were identified in patients taking hydroxychloroquine in several health-care centres in the USA and Brazil. Because of these reports of increased risk, emergency authorisation of hydroxychloroquine by medicines regulators was retracted, statements cautioning against hydroxychloroquine use were released, and randomised trials were stopped.,

European guidelines for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis contain little high-level evidence for the safety of hydroxychloroquine, and most systematic reviews of rheumatoid arthritis treatments have focused on biological therapies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence for hydroxychloroquine safety was largely found in retrospective case series and case reports, or within pharmaceutical adverse events registers. Azithromycin and macrolides in general are also known to induce cardiotoxicity and to interact with other drugs that prolong QTc.

The combination of minimal large-scale hydroxychloroquine safety studies before this pandemic, and the extensive research suggesting risks associated with hydroxychloroquine use that has been produced during 2020 is of great concern to both patients and clinicians. We therefore aimed to assess the safety of hydroxychloroquine alone compared with sulfasalazine and of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine in combination with amoxicillin), in part to provide clarity for patients taking hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis.

### Hydroxychloroquine use and risk of CKD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^117U7Upk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, large-scale studies examining the long-term effects of hydroxychloroquine on the development of kidney disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are lacking. We aimed to assess the long-term association of hydroxychloroquine use with the risk of developing CKD in this population.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted an observational cohort study for patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis who were enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2013. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to analyze the association of hydroxychloroquine use with incident CKD.

Results

A total of 2619 patients, including 1212 hydroxychloroquine users and 1407 hydroxychloroquine nonusers, were analyzed. Incident CKD was reported in 48 of 1212 hydroxychloroquine users and 121 of 1407 hydroxychloroquine nonusers. The incidence rate of CKD was lower in hydroxychloroquine users than in hydroxychloroquine nonusers (10.3 versus 13.8 per 1000 person-years). After multivariable adjustment, hydroxychloroquine users still had a lower risk of incident CKD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.90; P = 0.01) than hydroxychloroquine nonusers. The lower risk of subsequent CKD development was dose dependent and consistent across subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine use in patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a significantly lower risk of incident CKD compared with in nonusers.

### Toxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine following therapeutic use or overdose [^1132adkq]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While chloroquine, a derivative of quinine, has been used as an antimalarial for 70years, hydroxychloroquine is now used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose.

Objective

We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose.

Methods

Medline (via OVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: ("Chloroquine/" or "Hydroxychloroquine/") AND ("Adverse Drug Event/" or "Toxicities, Drug/" or "Toxic.mp". or "Toxicity.mp". or "Overdose.mp".). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: ("Chloroquine" or "Hydroxychloroquine") AND ("Coronavirus" or "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2"). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of the https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ website. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining "chloroquine" and "hydroxychloroquine" with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles.

Toxicity With Short-Term Use

Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances. Glucose abnormalities: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use. Cardiotoxicity: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies. Dermatologic: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy. Neuropsychiatric: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24–48h of drug initiation. Other toxicities: Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group.

Toxicity With Long-Term Use

Retinopathy: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage. Cardiotoxicity: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders. Neurotoxicity: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported.

Toxicity In Overdose

Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur.

Conclusions

Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8- aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^117UQQbN]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the largest ever analysis of the safety of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin worldwide, examining more than 950 000 hydroxychloroquine and more than 300 000 hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin users, respectively. Short-term (up to 30 days) hydroxychloroquine treatment among patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed no excess risk of any of the considered severe adverse events compared with sulfasalazine. Short-term treatment is also proposed for COVID-19 therapy and might be informed by the experience of treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. By comparison, long-term hydroxychloroquine therapy appears to be associated with a relative risk increase in cardiovascular-related mortality compared with a roughly equivalent rheumatoid arthritis therapy (sulfasalazine; calibrated HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.12–2.44]). Perhaps more worryingly, compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin, significant risks were identified for the combination of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin even in the short term: increased risk of angina or chest pain (calibrated HR 1.15 [95% CI 1.05–1.26]) and heart failure (1.22 [1.02–1.45]), and a doubled risk of cardiovascular mortality in the first month of treatment (2.19 [1.22–3.94]).

A systematic review of reports on the toxicity of hydroxychloroquine has identified cardiac side-effects, including conduction disorders, heart failure, and ventricular hypertrophy resulting in 12.9% irreversible damage and 30% mortality. Furthermore, interrogation of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database identified 357 adverse events reported for chloroquine.20% of the events reported were cardiac and included arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, or heart failure.

Our results suggest that long-term use of hydroxychloroquine leads to increased cardiovascular mortality, which might relate to cumulative effects of hydroxychloroquine leading to an increased risk of QT lengthening and potentially to sudden undetected torsade-de-pointes and cardiovascular death. Although long-term treatment with hydroxychloroquine is not expected for the management of COVID-19, some research suggests that the higher doses prescribed for COVID-19 than for rheumatoid arthritis can, even in the short term, lead to equivalent side-effects given the long half-life of hydroxychloroquine.

### Long-term hydroxychloroquine use in patients with rheumatic conditions and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study [^113GyntX]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine is one of several agents being evaluated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Findings

Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [0.3%] of 10703 vs 78 [0.4%] of 21406; odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.52–1.20, p = 0.27). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. For all patients in the study, overall mortality was lower in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the group of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89, p = 0.0031). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, receipt of hydroxychloroquine was not associated with the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.51–1.42).

Interpretation

Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a preventive effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large group of patients with rheumatological conditions.

### Hydroxychloroquine effectiveness in reducing symptoms of hand osteoarthritis: a randomized trial [^115XKLQ3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Synovitis is believed to play a role in producing symptoms in persons with hand osteoarthritis, but data on slow-acting anti-inflammatory treatments are sparse.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo as an analgesic treatment of hand osteoarthritis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 12-month follow-up. (ISRCTN registry number: ISRCTN91859104).

Setting

13 primary and secondary care centers in England.

Participants

Of 316 patients screened, 248 participants (82% women; mean age, 62.7 years) with symptomatic (pain ≥ 4 on a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale) and radiographic hand osteoarthritis were randomly assigned and 210 (84.7%) completed the 6-month primary end point.

Intervention

Hydroxychloroquine (200 to 400 mg) or placebo (1:1) for 12 months with ongoing usual care.

Measurements

The primary end point was average hand pain during the previous 2 weeks (on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale [NRS]) at 6 months. Secondary end points included self-reported pain and function, grip strength, quality of life, radiographic structural change, and adverse events. Baseline ultrasonography was done.

Results

At 6 months, mean hand pain was 5.49 points in the placebo group and 5.66 points in the hydroxychloroquine group, with a treatment difference of -0.16 point (95% CI, -0.73 to 0.40 point) (P = 0.57). Results were robust to adjustments for adherence, missing data, and use of rescue medication. No significant treatment differences existed at 3, 6, or 12 months for any secondary outcomes. The percentage of participants with at least 1 joint with synovitis was 94% (134 of 143) on grayscale ultrasonography and 59% on power Doppler. Baseline structural damage or synovitis did not affect treatment response. Fifteen serious adverse events were reported (7 in the hydroxychloroquine group [3 defined as possibly related] and 8 in the placebo group).

Limitation

Hydroxychloroquine dosage restrictions may have reduced efficacy.

Conclusion

Hydroxychloroquine was no more effective than placebo for pain relief in patients with moderate to severe hand pain and radiographic osteoarthritis.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^114GGaCf]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has received much negative publicity for adverse events associated with its authorisation for emergency use to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I 2 value was less than 0.4.

Findings

The study included 956374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310350 users of sulfasalazine, 323122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.12–2.44]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2.19 [95% CI 1.22–3.95]), chest pain or angina (1.15 [1.05–1.26]), and heart failure (1.22 [1.02–1.45]).

Interpretation

Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^111Cm6cg]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies were used as recommended by methodological guidelinesfor observational drug safety research to estimate the safety of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with macrolide antibiotics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine and amoxicillin were chosen as active comparators because they have similar indications as the target treatments (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, respectively). Participants were included if they had a history of rheumatoid arthritis (a condition occurrence or observation indicating rheumatoid arthritis any time before or on the same day as therapy initiation), were aged 18 years or older at the index event, and had at least 365 days of continuous observation time before the index event.

As a secondary analysis, a self-controlled case series was used to estimate the safety of hydroxychloroquine in the wider population, including patients without rheumatoid arthritis. For this analysis, all prevalent users of hydroxychloroquine were included, regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication.

All data partners received approval or waiver from their institutional review boards in accordance with their institutional governance guidelines. The full study protocol is available online.

### Are poor prognostic factors a realistic basis for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Lessons from the IMPROVED study [^114A4Fah]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

In the IMPROVED study, 479 patients with RA (2010 criteria) started treatment with MTX and prednisone bridging. Patients not in early remission (Disease Activity Score (DAS) ≥ 1.6) after 4 months were randomised to Methotrexate (MTX)+Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)+ Sulfasalazine (SSZ) + continued low-dose prednisone (arm 1) or to MTX+adalimumab (arm 2). In these patients, we performed a post hoc analysis, aiming to compare the clinical response on either csDMARD combination or bDMARD therapy in relation to the presence or absence of PPFs.

We found that 98–99% of patients, depending on the definition of 'high swollen joint count' (> 4 or > 10), had PPFs. The presence of each PPF was equally distributed among randomisation arms (figure 1A, B). The presence of antibodies and high CRP/ESR were the most frequent PPFs (present in 366 (76%) and 390 (81%) patients, respectively). Only 10 patients (2%) had no PPFs at all in the main analysis (with 'high SJC' defined as > 10) and only 5 (1%) in the sensitivity analysis (with SJC > 4). Of these, 2/10 and 2/5 patients did not achieve early remission and were randomised to the two treatment arms. Thus, a comparison of treatment response in patients without PPFs was unrealistic. In the PPF-positive patients in both randomisation arms, we found similar outcomes for mean DAS, mean HAQ and damage progression over time.

Figure 1
(A and B) Erosions: presence of baseline erosions, DAS > 2.4: moderate/high DAS after 4 months of treatment with MTX+prednisone bridging, CRP/ESR: high C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate at baseline, SJC-4: presence of > 4 swollen joints at baseline, SJC-10: presence of > 10 swollen joints at baseline, antibodies: presence of ACPA or RF at baseline. Patients can be present in multiple categories; numbers do not add up to 479 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in (A). ACPA, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies; CRP, C reactive protein; DAS, disease activity score; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; MTX, methotrexate; RF, rheumatoid factor; SJC, swollen joint count.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^117BCmRr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

### Addition of infliximab compared with addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine to methotrexate in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (swefot trial): 1-year results of a randomised trial [^1155iEe7]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

New treatment strategies for early rheumatoid arthritis are evolving rapidly. We aimed to compare addition of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) with addition of a tumour necrosis factor antagonist (infliximab) to methotrexate in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

We undertook a randomised trial in 15 rheumatology units in Sweden. We enrolled patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (symptom duration < 1 year) and administered methotrexate (up to 20 mg per week). After 3–4 months, those who had not achieved low disease activity but who could tolerate methotrexate were randomly allocated by computer addition of either sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine or infliximab. Primary outcome was achievement of a good response according to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at 12 months. Patients were followed up to 24 months; here, we present findings at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and we used non-responder imputation. The Swefot (Swedish Pharmacotherapy) study is registered in the WHO database at the Karolinska University Hospital, number CT20080004.

Findings

487 patients were initially enrolled. Of 258 who had not achieved low disease activity with methotrexate, 130 were allocated sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine and 128 were assigned infliximab. 32 of 130 (25%) patients allocated sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine achieved the primary outcome compared with 50 of 128 (39%) assigned infliximab (risk ratio 1.59 [95% CI 1.10–2.30], p = 0.0160). Adverse events were balanced fairly well between the two groups and accorded with known adverse events of the drugs used. No deaths occurred in either group.

Interpretation

In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate treatment failed, addition of a tumour necrosis factor antagonist to methotrexate monotherapy is clinically superior to addition of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

### Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa [^113C3C4A]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

For more advanced disease (Hurley stage II and III), the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor adalimumab is the only Food and Drug Administration–approved biologic treatment option for HS. It has shown promise in severe disease; however, only ∼50% of patients achieved a clinical response at 12 weeks, and this clinical response declined over time. Additionally, newer biologic therapies have been used in small numbers of patients with HS, with variable results. Although biologic treatments can have a tremendous benefit, they come with a high cost, and this can limit accessibility.

Hydroxychloroquine, initially developed as an antimalarial, has been used successfully for > 70 years in the treatment of autoimmune disease. Its mechanism of action is still poorly understood; however, it has been shown to have many varied immunomodulatory properties. Evidence has suggested that hydroxychloroquine has an effect on inflammatory disease through decreasing levels of TNF-αand Th-17 cytokines (including IL-6, IL-17, and IL-22). Additionally, studies have shown a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine on lipid metabolism and glucose. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (which, similar to HS, has an independent association with cardiovascular disease) who were treated with hydroxychloroquine had an overall decreased incidence of cardiovascular events. Hydroxychloroquine has a relatively benign safety profile, with retinopathy being the most concerning long-term side effect. The retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine is reversible if identified early, and standard protocols for the use of this medication include yearly ophthalmologic examinations.

The objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment option for HS.

### Therapies for active rheumatoid arthritis after methotrexate failure [^113ULYMb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Few blinded trials have compared conventional therapy consisting of a combination of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs with biologic agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have active disease despite treatment with methotrexate — a common scenario in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

We conducted a 48-week, double-blind, noninferiority trial in which we randomly assigned 353 participants with rheumatoid arthritis who had active disease despite methotrexate therapy to a triple regimen of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) or etanercept plus methotrexate. Patients who did not have an improvement at 24 weeks according to a prespecified threshold were switched in a blinded fashion to the other therapy. The primary outcome was improvement in the Disease Activity Score for 28-joint counts (DAS28, with scores ranging from 2 to 10 and higher scores indicating more disease activity) at week 48.

Results

Both groups had significant improvement over the course of the first 24 weeks (P = 0.001 for the comparison with baseline). A total of 27% of participants in each group required a switch in treatment at 24 weeks. Participants in both groups who switched therapies had improvement after switching (P < 0.001), and the response after switching did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.08). The change between baseline and 48 weeks in the DAS28 was similar in the two groups (-2.1 with triple therapy and -2.3 with etanercept and methotrexate, P = 0.26); triple therapy was noninferior to etanercept and methotrexate, since the 95% upper confidence limit of 0.41 for the difference in change in DAS28 was below the margin for noninferiority of 0.6 (P = 0.002). There were no significant between-group differences in secondary outcomes, including radiographic progression, pain, and health-related quality of life, or in major adverse events associated with the medications.

Conclusions

With respect to clinical benefit, triple therapy, with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine added to methotrexate, was noninferior to etanercept plus methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had active disease despite methotrexate therapy.

### Clinical and structural efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review [^114oY7vw]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) improves metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its efficacy appears to be moderate as compared to placebo. The aim of our study was to assess the current literature on the clinical and structural efficacy of HCQ in the joints of patients with RA.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, and the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual scientific meeting abstracts for studies available up to November 2017 comparing the efficacy of HCQ in patients with RA, in monotherapy or combined with other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). Data were extracted by 1 investigator and independently checked by a different investigator.

Results

The literature search revealed 197 articles and abstracts of potential interest, and 11 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. The clinical and structural efficacy of HCQ was similar to or lower than that for methotrexate or sulfasalazine in monotherapy. HCQ combined with other DMARDs could increase the clinical efficacy.

Conclusion

In addition to its metabolic benefit, combining HCQ with other DMARDs could provide some clinical improvement in patients with RA and inadequate response to previous csDMARDs.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with inflammatory and erosive osteoarthritis of the hands: results of the OA-TREAT study-a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, investigator-initiated trial [^1139P56r]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

OA-TREAT is the first randomised PBO controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of HCQ compared with PBO focusing exclusively on severe and refractory inflammatory erosive OA of the hands, defined as persisting symptoms of digital inflammatory OA (pressure pain of the joints and/or florid joint swelling and/or redness and/or warmth) with more than three finger joints for more than 3 months despite taking analgesics and NSAIDs.

There was no difference in both coprimary endpoints AUSCAN pain and AUSCAN function between treatment with HCQ and PBO.

In the randomised, double blind, PBO-controlled Dutch study published in 2018. Ninety-eight patients in each group with painful hand OA fulfilling ACR criteria for hand OA and confirmed by radiographic evidence of OA at least grade 1 in two joints of the hands according to the Kellgren and Lawrence Classification were treated with HCQ 400 mg/day or PBO over 24 weeks. No superior effect of HCQ was found to PBO in reducing pain as measured on a visual pain scale. Also, no effect could be observed in change of AUSCAN and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 Short Form after 24 weeks of treatment.

In the HERO study from the UK, also published in 2018, 124 patients in each group were treated with HCQ or PBO over 1 year. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of HERO were comparable to those of the OA-TREAT trial. Both trials required a clinical diagnosis of hand OA confirmed by ACR criteria and radiographic evidence of OA as well as a pain level of > 4 on a scale of 0–10. Use of analgetic medication should be kept constant for 4 weeks (HERO) versus 2 weeks (OA-TREAT) before baseline and could be used as needed during both trials. In the HERO Study HCQ dose was adjusted according to the actual ideal body weight of the patient whereas it remained constant based on initial body weight in OA-TREAT. It is worthwhile to mention that some important baseline parameters are very similar in both studies: for example, the (original) baseline Kallman score was 42.5 for HCQ and 43.8 for PBO in OA-TREAT and 42.7 and 43.9 in HERO and mean visual analogue scale pain was 6.3 and 6.1 versus 6.9 and 6.8, whereas others like AUSCAN pain and AUSCAN function were about 2.5 times higher in our study.

### Mechanisms of action of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine: implications for rheumatology [^116rkQ9f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Despite widespread clinical use of antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs are still emerging. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are weak bases and have a characteristic 'deep' volume of distribution and a half-life of around 50 days. These drugs interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy, interact with membrane stability and alter signalling pathways and transcriptional activity, which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain co-stimulatory molecules. These modes of action, together with the drug's chemical properties, might explain the clinical efficacy and well-known adverse effects (such as retinopathy) of these drugs. The unknown dose-response relationships of these drugs and the lack of definitions of the minimum dose needed for clinical efficacy and what doses are toxic pose challenges to clinical practice. Further challenges include patient non-adherence and possible context-dependent variations in blood drug levels. Available mechanistic data give insights into the immunomodulatory potency of hydroxychloroquine and provide the rationale to search for more potent and/or selective inhibitors.

### Hydroxychloroquine and the risk of respiratory infections among RA patients [^113Szzzb]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

It is clear that this observational study should not be considered definitive as only an appropriately powered, prospective intervention of hydroxychloroquine in a controlled trial of patients with newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection can provide reliable evidence. HCQ does not appear to decrease the risk of viral infections when compared to csDMARDs.

In summary, we found little evidence in a large number of patients with RA on HCQ that there was a diminution in respiratory infections including URIs, bronchitis or pneumonia. It is acknowledged that this experience may not necessarily be relevant to the effect of HCQ on SARS-CoV-2. The effects of HCQ in patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 infection should be studied in RCTs and later population-based fashion to determine if the in vitro and small blinded studies are indicative of its clinical effects in this infection. Understanding how HCQ contributes to risk in other viral infections, and respiratory infections in general, is useful as it will help inform these future investigations. It should be noted that the evidence we describe would not support the diversion of limited supplies of HCQ to the adjunctive treatment of viral syndromes in general given the reports of the challenges that many patients with both RA and SLE are having in accessing this drug needed for their routine care and well-being.
