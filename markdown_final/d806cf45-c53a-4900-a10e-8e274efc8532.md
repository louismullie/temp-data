## Question

Is Ozempic preferable over Mounjaro in terms of CV and CKD benefits?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Ozempic (semaglutide) is preferable to Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in terms of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease benefits, and to transform the reasoning into a clinical, reference-aware flow. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise clinical question and scope. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for semaglutide's cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Next, I will examine the corresponding evidence for tirzepatide, including any head-to-head or meta-analytic data. After that, I need to compare effect sizes and consider mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and outline practical, patient-centered recommendations, while acknowledging uncertainties and ongoing trials [^1127AHR7] [^115UBQzU].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The question is not about glycemic control or weight loss, but specifically about hard cardiovascular outcomes (MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) and kidney outcomes (eGFR decline, kidney failure, kidney/CV death) in people with type 2 diabetes and/or CKD, and whether semaglutide has stronger or more definitive evidence than tirzepatide for these endpoints right now [^1127AHR7] [^115UBQzU].

> I will now examine semaglutide's cardiovascular evidence. SUSTAIN-6 demonstrated a significant reduction in MACE with subcutaneous semaglutide in high-risk T2D, with HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.58–0.95), establishing class benefit for GLP-1 RAs in atherosclerotic CVD risk reduction [^113aiBrc] [^117DEQH3]. Wait, let me verify the oral formulation data. PIONEER-6 met noninferiority for MACE and showed large reductions in CV and all-cause mortality, but it was not powered for superiority; nonetheless, it supported cardiovascular safety and signaled potential benefit, which was later confirmed in the larger SOUL trial [^1122wSgC] [^114DTz89]. SOUL, with 9,650 participants and median follow-up ~49 months, showed a significant 14% reduction in MACE with oral semaglutide (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.96), consolidating semaglutide's cardiovascular benefit across formulations and diverse high-risk T2D populations [^114DTz89] [^1165Zumc].

> Next, I should review semaglutide's kidney outcomes. FLOW, the first dedicated kidney outcomes trial of a GLP-1 RA in T2D with CKD, showed a 24% reduction in a composite kidney endpoint (kidney failure, sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or kidney/CV death; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88), with slower annual eGFR decline and lower all-cause mortality, confirming clinically meaningful renoprotection and supporting regulatory labeling for CKD risk reduction in T2D [^115ksonM] [^113bkZy7] [^112zYwtM]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across subgroups and background therapies. Prespecified analyses indicate benefit regardless of baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use, supporting additive mechanisms and clinical flexibility in combination therapy [^111vgArD] [^115NT22n].

> Now, let me consider tirzepatide's cardiovascular evidence. I need to check whether there are completed CV outcomes trials. SURPASS-CVOT, the head-to-head trial versus dulaglutide, is ongoing and not yet published, so definitive MACE data for tirzepatide are pending [^113ckCi6] [^116jwyx5]. The available cardiovascular signal comes from a prespecified meta-analysis across SURPASS showing noninferiority for MACE-4 (HR ~0.80, 95% CI 0.57–1.11), which meets regulatory safety criteria but does not establish superiority or definitive CV risk reduction at this time [^113c45e2] [^114QLkpm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was a completed CVOT for tirzepatide — let me correct that: there is no completed, published CV outcomes trial yet, and we await SURPASS-CVOT results to clarify hard CV outcomes [^116jwyx5].

> I will now examine tirzepatide's kidney data. Post hoc analyses from SURPASS-4 showed slower eGFR decline and a 31.9% reduction in albuminuria versus insulin glargine, suggesting potential renoprotective effects, but these were secondary endpoints in a trial not designed for kidney outcomes and with an active comparator rather than placebo, limiting causal inference compared with FLOW [^111yV6ax] [^114mmNvU]. Let me verify whether a dedicated kidney trial exists. TREASURE-CKD is ongoing and will test tirzepatide's effects on kidney outcomes, so definitive kidney-outcome evidence for tirzepatide remains pending [^117TtQEM] [^116jwyx5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should compare effect sizes and certainty. Semaglutide has multiple large, event-driven RCTs demonstrating consistent MACE reduction (SUSTAIN-6, SOUL) and a dedicated kidney outcomes trial (FLOW) with hard renal endpoints and mortality benefits, yielding high-certainty evidence for both CV and CKD risk reduction in T2D [^113aiBrc] [^114DTz89] [^115ksonM]. By contrast, tirzepatide shows promising metabolic and surrogate kidney signals and cardiovascular safety, but lacks completed CVOTs and dedicated kidney-outcome trials, so the certainty and magnitude of benefit remain unproven for hard outcomes at this time [^113c45e2] [^111yV6ax] [^116jwyx5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary guidelines prioritize agents with proven cardiorenal benefits in T2D with ASCVD and/or CKD; semaglutide is strongly recommended in higher-risk patients, and its kidney benefits are reflected in recent labeling and guidance, whereas tirzepatide is recognized for glycemic and weight effects but lacks outcome-trial confirmation for CV/CKD endpoints to date [^1127AHR7] [^115UBQzU] [^114ixkaC]. Let me double-check: ADA 2025 highlights semaglutide's favorable kidney and CV effects in CKD, and AACE 2025 algorithms list semaglutide as preferred for CKD in T2D, reinforcing the strength of evidence for semaglutide over tirzepatide for these outcomes right now [^115UBQzU] [^112ZGL2y].

> But wait, what if mechanisms differ and could favor tirzepatide? Dual GLP-1/GIP agonism may confer additional metabolic and hemodynamic effects, and tirzepatide's greater weight and HbA1c reductions could theoretically translate into cardiorenal gains; however, without completed CVOTs and a dedicated kidney trial, that remains hypothesis-generating rather than evidence-based for hard outcomes today [^114mmNvU] [^111JsVvS]. I should confirm that ongoing trials like SURPASS-CVOT and TREASURE-CKD may change this calculus once completed, so recommendations may evolve as outcome data mature [^113ckCi6] [^117TtQEM].

> I need to ensure practical considerations are addressed. Semaglutide is available in subcutaneous weekly (Ozempic) and oral daily (Rybelsus) formulations, with robust outcome data across both, and no dose adjustment is required in renal impairment, facilitating use across CKD stages, which supports implementation in complex cardiorenal patients [^112m7ZMy] [^114DTz89] [^115z5XSi]. Tirzepatide is currently injectable only, and while its weight and glycemic potency are higher, clinicians must weigh unproven hard outcomes against metabolic advantages in shared decision-making until outcome trials report [^111JsVvS] [^1127AHR7].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Based on completed, large, event-driven trials, semaglutide has definitive cardiovascular benefit (SUSTAIN-6, SOUL) and proven kidney benefit (FLOW) in T2D with high-risk features, whereas tirzepatide shows cardiovascular safety and promising metabolic and surrogate kidney signals but lacks completed CVOTs and dedicated kidney-outcome data to date; therefore, for patients prioritizing proven CV and CKD risk reduction, semaglutide is currently the preferable choice, with the caveat that tirzepatide may prove comparable or superior once SURPASS-CVOT and TREASURE-CKD report [^113aiBrc] [^114DTz89] [^115ksonM] [^113c45e2] [^111yV6ax].

Ozempic (semaglutide) is currently **preferable to Mounjaro (tirzepatide)** for cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits because it has **robust, completed outcomes trials** (SUSTAIN-6, FLOW, SOUL) demonstrating significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and kidney outcomes, and is FDA-approved for these indications [^116U1EtX]. Mounjaro shows promising cardiometabolic effects and is undergoing dedicated cardiovascular and CKD outcomes trials (SURPASS-CVOT, TREASURE-CKD), but **definitive outcome data are pending** [^116jwyx5]. Therefore, for patients with T2D and established CVD or CKD, semaglutide is the evidence-based choice pending tirzepatide's outcomes data.

## Cardiovascular benefits

### Semaglutide (Ozempic)

- **SUSTAIN-6 trial**: Semaglutide reduced MACE by 26% (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58–0.95) in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk [^113aiBrc] [^117DEQH3].

- **SOUL trial**: Oral semaglutide reduced MACE by 14% (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.96) in patients with T2D and established ASCVD and/or CKD [^114DTz89] [^1165Zumc].

- **SELECT trial**: In patients with overweight/obesity and CVD without diabetes, semaglutide reduced MACE by 20% (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72–0.90) [^116TaVdH].

---

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)

- **SURPASS program**: Tirzepatide shows superior glycemic and weight loss vs semaglutide, but cardiovascular outcome data are limited to meta-analyses and post hoc analyses [^114mmNvU] [^113c45e2].

- **SURPASS-CVOT**: A dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial is ongoing; definitive MACE data are pending [^116jwyx5] [^113ckCi6].

- **Current evidence**: No completed trial demonstrates definitive cardiovascular benefit comparable to semaglutide [^112xAC1W].

---

## Chronic kidney disease benefits

### Semaglutide (Ozempic)

- **FLOW trial**: Semaglutide reduced the risk of kidney failure, sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or renal/cardiovascular death by 24% (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88) in patients with T2D and CKD [^115ksonM] [^113bkZy7].

- **SELECT trial**: Semaglutide reduced a composite kidney endpoint by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.96) in patients with overweight/obesity and CVD without diabetes [^116TaVdH] [^114FoR1q].

- **FDA approval**: Semaglutide is approved to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESRD, and cardiovascular death in adults with T2D and CKD [^116U1EtX].

---

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)

- **SURPASS-4 post hoc analysis**: Tirzepatide slowed eGFR decline vs insulin glargine, but definitive CKD outcomes are pending [^111yV6ax] [^114mmNvU].

- **TREASURE-CKD**: A dedicated CKD outcomes trial is ongoing; definitive renal outcome data are pending [^116jwyx5] [^117TtQEM].

- **Current evidence**: No completed trial demonstrates definitive CKD benefit comparable to semaglutide [^112zYwtM] [^112xAC1W].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **favor semaglutide** for patients with T2D and established CVD or CKD given its proven cardiovascular and renal benefits [^115UBQzU] [^115pMuZ4]. Tirzepatide is recognized for its superior glycemic and weight effects, but **outcome data are pending**, so it is not yet preferred for CV/CKD risk reduction [^114mmNvU] [^112ZGL2y].

---

## Safety profiles

Both agents have **similar safety profiles**, with gastrointestinal adverse events most common and generally mild-to-moderate. No significant differences in major adverse events have been observed between semaglutide and tirzepatide.

---

## Ongoing trials and future evidence

Ongoing trials — SURPASS-CVOT and TREASURE-CKD — may clarify tirzepatide's cardiovascular and CKD benefits and could **shift practice** if positive [^116pHbAj] [^116jwyx5]. Until then, semaglutide remains the **evidence-based choice** for CV/CKD risk reduction.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Semaglutide (ozempic)** | **Tirzepatide (mounjaro)** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular outcomes | - SUSTAIN-6: 26% ↓ MACE <br/> - SOUL: 14% ↓ MACE <br/> - SELECT: 20% ↓ MACE | - SURPASS-CVOT: ongoing <br/> - Meta-analyses: promising but pending |
| Chronic kidney disease outcomes | - FLOW: 24% ↓ kidney composite <br/> - SELECT: 22% ↓ kidney composite | - SURPASS-4: eGFR benefit <br/> - TREASURE-CKD: ongoing |
| Regulatory approval | - CV risk reduction <br/> - CKD progression | Pending |

---

Semaglutide is **currently preferred** over tirzepatide for cardiovascular and CKD benefits due to completed, positive outcomes trials and regulatory approval. Tirzepatide shows promise but **awaits definitive outcome data**; clinicians should monitor ongoing trials and tailor therapy to patient-specific factors and emerging evidence.

14.2 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this trial, 3,297 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to OZEMPIC (0.5 mg or 1 mg) once weekly or placebo for a minimum observation time of 2 years. The trial compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between semaglutide and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,940 patients (58.8%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 353 (10.7%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 442 (13.4%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 562 patients (17%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. In the trial 453 patients (13.7%) had peripheral artery disease. The mean age at baseline was 65 years, and 61% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years, and mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 83% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (24%), hypertension (93%), history of ischemic stroke (12%) and history of a myocardial infarction (33%). In total, 98.0% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.6%.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^112zYwtM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OZEMPIC was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic renal replacement therapy, renal death, CV death (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.66, 0.88], p = 0.0003) as shown in Table 10 and Figure 7. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, progression to kidney failure and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial.

OZEMPIC also reduced the annual rate of change in eGFR (Figure 9), the incidence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint, consisting of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, and the incidence of all-cause death (Table 10 and Figure 8).

The treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint was generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including age, biological sex, eGFR and UACR. The treatment benefit on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline, but there were few events in these patients.

For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority of OZEMPIC to placebo for time to first MACE using a risk margin of 1.3. The statistical analysis plan pre specified that the 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses would be combined. Type-1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.

OZEMPIC significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio for time to first MACE

was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.95). Refer to Figure 6 and Table 9.

14.3 Kidney Outcomes Trial of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

FLOW (NCT03819153) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event driven trial in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2with urine albumin-to- creatinine ratio [UACR] > 100 mg/g and < 5000 mg/g). All patients needed to have an HbA1c ≤ 10% at screening and be receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximum tolerated labeled dose of a renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blocking agent including an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), unless such treatment was contraindicated or not tolerated. The trial excluded patients with congenital or hereditary kidney diseases including polycystic kidney disease, autoimmune kidney diseases including glomerulonephritis or congenital urinary tract malformations.

A total of 3,533 patients were randomized to receive OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly or placebo and were followed for a median of 41 months. The mean age of the study population was 67 years, and 70% of patients were male. Approximately 66% of the trial population was White, 24% Asian, and 5% Black or African American. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 47 mL/min/1.73m2, with 11% of patients having an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Median baseline UACR was 568 mg/g with 69% of patients with a UACR > 300 mg/g. At baseline, 95% of patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, 16% were on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, 76% were on a statin, and 50% were on an antiplatelet agent.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials, 744 (23.6%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 102 OZEMPIC-treated patients (3.2%) patients were 75 years of age and over. In SUSTAIN 6, the cardiovascular outcome trial, 788 (48%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 157 OZEMPIC-treated patients (9.6%) patients were 75 years of age and over.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including kidney failure, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk type 2 diabetes [^114DTz89]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has been established in persons with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. An assessment of the cardiovascular efficacy of oral semaglutide in persons with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both is needed.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven, superiority trial, we randomly assigned participants who were 50 years of age or older, had type 2 diabetes with a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5 to 10.0%, and had known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both to receive either once-daily oral semaglutide (maximal dose, 14 mg) or placebo, in addition to standard care. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. The confirmatory secondary outcomes included major kidney disease events (a five-point composite outcome).

Results

Among the 9650 participants who had undergone randomization, the mean (± SD) follow-up was 47.5 ± 10.9 months, and the median follow-up was 49.5 months. A primary-outcome event occurred in 579 of the 4825 participants (12.0%; incidence, 3.1 events per 100 person-years) in the oral semaglutide group, as compared with 668 of the 4825 participants (13.8%; incidence, 3.7 events per 100 person-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.96; P = 0.006). The results for the confirmatory secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. The incidence of serious adverse events was 47.9% in the oral semaglutide group and 50.3% in the placebo group; the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was 5.0% and 4.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

Among persons with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both, the use of oral semaglutide was associated with a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than placebo, without an increase in the incidence of serious adverse events.

### Effects of semaglutide on chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115ksonM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease are at high risk for kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and death. Whether treatment with semaglutide would mitigate these risks is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 50 to 75 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams] of > 300 and < 5000 or an eGFR of 25 to < 50 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 100 and < 5000) to receive subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 1.0 mg weekly or placebo. The primary outcome was major kidney disease events, a composite of the onset of kidney failure (dialysis, transplantation, or an eGFR of < 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2), at least a 50% reduction in the eGFR from baseline, or death from kidney-related or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified confirmatory secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.

Results

Among the 3533 participants who underwent randomization (1767 in the semaglutide group and 1766 in the placebo group), median follow-up was 3.4 years, after early trial cessation was recommended at a prespecified interim analysis. The risk of a primary-outcome event was 24% lower in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (331 vs. 410 first events; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.88; P = 0.0003). Results were similar for a composite of the kidney-specific components of the primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.94) and for death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.89). The results for all confirmatory secondary outcomes favored semaglutide: the mean annual eGFR slope was less steep (indicating a slower decrease) by 1.16 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 in the semaglutide group (P < 0.001), the risk of major cardiovascular events 18% lower (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.029), and the risk of death from any cause 20% lower (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.01). Serious adverse events were reported in a lower percentage of participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (49.6% vs. 53.8%).

Conclusions

Semaglutide reduced the risk of clinically important kidney outcomes and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; FLOW ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03819153.).

GLP-1RAs

GLP-1RAs, like SGLT2 inhibitors, were initially developed as glucose-lowering therapies. Secondary kidney outcome findings from CVOTs and a clinical trial (inclusive of participants with eGFRs as low as 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) suggested benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonism on kidney disease. Pooled GLP-1RA CVOT analyses reported that GLP-1RA therapy reduced albuminuria and slowed eGFR decline compared with placebo, with the greatest benefits observed in those with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The first dedicated kidney outcome trial performed with a GLP-1RA, the "Effects of Semaglutide Versus Placebo on the Progression of Renal Impairment in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease" (FLOW) enrolled 3533 participants with T2D and CKD. After median follow-up of 3.4 years, treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide 1.0 mg weekly reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome by 24%. Both the kidney and CV components of the composite endpoint contributed to the reduction in risk, with a 21% risk reduction observe for the kidney-specific components of the primary outcome, and a 29% reduction in death from CV causes. Importantly, the risk of death from any cause was 20% lower in the semaglutide group compared with placebo. The number of persons who would need to be treated over 3 years to prevent one primary outcome event was 20. Therefore, the FLOW results are likely to elevate semaglutide as another foundational GDMT for treatment of CKD in persons with T2D.

In addition to robust reductions in glycemia and weight, GLP-1RAs suppress oxidative stress, reduce activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the kidney and heart, and reduce inflammation and fibrosis (Fig. 4). Notably, early findings with the dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonist, tirzepatide, suggest benefits on both albuminuria and eGFR decline. The ongoing Study of Tirzepatide (LY3298176) in Participants With Overweight or Obesity and Chronic Kidney Disease With or Without Type 2 Diabetes (TREASURE-CKD; NCT05536804) is examining the effect of tirzepatide on kidney oxygenation and fibrosis on magnetic resonance imaging in addition to multiple secondary clinical outcomes (e.g. eGFR and UACR change from baseline).

Background

Establishing cardiovascular safety of new therapies for type 2 diabetes is important. Safety data are available for the subcutaneous form of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide but are needed for oral semaglutide.

We assessed cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in an event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients at high cardiovascular risk (age of ≥ 50 years with established cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease, or age of ≥ 60 years with cardiovascular risk factors only). The primary outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). The trial was designed to rule out 80% excess cardiovascular risk as compared with placebo (noninferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio for the primary outcome).

Results

A total of 3183 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral semaglutide or placebo. The mean age of the patients was 66 years; 2695 patients (84.7%) were 50 years of age or older and had cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. The median time in the trial was 15.9 months. Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 61 of 1591 patients (3.8%) in the oral semaglutide group and 76 of 1592 (4.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.11; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Results for components of the primary outcome were as follows: death from cardiovascular causes, 15 of 1591 patients (0.9%) in the oral semaglutide group and 30 of 1592 (1.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.92); nonfatal myocardial infarction, 37 of 1591 patients (2.3%) and 31 of 1592 (1.9%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.90); and nonfatal stroke, 12 of 1591 patients (0.8%) and 16 of 1592 (1.0%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.57). Death from any cause occurred in 23 of 1591 patients (1.4%) in the oral semaglutide group and 45 of 1592 (2.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.84). Gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation of oral semaglutide or placebo were more common with oral semaglutide.

Conclusions

In this trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes, the cardiovascular risk profile of oral semaglutide was not inferior to that of placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; PIONEER 6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02692716.).

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes, according to SGLT2i use: prespecified analyses of the SOUL randomized trial [^112x2fP6]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the presence of these comorbidities has a major impact on prognosis.

Results from several outcome trials have independently demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular outcomes of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists (RA) – and of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) – in people with T2D and high cardiovascular risk and/or CKD. Based on these trial results, as well as on data from meta-analyses for both drug classes, current guidelines recommend treatment with GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in people with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) to reduce cardiovascular risk, independent of glucose control and concomitant glucose-lowering medications. Although both classes are recommended in guidelines, there is little evidence about the efficacy of combination therapy with both drug classes. The trials that examined GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i were conducted concurrently, and therefore relatively few participants in each of the trials were receiving the other class of drug. As the biological mechanisms contributing to the beneficial effects of both drug classes are likely to be different, they are potentially complementary and therefore additive. Several short-term trials investigating the combination of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i have shown further improvement of metabolic parametersversus their monotherapies, but as yet, no randomized study has been published to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes of combination treatment. Data on the cardiovascular effects of the combination therapy with GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are therefore only available from subgroup analyses of cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) involving GLP-1 RA, such as AMPLITUDE-O, HARMONY OUTCOMES, and FLOW, all suggesting consistent benefits of GLP-1 RA in participants with and without baseline SGLT2i use. – A recent meta-analysis including these 3 trials confirmed the consistent cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs, regardless of SGLT2i use, but overall, only 10.2% of all participants were receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor at baseline.

### Clinical outcomes of tirzepatide or GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^114mmNvU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular and kidney diseases are prevalent in patients with diabetes, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Many hypoglycemic agents have been evaluated for cardiovascular and kidney protection beyond their originally designed hypoglycemic effects. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were found to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, with new trials ongoing and results emerging.

Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RA, was developed in view of the synergistic effect of both receptors in achieving negative energy balance besides facilitating glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Studies have shown tirzepatide's superiority over semaglutide in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) and weight (additional reductions of 0.15–0.45 percentage points in HbA 1c and 1.9–5.5 kg in body weight) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Compared with insulin glargine, tirzepatide has been shown to ameliorate annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline by 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and to reduce the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio by 31.9%. Favorable effects on additional cardiovascular risk factors, including atherogenic lipoproteins and blood pressure, were also observed with tirzepatide compared with semaglutide (increase of 6.8%-7.9% vs 4.4% in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decrease of 17.5%-23.7% vs 11.1% in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decrease of 4.8–6.5 mm Hg vs 3.6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure). However, whether these metabolic improvements lead to benefits in survival and kidney or cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear.

One meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported noninferiority of tirzepatide for cardiovascular safety compared with the control groups, though the included studies were highly heterogenous regarding their comparators (ie, placebo, insulin, GLP-1 RA) and trial participant characteristics, thus precluding a solid conclusion. Notably, there is a lack of studies directly comparing tirzepatide with GLP-1 RAs, thereby necessitating further investigation in this context. Hence, we investigated the association of tirzepatide with mortality and adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes compared with GLP-1 RAs in US patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Cost per patient achieving treatment targets and number needed to treat with tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^1167V7Gg]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a complex chronic condition affecting 11.3% of the US population, amounting to 37.3 million people living with diabetes in 2019. With estimated total combined direct healthcare and lost productivity costs of $327 billion in 2017, diabetes continues to be one of the costliest health conditions in the US. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes cases, and associated microvascular and macrovascular complications have been shown to play an important role in driving long-term costs in patients with T2D.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical practice recommendations identify the achievement of glycemic and weight loss targets as integral to a patient-centered approach to the management of diabetes. Achieving glycemic control (i.e. a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) goal of ≤ 6.5 or < 7.0% without significant hypoglycemia for most adults) has been shown to reduce microvascular complications and may reduce long-term cardiovascular disease rates in newly diagnosed patients. Lower HbA1c values may be beneficial in some patients if achieved safely and without significant hypoglycemia. The benefits of weight loss go beyond glycemic management by improving risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Weight loss of 5–10% has been associated with metabolic improvement, while sustained weight loss of ≥ 10–15% may have a disease-modifying effect, leading to improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

Treatment of T2D should be tailored to the individual based on comorbidities (e.g. atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease) and patient-centered treatment factors. Pharmacologic treatment approaches (i.e. metformin or other agent[s], including combination therapy) should be selected to provide adequate efficacy to achieve and maintain treatment goals. According to the ADA standards of care, weight management is an important part of glucose-lowering management in T2D, and treatment selection should consider weight management goals. Regimens that include agents with high to very high efficacy for glucose lowering and weight loss, such as the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) dulaglutide (high dose) and semaglutide or the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, typically have a greater likelihood of achieving glycemic and weight management goals.

Tirzepatide in T2D: SURPASS Clinical Trial Program

Results from SURPASS-1–5 have been published and reviewed extensively elsewhere, so are only briefly summarised here. Further details of the SURPASS clinical trial program, study designs and outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Study Designs

The wide range of background therapies and study population characteristics at baseline in SURPASS-1–5 reflect the continuum of T2D disease (with mean disease duration ranging from 4.7 to 13.3 years) and treatment (including monotherapy, combination oral therapy and insulin). Tirzepatide was compared with active comparators (semaglutide 1 mg, basal insulins) as well as with placebo (Table 1, Table S2 Supplementary Appendix). In all phase 3 studies, tirzepatide was initiated at 2.5 mg sc once weekly and escalated by 2.5-mg increments every 4 weeks until the target dose of 5, 10 or 15 mg sc per week was reached.

### From weight loss to multimorbidity prevention: framing the anticipated contributions of SURMOUNT-MMO [^1176tU5M]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently approved incretin‐based therapies for weight loss, specifically semaglutide and tirzepatide, can induce 10% to 25% reductions in body weight. These "chemical shields" against the obesogenic environment not only facilitate satiety at lower caloric intake but also reduce the pervasive "food noise" described by many users, making it potentially easier to engage in other healthy lifestyle changes. These are important medicines coming at a time when obesogenic environments show little signs of being meaningfully reversed.

Importantly, the clinical effects of these weight loss therapies extend beyond weight reduction. Semaglutide has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in people without diabetes, as demonstrated in the landmark SELECT trial. Tirzepatide, a dual glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA), appears to offer even greater average weight loss and potentially additional metabolic benefits, though its cardiovascular impact remains to be confirmed.

The ongoing SURMOUNT‐MMO trial described in this issue of Obesity is designed to evaluate this question and much more. It is the pivotal placebo‐controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial for tirzepatide in individuals without type 2 diabetes (T2D), following on from the soon to be reported SUPRASS CVOT which tests the cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide versus an active comparator, dulaglutide, in people with T2D. SURMOUNT‐MMO compares tirzepatide to placebo for a composite primary endpoint that includes a range of cardiovascular events, notably including heart failure — a cardiovascular condition more strongly associated with obesity than atherosclerotic outcomes.

Critically, however, in addition to the primary endpoint, SURMOUNT‐MMO is also examining a series of important secondary outcomes. These include the incidence of T2D, changes in kidney function via estimated glomerular filtration rate, and physical functioning, each representing somewhat different pathways through which obesity causes harm: metabolic, hemodynamic, and mechanical. Other secondary and tertiary outcomes include heart failure hospitalization, obesity‐related liver outcomes, cancers linked to obesity, and all‐cause hospitalization. Consequently, this trial will offer an opportunity to assess both the broad direct and weight loss effects of tirzepatide in a controlled setting (Figure 1). Placebo‐controlled randomized trials remain the gold standard for assessing both benefits and safety and are especially valuable for detecting outcomes that are relatively common. Even the best designed observational studies cannot provide this level of causal evidence.

14.4 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

PIONEER 6 (NCT02692716) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In this trial, 3,183 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily or placebo for a median observation time of 16 months. The trial compared the risk of a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between RYBELSUS 14 mg and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,797 patients (56.5%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 354 patients (11.1%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 544 patients (17.1%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 488 patients (15.3%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. The mean age at baseline was 66 years and 68% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years and mean BMI was 32 kg/m2. Overall, 72% were White, 6% were Black or African American and 20% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (12%), history of ischemic stroke (8%) and history of a myocardial infarction (36%). In total, 99.7% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 100%.

### Effects of semaglutide on heart Failure outcomes in diabetes and chronic kidney disease in the FLOW trial [^112iNXC7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for heart failure (HF) and premature death from cardiovascular (CV) causes. The FLOW (Research Study To See How Semaglutide Works Compared to Placebo in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease), which enrolled participants with T2D and CKD, demonstrated that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, reduced the incidence of the primary composite outcome (persistent ≥ 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, kidney replacement therapy, and kidney or CV death) by 24%.

Objectives

This prespecified analysis examined the effects of semaglutide on HF outcomes in this high-risk population.

Methods

Participants were randomized (1:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 1 mg or placebo. The prespecified main outcome was a composite of HF events (new onset or worsening of HF leading to an unscheduled hospital admission or an urgent visit, with initiation of or intensified diuretic/vasoactive therapy) or CV death. HF data were collected by the investigator. CV death was adjudicated by an independent committee.

Results

A total of 3,533 randomized participants were followed for a median of 3.4 years. HF was present at baseline in 342 participants (19.4%) in the semaglutide group and 336 (19.0%) in the placebo group. In the overall trial population, semaglutide increased time to first HF events or CV death (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62–0.87; P = 0.0005), HF events alone (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58–0.92; P = 0.0068), and CV death alone (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56–0.89; P = 0.0036). The risk reduction for the composite HF outcome was similar in those with (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.54–0.98; P = 0.0338) and without (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58–0.89; P = 0.0028) HF at baseline. The risk of HF outcomes (HF events or CV death) was generally higher in participants categorized as NYHA functional class III and those with the HF reduced ejection fraction subtype, regardless of treatment.

Conclusions

Semaglutide substantially reduced the risk of time to first composite outcome of HF events or CV death, as well as HF events and CV death alone, in a high-risk population with T2D and CKD. These effects were consistent regardless of history of HF.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116khVzb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 INDICATIONS FOR‐1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS IN PEOPLE WITH

The primary GLP‐1 RAs used in the treatment of T2D are liraglutide, injectable semaglutide and dulaglutide. The specific advantage these agents have is their established cardiovascular benefit in outcomes trials. Conversely, lixisenatide and exenatide did not demonstrate a cardiovascular benefit in their outcomes trials, and a cardiovascular outcomes trial is not available for tirzepatide. Oral semaglutide did not demonstrate a cardiovascular benefit in PIONEER 6; though in the SOUL trial, with a longer follow‐up, it was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular‐related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke.

In addition to the cardiovascular benefit with some GLP‐1 RAs, primary and secondary data from several outcome trials suggest an improvement in renal outcomes, a heart failure benefit, and that semaglutide improves heart failure symptoms among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Key populations in which GLP‐1 RAs should be avoided include existing use with DPP‐4 inhibitors given the overlapping mechanism of action and in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Additionally, and while not contraindications, caution should be taken in pregnancy, and in those with a history of pancreatitis, gastroparesis, other severe gastrointestinal diseases and severely elevated triglycerides.

### Effects of oral semaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and / or chronic kidney disease: design and baseline characteristics of SOUL, a randomized trial [^112NXXpL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To describe the design of the SOUL trial (Semaglutide cardiOvascular oUtcomes triaL) and the baseline clinical data of its participants.

Materials and Methods

In SOUL, the effects of oral semaglutide, the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in individuals with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be assessed. SOUL is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled CV outcomes trial comparing oral semaglutide (14mg once daily) with placebo, both in addition to standard of care, in individuals aged ≥ 50years with type 2 diabetes and evidence of ASCVD (coronary artery disease [CAD], cerebrovascular disease, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) and/or CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73m 2). The primary outcome is time from randomization to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event (MACE; a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke). This event-driven trial will continue until 1225 first adjudication-confirmed MACEs have occurred. Enrolment has been completed.

Results

Overall, 9650 participants were enrolled between June 17, 2019 and March 24, 2021 (men 71.1%, White ethnicity 68.9%, mean age 66.1years, diabetes duration 15.4years, body mass index 31.1kg/m 2, glycated haemoglobin 63.5mmol/mol [8.0%]). The most frequently used antihyperglycaemic medications at baseline were metformin (75.7%), insulin and insulin analogues (50.5%), sulphonylureas (29.1%), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (26.7%) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (23.0%). At randomization, 70.7% of participants had CAD, 42.3% had CKD, 21.1% had cerebrovascular disease and 15.7% had symptomatic PAD (categories not mutually exclusive). Prevalent heart failure was reported in 23.0% of participants.

Conclusion

SOUL will provide evidence regarding the CV effects of oral semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD and/or CKD.

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes, according to SGLT2i use: prespecified analyses of the SOUL randomized trial [^116wTCLF]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Both GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. However, there are limited data about the effect of combining these agents on cardiovascular and safety outcomes.

Methods

The SOUL trial (Semaglutide Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial; NCT03914326) randomized 9650 participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease to oral semaglutide or placebo. As prespecified, participants were analyzed according to baseline use of SGLT2i (yes, n = 2596; no, n = 7054), and subsequently for any use of SGLT2i during the trial (yes, n = 4718; no, n = 4932). The primary outcome was time to first major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Safety was evaluated by comparing the incidence of serious adverse events.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 47.5 ± 10.9 months, the risk of the primary outcome in the overall trial population was 14% lower for oral semaglutide versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.96). In those taking SGLT2i at baseline, there were 143 of 1296 (semaglutide) versus 158 of 1300 (placebo) primary outcome events (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71–1.11); and 436 of 3529 versus 510 of 3525, respectively, in participants not taking SGLT2i at baseline (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; P -interaction, 0.66). An analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events by any in-trial SGLT2i use versus no use also showed no evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of oral semaglutide. The adverse event profiles of oral semaglutide with or without concomitant SGLT2i were similar.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular event outcomes independently of concomitant SGLT2i treatment, and this combination appeared to be safe.

### Semaglutide vs tirzepatide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity [^114UZR3s]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this large, propensity-matched, cohort study, individuals with overweight or obesity treated with tirzepatide were significantly more likely to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss and larger reductions in body weight compared with those treated with semaglutide. Consistent treatment effect estimates were observed in subgroups with and without T2D. Future work is needed to compare the effect of tirzepatide and semaglutide on other key end points (eg, reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events).

Semaglutide in Kidney Disease

Other potential pleiotropic effects of semaglutide are also being investigated. The role of semaglutide in kidney disease is not quite clear, although evidence implies its beneficial effect on renal disease. A nephroprotective effect of semaglutide in mice has already been proposed. Furthermore, a pooled analysis of SUSTAIN 6 (a trial to evaluate cardiovascular and other long-term outcomes with semaglutide in subjects with T2DM) and PIONEER 6 (a trial investigating the cardiovascular safety of orally administered semaglutide in subjects with T2DM) clinical trials among people with T2DM at high CVD risk suggested that the treatment with semaglutide may reduce the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline compared with placebo. Potential mechanisms suggested for this beneficial effect of semaglutide might be the reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory effects as well as hemodynamic effects. Whether semaglutide could play a beneficial role in the progression of renal impairment in people with T2DM and chronic kidney disease is currently being investigated in the FLOW trial (effect of semaglutide versus placebo on the progression of renal impairment in subjects with T2D and chronic kidney disease) and remains to be answered.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related complications?

Context

Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications to inform diabetes management.

Recommendations

The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity.

About This Guideline and How It Was Created

An international panel including two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience and likelihood of changing practice. This is the first version of the living guideline. The guideline is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations series. MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published in The BMJ. We encourage re-use, adaptation and translation of these living guidelines, and recognise that the lack of availability or high costs of some medications may be prohibitive and will impact on how these recommendations are implemented across different health care systems.

### Long-term kidney outcomes of semaglutide in obesity and cardiovascular disease in the SELECT trial [^116TaVdH]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The SELECT trial previously reported a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with semaglutide (n = 8,803) versus placebo (n = 8,801) in patients with overweight/obesity and established cardiovascular disease, without diabetes. In the present study, we examined the effect of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg on kidney outcomes in the SELECT trial. The incidence of the pre-specified main composite kidney endpoint (death from kidney disease, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, onset of persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2, persistent ≥ 50% reduction in eGFR or onset of persistent macroalbuminuria) was lower with semaglutide (1.8%) versus placebo (2.2%): hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 0.96; P = 0.02. The treatment benefit at 104 weeks for eGFR was 0.75 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2 (95% CI 0.43, 1.06; P < 0.001) overall and 2.19 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2 (95% CI 1.00, 3.38; P < 0.001) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2. These results suggest a benefit of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in individuals with overweight/obesity, without diabetes.

### CVOT summit report 2024: new cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic outcomes [^116jwyx5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the outcomes of four further HF outcome trials with empagliflozin (EMPACT-MI), semaglutide (STEP-HFpEF-DM), tirzepatide (SUMMIT), and finerenone (FINEARTS-HF) were published, as well as a kidney outcome trial with semaglutide (FLOW), and a metabolic outcome trial with tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-OSA). Two further CVOTs are currently being conducted with tirzepatide: SURPASS-CVOT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04255433) in people with T2D and a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and SURMOUNT-MMO (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05556512) in people living with overweight or obesity. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in CKD is being evaluated in the TREASURE-CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05536804) trial.

Following the practice of previous years, we present and summarize the key aspects discussed at the 10th CVOT Summit: Congress on Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Metabolic Outcomes held virtually on December 5–6, 2024.

Cardiometabolic impact of

The body weight reduction achieved with second‐generation OMs, namely semaglutide and tirzepatide, is considerable and has been associated with positive impacts beyond weight reduction, especially on important biomarkers of cardiovascular health and tissue inflammation. The potential for these OMs to exert beneficial anti‐inflammatory tissue effects, in addition to beneficial impacts on blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and insulin resistance, is supported by evidence of reduced cardiometabolic risk. For instance, tirzepatide has been shown in a meta‐analysis to result in clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as an increase in high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the same analysis, tirzepatide was likewise shown to improve hemoglobin A1c and reduce overall type 2 diabetes risk. A phase 3, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes found that semaglutide, when compared with placebo, was associated with significantly lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. More recently, in a larger multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity, but no history of diabetes, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly was associated with a significant reduction in a composite cardiovascular endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (p < 0.001) at a mean follow‐up of 39.8 months.

and other health outcomes

Tirzepatide and semaglutide have also demonstrated benefits beyond cardiovascular risk reduction and improvements in metabolic health that have resulted in an expanded FDA‐approved indication for semaglutide 2.4 mg for cardiovascular risk reduction in at‐risk patients with overweight or obesity. In December 2024, tirzepatide became the first FDA‐approved medication for obstructive sleep apnea based on phase 3 results from the SURMOUNT clinical trial program. The STEP research program continues to evaluate the wider benefits of the weight reduction seen with semaglutide, including sustained weight reduction and maintenance over 2 years in the STEP 5 trial. Other areas of research focus in the STEP program include the potential of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to positively impact quality of life, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, kidney dysfunction, and depression, all of which are substantially impacted in patients with obesity.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aiBrc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^112YdmT5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Obesity is a chronic disease and is considered a global epidemic, with high associations with but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), several malignancies, chronic kidney disease, metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatosis liver disease (MASLD) and mental disorders. Thus, the prevention and treatment of obesity are important to improve healthcare outcomes, quality of life and decrease overall healthcare costs. Currently, treatment for overweight and obesity includes healthy lifestyle changes, behavioural counselling, prescription medications and surgery. Given its detrimental effects on individual health and its widespread impact on society, there is great interest in the development of therapeutics to combat obesity and T2DM and their associated sequelae.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have emerged as a prominent treatment for T2DM with a notable weight loss effect via delayed gastric emptying, glucagon inhibition and stimulation of central receptors that modulate appetite suppression and energy expenditure. Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GLP‐1RAs are for glycaemic control (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide/insulin, semaglutide) or weight loss (semaglutide, liraglutide). However, tirzepatide, a recent agent that has gained popularity, has shown similar, if not greater, glycaemic control and weight loss in patients with obesity or T2DM. Its mechanism of action involves dual agonism of the GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors.

Through a comparative analysis, this systematic review aims to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide in facilitating weight loss and their respective safety profiles. A more accurate comparison can be performed through a comparative analysis by reducing the confounding and bias observed in differing patient demographics and study characteristics associated with indirect comparisons or network meta‐analyses. We hypothesise that tirzepatide, due to its dual agonism, will produce greater weight loss with a similar or improved safety profile.

### Long-term kidney outcomes of semaglutide in obesity and cardiovascular disease in the SELECT trial [^114FoR1q]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The SELECT trial previously reported a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with semaglutide (n = 8,803) versus placebo (n = 8,801) in patients with overweight/obesity and established cardiovascular disease, without diabetes. In the present study, we examined the effect of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4mg on kidney outcomes in the SELECT trial. The incidence of the pre-specified main composite kidney endpoint (death from kidney disease, initiation of chronic kidney replacement therapy, onset of persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15mlmin -1 1.73m - 2, persistent ≥ 50% reduction in eGFR or onset of persistent macroalbuminuria) was lower with semaglutide (1.8%) versus placebo (2.2%): hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 0.96; P = 0.02. The treatment benefit at 104weeks for eGFR was 0.75mlmin -1 1.73m - 2 (95% CI 0.43, 1.06; P < 0.001) overall and 2.19mlmin -1 1.73m - 2 (95% CI 1.00, 3.38; P < 0.001) in patients with baseline eGFR < 60mlmin -1 1.73m - 2. These results suggest a benefit of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in individuals with overweight/obesity, without diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03574597.

1 INTRODUCTION

People with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of cardiorenal events, emphasising the link between cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and suboptimal glycaemic control.T2D is a complex disease with a high degree of heterogeneity, and several underlying pathological mechanisms that affect the risk of comorbidities and response to oral glucose‐lowering drugs. The pathogenesis of T2D in people with or without overweight/obesity also differs.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have multifactorial effects in people with T2D because this drug class targets the pancreas, brain, and insulin‐sensitive tissues to regulate glycaemic control and food intake, also resulting in body weight (BW) reductions. Furthermore, GLP‐1RAs affect the CV systemand kidneys. A meta‐analysis of CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) has shown that GLP‐1RAs reduced the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE) and worsening of kidney function by 14% and 18%, respectively, in people with T2D and with, or at high/very high risk of, CVD. Specifically, the SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes) trial has shown CV benefits of the once‐weekly (OW) subcutaneous (s.c.) GLP‐1RA semaglutide versus placebo in people with T2D at high CV risk or with established CVD, whereas once‐daily (OD) oral semaglutide showed noninferiority on the risk of MACE versus placebo in the PIONEER 6 (A Trial Investigating the Cardiovascular Safety of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) trial. In a pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 CVOTs, semaglutide reduced the risk of primary MACE (i.e. a composite outcome of CV death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction [MI], or non‐fatal stroke) versus placebo, independent of baseline CV risk, with the exception of people with prior heart failure (HF). In an analysis of the LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) and SUSTAIN 6 trials, the risk reduction of primary MACE, expanded MACE, CV death, and nephropathy with OD s.c. liraglutide or OW s.c. semaglutide versus placebo was generally consistent across subpopulations with different baseline body mass index (BMI) ranges. In addition, the kidney outcomes trial FLOW (A Research Study to See How Semaglutide Works Compared with Placebo in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease; NCT03819153) demonstrated that OW s.c. semaglutide 1.0 mg reduced the risk of major kidney disease events, MACE, and all‐cause death by 24%, 18%, and 20%, respectively, versus placebo in people with T2D and CKD.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease — preferred agents and eGFR applicability: for individuals with type 2 diabetes and CKD, preferred medications for glucose management are GLP‑1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors (can be initiated if eGFR is above 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2); GLP‑1 RAs are effective in lowering glucose levels regardless of kidney function, with a low risk for hypoglycemia, and recent trial data suggest semaglutide has beneficial effects on CVD, mortality, and kidney outcomes among people with CKD.

### Cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale, design and patient baseline characteristics for the PIONEER 6 trial [^112VtKJS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

Materials and Methods

PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ≥ 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

Results

Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

Conclusions

PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

1 INTRODUCTION

Incretin‐based therapies such as glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP4) inhibitors act on multiple pathophysiological pathways to help normalize insulin and glucagon secretion, and lower blood glucose levels. GLP‐1RAs also reduce appetite and facilitate weight loss. 1, 2, 3 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines recommend a GLP‐1RA or DPP4 inhibitor, or a sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione, as second‐line treatment in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on metformin. 4, 5 Regardless of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) should preferentially receive GLP‐1RA that has shown CV benefit, or an SGLT2i with CV benefit if a GLP‐1RA is not appropriate; SGLT2is are preferred over GLP‐1RAs for those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease (CKD). 4, 5

Semaglutide is a GLP‐1 analogue approved as a once‐weekly subcutaneous injection for glycaemic control in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on at least one oral glucose‐lowering medication. 6, 7, 8 In the Phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trials, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide provided consistently significantly better reductions in HbA1c and body weight against placebo and a variety of active comparator drugs in multiple patient groups with T2D. 9 Additionally, semaglutide, like several other GLP‐1RAs, 10, 11, 12 showed a cardioprotective effect in patients with T2D and CVD or CV risk factors. 13

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including an increased risk of both kidney failure and cardiovascular (CV) events. CKD is a common complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), affecting ≈40% of those with T2D, and the risk increases with diabetes duration. The presence of CKD causes average healthcare costs to increase by almost 50% compared with costs for those with diabetes alone.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend multifactorial interventions to reduce the risk of CKD developing or progressing in people with T2D. Recommendations include optimising blood glucose levels towards an individualised target, lowering blood pressure, moderating dietary protein intake and weight loss. Guidelines on CKD and diabetes management, such as the 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for patients with CKD and the 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards-of-care (SoC) guidelines for patients with T2D recommend treatment with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blocking agents and sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in most patients. Both guidelines also recommend a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) for patients with CKD at increased risk for CV events, or CKD progression, or unable to use SGLT2is. The 2022 KDIGO guidelines recommend long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) with proven CV benefits as the preferred second-line treatment for glucose lowering and CV event risk reduction in individuals either with CV disease (CVD) or at high risk of CVD who are not achieving individualised glycaemic targets despite the use of metformin and an SGLT2i or who are unable to use those medications. For patients with confirmed atherosclerotic CVD or at high risk of CV events, the 2022 ADA SoC guidelines recommend either a GLP-1RA or an SGLT2i with proven CV benefits.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^114VYzUn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Implications

The substantial weight loss induced by semaglutide and tirzepatide provides an attractive modality for patients on their weight loss journey. Their physiological mechanism of action in reducing overall food intake may allow patients to make changes to their diets with greater ease compared to traditional lifestyle interventions and counselling. Weight loss can also lead to improved physical activity, an important lifestyle habit that can further improve cardiovascular health. In addition to the effects of weight loss on attenuating risk for cardiovascular disease, semaglutide also demonstrates cardiovascular safety and has recently been approved in March 2024 by the FDA for reducing cardiovascular mortality. It is important to note that this cardiovascular benefit is not observed with oral semaglutide. Ultimately, these results for semaglutide and tirzepatide emphasise the need to ensure the maintenance of weight loss regardless of which medication an individual takes.

Future studies should focus on conducting longer‐term follow‐up studies to better elucidate the weight loss maintenance and safety profiles of these medications. High‐quality studies with standardised baseline patient demographics are also important, as this may affect the outcomes seen. Additionally, more head‐to‐head studies will better characterise the effect of one GLP‐1 RA over another. A focus on weight loss maintenance should also be analysed due to the possibility of weight regain after cessation of these medications.

### An observational study of cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^112xzfVG]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The introduction of tirzepatide, a combined glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GIP/GLP-1RA, has further strengthened the cardiometabolic field. Tirzepatide is a novel, unimolecular twincretin agonist of GIP-GLP-1RA, which, after initial phase 2 studies, was found to be superior in glycaemia reduction compared to the standard of care or placebo in the SURPASS RCT program. Tirzepatide not only improved glycemia and body weight but also slowed the reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)and is beneficial in metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease. When compared with semaglutide 1 mg directlyand indirectly, glycemic control, weight reduction, blood pressure control, and lipid reduction were better with tirzepatide. In a prespecified meta-analysis of the SURPASS trials, tirzepatide was found to be safe from a cardiovascular standpoint with a trend towards lower MACE. However, the published SURPASS trials were not powered to detect statistically significant differences in MACE due to low event rates.

To date, there are no head-to-head RCTs comparing the effect of tirzepatide vs contemporary GLP-1RA on cardiovascular outcomes. While this question is being addressed by the SURPASS-CVOT (A Study of Tirzepatide Compared With Dulaglutide on Major Cardiovascular Events in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes)trial that should report in 2025, this knowledge gap can be estimated by real-world evidence-based observational studies.

In this observational cohort study, we aim to explore the cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide vs contemporary GLP-1RAs using a large research network database.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and population

Individual participant data from participants in the SUSTAIN 6 (N = 3297) and PIONEER 6 (N = 3183) CVOTs, receiving semaglutide (SUSTAIN 6: OW s.c. 0.5 or 1.0 mg; PIONEER 6: OD oral 14 mg) or placebo, were used in this analysis. Data from the s.c. and oral semaglutide arms were pooled and compared with pooled placebo data from both trials. The SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 CVOTs have been described previously; however, relevant information is provided here for clarity.

The SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 CVOTs were event‐driven trials, with a minimum of 122 MACE events needed to ascertain statistical power. A minimum trial duration of 109 weeks was defined for SUSTAIN 6, whereas no minimal trial duration was established for PIONEER 6. The median study observation time for the SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 trials was 2.1 years and 15.9 months, respectively. Key inclusion criteria for the participants of both CVOTs were an age of ≥ 50 years and established CVD (including previous CV, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease), chronic HF or CKD, or an age of ≥ 60 years and at least one CV risk factor. In both CVOTs, key kidney‐related exclusion criteria were long‐term or intermittent haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis; for PIONEER 6, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was also an exclusion criterion.

2.2 Subgroups by prioror baseline

The overall pooled study population was divided into subgroups based on the presence of CVD (coronary, carotid or peripheral arterial revascularisation, MI, and stroke/TIA) before randomisation. Participants were also divided into subgroups based on BMI ranges at baseline: < 25 kg/m 2 (indicating lean BW), ≥ 25 to < 30kg/m 2 (indicating overweight), and ≥ 30kg/m 2 (indicating obesity).

### Effects of semaglutide with and without concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor use in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease in the FLOW trial [^111vgArD]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit a high risk for kidney failure and CV complications. Therefore, it is of global interest to examine potential benefits and adverse effects of glucose-lowering drugs in people with T2D and CKD to prevent death, kidney failure and CV complications. Early trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in persons with T2D and high CV risk were powered for CV outcomes as primary and kidney outcomes as secondary. Some of those trials demonstrated benefits on CV outcomes and suggested kidney benefit of both drug classes. Later, three independent trials with SGLT2i in persons with and without T2D and CKD defined kidney outcomes as primary and demonstrated substantial kidney benefits of SGLT2i. Recently, the FLOW (Evaluate Renal Function with Semaglutide Once Weekly) trial was the first dedicated kidney outcomes trial in participants with T2D and CKD that examined a GLP-1 RA, namely once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (1.0 mg). A clear benefit of treatment with semaglutide on kidney outcomes was shown as well as on CV outcomes and survival compared with placebo.

SGLT2i are particularly effective in preventing kidney, heart failure and CV outcomes. Notably, GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, also provide substantial benefits for CV and CKD outcomes, death, and heart failure. Since the molecular mechanisms of action of both drug classes on the CV system and the kidney may be complementary and largely independent of glucose lowering, it has been speculated that the combination might further improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, GLP-1 RAs may become another pillar of therapy for diabetic kidney disease along with inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RASi), mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and SGLT2i.

There are no clinical trials that have directly examined the combination of GLP-1 RAs plus SGLT2i on major kidney and CV outcomes in participants with T2D and CKD. Therefore, in a prespecified analysis, we investigated the potential benefits and safety of semaglutide, stratified by baseline use of SGLT2i, in the FLOW trial and also analyzed the effect of SGLT2i use initiated after randomization.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — incretin mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs] and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] RAs) for weight management in kidney disease — notes regulatory status and kidney outcome data: As of August 16, 2024, three GLP-1 RAs are approved for weight loss (liraglutide, tirzepatide, semaglutide), and weight loss in this class often exceeds 5% of baseline body weight. In patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25–75), semaglutide reduced the risk of major kidney disease outcomes by approximately 25%. In adults without preexisting cardiovascular disease and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m^2, semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly administration reduced a five-component kidney composite end point by 22%. A randomized trial with liraglutide (1.8 mg subcutaneous daily) demonstrated a 22% lower occurrence of a composite kidney outcome versus placebo, primarily driven by reduced new persistent microalbuminuria.

14.1 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Cardiovascular Disease and Either Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Trial Study 1 (NCT03574597) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine the effect of WEGOVY relative to placebo on major adverse CV events (MACE) when added to current standard of care, which included management of CV risk factors and individualized healthy lifestyle counseling (including diet and physical activity). The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

All patients were 45 years or older, with an initial BMI of 27 kg/m2or greater and established CV disease (prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, or peripheral arterial disease). Patients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Concomitant CV therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of the investigator, to ensure participants were treated according to the current standard of care for patients with established CV disease.

In this trial, 17,604 patients were randomized to WEGOVY or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (range 45–93), 72% were male, 84% were White, 4% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. Mean baseline body weight was 97 kg and mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. At baseline, prior myocardial infarction was reported in 76% of randomized individuals, prior stroke in 23%, and peripheral arterial disease in 9%. Heart failure was reported in 24% of patients. At baseline, CV disease and risk factors were managed with lipid-lowering therapy (90%), platelet aggregation inhibitors (86%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (74%), and beta blockers (70%). A total of 10% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and 0.4% had severe renal impairment eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

### Clinical profile and treatment patterns in individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who initiate a GLP-1 receptor agonist: a multinational cohort study [^112N3LHx]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Diabetes with CKD is the most common underlying cause of kidney failure, accounting for almost 50% of cases in the developed world. Additionally, people with T2D and CKD are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Available therapies for preventing and reducing the risk of CKD progression among patients with T2D include renin-angiotensin system inhibitor drugs (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also have favorable renal effects given their direct and indirect mechanisms of action, including stimulating pathways responsible for reducing oxidative stress in the kidneys, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss and glucose control. GLP-1 RAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney outcomes. Specifically, evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials, in which kidney outcomes have been captured as secondary endpoints, and from observational studies suggests that treatment with a GLP-1 RA is associated with cardiovascular benefits in patients with prediabetes and T2D, and with lower risks of composite kidney outcomes in patients with T2D. Moreover, FLOW, the first randomized trial designed to study the effects of GLP-1 RAs on kidney outcomes, showed a 24% reduction in the risk (hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.88) of a primary composite kidney outcome (kidney failure onset, at least a 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from baseline, or death from kidney-related or cardiovascular causes) when comparing patients initiating semaglutide with patients initiating placebo. In 2025, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the GLP-1 RA semaglutide to reduce the risk of worsening CKD, and the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs as a second-line therapy for patients with T2D and CKD who have not met their glycemic targets despite use of metformin and an SGLT2i or for those who are unable to tolerate these medications.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^117REGT1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Looking to the future

With the growing number of therapeutic options for people with T2DM, there is a need to better understand the optimal combination of treatments. There is strong evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists also reduce the risk of a range of cardiovascular events. The types of events prevented with GLP-1 receptor agonists, and time frames over which benefits accrue, highlight that the mechanism of cardioprotection with these agents is likely to be distinct from SGLT2 inhibitors and mediated mainly through anti-atherothrombotic effects. In contrast, SGLT2 inhibitors have greater benefits on HF and kidney outcomes, underscoring their unique haemodynamic effects. Additionally, GLP-1 receptor agonists are permitted for use down to an eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in some regions, presenting an important treatment option for patients with advanced CKD. The contrasting mechanisms and benefits of these two classes of drugs raise the possibility that combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors could provide additive cardiovascular and kidney benefits. Short-term trials of semaglutide and dulaglutide suggest that combination treatment reduces HbA1c and body weight to a greater extent than SGLT2 inhibition alone, without additional safety concerns. However, randomized evidence on patient-level cardiovascular and kidney outcomes is currently lacking and a trial designed to test these agents in combination would be very valuable. In lieu of such trials, the uptake of SGLT2 inhibitors in routine clinical practice will mean that future randomized studies, including of GLP-1 receptor agonists, may well include substantial numbers of participants receiving SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, and thus provide indirect evidence on the effects of these drug classes used in combination.

### Systolic blood pressure reduction with tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes: insights from SURPASS clinical program [^111Xeg5N]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Safety

Across SURPASS studies, tirzepatide was associated with an increase in heart rate of 1 to 6 beats per minute at the end of study treatment. There was no significant difference between tirzepatide and semaglutide in the SURPASS-2 study at Week 40 in change in heart rate compared to baseline despite higher reduction in HbA1c, weight and SBP. Several mechanisms have been postulated for elevation in heart rate with GLP-1 RAs, such as reflex tachycardia, increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and direct sino-atrial node action but none have been clinically proven yet. Several long-acting GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated CV protection in a dedicated CV outcome trial (CVOT) while the SURPASS-CVOT study (NCT04255433) for tirzepatide is ongoing and will provide further insights into whether these effects on blood pressure lowering, improvements in metabolic parameters and elevation in heart rate would combine to produce any meaningful impact on hard CV outcomes. To date, tirzepatide has demonstrated CV safety when compared with pooled comparators in a meta-analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies with the hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57–1.11) for MACE-4. In a post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 data, tirzepatide slowed the rate of decline in eGFR, showed clinically meaningful improvement in albuminuria and significantly lowered occurrence of the composite kidney outcomes compared to insulin glargine which may be related to SBP lowering.

Limitations and conclusions

The limitations of this study include its post-hoc nature and the fact we did not systematically collect indications for antihypertensive medications as these could have been used for other co-morbidities. Studies were not designed to systematically assess blood pressure and randomization was not stratified based on baseline status of hypertension, SBP and other relevant parameters that could have affected the outcomes. Weight loss with tirzepatide did not plateau at 40/42 weeks and therefore longer term data could provide more robust assessments in future.

In conclusion, tirzepatide has demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in SBP across the SURPASS program. This effect was primarily mediated through weight loss, with different degrees of contributions from weight-loss independent effects across the different SURPASS trials. Furthermore, SBP reduction was not dependent on antihypertensive medication use and dependent on baseline SBP value, alleviating theoretical concerns of hypotension in patients with lower baseline SBP.

### Cardiovascular effects and tolerability of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 99, 599 patients [^112LeqGE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated significant cardiovascular (CV) benefits particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), but the safety and efficacy of different GLP-1 RAs across diverse populations remain insufficiently defined.

Objectives

Previous meta-analyses of GLP-1 RAs have been limited by restricted populations, omission of recent trials, or incomplete safety synthesis; this study integrates the latest evidence across 21 RCTs and diverse populations using advanced meta-analytic methods.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing GLP-1 RAs vs controls or placebo were included. Analyses were conducted in pre-specified subgroups based on the GLP-1 RA used. Pre-specified subgroups according to DM, kidney function, obesity or heart failure (HF) were also performed. Main outcomes comprised mortality (all-cause and CV), trial-defined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and serious adverse events (SAEs). GRADE and trial sequential analyses were performed to evaluate certainty and conclusiveness of findings, respectively.

Results

A total of 21 trials encompassing 99,592 patients were included. Eight different GLP-1 RAs were used (lixisenatide, liraglutide, exenatide, semaglutide, efpeglenatide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, and tirzepatide), each administered at therapeutic doses and compared vs placebo or controls. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 years. We found conclusive, high certainty, evidence that GLP-1 RAs reduced all-cause death (IRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84–0.92, NNT = 121), CV death (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–0.92, NNT = 170) and MACE (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83–0.91, NNT = 66), compared with controls. GLP-1 RAs reduced SAE (-9%), myocardial infarction (-15%), acute kidney failure (-9%), HF (-15%), and infections (-10%), but increased gastrointestinal (GI; +63%) and gallbladder (+26%) disorders. There were no differences in stroke, pancreatitis or neoplasm between groups. Results were mostly consistent across subgroups. Analysis by GLP-1 RA type revealed potential differences in efficacy and safety profiles.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs reduce mortality and MACE in high-risk populations, highlighting benefits beyond glycemic control. These come at increased GI and gallbladder risks. Variation in efficacy and tolerability supports tailoring GLP-1 RA therapy to individual patient characteristics and treatment goals.

### Effect of semaglutide on kidney function across different levels of baseline HbA1c, blood pressure, body weight and albuminuria in SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 [^115HxUg4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This post hoc analysis explored the effects of semaglutide on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) slope by baseline glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI) and albuminuria status in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.

Methods

Pooled SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) and PIONEER 6 (A Trial Investigating the Cardiovascular Safety of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes) data were analyzed for change in eGFR slope by baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (< 8%/ ≥ 8%; < 64/ ≥ 64 mmol/mol), systolic BP (< 140/90/ ≥ 140/90 mmHg) and BMI (< 30/ ≥ 30 kg/m2). SUSTAIN 6 data were analyzed by baseline urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR; < 30/30–300/ > 300 mg/g).

Results

The estimated absolute treatment differences overall in eGFR slope (95% confidence intervals) favored semaglutide versus placebo in the pooled analysis [0.59 (0.29; 0.89) mL/min/1.73 m2/year] and in SUSTAIN 6 [0.60 (0.24; 0.96) mL/min/1.73 m2/year]; the absolute benefit was consistent across all HbA1c, BP, BMI and UACR subgroups (all P-interaction > .5).

Conclusion

A clinically meaningful reduction in risk of chronic kidney disease progression was observed with semaglutide versus placebo regardless of HbA1c, BP, BMI, and UACR levels.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^113WDvAY]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommended using GLP‐1 RA in patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualised glycaemic targets despite using metformin and SGLT2i or cannot use SGLT2i. Following the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of semaglutide observed in the FLOW trial, the 2025 guidelines noted that semaglutide can also be used as a first‐line agent for people with T2D and CKD. Relying on accumulating data that adding GLP‐1 RA to SGLT2i may offer additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits, several guidelines now recommend using both disease/diabetes‐modifying drugs (DMDs) together in many groups of patients with type 2 diabetes. No randomized controlled kidney outcome trial has directly compared kidney outcomes between GLP‐1 RA versus SGLT2i; thus, it is not clear which one is more beneficial, especially in low‐resource settings where patients may not have simultaneous access to both DMDs. This systematic review and meta‐analysis indicated that GLP‐1 RAs appeared to be associated with lower kidney risk compared to other glucose‐lowering agents but were inferior or not superior compared with SGLT2i. However, in addition to kidney protection, GLP‐1 RAs have additional benefits such as lowering blood glucose, body weight, blood pressure, and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The differential mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, and side effects of GLP1 RAs and SGLT2i, should be taken into consideration in the treatment choice to allow personalised tailoring of treatment.

This study has several limitations. A limited number of studies have reported kidney outcomes following initiation of GLP‐1 RA compared to a single class of GLAs in real‐world. We excluded studies that compared GLP‐1 RA against cohorts that combined several classes of GLAs due to the large heterogeneity in kidney outcomes among the GLAs' classes, as observed in our analysis. Real‐world data are limited by selection bias, as physicians aim to tailor treatment to patients' characteristics and preferences. Partially addressing these limitations, we included only studies that applied a statistical approach to balance the cohorts (e.g. inverse probability treatment weighting or propensity score), although no statistical method can completely emulate randomisation. Additional challenges in real‐world studies include variable duration of follow‐up, study populations, frequency of laboratory measurements, and baseline medications, among others.

### GLP-1-based therapeutics for cardiorenal protection in metabolic diseases [^114ydKVc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Over last decade, significant progress has been made in cardiorenal protection for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. With an expanding range of pharmacological options and continuously evolving guidelines, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have garnered substantial clinical and societal attention for their role in T2D and weight-management. GLP-1RAs have consistently demonstrated robust HbA1c- and bodyweight-reducing efficacy in clinical and real-world studies. In addition, mounting data established their cardiorenal benefits beyond glycemic control in select high-risk populations. In T2D, GLP-1RAs have been shown to improve both hard cardiovascular and, more recently, relevant kidney outcomes. Meanwhile, in individuals with obesity but without T2D, semaglutide (at a higher dose compared to T2D) reduces body-weight by up to 15%, and lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular-events by 20%. The success of GLP-1-based therapy fueled the development of new single-molecules, that combine GLP-1R agonism with activation of other entero-pancreatic hormone receptors (e.g. glucose-dependent insulinoptropic polypeptide [GIP], glucagon and amylin) aiming to achieve complementary and potentially synergistic effects. These next-generation GLP-1-based therapeutics for metabolic diseases, either already available or approaching clinical approval, appear to enhance the metabolic and weight-reducing efficacy compared to existing GLP-1RAs. An example is tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, which has been approved for both T2D and obesity-management, demonstrating up to 22.5% weight-loss in phase-3 trials. This review explores the landscape of current and emerging GLP-1-based therapies, their efficacy in managing hyperglycemia and bodyweight, recent evidence supporting their cardiorenal benefits, and clinical implications of these advancements.

Management of obesity in HF: pharmacologic interventions — trial signals and safety monitoring are presented as follows: The STEP-HFpEF program and SUMMIT trial are reported to show that weight loss is associated with improvements in symptoms and functional capacity; insufficient evidence exists to date to confidently conclude that semaglutide and tirzepatide reduce HF events in individuals with HFpEF and obesity (with stronger evidence for tirzepatide), although exploratory analyses indicate favorable changes in biomarkers and imaging parameters; during early-phase gradual cessation of semaglutide or tirzepatide, which occurs every 4 weeks, clinicians are advised to monitor kidney function and electrolytes with adjustment of diuretics, antihypertensive agents, and antihyperglycemic agents as indicated, particularly if gastrointestinal adverse effects are prominent.

### Effects of semaglutide with and without concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor use in participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease in the FLOW trial [^115NT22n]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the three kidney outcomes trials examining SGLT2i, the use of GLP-1 RAs was rare, below 5% –. Only one of these three trials, to our knowledge, published data on the GLP-1 RA subgroup (n = 122 of 4,304) and found no interaction of GLP-1 RA use with SGLT2i benefits on main outcomes. A recent meta-analysis of all major SGLT2i outcome trials focused on 3,065/72,970 participants using GLP-1 RAs (4%) simultaneously with SGLT2i/placebo. The authors concluded that CV and kidney benefits of SGLT2i were independent of background use of GLP-1 RAs. There are numerous CV outcome trials in T2D that examined either GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2i. However, a history of CKD was rare in those trials and combined use (non-randomized and non-stratified) of both drug classes was reported in 0–5.3%. Lam et al. analyzed the AMPLITUDE-O trial, which examined a GLP-1 RA versus placebo and stratified for SGLT2i use (618 participants, 15.2%). Overall, in this general T2D cohort, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs on CV and kidney outcomes were not impacted by SGLT2i use. However, there was a strong trend for SGLT2i to enhance albuminuria and heart failure benefits, but blunting benefits on myocardial infarction and stroke of the GLP-1 RA in AMPLITUDE-O. Similar data stem from a CV outcomes trial that examined an SGLT2i versus placebo, DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58). Several smaller short-term trials reported additive effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2i on surrogate outcomes such as body weight, blood pressure and HbA 1c –.

### Liraglutide vs semaglutide vs dulaglutide in veterans with type 2 diabetes [^1152mg3V]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Among the 29.7 million US adults with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality. Furthermore, 30% to 40% of patients with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, leading to significant morbidity and health care costs. Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is an emerging focus for patients with diabetes, highlighting the shared pathophysiology among diabetes, CVD, and chronic kidney disease.

Among therapeutic options for diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) offer important advantages for patients with CKM. In pivotal randomized clinical trials, compared with placebo, GLP-1RAs decreased all-cause mortality, CVD, and kidney function decline in patients with diabetes. Given their effectiveness and safety, use of GLP-1RAs has grown substantially since exenatide first became available in 2005. As of 2022, more than 5.1 million patients with diabetes use GLP-1RAs. Nonetheless, cost and equitable access to GLP-1RAs remain an issue.

As the GLP-1RA market expands and generic GLP-1RAs become available starting in 2025, understanding intraclass differences on clinical outcomes is essential. Beyond glycemic control, liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide are all approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent CVD outcomes in patients with diabetes. Although all 3 drugs have shown beneficial effects on early markers of kidney damage (ie, decreased albuminuria or prevented declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), evidence is limited on their effects as a class on more advanced kidney outcomes (eg, progression to end-stage kidney disease). Only semaglutide is approved in the US by the FDA for slowing chronic kidney disease progression in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no head-to-head trial has directly compared effects of individual GLP-1RAs on clinical events. One indirect meta-analysis of 7 trials including 56 004 participants suggested that semaglutide was associated with lower rates of CVD events and CVD death, and only 1 cohort study reported similar effectiveness between liraglutide and dulaglutide for CVD and kidney outcomes.

In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: is tirzepatide superior to insulin glargine in patients with T2DM with regard to renal outcomes? In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 1995 patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus, chronic or acute pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopathy requiring urgent treatment, heart attack or stroke in the past 2 months. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 995 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1000 insulin glargine (titrated to 100 U/mL SC once daily). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration decline (1.4 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²; AD -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -1.6 to -2.8). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in urine albumin-creatinine ratio reduction (6.8% vs. -36.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 37.7). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine with respect to estimated glomerular filtration decline.

### Effect of semaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events by baseline kidney parameters in participants with type 2 diabetes and at high risk of cardiovascular disease: SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 post hoc pooled analysis [^116r9r6p]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the established kidney-related effects of SGLT2is from kidney outcomes trials, there are currently no data from kidney outcomes trials demonstrating efficacy of GLP-1RAs regarding kidney-related endpoints. However, several CVOTs have included participants with reduced kidney function, enabling the introduction of GLP-1RAs in guidelines and consensus statements addressing CKD treatment. A meta-analysis including data from GLP-1RA CVOTs has shown that GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of MACE versus placebo in people with T2D at high CV risk, including in those with low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Moreover, GLP-1RAs reduced the relative risk for a composite kidney outcome (time to development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine or ≥ 40% eGFR decline, kidney replacement therapy, or kidney-related death) compared with placebo; an earlier CVOT meta-analysis indicated that this effect of GLP-1RAs was largely driven by a reduction in albuminuria. In participants with T2D and CKD (stages 3–4), the GLP-1RA dulaglutide reduced decline in eGFR as a secondary outcome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic and progressive metabolic disorder associated with an elevated risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), which can result in considerable morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown that, while the effect of intensive blood glucose control decreases the risk of microvascular complications after a median of 5 years of follow‐up, its effect on macrovascular complications is only observed in the longer term for some cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, more recently, some glucose‐lowering medication classes have demonstrated significant CV benefit versus placebo in far shorter timeframes in their cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). These include glucagon‐like peptide receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2is).

For patients with T2D who have established CVD or indicators of high risk of CVD, GLP‐1 RAs and SGLT‐2is are recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology. However, based on findings of CVOTs, the ADA and EASD recommend GLP‐1 RAs as the preferred option when atherosclerotic CVD predominates and SGLT‐2is as the preferred option when heart failure (HF) or chronic kidney disease predominates. As well as differences between treatment classes, previous analyses suggest that CV benefit may vary within treatment class. There are currently no head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CV benefit within treatment classes, and, in the absence of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on a standardized approach to the design of CVOTs, differences in study design between some CVOTs can make indirect comparison challenging. Robust, within‐class comparison could help to guide decisions on which product in a treatment class should be used to treat individual patients with T2D with CVD or CV risk factors.

The 10th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit: Congress on Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Metabolic Outcomes was held virtually on December 5–6, 2024. This year, discussions about cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcome trials centered on the recent findings from studies involving empagliflozin (EMPACT-MI), semaglutide (STEP-HFpEF-DM and FLOW), tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-OSA and SUMMIT), and finerenone (FINEARTS-HF). These studies represent significant advances in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and improving metabolic outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The congress also comprised sessions on novel and established therapies for managing HFpEF, CKD, and obesity; guidelines for managing CKD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); organ crosstalk and the development of cardio-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome; precision medicine and person-centered management of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD; early detection of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and strategies to delay its onset; continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery (AID); cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and the diabetic heart; and the role of primary care in the early detection, prevention and management of CKM diseases. The contribution of environmental plastic pollution to CVD risk, the increasing understanding of the efficacy and safety of incretin therapies in the treatment of CKM diseases, and the latest updates on nutrition strategies for CKM management under incretin-based therapies were also topics of interest for a vast audience of endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists, nephrologists and primary care physicians, who actively engaged in online discussions. The 11th CVOT Summit will be held virtually on November 20–21, 2025 (http://www.cvot.org).

Evidence gaps and research needs — Most included studies had shorter-term follow-up. The evidence was very uncertain regarding predefined subgroups of interest, including demographic subgroups, treatment-naive patients, and patients with established CVD or CKD, and evidence was insufficient or had low certainty regarding cost-effectiveness analyses directly comparing newer type 2 diabetes medications or pharmacologic classes. For newer type 2 diabetes medications compared with usual care, evidence was not available on the effects of GLP-1 agonists for the progression of CKD and effects of tirzepatide on MI, stroke, hospitalizations for CHF, and progression of CKD. Evidence from RCTs was lacking for examined newer diabetes pharmacologic classes in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated, and the net benefit and cost-effectiveness of combined formulations or combined treatments with newer pharmacologic classes beyond glycemic control are currently unknown.

### CVOT summit report 2024: new cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic outcomes [^116CYMTn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, CVOTs with DPP-4is, GLP-1RAs, SGLT2is, and finerenone included a three-point composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (3P-MACE): CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal stroke. DPP-4is were noninferior to placebo in the 3P-MACE. However, saxagliptin, among DPP-4is, was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). In addition, CV benefits, including reduction in the number of HHF, have been observed with SGLT2is, some GLP-1 RAs, and finerenone.

In metabolic outcome trials, significant effects on weight reduction were shown with semaglutide (GLP-1RA) and tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 RA) in people with or without T2D. Recently, the 3-year safety outcomes of the SURMOUNT-1 trial with tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 RA) were reported, confirming its efficacy in reducing weight and delaying progression to T2D in persons with both obesity and prediabetes. Results of the SURMOUNT-5 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT05822830), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 RA) compared with semaglutide (GLP-1 RA) in adults with obesity or overweight, at least one weight-related comorbidity but no T2D, are in process and expected to be presented and published in 2025. Recently reported top-line results indicate a 47% greater relative weight loss with tirzepatide compared to semaglutide over 72 weeks of treatment.

### Forecasting trial milestones: a predictive analysis for early termination of the SOUL study [^117FKPT6]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases and is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and death. It is also one of the most common causes of end-stage renal disease. Treatment with RAAS blockade, statins, anti-platelets, and SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended by all major associations to reduce major adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and these drugs are considered the standard of care. Although renal and cardiac outcomes have improved over time with these medications, a therapeutic gap persists; renal and cardiovascular outcomes remain suboptimal in patients with T2D.

The LEADER trial of liraglutide, conducted on 9340 patients, was the first trial in which a GLP1RA was used to document an improvement in MACE in patients with T2D and established ASCVD. Since then, other trials of multiple other GLP1RAs have demonstrated similar improvements in MACE and a probable improvement in renal outcomes.

Semaglutide, the newest GLP1RA, is widely used as the most powerful and efficacious GLP1RA. The SUSTAIN 6 trial, conducted on 3297 patients and followed up for 104 weeks, compared once weekly injections of semaglutide with placebo in patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease (previous cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease), chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III) or chronic kidney disease ≥ stage 3 or age ≥ 60 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The primary outcome occurred in 6.6% of patients in the semaglutide group and in 8.9% of patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). This difference was driven primarily by a reduction in nonfatal stroke, which occurred in 1.6% of patients in the semaglutide arm compared to 2.7% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI 0.38–0.99; P = 0.04). The rates of new or worsening nephropathy were lower in the semaglutide group. The recently published FLOW trial, conducted on 3533 patients and followed up for 177 weeks, comparing injectable once weekly semaglutide with placebo, revealed that semaglutide reduced the risk of clinically important kidney outcomes and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

The PIONEER-6 trial investigated CV safety of oral semaglutide, the first FDA-approved oral GLP-1 RA. PIONEER-6 included a total of 3183 patients randomized to receive oral semaglutide (14 mg daily after an 8 week run-in period of 3 mg and 7 mg oral semaglutide for 4 weeks, respectively) or placebo for a median follow-up period of 15.9 months. Eligible patients had an age ≥ 50 years and established CVD or CKD, or, if ≥ 60 years of age ≥ 1 CV risk factor. In total, 84.7% of patients were ≥ 50 years and had established CVD of CKD. Primary outcome was a composite of death from CV causes (including undetermined causes of death), non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. Secondary CV outcomes encompassed (a) an expanded composite outcome (primary endpoint plus unstable angina resulting in hospitalization or HF resulting in hospitalization), (b) a composite of death from any cause, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke and (c) the individual components of the previously listed outcomes. Efficacy outcomes included HbA1c level, body weight, and lipid levels.

### Finerenone in patients across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use [^1136fWCc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of the global diabetes burden and is the leading cause of kidney failure in developed countries. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 40% of people with T2D, and in comparison with T2D alone, comorbid CKD leads to three times greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) are recommended in patients with T2D, and guidelines were updated in 2020 to recommend GLP‐1RAs for patients with T2D and CV disease and/or high risk for CV events to reduce the risk of CV disease progression.GLP‐1RAs are also recommended for use in patients with CKD and T2D who have not achieved individualized glycaemic targets despite use of metformin and a sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Moreover, despite the use of guideline‐recommended therapies, some patients with CKD and T2D still experience CKD progression or kidney failure, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic options in this patient population. Previous CV outcome trials have indicated potential benefits with regard to kidney outcomes. Thus, GLP‐1RAs have been shown to reduce the risk of developing or worsening CKD mostly by reducing the development of overt albuminuria. Potential protective mechanisms of GLP‐1RAs include attenuation of oxidative stress, fibrosis, and cellular apoptosis in the kidney. In a pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes) and LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results) trials, semaglutide and liraglutide were suggested to have kidney‐protective effects in patients with T2D, which will need to be proven by the ongoing FLOW trial.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to improve cardiorenal outcomes: data from FLOW and beyond [^111KikA3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), initially approved for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have emerged as agents for weight loss, cardiovascular and kidney protection. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the benefits of these therapies on cardiorenal outcomes.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events with GLP1RA treatments. Recently, the FLOW trial revealed that semaglutide reduced the composite outcome of kidney failure, at least 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, kidney or cardiovascular mortality by 24% in patients with T2DM, thereby establishing GLP1RA as a pillar of therapy in this population. New evidence suggests favorable effects on kidney endpoints in nondiabetic individuals with overweight or obesity. Dedicated trials have also provided evidence for reduction in the risk for heart failure hospitalization and improvement in symptoms in individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Subgroup analyses have suggested that GLP1RAs confer additive cardiorenal benefits irrespective of background medication use.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that GLP1RA reduces the risk for cardiovascular events, chronic kidney disease progression, and heart failure hospitalizations. Further data on the effect of dual and triple GLP1-based therapies on cardiorenal outcomes is required.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, increasing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension and death. Given that the prevalence of CKD in T2D is predicted to increase over the next 20 years, additional treatment strategies that offer kidney protection will be critical for this patient population. Therapeutic agents that showed CV and/or kidney benefits are approved for use in patients with T2D, including treatments from the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) class.CV outcomes trials, including LEADER, REWIND, SUSTAIN‐6 and AWARD‐7, have proven the CV benefits and reported a kidney protective effect of GLP‐1RAs, in addition to glucose and weight‐reducing effects. Notably, the LEADER trial included patients with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 80 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (~75% of patients had an eGFR of ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and showed a reduction in blood glucose and body weight with liraglutide that was independent of eGFR at baseline, with subgroup analyses suggesting the potential for greater benefit with respect to CV outcomes in patients with a lower eGFR.CV benefits were also observed with injectable semaglutide in the SUSTAIN‐6 trial in which > 70% of patients had normal kidney function or mild kidney impairment at baseline. Secondary outcomes and analyses from GLP‐1RA trials have suggested that these agents may also have kidney protective effects, but these observations need to be confirmed in dedicated trials with a primary kidney disease outcome, such as the ongoing FLOW trial of injectable semaglutide versus placebo. In patients with CKD and T2D, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines of 2020 recommends a GLP‐1RA with a proven CV benefit for those who have not achieved glycaemic targets following therapeutic management with metformin and a sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor.

### Effect of semaglutide versus placebo on cardiorenal outcomes by prior cardiovascular disease and baseline body mass index: pooled post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 [^116bBNZi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This pooled post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 CVOTs demonstrated that the cardiorenal effects of semaglutide are consistent in people with T2D at high CV risk or with established CVD, regardless of prior CVD and baseline BMI, even when accounting for various degrees of weight loss.

This analysis shows that the risk of primary MACE, expanded MACE, and new or worsening nephropathy was significantly reduced with semaglutide versus placebo in the overall study population. Cardiorenal benefits were consistent across subgroups with and without prior revascularisation, MI, or stroke/TIA. Our findings support previous observations from a CVOT meta‐analysis demonstrating that GLP‐1RAs reduced the overall risk of individual MACE components, all‐cause mortality, hospitalisation for HF, and worsening kidney function versus placebo in T2D; moreover, the effect of GLP‐1RAs on MACE risk was consistent regardless of prior established CVD. Similarly, previous observations showed that both formulations of semaglutide reduced the relative risk of primary MACE versus placebo in people with T2D across varying CV risk and established CVD and/or CKD.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^114ixkaC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) — Recommendation 4.3.1 states that in patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite metformin and SGLT2i, or who are unable to use those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B). The commentary notes cardiovascular benefit has been shown for liraglutide, dulaglutide, injectable semaglutide, and albiglutide, with lack of cardiovascular benefit with lixisenatide and exenatide and oral semaglutide, and that in the oral semaglutide PIONEER 6 study there were significant reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality; thus, they suggest the guideline line be modified to recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefits. For kidney outcomes, KDIGO states the composite kidney outcome benefit for liraglutide was driven primarily by reduction in new severely increased albuminuria, and exploratory analyses in REWIND show possible preservation of eGFR with dulaglutide when using eGFR reductions of 40% and 50% from baseline, whereas the primary analysis of a sustained reduction of 30% from baseline did not show this.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^115kyHPx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dual agonists activating the GLP-1 receptor and the receptor of the other major hormone of the incretin system, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), are also in clinical development. Such and other combination therapies that integrate a GLP-1 RA and additional relevant compounds may hold additional potential. Results from the SURPASS programme for tirzepatide have shown that this dulaglutide-based GLP-1/GIP dual agonist provide profound glycaemic and weight-related benefits, which may translate into corresponding kidney-protection. Furthermore, the combination of the once-weekly GLP-1 RA semaglutide and the amylin analogue, cagrilintide, has displayed similar promising efficacy results on body weight that seem to go beyond what is achievable with semaglutide alone. Amylin clearance predominantly happens via the renal route, suggesting the effects of amylin, whether beneficial or risk-associated, could be more pronounced in people with CKD.

The current KDIGO guideline recommends blockade of the RAAS and SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with DKD. In addition, the American Diabetes Association now recommends finerenone in case of SGLT-2 inhibitor intolerance or inadequacy. Further expanding the treatment options for people with DKD, GLP-1 RA treatment may provide additional benefits (Figure 1), including body weight reduction. Recent evidence supports the safe combined use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAsand that the benefits of finerenone are independent of GLP-1 RA treatment in people with DKD. Thus, combined appropriate use of these three drug classes may offer added or even synergistic benefits to people with DKD.

In conclusion, data from clinical trials and real-world evidence suggest a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in DKD as reflected by the prioritisation of the drug class in current treatment guidelines. Confirmatory and mechanistic trials are ongoing, which will provide additional insights, potentially allowing for the approved use of GLP-1 RAs to address the profound current unmet medical need for kidney protection in diabetes, alone or in combination with other treatment options.

With regards to CV outcomes, there are no completed CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) for oral semaglutide at present. The event-driven, double-blind PIONEER 6 trial, for which data analysis was halted as soon as it accumulated the necessary number of events to demonstrate noninferiority, was powered to determine excess CV risk associated with oral semaglutide and demonstrated noninferiority of oral semaglutide to placebo, ruling out an excess CV risk. Post hoc analysis of PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 showed that semaglutide consistently improved major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) outcomes versus placebo, irrespective of the mode of administration. In addition, a post hoc analysis of the LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 trials demonstrated that semaglutide was particularly effective in reducing stroke incidence in patients with T2D and high CV risk, a complication that is considered by people with T2D to be a particular concern. PIONEER 6 was not powered to prove superiority and, thus, CV benefit. However, the ongoing SOUL CVOT (A Heart Disease Study of Semaglutide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes; NCT03914326) will further inform on CV outcomes with oral semaglutide over a longer period of time and assess a larger population than PIONEER 6. The primary endpoint is time to the first occurrence of MACE, and this trial is powered for an assessment of superiority compared to placebo.

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^113c45e2]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The comparators across the trials' program were diverse. Some of the comparators, such as GLP-1RAs dulaglutide and semaglutide, have proven cardiovascular benefits as reflected in their product-labeled indications and endorsement across professional society guidelines and recommendations, which would attenuate the comparative estimate of cardiovascular effect of tirzepatide. It was assumed, however, that any such effect would be negligible due to the short treatment duration of pooled trials and apparent lag time required to observe MACE benefits with dulaglutide or semaglutide (as reported by the placebo-controlled trials). Placebo and the basal insulins included in the trials are considered to be neutral with regard to cardiovascular risk, with pre-specified analyses of this subset of comparators likely to more accurately reflect the cardiovascular safety of tirzepatide. Both subset analyses, including an analysis of the SURPASS-4 trial only and an analysis of all insulin and placebo comparator trials, were generally consistent with the MACE-4 result of the entire pooled population. Collectively, these data meet the regulatory cardiovascular safety criterion for consideration of a novel anti-hyperglycemic medication for initial approval, statistically excluding the upper confidence limit of the 95% CI of 1.8. Furthermore, some of these findings provide optimism for the potential positive cardiovascular effects of tirzepatide (aiming for a maximum dose of 15 mg per day) being tested in the ongoing outcome trial SURPASS-CVOT.

All individual trials had a balanced distribution of cardiovascular risk factors between pooled tirzepatide and control groups. However, this was not the case when participants were pooled from all trials. In SURPASS-4 (that is, participants with high cardiovascular risk), there was a higher ratio of participants in the control arm who had cardiovascular risk factors due to the 1:1 randomization scheme between the tirzepatide and insulin glargine groups. Therefore, these meta-analyses were based on pre-specified estimates adjusted for different randomization ratios between pooled tirzepatide versus pooled control in different trial-level cardiovascular risk strata. Without adjustment, the control group would be enriched with high-cardiovascular-risk participants, subject to more MACE, and would thus bias the results toward a lower HR in favor of tirzepatide.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^114CHNk4]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Combinations with GLP-1 RAs

Several clinical trials have shown significant CV benefits of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2D who were at high risk of CV events, with many of these individuals also taking a RAAS inhibitor at baseline. In many cases, this benefit of a GLP-1 RA was also seen in patients with or without kidney dysfunction at baseline. Key data from GLP-1 RAs trials are summarized in Table 2.

In T2D, GLP-1–stimulated insulin secretion is diminished, although this process may be restored with administration of a GLP-1 RA. GLP-1 RAs are also associated with gastric emptying and increased satiety, leading to weight loss. The importance of this mechanism is highlighted by recent research that suggests that weight loss at thresholds associated with normoglycemia and normotension may reduce CKD.

GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2is exhibit different mechanisms that affect glucose metabolism; consequently, GLP-1 RAs are typically added to current antiglycemic treatments if there is ongoing hyperglycemia despite treatment and after taking patient factors into account. In some instances, SGLT2is may offer more cardiorenal protection than GLP-1 RAs alone, further indicating a need to combine these therapies to maximize the cardiorenal protection afforded to patients at risk. In a meta-analysis of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i clinical trials, the authors concluded that the prevention of heart failure and kidney disease progression by SGLT2is should be considered in the decision-making process when treating people with T2D; although SGLT2is may be preferred over GLP-1 RAs in select patients. Overall, combining an SGLT2i and a GLP-1 RA may provide a holistic approach to improving outcomes in patients with CKD and high CV risk.

The impact of the GLP-1 RA semaglutide (plus maximum tolerated RAAS inhibitor) on kidney and CV outcomes is being investigated in the ongoing phase 3 FLOW clinical trial in patients with T2D and CKD (NCT0381915) (Table 3). This trial was stopped in October 2023 at interim analysis due to meeting certain prespecified efficacy criteria (Novo Nordisk company announcement, October 10, 2023) (Table 3).

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^116KywQU]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular outcomes, long-term efficacy and safety

In people with T2D and established cardiovascular disease, the international guidelines for T2D recommend the use of GLP-1 RA or sodium glucose co-transporters 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) as first-line treatment (independent of HbA1c), based on multiple trials demonstrating their cardio-renal benefits. In people with obesity and established cardiovascular disease but without diabetes, semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events [(MACE), death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke] compared to placebo (SELECT trial) after a mean follow-up of 39.8 months – this is the first trial demonstrating cardiovascular benefit for an obesity pharmacotherapy.

Despite the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide 2.4mg, whether the combination of GLP-1 RA with other entero-pancreatic hormones will also improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with obesity and/or T2D needs to be established. The SURPASS-CVOT trial (NCT04255433) will assess the cardiovascular safety of tirzepatide compared to dulaglutide in people with T2D and established atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, the SURMOUNT–MMO (tirzepatide, NCT05556512) will assess the impact of the dual GLP-1/GIP RA in cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality for people with obesity (without diabetes) when the REDEFINE-3 study will assess the impact of cagrisema in people with obesity (with and without T2DM) and established cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the oral GLP-1 RA will also need to demonstrate their cardiovascular safety in these populations (NCT05803421).

### Older adults' views on insurance coverage for weight management medications [^111bD6Mp]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the US, with approximately half of all adults estimated to have obesity by 2030. Obesity is also a risk factor for many costly medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver disease, and cancer. Obesity was associated with an estimated $173 billion in US annual health care spending per year in 2019 dollars, with the highest estimated costs occurring among people ages 60 to 70 years with severe obesity. Overall social and economic costs of obesity were estimated at $1.2 trillion, or 6.7% of gross domestic product, in 2018 dollars. Even modest reduction in body weight of 5% can improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs through a variety of effective treatments, including lifestyle change, weight management medication (WMM), and metabolic surgery.

Since 2012, new and more effective WMMs have become available for treatment of obesity or overweight with comorbidities, such as hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea. The newest class of medications, incretin mimetics, includes glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor agonists. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 3 medications in this class for weight management: liraglutide in 2014, semaglutide in 2021, and tirzepatide in 2023. These medications are effective at treating obesity and preventing and treating complications of obesity, including obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Older WMMs, including phentermine, approved in 1959; phentermine-topiramate, approved in 2012; and bupropion-naltrexone, approved in 2014, are also approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity or overweight with comorbidities.

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^114QLkpm]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This prospectively planned, pooled individual participant data, cardiovascular safety meta-analysis was conducted for the tirzepatide T2D clinical development program, SURPASS. The overall cardiovascular findings indicate that tirzepatide treatment given for a median duration of just over 1 year, at a mean randomization dose of 9.9 mg per week to a population with just over one-third having established cardiovascular disease, is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk when compared to placebo or comparators not known to be cardioprotective, with point estimates of HR < 1.0 and upper confidence limits of 95% CI < 1.8 for all MACE components. Furthermore, the incidence of MACE-4 with tirzepatide starts to diverge from the control groups after approximately 1 year. A similar pattern was observed in most previous GLP-1RA cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) –.

The population in the SURPASS clinical development program included a wide spectrum of people on the continuum of T2D — from participants treated with diet and exercise alone with a mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years (SURPASS-1) to participants for whom basal insulin treatment was insufficient with a mean duration of diabetes of 13.3 years (SURPASS-5). Similarly, participants' cardiovascular risk varied among trials. The SURPASS-4 trial enrolled participants at especially high cardiovascular risk, with enrichment criteria including previous cardiovascular event, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Consequently, as anticipated in the planning of the cardiovascular safety meta-analysis, this trial had the highest MACE incidence and contributed considerably to events analyzed in the present study. On the other hand, as similar changes in cardiovascular surrogate markers (HbA1c, weight, blood pressure and lipoproteins) by tirzepatide were observed in studies with high or moderate cardiovascular risk, it was assumed that the relative treatment effect would not be different regardless of the participants' baseline cardiovascular risk level. Moreover, baseline cardiovascular risk did not modify the estimate of treatment effects of GLP-1RAs on MACE.

Table 3
Overview of the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of T2DM

HbA1c glycated haemoglobin, MACE major adverse cardiac event, OAM oral anti-hyperglycaemic medication, SAE serious adverse event, SGLT2i sodium–glucose co-transporter 2, SU sulfonylurea

SURPASS-CVOT is a large phase 3, randomised, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes trial for tirzepatide assessing both non-inferiority and superiority of tirzepatide against dulaglutide (1.5 mg weekly). The SURPASS-CVOT will include 12,500 participants with T2DM (aged 40 years, HbA1c between 7.5% and 10.5%, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease from 30 countries. In addition to study drug, participants should continue to receive standard medical care for diabetes which include concomitant oral glucose-lowering therapy and/ or various insulin regimens. Participants who have treatment with any GLP-1 RA or pramlintide in 3 months prior to screening visit and who discontinue a GLP-1 RA or pramlintide because of intolerability are excluded from the study. Participants with sever heart failure (NYHA class 4) and those with end-stage renal disease or on dialysis are excluded from the study. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline is one of the stratification factors for randomisation. Tirzepatide is started at 2.5 mg weekly and to be escalated to 15 mg weekly or to the highest maintenance dose tolerated by the study participant. The dose of dulaglutide is initiated and maintained at 1.5 mg weekly. A sham dose escalation of dulaglutide will be employed to maintain the double-blind study design. The primary outcome measure is time to first occurrence of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke (MACE-3). Secondary outcome measures include time to all-cause mortality, time to occurrence of each component of the primary endpoint, time to first occurrence of new or worsening nephropathy and change in body weight, HbA1c, urine albumin to creatinine ratio and lipid profile from baseline. The study is event-driven and is expected to run for approximately 54 months (randomisation up to study completion).

Mechanism of benefit from AOM in HFpEF — Whether the benefits of semaglutide and tirzepatide in obesity-related HF are attributable to weight loss or another mechanism distinct to the action of these therapies is not established and is under ongoing investigation (NCT03571496). The extent of weight loss likely mediates benefit, although there may be distinct mechanistic advantages given observed improvements in diastolic function and reductions in left ventricular mass and paracrine adipose tissue; semaglutide and tirzepatide are also associated with favorable effects on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine albumin-creatinine ratio, NT-proBNP, and high-sensitivity troponin. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the encouraging findings from STEP-HFpEF and SUMMIT will be confirmed with a statistically robust, long-term reduction in cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF or apply to those who are overweight or have normal BMI.

### Tirzepatide, the newest medication for type 2 diabetes: a review of the literature and implications for clinical practice [^111JsVvS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through September 7, 2022, using the keyword "tirzepatide".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with available results were included.

Data Synthesis

Seven published phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trials investigated efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Studies included adults with uncontrolled T2DM and body mass index above 23 or 25 kg/m 2. Hemoglobin A1c reduction from baseline was greater with tirzepatide across all studies with absolute reductions up to 3.02% and relative reductions ranging 0.44% (vs semaglutide) to 2.11% (vs placebo). Weight loss was significant. Incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (AE) was similar to semaglutide, and major cardiovascular events was similar to insulin glargine.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Studies demonstrated greater A1c lowering and weight reduction versus placebo and active comparators with AE similar to semaglutide, suggesting tirzepatide will be a valuable addition to the growing list of antidiabetic medications. Although tirzepatide's effects on major cardiovascular events was not increased when compared with insulin glargine, further evidence is needed to assess long-term implications on cardiovascular outcomes compared with agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide has the potential to significantly impact the clinical management of T2DM, and results of ongoing clinical trials will help to fully determine its place in therapy.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a review [^117M2Ned]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) reduce cardiovascular events in at-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes. Despite these findings, GLP-1RAs are underused in eligible patients, particularly by cardiologists.

Observations

To date, randomized clinical trials of albiglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide have reported favorable cardiovascular outcomes. Most recently approved for clinical use, oral semaglutide has a favorable safety profile and is currently undergoing regulatory evaluation and further study for cardiovascular outcomes. Professional society guidelines now recommend GLP-1RA therapy for cardiovascular risk mitigation in patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple ASCVD risk factors, independent of glucose control or background antihyperglycemic therapy (other diabetes medications being used). Additional conditions suitable for GLP-1RA therapy include obesity and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), for which cardiovascular risk-reducing options are limited. Out-of-pocket costs and secondary advantages (eg, weight loss) may inform shared decision-making discussions regarding potential therapies. GLP-1RA therapy has a favorable safety profile. Its most common adverse effect is gastrointestinal upset, which typically wanes during the early weeks of therapy and may be mitigated by starting at the lowest dose and escalating as tolerated. Depending on baseline glycemic control, sulfonylureas and insulin may need to be decreased before GLP-1RA initiation; without concurrent use of insulin or sulfonylureas, GLP-1RAs are not associated with hypoglycemia. Multidisciplinary follow-up and collaborative care with primary care physicians and/or endocrinologists are important.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings from this review suggest that GLP-1RAs are safe, are well tolerated, and improve cardiovascular outcomes, largely independent of their antihyperglycemic properties, but they remain underused by cardiologists. This review provides a practical resource for cardiologists for initiating GLP-1RAs and managing the therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or high risk for ASCVD.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^113RQvfw]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

It is relevant to compare the SELECT study safety results with those of other semaglutide studies when assessing the risk–benefit profile. The STEP studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in addition to lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity with or without diabetes. Because the SELECT study excluded patients with diabetes, a comparison with the non‐diabetes STEP studies (STEP 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8) is warranted. These studies enrolled predominantly female patients (74%–81%) with a younger mean age (46–47 years), higher mean BMI (38 kg/m 2), and shorter treatment duration (68–204 weeks). In the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN 6) CVOT, patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD, chronic kidney disease, or both were randomized to once‐weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or placebo. This study population was more comparable with the SELECT study but had diabetes, had a shorter duration of treatment (104 weeks), and used a lower maintenance dose of semaglutide (up to 1.0 mg).

SAEs in the non‐diabetes STEP studies were less frequent than in the SELECT study and ranged from 7.7% to 9.8% for semaglutide versus 2.9% to 11.8% for placebo, reflecting shorter study durations and younger, healthier populations. In contrast, the proportions of SAEs in the SUSTAIN 6 CVOT were 35% (43.5 events per 100 PYO) and 33.6% (36.7 events per 100 PYO) for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, versus 39.9% (44.8 events per 100 PYO) and 36.1% (41.1 events per 100 PYO) for placebo. Although the proportions of patients with events in the SELECT study were similar to SUSTAIN 6, the event rates in the SELECT study are lower both in the patients treated with semaglutide (22.6 events per 100 PYO) and those treated with placebo (25.8 events per 100 PYO), despite the higher semaglutide dose in SELECT (2.4 mg vs. 0.5 and 1.0 mg).

### GLP-1 receptor agonists vs DPP-4 inhibitors and mortality in diabetes and advanced CKD… [^116Tg5VT]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes, advanced-stage CKD, and ESKD than was treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors. Additional well-designed, prospective studies are needed to confirm the potential benefit of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment for patients with advanced CKD or ESKD. End-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis was verified by identifying insured individuals who had a diagnostic code for ESKD and received an appropriate catastrophic illness certificate for maintenance dialysis. Patients who were first prescribed either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a DPP-4 inhibitor 3 months before the index date were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality after the index date during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were sepsis- or infection-related mortality and MACCE-related mortality.

MACCE included myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, coronary revascularization, coronary artery bypass surgery, thrombolysis therapy, malignant arrhythmia, and stroke. MACCE-related mortality in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group was similar to that in the DPP-4 inhibitor group. The survival curve analysis for all-cause mortality, sepsis- and infection-related mortality, and MACCE-related mortality after propensity score weighting is provided in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. The 2 major findings of this study can be summarized as follows: use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with diabetes and stage 5 CKD or EKSD was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors.

In this cross-sectional study, in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 5 CKD or ESKD, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with better outcomes, including all-cause mortality and sepsis- and infection-related mortality, compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Additional large-scale, prospective studies are needed to examine our results.

### More data emerge for new antiobesity drugs… [^113eAKw7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Antiobesity drugs were front and center at the annual ObesityWeek conference, held in Dallas, Texas, this past October. "There was a huge focus on newer medications, their efficacy, their safety, gaps in knowledge, and what future studies are needed, " said John A. Batsis, MD, an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a member of the ObesityWeek 2023 program committee. New data were presented for tirzepatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist. Tirzepatide, branded as Zepbound, received US regulatory approval for chronic weight management 3 weeks after the meeting. Discussions also focused on semaglutide, the GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed as Wegovy for chronic weight management. Semaglutide and tirzepatide are hormone-mimicking drugs originally approved as diabetes therapies under the names Ozempic and Mounjaro, respectively. Ruder K.
