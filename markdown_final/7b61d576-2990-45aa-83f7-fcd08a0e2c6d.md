## Question

what are some typical side effects of ibuprofen is it safe for mild headaches

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical side effects of ibuprofen and whether it is safe to use for mild headaches. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications to anchor expected effects. Then, I should verify the most common adverse effects from authoritative sources. Next, I will examine serious but rare risks that change the risk-benefit calculus. After that, I need to check guideline positions on using ibuprofen for mild headaches and tension-type headache. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation with dosing and monitoring advice, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited data.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Ibuprofen is a nonselective NSAID that inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, providing analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects; it is indicated for symptomatic relief of mild to moderate pain, including headache, and is available over the counter in lower doses, which frames the context for occasional use in mild headaches [^3bcb1a70] [^62273ecd].

> I will now examine the most common side effects. Typical adverse effects are gastrointestinal and include dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and constipation; dizziness and headache are also reported, and these are generally mild and transient with single-dose or short-term use, which aligns with what we see in clinical trials and labeling summaries [^c97a07e2] [^dd3b55af].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without considering serious but rare risks. Ibuprofen carries boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, stroke) and serious gastrointestinal events (bleeding, ulceration, perforation), with risk rising with dose and duration; renal impairment, hypertension, and fluid retention can occur, and rare hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and severe skin reactions are possible, so I need to ensure we counsel on these even when treating mild headaches [^27db0266] [^f188217c].

> Next, I should review whether ibuprofen is effective and appropriate for mild headaches. For tension-type headache, high-quality evidence shows ibuprofen 400 mg improves the chance of being pain-free at 2 hours versus placebo, with an NNT around 14, and adverse event rates similar to placebo; VA/DoD guidelines suggest ibuprofen 400 mg or acetaminophen 1000 mg for acute treatment of tension-type headache, reflecting a weak recommendation with low-certainty evidence but a favorable safety profile in otherwise healthy adults [^c745dbe0] [^03e2060e] [^362aff15].

> Wait, let me verify the migraine data because I initially thought the NNT for 2-hour pain freedom with ibuprofen 400 mg was 3.2; that would be too low for pain freedom. On review, the Cochrane analysis shows ibuprofen 400 mg yields 2-hour pain freedom in 26% vs 12% with placebo, corresponding to an NNT of 7.2, whereas 2-hour headache relief is 57% vs 25% with an NNT of 3.2; I should correct that distinction to avoid overstating pain-free outcomes [^b4e361d6] [^eb84ba89].

> I need to ensure dosing and frequency are safe. For adults with normal renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular risk profiles, a single 200–400 mg dose with water and food is reasonable for a mild headache, not exceeding 1200 mg/day without clinician oversight; using the lowest effective dose and avoiding more than 2–3 days per week helps mitigate GI, CV, and renal risks and reduces the chance of medication overuse headache, which guidelines emphasize for both adults and adolescents [^5e7dea8e] [^03e2060e] [^3c9ba8e9].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific vulnerabilities. I should double-check contraindications and precautions: avoid ibuprofen in active peptic ulcer disease, severe heart failure, advanced renal disease, or known NSAID hypersensitivity; use caution in older adults, those with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or concurrent anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy; in pregnancy, limit NSAIDs to the second trimester if needed, and prefer acetaminophen otherwise, which materially changes the risk-benefit balance [^27db0266] [^83323274].

> Let me consider alternatives and special contexts. Acetaminophen 1000 mg is a reasonable alternative for mild headache, particularly when NSAID risks are a concern; for rapid relief, some data suggest faster onset with certain ibuprofen formulations (e.g., arginate), though availability varies and standard OTC ibuprofen remains effective; in pediatrics, ibuprofen is appropriate at weight-based dosing with attention to frequency limits to avoid medication overuse headache [^02e857b6] [^9b9d96ee] [^3c9ba8e9].

> I should confirm practical counseling points. Take ibuprofen with food or milk to reduce GI irritation, stay hydrated, and avoid combining with other NSAIDs or excessive alcohol; monitor for black stools, hematemesis, chest pain, dyspnea, edema, or changes in urination, and seek care if red flags occur; if headaches become frequent or refractory, reassess for primary headache disorders and medication overuse rather than escalating NSAID frequency [^27db0266] [^03e2060e].

> In summary, ibuprofen is generally safe and effective for occasional mild headaches in otherwise healthy adults when used at 200–400 mg per dose, not exceeding 1200 mg/day, and limited to infrequent use; typical side effects are mild GI upset and dizziness, while serious CV, GI, and renal risks are uncommon with short-term, low-dose use but warrant counseling and vigilance, especially in patients with comorbidities or those using interacting medications [^c745dbe0] [^c97a07e2] [^27db0266].

Ibuprofen is **generally safe for mild headaches** when used occasionally and at recommended doses (200–400 mg) [^5e7dea8e]. The most common side effects are **mild gastrointestinal symptoms** (nausea, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain) [^c97a07e2] and dizziness [^dd3b55af]; serious risks (GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment) are rare with short-term use but increase with higher doses, prolonged use, or in patients with risk factors [^27db0266]. For mild headaches, ibuprofen is effective and well tolerated; avoid use if you have peptic ulcer disease, significant cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or are pregnant, and limit use to avoid medication-overuse headache [^03e2060e] [^3c9ba8e9].

## Typical side effects of ibuprofen

Ibuprofen's side effects are **dose-dependent and more likely with prolonged use** [^f188217c]. The most common are gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms, while serious adverse effects are rare with short-term, low-dose use [^c745dbe0].

| **Side effect category** | **Common side effects (≥ 1%)** | **Less common/rare side effects (< 1%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Nausea <br/> - Heartburn <br/> - Indigestion <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Flatulence [^c97a07e2] | - Gastrointestinal bleeding <br/> - Peptic ulcer <br/> - Gastritis [^f188217c] |
| Neurologic | - Dizziness <br/> - Headache <br/> - Nervousness [^dd3b55af] | - Seizures <br/> - Aseptic meningitis (rare) [^c97a07e2] |

## Safety of ibuprofen for mild headaches

Ibuprofen is **effective and safe for mild headaches** when used occasionally at recommended doses (200–400 mg) [^5e7dea8e]. Clinical trials show significant pain relief with low rates of adverse events, similar to placebo in short-term use [^c745dbe0] [^b4e361d6]. Serious adverse effects (GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment) are rare with short-term use but increase with higher doses, prolonged use, or in patients with risk factors [^27db0266].

---

## Factors influencing safety and tolerability

Several factors influence **ibuprofen safety and tolerability**:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and prolonged use increase risks of GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse effects [^f188217c].
- **Age**: Older adults have higher risks of GI bleeding, renal impairment, and cardiovascular events [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Patients with peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or hypertension have increased risks [^27db0266].
- **Concurrent medications**: Anticoagulants, corticosteroids, SSRIs, and other NSAIDs increase risks of GI bleeding and renal impairment [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines support **occasional ibuprofen use for mild headaches** at recommended doses, with caution in patients with risk factors:

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Recommend ibuprofen 400 mg or acetaminophen 1000 mg for acute tension-type headache; benefits outweigh potential harms in short-term use [^03e2060e] [^362aff15].
- **AAN/AHS guidelines**: Support ibuprofen for acute migraine and tension-type headache, emphasizing early treatment and limiting frequency to avoid medication-overuse headache [^d0f7a4b7] [^3c9ba8e9].
- **ACOG guidelines**: Limit NSAID use in pregnancy to the second trimester due to fetal risks [^83323274].

---

## Precautions and contraindications

Ibuprofen should be **avoided or used with caution** in the following situations:

- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Increased risk of GI bleeding [^f188217c].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of MI and stroke [^27db0266].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Risk of renal impairment [^27db0266].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid, especially in the third trimester [^notfound].
- **Allergy to NSAIDs**: Contraindicated [^notfound].

---

## Alternative medications

Alternative medications for mild headaches include **acetaminophen**, which is effective and has a different safety profile, with less GI irritation but a risk of hepatotoxicity at high doses [^02e857b6] [^fe0037ca]. Aspirin is also effective but has higher GI bleeding risk and is not recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease [^479c43da] [^ca5a5fcb].

---

Ibuprofen is **safe and effective for mild headaches** when used occasionally at recommended doses, with minimal risk of serious adverse effects. Use caution in patients with risk factors and consider alternatives when appropriate [^03e2060e].

### Ibuprofen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^b4e361d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers do not seek professional help, relying instead on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce symptoms commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 22 April 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered ibuprofen to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and number needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Nine studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication. For ibuprofen 400 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo), 2-hour headache relief (57% versus 25%) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (45% versus 19%) were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. For ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (20% versus 10%) and 2-hour headache relief (52% versus 37%) were 9.7 and 6.3, respectively. The higher dose was significantly better for 2-hour headache relief than the lower dose. Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief.Associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia and functional disability were reduced within 2 hours, and fewer participants used rescue medication with ibuprofen compared with placebo. Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient.Ibuprofen 400 mg did not differ from rofecoxib 25 mg for 2-hour headache relief, 24-hour headache relief or use of rescue medication.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo.

### Ibuprofen for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache in adults [^c745dbe0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) affects about one person in five worldwide. It is divided into infrequent episodic TTH (fewer than one headache per month), frequent episodic TTH (1 to 14 headaches per month), and chronic TTH (15 headaches a month or more). Ibuprofen is one of a number of analgesics suggested for acute treatment of headaches in frequent episodic TTH.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of oral ibuprofen for treatment of acute episodic TTH in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and our own in-house database to January 2015. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching on-line clinical trial registers and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, placebo-controlled studies (parallel-group or cross-over) using oral ibuprofen for symptomatic relief of an acute episode of TTH. Studies had to be prospective and include at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) of oral ibuprofen compared to placebo for a range of outcomes, predominantly those recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS).

Main Results

We included 12 studies, all of which enrolled adult participants with frequent episodic TTH. Nine used the IHS diagnostic criteria, but two used the older classification of the Ad Hoc Committee, and one did not describe diagnostic criteria but excluded participants with migraines. While 3094 people with TTH participated in these studies, the numbers available for any form of analysis were lower than this; placebo was taken by 733, standard ibuprofen 200 mg by 127, standard ibuprofen 400 mg by 892, and fast-acting ibuprofen 400 mg by 230. Participants had moderate or severe pain at the start of treatment. Other participants were either in studies not reporting outcomes we could analyse, or were given one of several active comparators in single studies.For the IHS-preferred outcome of being pain free at 2 hours the NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg (all formulations) compared with placebo was 14 (95% confidence interval (CI), 8.4 to 47) in four studies, with no significant difference from placebo at 1 hour (moderate quality evidence). The NNT was 5.9 (4.2 to 9.5) for the global evaluation of 'very good' or 'excellent' in three studies (moderate quality evidence). No study reported the number of participants experiencing no worse than mild pain at 1 or 2 hours. The use of rescue medication was lower with ibuprofen 400 mg than with placebo, with the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNTp) of 8.9 (5.6 to 21) in two studies (low quality evidence).Adverse events were not different between ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo; RR 1.1 (0.64 to 1.7) (high-quality evidence). No serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen 400 mg provides an important benefit in terms of being pain free at 2 hours for a small number of people with frequent episodic tension-type headache who have an acute headache with moderate or severe initial pain. There is no information about the lesser benefit of no worse than mild pain at 2 hours.

Step 4: Acute treatment

Acute treatments can be classified as first-line, second-line, third-line and adjunct (Table 3), and should be used in a stepped care approach(Fig. 2). Our recommendations for each line of treatment are outlined below. The medications at each stage were selected on the basis of efficacy, tolerability, safety, cost and availability.

Table 3 
Acute migraine treatment

Fig. 2 
Stepped care across migraine attacks.

Preventive therapy, in addition, may be indicated at any stage. In general, initiation of preventive therapy is indicated in patients who are adversely affected on ≥2 days per month despite acute treatment optimized according to the stepped care approach. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

First-line medication

Over-the-counter analgesics are used worldwide for acute migraine treatment. Those with proven efficacy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the strongest evidence supports use of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium as first-line medications –. Paracetamol has less efficacyand should be used only in those who are intolerant of NSAIDs.

Second-line medication

Patients for whom over-the-counter analgesics provide inadequate headache relief should be offered a triptan. All triptans have well-documented effectiveness, but availability of and access to each vary between countries. Triptans are most effective when taken early in an attack, when the headache is still mild,. However, no evidence supports the use of triptans during the aura phase of a migraine attack. If one triptan is ineffective, others might still provide relief,. When all other triptans have failed or in patients who rapidly reach peak headache intensity or cannot take oral triptans because of vomiting, sumatriptan by subcutaneous injection can be useful.

Some patients can experience relapses, which are defined as a return of symptoms within 48 h after apparently successful treatment. Upon relapse, patients can repeat their triptan treatment or combine the triptan with simultaneous intake of fast-acting formulations of naproxen sodium, ibuprofen lysine or diclofenac potassium,. However, patients should be informed that repeating the treatment does not preclude further relapses and ultimately increases the risk of developing MOH.

### Efficacy of low-dose ibuprofen in acute migraine treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis [^86559e7a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen have been shown to be effective in treating migraine.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose ibuprofen for treatment of acute migraine attack.

Methods

Clinical trials were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM review, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2006 and historical searches of relevant articles. Studies were included if they (1) were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated ibuprofen tablets in moderate or severe migraine attacks in patients greater than 16 years of age, (2) evaluated at least one migraine attack, and (3) reported headache relief, pain-free, sustained pain-free, or relief of other migraine-associated symptoms at 2 hours. The MeSH search terms used were migraine disorders, headache, vascular headache, ibuprofen, adult, and clinical trial. This was followed by a key word search using migraine, cephalalgia, and cephalgia as key words. The reference lists of relevant articles were also scanned to identify possible published trials. There was no language restriction. Two authors extracted data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Results

Ibuprofen 200 and 400 mg were more effective than placebo in reducing pain intensity and eliminating pain (pain-free) within 2 hours in adults with moderate or severe migraine attacks. For the 200 mg dose, the number needed to treat was 8 (95% CI 5 to 20) for headache relief and 13 (95% CI 8 to 50) for pain-free. The risk ratios for headache relief and pain-free were 1.89 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.46; p < 0.0001) and 2.15 (95% CI 1.24 to 3.73; p = 0.0063), respectively, for ibuprofen 400 mg. The 24-hour sustained pain-free outcome with ibuprofen was no better than with placebo. Ibuprofen 400 mg increased the chance of relief in photophobia and phonophobia by 30% (95% CI 8 to 57; p < 0.01) and 49% (95% CI 23 to 81; p < 0.0001), respectively.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that ibuprofen 200 and 400 mg are effective in reducing headache intensity and rendering patients pain-free at 2 hours. Photophobia and phonophobia improved with 400 mg dosing. Due to the limited data and the shortcomings of the available evidence, further studies are needed.

### Current therapies in childhood and adolescent migraine [^387ebea9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

This review summarizes recent guidelines for diagnosis of migraine in children and adolescents and inherent issues regarding their headaches that influence evaluation of therapies. With the shorter duration of pediatric migraine attacks and the prominent placebo responder rate, design of randomized clinical trials becomes more problematic than in the adult population. Regarding abortive therapies, several agents have appreciable efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and sumatriptan nasal spray are probably beneficial and safe to use in pediatric migraine. For the minority of children who should be candidates for prophylactic therapy, there is a limited amount of information available for clinicians to make judicious treatment decisions.

### Single dose oral ibuprofen plus codeine for acute postoperative pain in adults [^367e341e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is good evidence that combining two different analgesics in fixed doses in a single tablet can provide better pain relief in acute pain and headache than either drug alone, and that the drug-specific effects are essentially additive. This appears to be broadly true in postoperative pain and migraine headache across a range of different drug combinations and when tested in the same and different trials. Some combinations of ibuprofen and codeine are available without prescription (but usually only from a pharmacy) where the dose of codeine is lower, and with a prescription when the dose of codeine is higher.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus codeine for moderate to severe postoperative pain. We compared ibuprofen plus codeine with placebo and with the same dose of ibuprofen alone.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of articles. The date of the most recent search was 30 September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials of single dose oral ibuprofen plus codeine for acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants prescribed ibuprofen plus codeine, placebo, or the same dose of ibuprofen alone with at least 50% pain relief over six hours, using validated equations. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on the use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse effects. Analyses were planned for different doses of ibuprofen and codeine, but especially for codeine where we set criteria for low (< 10 mg), medium (10 to 20 mg), and high (> 20 mg) doses.

Main Results

Information was available from six studies with 1342 participants, with a variety of doses of ibuprofen and codeine. In four studies (443 participants) using ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 to 60 mg (high dose codeine) 64% of participants had at least 50% maximum pain relief with the combination compared to 18% with placebo. The NNT was 2.2 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.6). In three studies (204 participants) ibuprofen plus codeine (any dose) was better than the same dose of ibuprofen (69% versus 55%) but the result was barely significant with a relative benefit of 1.3 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.6). In two studies (159 participants) ibuprofen plus codeine appeared to be better than the same dose of codeine alone (69% versus 33%), but no analysis was done. There was no difference between the combination and placebo in the reporting of adverse events in these acute studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 to 60 mg demonstrates good analgesic efficacy. Very limited data suggest that the combination is better than the same dose of either drug alone. Use of combination analgesics that contain codeine has been a source of some concern because of misuse from over-the-counter preparations.

Analyses were planned for different doses of ibuprofen and codeine, but especially for codeine where we set criteria for low (< 10 mg), medium (10 to 20 mg), and high (> 20 mg) doses.

Main Results

Since the last version of this review no new studies were found. Information was available from six studies with 1342 participants, using a variety of doses of ibuprofen and codeine. In four studies (443 participants) using ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 mg to 60 mg (high dose codeine) 64% of participants had at least 50% maximum pain relief with the combination compared to 18% with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 25.6 mg to 60 mg demonstrates good analgesic efficacy. Very limited data suggest that the combination is better than the same dose of either drug alone, and that similar numbers of people experience adverse events with the combination as with placebo.

Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety

The overall proportion of patients with treatment-emergent AEs was low, with no patients reporting severe AEs during the treatment period. Patients who received placebo reported the lowest frequency of all-grade AEs (5.6%) compared with those who received ibuprofen + caffeine (7.8%) and ibuprofen alone (7.1%). The most commonly reported AEs were headache (1.9%) and upper abdominal pain (1.1%). In total, five patients had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation (ibuprofen + caffeine, n=2; ibuprofen, n=2; placebo, n=1). An overall summary of AEs and the most frequently occurring AEs is shown in Table 3.

Headache/Migraine

The analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen 400 mg for tension-type headache was evaluated in a Cochrane systematic review, in which 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included (only one study of ibuprofen arginate).It was found that ibuprofen 400 mg provided an important benefit in terms of being pain free at 2 hours for patients with frequent episodic tension‐type headache who have an acute headache with moderate or severe initial pain. In relation to the use of ibuprofen arginate in headache or migraine attacks, two randomized, double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled studies have been published,(Table 2). In the first study, ibuprofen arginate 400 mg was compared with ß-cyclodextrin piroxicam, or placebo in 30 patients with tension-type headache.Pain intensity was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Both active treatments were similar and significantly better than placebo. AEs related to treatment were not observed. In the second trial carried out in 40 patients with acute migraine attacks, each patient was treated with a single oral dose of ibuprofen arginate 400 mg or placebo during two consecutive attacks.All pain measures were significantly better as compared with placebo and ibuprofen arginate was well tolerated.

Dysmenorrhea

Dysmenorrhea is defined as the presence of painful cramps of uterine origin that occur during menstruation and represents one of the most common causes of pelvic pain and menstrual disorder. The burden of dysmenorrhea is greater than any other gynecological complaint and is the leading cause of gynecological morbidity in women of reproductive age, particularly in adolescents, regardless of age, nationality, and economic status.In a recent network meta-analysis of 35 trials with 4383 participants, in which the efficacy of OTC analgesics for dysmenorrhea was compared, ibuprofen was recommended as the optimal option for superiority in terms of pain relief and safety profile.Details of two studies assessing ibuprofen arginate in primary dysmenorrhea,are shown in Table 3. One study was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial in 83 patients assessing the efficacy of two doses (200, 400 mg) of ibuprofen arginate vs ibuprofen and placebo.In all pain-related measures ibuprofen arginate especially at doses of 400 mg was significantly more effective than ibuprofen and both active treatments than placebo. No significant differences were found between the active treatments and placebo in the incidence of overall or individual AEs. The most common AEs were headache, nausea, and dizziness. The second study was an open trial of ibuprofen arginate 600 mg administered during three cycles in 838 patients.Marked pain relief was already reported after 15 min of drug administration. Interestingly, treatment with ibuprofen arginate had an important impact on work productivity, with significant reduction of absenteeism. AEs occurred in 3% of women, with gastrointestinal complaints as the most common.

### Single dose oral ibuprofen plus caffeine for acute postoperative pain in adults [^90a36469]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is good evidence that combining two different analgesics in fixed doses in a single tablet can provide better pain relief in acute pain and headache than either drug alone, and that the drug-specific benefits are essentially additive. This appears to be broadly true in postoperative pain and migraine headache across a range of different drug combinations, and when tested in the same and different trials. Adding caffeine to analgesics also increases the number of people obtaining good pain relief. Combinations of ibuprofen and caffeine are available without prescription in some parts of the world.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus caffeine for moderate to severe postoperative pain, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of articles. The date of the most recent search was 1 February 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials of single dose oral ibuprofen plus caffeine for acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief over six hours prescribed either ibuprofen plus caffeine or placebo. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on the use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse effects.

Main Results

We identified five randomised, double-blind studies with 1501 participants, but only four had been published and had relevant outcome data. These four studies were of high quality, although two of the studies were small.Both ibuprofen 200 mg + caffeine 100 mg and ibuprofen 100 mg + caffeine 100 mg produced significantly more participants than placebo who achieved at least 50% of maximum pain relief over six hours, and both doses significantly reduced remedication rates (moderate quality evidence). For at least 50% of maximum pain relief, the NNT was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.5) for ibuprofen 200 mg + caffeine 100 mg (four studies, 334 participants) and 2.4 (1.9 to 3.1) for ibuprofen 100 mg + caffeine 100 mg (two studies, 200 participants) (moderate quality evidence). These values were close to those predicted by published models for combination analgesics in acute pain, and were supported by low (good) NNT values for prevention of remedication.Adverse event rates were low, and no sensible analysis was possible.

Authors' Conclusions

For ibuprofen 200 mg + caffeine 100 mg particularly, the low NNT value is among the lowest (best) values for analgesics in this pain model. The combination is not commonly available, but can be probably be achieved by taking a single 200 mg ibuprofen tablet with a cup of modestly strong coffee or caffeine tablets. In principle, this can deliver good analgesia at lower doses of ibuprofen.

This appears to be broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache. Some combinations of ibuprofen and paracetamol are available for use without prescription in some acute pain situations.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of single dose oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol for acute postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to May 21st 2013), EMBASE (1974 to May 21st 2013), the Oxford Pain Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind clinical trials of single dose, oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol compared with placebo or the same dose of ibuprofen alone for acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used validated equations to calculate the area under the pain relief versus time curve and derive the proportion of participants with at least 50% of maximum pain relief over six hours. We calculated relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for ibuprofen plus paracetamol, ibuprofen alone, or placebo. We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse events.

Main Results

Searches identified three studies involving 1647 participants. Each of them examined several dose combinations. Included studies provided data from 508 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo, 543 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo, and 359 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone.The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief over 6 hours was 69% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 73% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 7% with placebo, giving NNTs of 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8) and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.7) for the lower and higher doses respectively compared with placebo. For ibuprofen 400 mg alone the proportion was 52%, giving an NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 5.4 (3.5 to 12).Ibuprofen + paracetamol at the 200/500 mg and 400/1000 mg doses resulted in longer times to remedication than placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication was 7.6 hours for ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 8.3 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 1.7 hours with placebo. Fewer participants needed rescue medication with ibuprofen + paracetamol combination than with placebo or ibuprofen alone. The proportion was 34% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 25% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 79% with placebo, giving NNTs to prevent use of rescue medication of 2.2 (1.8 to 2.9) and 1.8 (1.6 to 2.2) respectively compared with placebo. The proportion of participants using rescue medication with ibuprofen 400 mg was 48%, giving an NNT to prevent use for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 4.3 (3.0 to 7.7).The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events was 30% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 29% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 48% with placebo, giving NNT values in favour of the combination treatment of 5.4 (3.6 to 10.5) and 5.1 (3.5 to 9.5) for the lower and higher doses respectively. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy were fewer than 5% and balanced across treatment arms.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen plus paracetamol combinations provided better analgesia than either drug alone (at the same dose), with a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours, and with a smaller chance of experiencing an adverse event.

Naproxen—acute migraine with or without aura (systematic review of RCTs): Six RCTs comparing naproxen 275 mg, 500 mg, or 825 mg to placebo or active comparators with 24-hour post-treatment follow-up showed a statistically significant between-group difference for percentage pain-free at 2 hours favoring naproxen (RR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.61–2.58; p<0.00001). Given the increased incidence of AEs with doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg and relatively equal efficacy, naproxen 500 mg or fewer is advised over higher doses. For naproxen versus placebo, NNT for pain freedom at 2 hours, headache relief at 2 hours, and 24-hour sustained headache relief was 11, 6, and 24, respectively. Patients should be advised that many combination products for flu, cold, sinus, and allergy available without a prescription can contain ibuprofen or naproxen and these amounts must be included in the daily total.

Background

Combining two different analgesics in fixed doses in a single tablet can provide better pain relief than either drug alone in acute pain. This appears to be broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache. Fixed-dose combinations of ibuprofen and oxycodone are available, and the drugs may be separately used in combination in some acute pain situations.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus oxycodone for moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, (CENTRAL), on The Cochrane Library, (Issue 4 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 21st May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 21st May 2013), the Oxford Pain Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind clinical trials of single dose, oral ibuprofen plus oxycodone compared with placebo or the same dose of ibuprofen alone for acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants prescribed ibuprofen plus oxycodone, ibuprofen alone, oxycodone alone, or placebo with at least 50% pain relief over six hours, using validated equations. We calculated relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT). We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse events.

Main Results

Searches identified three studies involving 1202 participants. All examined the same dose combination. Included studies provided data from 603 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg with placebo, 717 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone, and 471 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg with oxycodone 5 mg alone.The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours was 60% with ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg and 17% with placebo, giving an NNT of 2.3 (2.0 to 2.8). For ibuprofen 400 mg alone the proportion was 50%, producing no significant difference between ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg alone. For oxycodone 5 mg alone the proportion was 23%, giving an NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg compared with oxycodone alone of 2.9 (2.3 to 4.0).Ibuprofen + oxycodone resulted in longer times to remedication than with placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication was more than 5 hours for ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg, and 2.3 hours or less with placebo. Fewer participants needed rescue medication with ibuprofen + oxycodone combination than with placebo or ibuprofen alone. The proportion was 40% with ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg, 83% with placebo, 53% with ibuprofen alone, and 83% with oxycodone alone, giving NNT to prevent one patient needing rescue medication of 2.4 (2.0 to 2.9), 11 (6.1 to 56), and 2.6 (2.1 to 3.4) for comparisons of ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg with placebo, ibuprofen alone, and oxycodone alone, respectively.The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events was 25% with ibuprofen 400 mg + oxycodone 5 mg, 25% with placebo, 26% with ibuprofen alone, and 35% with oxycodone alone; they were not significantly different. Serious adverse events were reported only after abdominal surgery 6/169 with the combination, 1/175 with ibuprofen alone, 3/52 with oxycodone alone, and 1/60 with placebo. Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy were fewer than 5% and balanced across treatment arms.

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of ibuprofen 400mg + oxycodone 5mg provided analgesia for longer than oxycodone alone, but not ibuprofen alone (at the same dose). There was also a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours, and with no greater chance of experiencing an adverse event.

Introduction

Multimodal analgesia has the potential to provide safe and effective management of postoperative pain.Combining oral analgesics into a single product potentially increases compliance, safety, and efficacy.The use of acetaminophen (APAP; N-acetyl-para-aminophenol or paracetamol) and/or ibuprofen (IBP) in postoperative pain management is well established internationally, often provided as an adjunct to opioid analgesia.–The current opioid crisis in the United States illustrates the immediate need for alternative or adjunct nonopioid analgesics with improved safety profiles.Opioid use can lead to addiction, with users developing a compulsive need to continue taking opioids despite negative consequences.Many opioid abusers begin their addiction through prescriptions for the treatment of postoperative pain.More than 40% of all opioid deaths in the United States involve prescription opioids.More than 75% of people misusing prescription opioids receive excess medication prescribed to friends or relatives.Other countries, such as Australia,,New Zealand,,Canada,and the UK,have also seen increases in the number opioid prescriptions and opioid-related deaths in recent years.

The combination of APAP and IBP is an effective alternative to opioid-based analgesia.–IBP is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities. A good tolerability profile along with extensive clinical experience has resulted in IBP being sold over-the-counter (OTC) in pharmacies worldwide, as well as in supermarkets and other general retailers. Approved indications include fever reduction and relief of minor aches and pains associated with the common cold, headache, toothache, muscular aches, backache, arthritis, and menstrual cramps.

Like other NSAIDs, IBP is believed to work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), thus inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.The COX family of enzymes is responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, an unstable molecule, which is in turn converted to numerous other pro-inflammatory compounds. There are at least two COX isoforms, designated as COX-1 and COX-2. IBP inhibits both isoforms nonselectively. Its desired activities are principally due to COX-2 inhibition, while its unwanted side effects on platelet aggregation and the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa are due to COX-1 inhibition.The activity of the COX enzyme relies on being in the oxidized form.It has been shown that APAP can reduce the oxidized form of the COX enzyme in low peroxide environments such as the central nervous system, but not in peripheral immune cells.

### Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant for acute pain in adults [^7214d23a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons.

Objectives

To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events.

Main Results

We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small.Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence).Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication.We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-and active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of diclofenac-K and ibuprofen for the treatment of adults with influenza-like symptoms [^c658800b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The alleviation of influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and muscle/joint aches and pains, is important so that sufferers can return to their normal daily activities. A flexible dosing regimen is proposed, starting with an initial dose of 2 tablets (2 x 12.5 mg), followed by 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed, to a maximum daily dose of 75 mg for up to 3 days for fever and 5 days for pain. This flexible dosing regimen matches the existing over-the-counter dosing regimen of ibuprofen, which allows the patient to adjust the treatment according to the type, duration, and severity of symptoms.

Objective

This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac-K 12.5 mg versus ibuprofen 200 mg and placebo against influenza-like symptoms (oral temperature > or = 38.1 degrees C, and at least moderate headache and muscle/joint aches and pains).

Methods

This was a 3-day, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Germany. The flexible dosing regimens comprised 2 tablets of diclofenac-K (12.5 mg), ibuprofen (200 mg), or placebo, then 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed, to a maximum of 6 tablets/d. Primary efficacy outcomes were fever reduction after the initial dose and an end-of-study global assessment of overall symptom relief. Secondary efficacy outcomes included reduction of feverishness; relief of headache; and relief of muscle/joint aches and pains, after the first dose and at the end of days 1, 2, and 3. Use of rescue medication (paracetamol 500-mg tablets) and usage patterns of study medication were also studied. Tolerability was monitored by recording of patients' adverse events.

Results

A total of 356 patients were enrolled (n = 121, 120, and 115 patients in the diclofenac-K, ibuprofen, and placebo groups, respectively). All patients were white except 1 Asian patient in the diclofenac-K group; 55% to 60% of patients in all 3 groups were male; the mean age in each treatment group was approximately 40 years. At baseline, mean oral temperature ranged from 38.65 degrees C in the placebo group to 38.74 degrees C in the diclofenac-K group. Mean oral temperatures in both active groups were significantly lower than that of the placebo group from 30 minutes through 6 hours (P < 0.001), dropping 0.85 degrees C after 4 hours in the diclofenac-K group and 0.76 degrees C in the ibuprofen group versus 0.32 degrees C for placebo. In the end-of-study global treatment assessment, 89.0% of diclofenac-K and 89.1% of ibuprofen patients rated global efficacy as "good" to "excellent" versus only 32.1% for placebo. Diclofenac-K was superior to placebo (P < 0.001) and similar to ibuprofen on all direct assessments of fever and aches and pains. Both active treatments were as well tolerated as was placebo.

Conclusions

In this 3-day study, diclofenac-K 12.5 mg taken in a flexible dosing regimen was more effective than placebo in relieving influenza-like symptoms, with comparable tolerability Efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac-K were similar to those of ibuprofen 200 mg.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥15 days per month for >3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of celecoxib oral solution (ELYXYB) in acute treatment of episodic migraine with or without aura [^7d6e259b]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Some patients with migraine respond well to simple pain relievers, as measured by 2-hour post-dose pain relief.For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects.Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, are established as effective in migraine and are recommended treatment options for acute attacks.These non-selective NSAIDs inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (which play a key role in migraine pathogenesis)through two isoenzymes, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. However, up to 60% of patients experience gastrointestinal (GI) AEs with non-selective NSAIDs; these problems include GI bleeding and ulcers, which are related to COX-1 inhibition.However, the analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs is associated with COX-2 inhibition.Furthermore, since migraine is a chronic conditionrequiring episodic treatment,,it is important to recognize that the cumulative consumption of non-selective NSAIDs can lead to serious AEs, including GI, cardiovascular, and renal events.Predicated on this, the use of COX-2-selective versus non-selective NSAIDs may provide a therapeutic advantage in the acute management of migraine.

Celecoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID; it has an analgesic profile similar to other NSAIDs, alongside a more favorable GI profile.A systematic review and meta-analysis of celecoxib capsules in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis found a significantly reduced incidence of GI AEs with celecoxib capsules compared to non-specific NSAIDs such as naproxen (relative risk [RR]: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.55–0.67]). Incidence was also reduced non-significantly when celecoxib was compared to the COX-2-specific NSAID rofecoxib (RR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.49–1.06]).In 2007, Loo et al evaluated 400-mg celecoxib capsules versus 550-mg naproxen sodium in an open-label, randomized, controlled study (N=60) for acute treatment of patients with migraine. Celecoxib capsules showed similar pain reduction as naproxen, based on Visual Analogue Scale results, as well as significantly reduced gastric pain incidence.However, celecoxib capsules are slow to provide pain relief, with a median T max of 2.5 hours.Because rapid pain relief is an important treatment goal,,and due to GI issues with oral NSAIDs,celecoxib capsules have not been approved for the acute treatment of migraine in the U.S.

### Combination of low-dose mirtazapine and ibuprofen for prophylaxis of chronic tension-type headache [^f025d0c1]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic headaches are difficult to treat and represent the biggest challenge in headache centres. Mirtazapine has a prophylactic and ibuprofen an acute effect in tension-type headache. Combination therapy may increase efficacy and lower side effects. We aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of a combination of low-dose mirtazapine and ibuprofen in chronic tension-type headache. Ninety-three patients were included in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Following a 4-week run-in period they were randomized to four groups for treatment with a combination of mirtazapine 4.5 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg, placebo, mirtazapine 4.5 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg daily for 8 weeks. Eighty-four patients completed the study. The primary efficacy parameter, change in area under the headache curve from run-in to the last 4 weeks of treatment, did not differ between combination therapy (190) and placebo (219), P = 0.85. Explanatory analyses revealed worsening of headache already in the third week of treatment with ibuprofen alone. In conclusion, the combination of low-dose mirtazapine and ibuprofen is not effective for the treatment of chronic tension-type headache. Moreover, the study suggests that daily intake of ibuprofen worsens headache already after few weeks in chronic tension-type headache.

### Diclofenac with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^881e2772]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in Issue 2, 2012 (Derry 2012a). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. Diclofenac is an established analgesic, and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts, which can be dissolved in water, have been developed for rapid absorption, which may be beneficial in acute migraine. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 27 September 2011 for the original review and 15 February 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled or active-controlled studies, or both, using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Five studies (1356 participants, 2711 attacks) compared oral diclofenac with placebo, and one also compared it with sumatriptan; none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic. Four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication, and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response. Only two studies, with three active treatment arms, provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes. For single doses of diclofenac potassium 50 mg versus placebo (two studies), the NNTs were 6.2, 8.9, and 9.5 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, and pain-free responses at 24 hours, respectively.Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with diclofenac and placebo.There were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac, or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens; only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator (oral sumatriptan 100 mg).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral diclofenac potassium 50 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine, providing relief from pain and associated symptoms, although only a minority of patients experience pain-free responses. Adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo.

### High altitude headache: efficacy of acetaminophen vs. ibuprofen in a randomized, controlled trial [^ee3763b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Ibuprofen has been shown to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of high altitude headache (HAH), but nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been linked to increased incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). We postulated that acetaminophen, which does not share ibuprofen's theorized causal link to GI side effects or HAPE, could provide effective HAH therapy. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of ibuprofen vs. acetaminophen in the Solu Khumbu, Nepal: Mt. Everest Base Camp, Pheriche, Dingboche (4240 m to 5315 m). Seventy-four consecutive patients (ages 13 to 61 years) were randomized, were assessed with the Lake Louise Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) criteria, and received a physical examination (which included vital signs, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)), and assessment of clinical Lake Louise AMS criteria). Patients then received either 400 mg of ibuprofen (IBU) or 1000 mg of acetaminophen (ACET), and were asked to rate their cephalgia using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). Thirty-nine patients received IBU, and 35 received ACET. Baseline Lake Louise AMS scores were identical in the two groups (mean = 5.9). No differences in mean VAS scores between IBU and ACET groups were noted at time 0 (presentation), 30, 60, or 120 min. No cases of HAPE or high altitude cerebral edema were noted during the study period. In this study population, acetaminophen was as effective as ibuprofen in relieving the pain of HAH.

If not tolerating oral fluids, perform “Electrolytes, urinary SG, IV hydration,” then administer “Metoclopramide 10 mg IV and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV” and reassess “Improving within 60 min?”; if improved, “Observe/sleep for several hours,” then disposition as “Resolved: Home,” “Mild/minimal residual: trial acetaminophen 1000 mg PO; Home,” or if “Improved but moderate residual,” ask “More than 6 h since metoclopramide/ diphenhydramine?” and either “Consider repeat metoclopramide 10 mg and diphenhydramine 25 mg IV” with reassessment for discharge if improved, or proceed to “Consider secondary treatment options, balancing risks. May administer any of the following individually or sequentially:” including “Sumatriptan 6 mg SC, may repeat in 1 h (max 12 mg/24 h) or sumatriptan 20 mg nasal spray, may repeat in 2 h (max 40 mg/24 h),” “Second trimester: ibuprofen 600 mg PO once or ketorolac 30 mg IV,” and “Magnesium 2 g IV over 10–20 min”; additionally, “If admitting for continued therapy or if discharging home, consider a corticosteroid to reduce risk of recurrence: prednisone 20 mg QID for 2 days or methylprednisolone 4 mg tabs (21-pill dose pack over 6 days).”

### Differential actions of indomethacin: clinical relevance in headache [^96ff9ef2]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

The dose of indomethacin, ibuprofen, and naproxen used was based on the knowledge of similar high absorption rates and plasma protein binding if taken orally, as well as the ratio of their maximum daily dose for the treatment of headache, viz. indomethacin: ibuprofen: naproxen = >225 mg·d −1 :1200 mg·d −1 :1200 mg·d −1 = 1:6:6. We used the same doses as previously reportedbecause these doses have been shown to be well tolerated; the dose for indomethacin is slightly lower than its oral LD 10.There is a broad knowledge from in vitro experiments about NSAIDs' action on the different cyclooxygenases, including their kinetic profilesand their capabilities in the inhibition of COX1/COX2 mechanisms, resulting in specific COX1/COX2 ratios.COX1 and COX2 are prominent, not only in the dura mater as a key structure of trigeminal innervation,, but COX2 activity has been shown to be modifiable at the level of the caudal trigeminal trigeminocervical nucleus.COX1/COX2 inhibition has been shown to alter trigeminocervical neurons responding to nociceptive dural activation.Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of the tested drugs at the level of the TCC seems to be rather limited compared to the effect of triptans, such as rizatriptan and naratriptan. This is in contrast to the greater use of NSAIDs in migraine, although it is consistent with severe migraine attacks being generally better treated with triptans. Certainly, in clinical trials, fewer patients respond to NSAIDs than triptans.

### Guidance for healthcare providers on newest guidelines for over-the-counter drug treatment of mild symptoms of COVID-19 [^12dce3e2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

On January 18, 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued their most recent guidelines for over-the-counter drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Specifically, the organization stated that "Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better." In this review we consider the contributions of different types of evidence and conclude that healthcare providers should make individual clinical judgments for each of their patients in the selection of over-the-counter drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19. This judgment should be based on the entire benefit to risk profile of the patient. It is our belief that the individual healthcare provider knows far more about each of his or her patients than anyone, including expert members of guideline committees. Their astute and judicious individual clinical decision-making for each individual patient based on all these considerations has the potential to do far more good than harm.

Adverse events were reported for 54 of the 100 patients, with most (97%) being classified as mild to moderate in severity. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing adverse events or the number of adverse events between treatment groups (Table 6). The most common adverse events were vomiting, infusion site pain (ibuprofen only), headache, nausea and diarrhea (Table 6). There were no deaths reported in this study. There were four (4%) subjects for whom six serious adverse events were reported. In the intravenous ibuprofen group, two subjects experienced four serious adverse events; one with pancreatitis and hepatitis and one with cardiac arrest and pneumothorax. In the acetaminophen group, two (2%) subjects experienced two serious adverse events; pleural effusion, and intra-abdominal abscess. None of the serious adverse events were deemed related to either intravenous ibuprofen or acetaminophen in the opinion of an independent data safety monitor.

### A randomized, placebo-and active-controlled, multi-country, multi-center parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of 400 mg ibuprofen and 100 mg caffeine compared with ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with acute lower back or neck pain [^9baba7cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Neck pain is also becoming an increasingly common disorder; 1-year prevalence rates range from 4.8–79.5%, with most studies reporting an increased risk of neck pain in women.There is some consistency between the causes of lower back pain and those of neck pain, including compressive causes, such as disc herniation, and degenerative changes of the vertebrae and/or intervertebral discs.As with lower back pain, there is often uncertainty around the pathophysiology of neck pain and specific causes are rarely identified.

Despite the lack of efficacy data, acute back and neck pain are often treated with over-the-counter analgesics; the most common treatment being ibuprofen. Surprisingly, considering the widespread use of ibuprofen, we identified only one published study in which ibuprofen was investigated for the treatment of acute back pain, published by Dreiser et al.Although ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium were both found to be superior to placebo in this study, limited efficacy was reported.However, other studies have reported that 400 mg ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than 1000 mg paracetamol or 325/650 mg aspirin for the treatment of other forms of acute pain (including dental pain, episodic tension-type headache, muscle contraction headache, postoperative pain after caesarean section).–In spite of this, some patients still reported insufficient pain relief with 400 mg ibuprofen,–which led to investigations into the analgesic adjuvant effect of caffeine.It must be noted that the definitions of “acute pain” differ greatly for back/neck pain and pain resulting from postpartum uterine cramping, tension headache, migraine or dental extraction, where the superiority of caffeine-containing analgesics has previously been demonstrated.–

### Diclofenac with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^4a987466]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. Diclofenac is an established analgesic, and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts, which can be dissolved in water, have been developed for rapid absorption, which may be beneficial in acute migraine. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 27 September 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Five studies (1356 participants) compared oral diclofenac with placebo, and one also compared it with sumatriptan; none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic. Four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication, and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response. Only two studies, with three active treatment arms, provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes. For single doses of diclofenac potassium 50 mg versus placebo (two studies), the NNTs were 6.2, 8.9, and 9.5 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, and pain-free responses at 24 hours, respectively.Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, and functional disability were reduced within two hours, and similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient.There were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac, or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens; only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator (oral sumatriptan 100 mg).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral diclofenac potassium 50 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine, providing relief from pain and associated symptoms, although only a minority of patients experience pain-free responses. Adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo.

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^78bc5369]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Treatment

During the first days of hospitalisation, the patient remained febrile without improvement of headache despite paracetamol, ibuprofen and morphine administration. Based on an inconclusive infectious diseases workup and the lack of improvement with empirical therapy, we discontinued anti-infective therapies after 48 hours. Furthermore, we found a temporal relationship between ibuprofen use and symptom worsening: initial headaches worsened after the first ibuprofen dose, pain resolved when NSAIDs were replaced by morphine during the ED visits and symptoms of meningitis recurred after each NSAID restart on hospital discharge. As a result, we suspected ibuprofen-induced meningitis and this medication was immediately suspended.

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache in adults [^02e857b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) affects about 1 person in 5 worldwide. It is divided into infrequent episodic TTH (fewer than one headache per month), frequent episodic TTH (two to 14 headaches per month), and chronic TTH (15 headache days a month or more). Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of a number of analgesics suggested for acute treatment of headaches in frequent episodic TTH.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for the acute treatment of frequent episodic TTH in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (CRSO), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database to October 2015, and also reference lists of relevant published studies and reviews. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (parallel-group or cross-over) using oral paracetamol for symptomatic relief of an acute episode of TTH. Studies had to be prospective, with participants aged 18 years or over, and include at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used the numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for oral paracetamol compared to placebo or an active intervention for a range of outcomes, predominantly those recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS).We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 23 studies, all of which enrolled adults with frequent episodic TTH. Twelve studies used the IHS diagnostic criteria or similar, six used the older classification of the Ad Hoc Committee, and five did not describe specific diagnostic criteria but generally excluded participants with migraines. Participants had moderate or severe pain at the start of treatment. While 8079 people with TTH participated in these studies, the numbers available for any analysis were lower than this because outcomes were inconsistently reported and because many participants received active comparators.None of the included studies were at low risk of bias across all domains considered, although for most studies and domains this was likely to be due to inadequate reporting rather than poor methods. We judged five studies to be at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome reporting, and seven due to small size.For the IHS preferred outcome of being pain free at two hours the NNT for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with placebo was 22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 15 to 40) in eight studies (5890 participants; high quality evidence), with no significant difference from placebo at one hour. The NNT was 10 (7.9 to 14) for pain-free or mild pain at two hours in five studies (5238 participants; high quality evidence). The use of rescue medication was lower with paracetamol 1000 mg than with placebo, with an NNTp to prevent an event of 7.8 (6.0 to 11) in six studies (1856 participants; moderate quality evidence). On limited data, the efficacy of paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg was not superior to placebo, and paracetamol 1000 mg was not different from either ketoprofen 25 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg (low quality evidence).Adverse events were not different between paracetamol 1000 mg and placebo (RR 1.1 (0.94 to 1.3); 5605 participants; 11 studies; high quality evidence). Studies reported no serious adverse events.The quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo was moderate to high. Where evidence was downgraded it was because a minority of studies reported the outcome. For comparisons of paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg with placebo, and of paracetamol 1000 mg with active comparators, we downgraded the evidence to low quality or very low quality because of the small number of studies and events.

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg provided a small benefit in terms of being pain free at two hours for people with frequent episodic TTH who have an acute headache of moderate or severe intensity.

### Additive value of intranasal fentanyl on ibuprofen for pain management of children with moderate to severe headaches: a randomized controlled trial [^e16c83c2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies have evaluated the rapid pain improvement provided by medications for children presenting to an emergency department (ED) with headaches.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate pain reduction provided by intranasal fentanyl (INF) compared with placebo in addition to ibuprofen.

Methods

A single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary care pediatric ED. All children aged 8-17 years presenting with a moderate to severe headache were eligible. Study participants were randomly allocated to receive INF 1.5 µg/kg (maximum dose of 100 µg) or similar placebo solution. Co-administration of oral ibuprofen 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 600 mg) was also provided. The primary outcome was the mean pain rating reduction at 15 min.

Results

Among the 62 participants, the median age was 14 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12-16 years in both groups) and the median initial visual analog scale (VAS) score was 64 (IQR 55-72 in the intervention group; IQR 50-81 in the control group). There was no difference in the mean pain score reduction at 15 min between the two groups (mean difference 2 mm; 95% CI -7 to 11 mm). Mean VAS score reductions were also similar at 30 and 60 min. Adverse events were more frequent in the INF group (risk ratio 2.8; 95% CI 1.29 to 6.22), but all events were minor and transient. No significant differences were found in other outcomes.

Conclusions

This study did not find a benefit from INF for providing additional pain relief in children presenting to ED with headaches.

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^dae6d340]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 40-year-old man developed aseptic meningitis after ibuprofen consumption for tension-type headaches. After a thorough diagnostic workup and lack of improvement on empirical therapy for common aetiologies of meningitis (bacterial and viral infections), we suspected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced meningitis due to the temporal relationship between drug administration and symptom onset. Two days after NSAID suppression, the evolution was progressively favourable with complete resolution of fever and symptoms. On follow-up, symptoms did not recur and there was no neurological sequela. This article summarises the clinical picture and the complementary exams that led to the difficult-to-make diagnosis of NSAID-induced acute meningitis, in parallel with a brief review of the literature.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^fe0037ca]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) for acute migraine—A systematic review (SR) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that paracetamol 1,000 mg versus placebo favored paracetamol for percentage of pain-free response at 2 hours (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.24–2.62; p=0.0022). When taken for moderate to severe pain, paracetamol was superior to placebo with pain freedom at 2 hours (NNT=12), headache relief at 2 hours (NNT=5), and headache relief at 1 hour (NNT=5.2). Paracetamol 1,000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at 2 hours is higher than other commonly used analgesics. For safety, the maximum dose of acetaminophen for acute use is 4,000 mg per day, and this dose should include any other acetaminophen-containing products, such as cold, flu, sinus, or allergy combination products.

### Ibuprofen arginate for rapid-onset pain relief in daily practice: a review of its use in different pain conditions [^f271ae88]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, the management of pain remains inadequate across different treatment settings, with a substantial proportion of patients continuing to experience pain of mild to moderate intensity.Inadequately managed acute pain has a negative impact on numerous aspects of patient´s health and may increase the risk of developing chronic pain.Physicians commonly encounter challenging acute pain scenarios, with key decisional dilemmas regarding the selection of medicines to provide adequate pain relief in order to facilitate recovery, improve function and quality of life, as well as minimizing adverse effects and the need of prescribing of opioids. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated some shortcomings in physicians’ knowledge about the optimal treatment and expected time course for acute pain conditions presenting to the primary care setting.

The use of prescribed and, in particular, over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics is very common at population level, and different studies have shown overall prevalences ranging between 8.5% for daily analgesic use, 13.6% a few times a week, 47% once a week, and 76% once a month.Ibuprofen was the first non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to be approved for OTC use and is widely considered to be the best tolerated drug of its class. Low-dose, OTC ibuprofen has been used for pain relief for over 30 years without any obvious major health issues.In a systematic review of 39 Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had examined the analgesic efficacy of drug interventions in the postoperative pain model, fast-acting formulations of ibuprofen 200 and 400 mg showed values of the number needed to treat (NNT) close to 2 for the outcome of at least 50% pain relief over 4–6 hours compared to placebo.Ibuprofen was also more favorable than paracetamol and aspirin at various doses with NTT values of 3 and above.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen injection (Combogesic iv) [^25588352]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The clinical trials of COMBOGESIC IV have been conducted in patients with postoperative musculoskeletal pain and soft tissue pain models lasting between two to five days. Two Phase 3 clinical trials have been conducted with COMBOGESIC IV to assess efficacy and safety after multiple doses. In AFT-MXIV-07 participants were treated with COMBOGESIC IV, acetaminophen IV, ibuprofen IV or placebo for a treatment period of 48 hours. In AFT-MXIV-11 participants were treated for between 48 hours and five days with COMBOGESIC IV. The study population for AFT-MXIV-07 was comprised of adults aged 18 to 65 years, mean age: 42 years. AFT-MXIV-11 included adults aged 19 – 87 years, mean age: 53 years.

Safety data for the first 48 hours of both studies was pooled. Overall, 59.3% of the patients (N = 182/307) administered COMBOGESIC IV experienced one or more treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the first 48 hours of treatment, accounting for a total of 436 TEAEs (see Table 1). The most common TEAEs were related to the infusion site (infusion site pain, infusion site extravasation), or affected the gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation) or nervous (dizziness, headache, somnolence) systems.

### Naproxen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^7b1dbf1f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); its efficacy in acute migraine has not been established by systematic reviews. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of naproxen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, together with two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) and reference lists, for studies to 22 May 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using naproxen alone or with an antiemetic to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratios and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

We included six studies using naproxen 275 mg, 500 mg, or 825 mg to treat attacks of moderate or severe pain intensity. Overall, 1241 participants took naproxen (275 mg to 825 mg), 229 took sumatriptan 50 mg, 173 took naratriptan 2.5 mg, and 1092 took placebo. No studies combined naproxen with an antiemetic. Studies using naproxen 275 mg provided no useable data for analysis.Naproxen (500 mg and 825 mg) was better than placebo for pain-free response and headache relief. At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 11 (17% response with naproxen, 8% with placebo; risk ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.6), moderate quality) and for headache relief was 6.0 (45% response with naproxen, 29% with placebo; risk ratio 1.6 (1.4 to 1.8), moderate quality). The NNT for sustained pain-free response during the 24 hours post dose was 19 (12% response with naproxen, 6.7% with placebo), and for sustained headache relief during the 24 hours post dose was 8.3 (30% response with naproxen, 18% with placebo). Analysing only the lower dose of 500 mg of naproxen did not significantly change the results. Adverse events, which were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal, were more common with naproxen than with placebo when the 500 mg and 825 mg doses were considered together, but not when the 500 mg dose was analysed alone.There were insufficient data for analysis of naproxen compared with sumatriptan, and no data suitable for analysis of naproxen compared with naratriptan.

Authors' Conclusions

Naproxen is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 11 for pain-free response at two hours suggests that it is not a clinically useful treatment. Cochrane reviews examining other commonly used analgesics for acute migraine have reported better (lower) NNT results for the same outcome. Naproxen is not clinically useful as a stand-alone analgesic in acute migraine, as it is effective in fewer than 2 people in 10.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^8e75658a]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) treatment at altitude notes that AMS improves rapidly with a descent of 300 m (1,000 ft) or more, especially if exertion is minimal. If staying at the altitude of onset, supplemental oxygen at 1–2 L per minute will improve headache within about 30 minutes and resolve other AMS symptoms over hours, although it is rarely available, and the popular small, handheld cans of compressed oxygen can provide brief relief but contain too little oxygen (5 L at most) for sustained improvement. Travelers with AMS but without HACE or HAPE can remain safely at their current altitude and self-treat with non-opiate analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen 600 mg or acetaminophen 500 mg every 8 hours) and antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron 4 mg orally disintegrating tablets). Acetazolamide speeds acclimatization and resolves AMS but is more commonly used and better validated for use as prophylaxis, and dexamethasone is more effective than acetazolamide at rapidly relieving the symptoms of moderate to severe AMS; if symptoms worsen while the traveler is at the same altitude and despite treatment, descent is mandatory.

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^5b48496d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Analysis of the safety data pooled from multiple repeated-dose Phase II/III clinical studies illustrates the excellent tolerability and safety of multiple FDC APAP/IBP oral tablet doses over 24–48 hours. By pooling the four studies, a safety population which was demographically broader than any individual study was able to be examined. The results show comparable safety to both the individual components of the FDC and placebo (with opioid rescue available in all groups) during treatment of postsurgical pain. The FDC did not increase the incidence of AEs, the proportion of subjects that experienced at least one AE, or the proportion of AEs that were deemed possibly or probably related to the study medication, when compared to the monotherapy groups. The proportion of subjects that experienced severe AEs and the number of severe AEs were also no different between treat ment groups. The ten most common AEs, which accounted for 74% of all AEs (nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, swelling face, postprocedural hemorrhage, constipation, dyspepsia, pruritus, and somnolence), are consistent with what can be expected in the postoperative setting. Nausea and vomiting are common AEs in postoperative circumstances and may relate to the use of local or general anesthetics or rescue medication, for example. The FDC did not result in an increase in the number of postoperative bleeding events compared to IBP monotherapy or placebo (2%–3%). NSAIDs such as IBP can interfere with bleeding due to their potential inhibition of platelet COX. Consequently, there is often concern that the use of NSAIDs will increase bleeding in the immediate postoperative period. Examination of combined administration of APAP and IBP has found that the efficacy of the combination is improved compared with APAP or IBP monotherapy, while the tolerability remains similar.–,–,

### Corticosteroids, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen for IFN β-1a flu symptoms in MS: a randomized trial [^57c8abd6]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and prednisone in the treatment of interferon beta-1a (IFNbeta-1a) flu-like syndrome (FLS).

Methods

Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis initiating treatment with IM IFNbeta-1a were randomized in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to receive acetaminophen 500 mg before and 6 and 12 hours after each injection, ibuprofen 400 mg before and 6 and 12 hours after each injection, or prednisone 60 mg daily for 1 week, plus tapering. Patients were instructed to keep a daily diary of fever severity, myalgia, chills, headache, and asthenia for 27 days. The sum of the scores of individual symptoms was used to obtain a daily FLS index. The primary outcome was the FLS index area under the curve (AUC) corrected by the number of measurement days.

Results

Eighty-four patients were randomized at 11 hospitals: acetaminophen (n = 28), ibuprofen (n = 28), and corticosteroids (n = 28). No differences were detected between treatments in the mean AUC of the FLS index. With limitation of the analysis to the days of IM IFNbeta-1a injection, differences favoring ibuprofen were observed in the mean FLS index (p = 0.0007).

Conclusions

No prophylactic treatment for flu-like syndrome seems to be superior to another in terms of overall well-being during the first month of IM IFNbeta-1a therapy. However, ibuprofen confers better control of symptoms immediately following IM IFNbeta-1a injection.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^0449a542]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Acute episodic migraine—triptan plus acetaminophen combination, compared with triptan monotherapy, may result in no important differences in pain freedom and relief at 2 hours, sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours, freedom from nausea at 2 hours, and restored physical function at 2 hours after initiating treatment, with low-certainty evidence and no important differences in overall AEs and uncertain serious AEs; compared with acetaminophen monotherapy, combination therapy resulted in a probably higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours (300 more events per 1000 treated people) and sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours (250 more events per 1000 treated people), but may result in a higher risk for overall AEs (200 more events per 1000 treated people; low-certainty evidence); and compared with an NSAID, low-certainty evidence showed that this combination may result in a higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours.

Introduction

High altitude headache (HAH) and acute mountain sickness (AMS) are common pathologies at high altitudes. There are similarities between AMS and migraine headaches, with nausea being a common symptom. Several studies have shown ibuprofen can be effective for AMS prophylaxis, but few have addressed treatment. Metoclopramide is commonly administered for migraine headaches but has not been evaluated for HAH or AMS. We aimed to evaluate metoclopramide and ibuprofen for treatment of HAH and AMS.

Methods

We performed a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, field-based clinical trial of metoclopramide and ibuprofen for the treatment of HAH and AMS in 47 adult subjects in the Mount Everest region of Nepal. Subjects received either 400 mg ibuprofen or 10 mg metoclopramide in a 1-time dose. Lake Louise Score (LLS) and visual analog scale of symptoms were measured before and at 30, 60, and 120 min after treatment.

Results

Subjects in both the metoclopramide and ibuprofen arms reported reduced headache severity and nausea compared to pretreatment values at 120 min. The ibuprofen group reported 22 mm reduction in headache and 6 mm reduction in nausea on a 100 mm visual analog scale at 120 min. The metoclopramide group reported 23 mm reduction in headache and 14 mm reduction in nausea. The ibuprofen group reported an average 3.5-point decrease on LLS, whereas the metoclopramide group reported an average 2.0-point decrease on LLS at 120 min.

Conclusions

Metoclopramide and ibuprofen may be effective alternative treatment options in HAH and AMS, especially for those patients who additionally report nausea.

### Preventive medications in pediatric migraine: a network meta-analysis [^283fdc9d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary headaches, particularly migraine, are common neurological disorders during childhood and adolescence. The estimated overall prevalence of migraine in children and adolescents is 11%.Migraine incidence rises notably among individuals aged 14 and older, showing a sex predilection for females in adolescence and young adulthood, as opposed to younger age groups.Migraine has increasingly become a leading cause of disability, and headache episodes have a substantial impact on quality of life and academic performance.Furthermore, it is suggested to increase the likelihood of developing psychological disorders including depression and anxiety disorders.

The International Classification of Headache Disorder (ICHD) was introduced by the International Headache Society in 1988. The latest edition, ICHD-III, was published in 2018, providing an essential tool based on headache characteristics including duration, location, quality of headaches, and accompanying symptoms, ultimately facilitating precise diagnosis and effective treatment.Despite migraine’s relatively straightforward diagnosis based on the ICHD criteria, treatment has emerged as a growing concern. Migraine treatment typically comprises 2 principal strategies: acute or abortive medications for immediate relief and prophylactic treatment to prevent future migraine attacks and to stop the condition from becoming chronic. First-line medication used for acute management of migraine in younger children consists of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Triptans are proven effective for treating moderate to severe headaches in adolescents. Combinational therapies, like sumatriptan and naproxen, have shown promise in managing adolescent migraine., Rizatriptan exclusively holds US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for children older than 6 years, whereas sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan have received FDA endorsement for adolescents aged 12 years and older.

Prophylactic treatment of pediatric migraines presents a challenging landscape due to limited evidence. Off-label use of preventive medication is common, highlighting the need for additional research and guidelines. Although topiramate is the first FDA-approved preventive medication for adolescent migraine, studies show less favorable results compared with a placebo, which contrasts with findings in adults. Evaluating treatment efficacy in pediatric and adolescent patients with migraine is further complicated by a significant placebo effect. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to conduct an in-depth examination of the existing evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of pharmacological treatments for pediatric migraine prophylaxis.

### Ibuprofen arginate for rapid-onset pain relief in daily practice: a review of its use in different pain conditions [^8bb22a9e]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Dental Pain

Pain following removal of impacted third molar teeth has proven to be a useful clinical model for evaluating oral analgesics, and NSAIDs demonstrate high potency in this model, reflecting the large contribution that peripheral prostaglandins may make to the pathophysiology of postoperative pain.In this model, five randomized single- or double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled trials have reported the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen arginate versus ibuprofen or other NSAIDs (naproxen, aceclofenac) and placebo.The main results of these studies are described in Table 2. Except for one study, in which ibuprofen arginate was administered 15 min before surgery for the prophylaxis of pain,the remaining studies evaluated the analgesic efficacy and tolerability after dental surgery, usually over the first 6 hours postoperatively. In these studies, efficacy was based on overall assessments of pain intensity and pain relief measures, including pain intensity differences from baseline, pain relief scores, total pain relief, and peak pain relief. Key summary measure for onset of analgesia was time to meaningful pain relief. In one study, duration of pain relief was evaluated by analyzing the time to remedication.In three studies,two doses of ibuprofen arginate (200, 400 mg) and ibuprofen (200, 400 mg) were evaluated and compared with placebo. Main findings were statistically significant differences of active treatments versus placebo, and significant differences of both doses of ibuprofen arginate versus the corresponding doses of ibuprofen. Overall, ibuprofen arginate 400 mg was the most effective. Results in the dental pain model indicate that ibuprofen arginate when taken at doses equivalent to standard commercially available ibuprofen formulations produces analgesia that is significantly faster in onset. Also, patients treated with ibuprofen arginate rated its overall effectiveness higher than those patients treated with conventional ibuprofen.

Adverse event (AE) profiles (overall and individual side effects) were similar across all treatment groups, with somnolence, headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting as the most frequent complaints. The rate of AEs, however, varied between 6 and 14% in the study of Desjardins,around 27% in the study of Mehlisch et al,and 36–43% in the study of Black et al.In the study of Manso et al,no AEs were registered.

### Medical cannabis: a review from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^ade7e4e1]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence for Medical Use

Headache

A small randomized controlled trialand several observational studiesreported limited evidence for the efficacy of cannabis treatment of headache. All other evidence stems from case reports and clinical experience, which highlights the need for additional studies on this topic.The occurrence of nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and pain during acute migraine may be alleviated by administration of cannabis products.In general, inhaled cannabis may be more effective as an abortive treatment for acute headache, whereas oral formulations are more useful as a preventive treatment.

Pini et alcompared the efficacy of nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid and dibenzopyran derivative)vs ibuprofen for the treatment of long-standing, intractable medication overuse headache in a randomized controlled trial. The 26 patients who completed that pragmatic crossover trial reported lower pain intensity and lower daily analgesic intake when taking nabilone than when taking ibuprofen. Furthermore, nabilone treatment resulted in a lower level of medication dependence and higher quality of life than did ibuprofen treatment. However, an observational studyreported that medication overuse headache occurred in 81% of cannabis users vs 41% of noncannabis users. The authors of that studyconcluded that cannabis use was significantly associated with medication overuse headache (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.6–11.1; P <0.001) and that patients should be advised to reduce cannabis use to treat medication overuse headache effectively. Of note, cannabis discontinuation or withdrawal has also been reported to induce headache in patients.

### Results of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-dose study comparing the fixed combination of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, and caffeine with ibuprofen for acute treatment of patients with severe migraine [^5ef87322]. Cephalalgia (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-dose study (n=1555), a fixed combination of acetaminophen 500mg, acetylsalicylic acid 500mg, and caffeine 130mg (AAC) was compared with ibuprofen 400mg (IB) and placebo (PLA) for acute treatment of migraine.

Subjects and Methods

An exploratory post-hoc analysis compared AAC with IB and PLA in the subset of patients with severe pain at baseline (n=660).

Results

At most time points, AAC and IB relieved the pain and associated symptoms of severe migraine significantly better than PLA (p≤0.05). AAC was significantly superior to IB for pain relief at 45 minutes and at one, two, three, and four hours postdose (p<0.04); pain intensity difference from one hour through three hours (p<0.05); headache response at two hours (p=0.04); functional disability reduced to little or none at three hours (p=0.013); freedom from phonophobia at three hours (p=0.04) and photophobia at 15 minutes postdose (p=0.03); and use of rescue medication (p=0.018). AAC patients also reported meaningful pain relief 16 minutes faster than IB patients (132 minutes vs 148 minutes, p=0.026).

Conclusions

In patients with severe baseline migraine pain, AAC and IB are significantly more effective than PLA, and AAC provides significantly faster and more effective pain relief than IB.

### Therapeutic lumbar puncture for headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: minimal gain, is it worth the pain? [^d0b88ffa]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Seventy headache diaries were returned. Four diaries had insufficient data for analysis and were excluded. The analysed cohort comprised 52 patients, and of these 14 had second lumbar punctures performed (Supplementary Table 1). Headache phenotype was characterised at baseline; in this study, all patients had active IIH, thus headaches were not primary headaches. However, based on phenotypic characteristics using the International Headache Society ICHD-3 beta classification, we noted: Migraine-like or probable migraine-like (n = 53, 80%), headache attributed to IIH (n = 23, 35%), tension-type headache-like (n = 5, 8%), other (n = 5, 8%) and not classifiable (n = 7, 11%) (Table 1). Some participants had more than one headache phenotype. We found no significant difference in the baseline characteristics or headache outcomes following the first and repeat LP. The mean headache score pre-LP was 3.6 ± 2.8 on the NRS; 18% (12/66) had severe headaches, 35% (23/66) had moderate headaches, 24% (16/66) had mild headaches and 23% (15/66) had no headache on the day of the LP, at the pre-LP time point.

Table 1. 
Baseline characteristics for the whole cohort including data from all patient visits (n = 66). Data presented as median, interquartile range (IQR) or percentage (visits) where specified.

Acetazolamide therapy was documented in 27% of the patients with a median dose of 500 mg and range 250–1500 mg. No other diuretics were used. In all, 24% used acute analgesics, of which 73% had paracetamol, 18% ibuprofen and 9% tramadol. One or more headache preventatives were used by 24% of the patients: 63% topiramate, 44% amitriptyline, 13% gabapentin, 6% mirtazepine and 6% propranolol.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4-18 years [^bf430198]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric AP-DGBIs—over-the-counter analgesics—The GDG recognizes that over-the-counter analgesics are commonly used and whereas they may have a role in intermittent or periodic symptom control, the GDG raises caution beyond local OTC dosing and duration guidance. The use of OTC analgesics in the management of pediatric AP-DGBIs warrants careful consideration, as NSAIDs and acetaminophen have risks of adverse events, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatotoxicity, renal impairment, and medication overuse headaches when consumed beyond the limits outlined in pediatric dosing guidelines. Evidence-based dosing parameters should be followed to reduce the potential for harm while acknowledging the intermittent role OTC analgesics may play in a multimodal approach to AP-DGBI management.

### Aspirin in episodic tension-type headache: placebo-controlled dose-ranging comparison with paracetamol [^479c43da]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

Most people with episodic tension-type headache (TTH) treat themselves with over-the-counter analgesics. In the absence of clear evidence of dose-related efficacy of the two most commonly used analgesics, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), this study compared two doses of each with placebo. In a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized parallel-groups comparative trial, 638 consenting subjects aged 16-65 years with episodic TTH (but not migraine) by IHS criteria were recruited from the UK general population by advertisement. They treated one episode of moderate or severe TTH with a single dose of 500 or 1000 mg aspirin, 500 or 1000 mg paracetamol or placebo. The primary objective was to compare aspirin 1000 mg with placebo, and the primary end-point was subjective pain relief (total or worthwhile) 2 h after treatment ('response'). Additionally, pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analogue scale and functional impairment were monitored regularly for 4 h and at 24 h, although rescue medication was allowed after 2 h. The analysis was of the intention-to-treat population of 542 who took treatment (all providing outcome data). Treatment groups were matched at baseline. Aspirin 1000 mg (75.7% response rate; P = 0.0009) and to a lesser extent aspirin 500 mg (70.3%; P = 0.011) and paracetamol 1000 mg (71.2%; P = 0.007), but not paracetamol 500 mg (63.8%; P = 0.104), were statistically more effective than placebo despite a high placebo-response rate (54.5%). Outcome was not affected by headache intensity at baseline. Secondary end-points including functional recovery (by median times of 4.0-13.5 h) were consistent with these findings, although a minority of subjects recorded long-duration functional impairment (37-54 h). Adverse events reported by 13.4-18.9% of subjects were mild or moderate, and transient. No safety concerns arose.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^2e032b6e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Q11 What is the best way to manage headaches in newly diagnosed IIH?

Patients must be informed, at the earliest opportunity, of the potential issues of painkiller overuse that can lead to medication overuse headache (use of simple analgesics on more than 15 days per month or opioids, combined preparations or triptan medication on greater than 10 days per month for more than 3 months).
Short-term painkillers may be helpful in the first few weeks following diagnosis. These could include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol. Indomethacin may have some advantage due to its effect of reducing ICP.Caution is required with potential side effects of NSAIDs, and gastric protection may be needed.
Opioids should not be prescribed for headaches.
Greater occipital nerve blocks maybe considered helpful by some, but there is a lack of evidence and consensus.
Acetazolamide has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of headache alone.
Lumbar punctures are not typically recommended for treatment of headache in IIH (see 7. What is the role of serial lumbar punctures in IIH? in table 3).

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in acute IIH.

Q12 What is the best approach for long-term headache management in IIH?

The pattern of headache in IIH often changes over time and needs careful assessment. There is frequently a mixed headache phenotype: headache attributed to IIH, migraine, medication overuse headache, tension-type headache, headache attributed to low CSF pressure and headache attributed to iatrogenic Chiari malformation secondary to CSF shunting.
A multidisciplinary team approach could be considered including, ideally, an assessment by an experienced clinician with an interest in headache management.
In patients with IIH, the headache phenotype should be assessed. Headache therapies should be tailored to the headache phenotype.
IIH patients with headache need clear explanation of how their headaches change over time and how to minimise the risks of developing medication overuse headache.
Early introduction of preventative medications (migraine preventatives) should be considered as these can take 3–4 months to reach maximal efficacy.

Uncertainty

There is no evidence to support the optimal managing of headache in established IIH.

### Combination analgesic efficacy: individual patient data meta-analysis of single-dose oral tramadol plus acetaminophen in acute postoperative pain [^a795d40d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The primary aims of this study were to assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose oral tramadol plus acetaminophen in acute postoperative pain and to use meta-analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of the combination drug compared with its components. Individual patient data from seven randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials of tramadol plus acetaminophen were supplied for analysis by the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Raritan, New Jersey, USA. All trials used identical methods and assessed single-dose oral tramadol (75 mg or 112.5 mg) plus acetaminophen (650 mg or 975 mg) in adult patients with moderate or severe postoperative pain. Summed pain intensity and pain relief data over six and eight hours and global evaluations of treatment effect after eight hours were extracted. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to obtain at least 50% pain relief was calculated. NNTs derived from pain relief data were compared with those derived from pain intensity data and global evaluations. Information on adverse effects was collected. Combination analgesics (tramadol plus acetaminophen) had significantly lower (better) NNTs than the components alone, and comparable efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg. This could be shown for dental but not postsurgical pain, because more patients were available for the former. Adverse effects were similar for the combination drugs and the opioid component alone. Common adverse effects were dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and headache. In sum, this meta-analysis demonstrated analgesic superiority of the combination drug over its components, without additional toxicity.

There also was a significant association for anomalies of the respiratory system 9. 55, but this association disappeared when cases coded as "unspecified anomaly of the respiratory system" were excluded. For the cases involving septal closure, 61 % were atrial septal defects and 31 % were ventricular septal defects. At 24 h, those survival rates were reduced to 19%, 19%, and 6%, respectively. In the 15/7. 5 mg IBU group, lung WW/DW ratios were significantly lower than in saline-treated mice at 12 h. Lipid peroxidation was lower only for the 9/4. 5 mg IBU dose; however, nonprotein sulfhydryls were greater across all IBU doses.

### Headaches and facial pain attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination: a systematic review [^40d98114]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

. What are the clinical characteristics of headache and/or facial pain attributed to acute‐19 and/or after‐19?

From the search performed, 30 articles were included (Appendix S2). Only headache‐focused studies from the first wave of the pandemic had available information on headache characteristics. In the acute phase of COVID‐19, different localizations, pain qualities and severity have been described. Headache is more commonly bilateral/holocranial (42%–94%). It is moderate–severe in 15%–88% and throbbing in 11%–64%. The most frequent associated symptoms include migraine features such as photo‐phonophobia in 22%–63%, nausea in 24%–32% and worsening with movement in 14%–53%. Two phenotypes may eventually be distinguished: migraine‐like in up to 51% and tension‐type‐like in up to 43%. The median duration of headache in inpatients during the first wave of the pandemic was 7–14 days. Response to acute treatment (most often with paracetamol) has been reported as unsatisfactory in 21%–41%. In other reports, 46% of participants rated aspirin as effective in headache relief, followed by ibuprofen (17%) and paracetamol (14%). One study showed that at least one headache red flag is reported in up to 95% of patients. Anosmia and ageusia are significantly associated with headache attributed to acute COVID‐19. No data on the influence of different SARS‐CoV‐2 variants and vaccination status on headache characteristics are available.

After resolution of the acute phase of COVID‐19, similar headache characteristics have been reported. According to the study, the migraine‐like (up to 74%) or the tension‐type‐like phenotype (up to 90%) is the most common; however, data on headache characteristics are very limited. Descriptions on the temporal pattern and causal relationship of persistent headache in the phase after the resolution of acute COVID‐19 are lacking. No data exist for facial pain.

Comment

Most of the questions that are supposed to be the most relevant ones currently are unanswered, for example the headache characteristics in vaccinated compared to non‐vaccinated individuals; in several SARS‐CoV‐2 variants the clinical characteristics in the long term are missing etc.
