## Question

Is an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) helpful for patients with hereditary angioedema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about whether an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) helps during hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks and whether it should be used to treat them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of HAE and whether it is histamine- or bradykinin-mediated. Then, I should verify how epinephrine works mechanistically and whether that aligns with HAE biology. Next, I will review high-credibility guideline recommendations on acute HAE management. After that, I need to outline the recommended on-demand therapies for HAE. Finally, I should consider edge cases, like concomitant anaphylaxis or drug-induced reactions, and then synthesize a clear conclusion and clinical implication statement.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is driven by unchecked plasma kallikrein activity with excessive bradykinin generation, leading to increased vascular permeability and swelling; this is not a mast cell–histamine process, which is why urticaria is typically absent in HAE, and it explains the lack of response to antihistamine-directed strategies [^111pR1zs] [^111rp1m4].

> Now, I need to check how epinephrine works and whether that maps onto HAE biology; epinephrine is first-line for anaphylaxis because it counters mast cell–mediated processes via alpha-1 vasoconstriction, beta-2 bronchodilation, and inhibition of mediator release, which is effective for histamine-mediated angioedema but not for bradykinin-driven HAE, so mechanistically it's not expected to help HAE attacks at all [^116v4UDj] [^111rp1m4].

> Next, I should review explicit guideline recommendations to avoid over-interpreting mechanism alone; hold on, I should verify multiple sources: the AAAAI/EAACI focused parameter update explicitly recommends not using epinephrine, corticosteroids, or antihistamines for HAE attacks, and the WAO/EAACI international guideline lists targeted HAE therapies for acute attacks without including epinephrine, reinforcing that epinephrine is not a recommended treatment for HAE exacerbations [^111rp1m4] [^114cyf2r].

> I will now examine what should be used instead, to be clinically actionable; recommended on-demand therapies that target the bradykinin pathway include plasma-derived or recombinant C1 inhibitor, the plasma kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant, and guidelines emphasize treating attacks as early as possible to reduce morbidity and risk, with fresh frozen plasma as a consideration when specific agents are unavailable, recognizing it may worsen some attacks [^114cyf2r] [^113ZQZXx] [^1111aioS].

> Wait, let me verify common pitfalls and special scenarios so I don't miss an important nuance; emergency departments have historically administered epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids inappropriately for HAE attacks, reflecting misdiagnosis and knowledge gaps, but this can delay effective therapy and worsen outcomes, and importantly, epinephrine remains essential if the patient is simultaneously experiencing true anaphylaxis, including rare drug-induced reactions such as ecallantide-associated anaphylaxis, where epinephrine is indicated for the anaphylactic process, not for the underlying HAE attack itself [^111CQwr5] [^111yKS4p] [^116coh53] [^116v4UDj] [^114j5WBf].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and airway considerations; guidelines stress that any attack affecting or potentially affecting the upper airway should be treated urgently with targeted HAE therapy and airway precautions, and they recommend that all patients have an action plan and be taught self-administration of on-demand treatments to ensure prompt access and early treatment outside of the hospital setting [^115nrdpe] [^116V7Db9] [^116PSPY2].

> Let me reconsider the strength of the conclusion language to be precise; my initial inclination was to say epinephrine is "contraindicated", but I should double-check terminology: guidelines state epinephrine is not recommended and is ineffective for HAE attacks, which is the accurate phrasing, while simultaneously emphasizing that epinephrine is first-line for anaphylaxis when that distinct condition is present, so patients with HAE should not rely on EpiPens for HAE management and instead must carry and promptly use approved on-demand HAE treatments according to their action plan [^111rp1m4] [^114cyf2r] [^116v4UDj] [^116V7Db9].

> Bottom line, after verifying mechanism, guidelines, and clinical scenarios: No, an epinephrine auto-injector is not helpful for treating hereditary angioedema attacks because HAE is bradykinin-mediated rather than histamine-mediated, and high-quality guidelines explicitly do not recommend epinephrine for HAE; effective management relies on targeted on-demand agents like C1 inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant used as early as possible, with epinephrine reserved for concomitant anaphylaxis due to other causes, not the HAE attack itself [^111pR1zs] [^111rp1m4] [^114cyf2r] [^113ZQZXx].

No, EpiPen (epinephrine) **does not help patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE)** because HAE is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids [^112x8tmA] [^111rp1m4] [^114kaCZH]. The **recommended acute treatments for HAE** are C1 inhibitor replacement, icatibant, or ecallantide, and patients should always have access to these HAE-specific therapies [^114cyf2r]. Epinephrine may be used **only if anaphylaxis is suspected**, but it does not treat HAE attacks [^116v4UDj].

---

## Pathophysiology of hereditary angioedema

HAE results from **C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction**, which drives excessive bradykinin production and increased vascular permeability, leading to swelling [^112x8tmA]. This **bradykinin-mediated mechanism** distinguishes HAE from histamine-mediated angioedema, which responds to epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids [^111yKS4p].

---

## Mechanism of action of epinephrine

Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic that activates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and reduced vascular permeability [^116v4UDj]. It is effective for histamine-mediated angioedema and anaphylaxis but **does not address the bradykinin-mediated pathway** involved in HAE [^111rp1m4].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding epinephrine use in HAE

Clinical guidelines and studies consistently indicate that **epinephrine is ineffective in treating HAE attacks** [^111XT8eJ]. The AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend against epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines for HAE management [^111rp1m4]. Case reports and clinical experience likewise confirm that HAE attacks do not respond to epinephrine [^114ep4GW].

---

## Recommended treatments for HAE

The recommended **acute treatments for HAE** attacks include:

- **C1 inhibitor replacement therapy**: Plasma-derived or recombinant C1 inhibitor concentrates are effective in treating acute HAE attacks [^114cyf2r].

- **Bradykinin receptor antagonists**: Icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, effectively treats acute HAE attacks [^114cyf2r].

- **Kallikrein inhibitors**: Ecallantide, a kallikrein inhibitor, is also effective in managing acute HAE attacks [^111VixqE].

These treatments **specifically target the bradykinin-mediated pathway** underlying HAE, providing effective symptom relief and preventing progression of swelling [^112x8tmA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from AAAAI/EAACI and WAO/EAACI consistently **recommend against the use of epinephrine for HAE attacks** [^111rp1m4]. They emphasize ensuring access to effective on-demand HAE-specific therapies [^111XT8eJ] and having an action plan with sufficient medication for acute attacks [^116V7Db9].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of epinephrine in HAE patients

While epinephrine is generally safe when used appropriately, it can cause side effects such as increased heart rate, anxiety, tremors, and hypertension [^115VADFC]. In HAE, unnecessary administration **may delay appropriate treatment** and worsen outcomes by postponing access to effective HAE-specific therapies [^113ZQZXx].

---

## Situations where epinephrine may be considered

Epinephrine may be considered in HAE patients **only if concurrent anaphylaxis is suspected** [^116hCcjF]. However, it does not treat the underlying bradykinin-mediated swelling characteristic of HAE attacks [^1117hMqg].

---

## Patient education and management strategies

Patients with HAE should be educated about the **ineffectiveness of epinephrine in treating HAE attacks**. They should receive clear action plans [^116V7Db9], access to effective on-demand therapies, and training in self-administration of HAE-specific medications [^116PSPY2]. Regular follow-up with healthcare providers specializing in HAE is essential to ensure optimal disease control and patient safety [^115Adp5v].

---

Epinephrine (EpiPen) is **not effective in treating hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks**, as HAE is bradykinin-mediated and does not respond to epinephrine [^111rp1m4]. The recommended treatments for HAE attacks include C1 inhibitor replacement therapy, bradykinin receptor antagonists, and kallikrein inhibitors [^114cyf2r]. Epinephrine may only be considered if there is suspicion of concurrent anaphylaxis, but it does not address the underlying mechanism of HAE [^116v4UDj].

### Kalbitor [^116coh53]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in 4% of treated patients. Administer Kalbitor in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis and hereditary angioedema. Given the similarity in hypersensitivity symptoms and acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) symptoms, monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis**: Potentially serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed in patients treated with Kalbitor. In a study of 255 HAE patients treated with intravenous or subcutaneous Kalbitor, 10 patients (4%) experienced anaphylaxis. Specifically, in the subgroup of 187 patients treated subcutaneously, 5 patients (3%) experienced anaphylaxis. Symptoms associated with these reactions included chest discomfort, flushing, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, throat irritation, urticaria, wheezing, and hypotension. These reactions typically occurred within the first hour after dosing. Other adverse reactions indicative of hypersensitivity included pruritus (5%), rash (3%), and urticaria (2%).

Patients should be observed for an appropriate period after administration of Kalbitor, considering the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials. Given the similarity in hypersensitivity and acute HAE symptoms, patients should be monitored closely in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. Kalbitor should not be administered to any patients with known clinical hypersensitivity.

The treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has undergone dramatic changes as newer medicines have become available in recent years. Optimal care of these patients requires a comprehensive management plan. Although several consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, guidelines for a comprehensive management plan have not been developed.

- **Objective**: To develop state-of-the-art recommendations for the treatment and management of HAE due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency in the United States.

- **Methods**: Members of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board began by reviewing the literature concerning treatment of HAE. Preliminary recommendations were developed based on the literature review, discussions in a face-to-face meeting, and refinements in a series of drafts. Final recommendations reflect the unanimous consensus of the medical advisory board and the US Hereditary Angioedema Association leadership.

- **Results**: Recommendations are provided regarding a comprehensive care plan for HAE, including the following: development of an overall management plan, treatment of angioedema attacks, prophylactic treatment, and patient monitoring.

- **Conclusion**: A comprehensive individualized management plan developed between an expert HAE physician and the patient, in collaboration with local medical providers and emergency departments, can provide patients with the best opportunity to lead a normal life.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of garadacimab for preventing hereditary angioedema attacks: Phase 3 open-label extension study [^113PGQUX]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease with an estimated global prevalence of approximately 1 in 50,000–100,000. HAE is characterized by episodes (attacks) of disfiguring swelling, most commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and upper airways. Attacks involving the tongue and larynx are potentially life-threatening. The unpredictable nature of attacks can substantially impair quality of life (QoL) by impacting daily activities, work, and mental health, resulting in considerable lifestyle modifications. World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (WAO/EAACI) guidelines state that the goals of HAE treatment are to achieve complete disease control and normalize patients' lives; presently, this can only be achieved with long-term prophylaxis (LTP).

Although currently available LTP options are efficacious, they may not be convenient for all patients as some require frequent dosing (e.g. once-daily berotralstat, lanadelumab every 2 weeks initially), some are administered intravenously (e.g. plasma-derived C1 inhibitor [C1INH]), and others are given in variable doses (e.g. subcutaneous [SC] C1INH). Despite sharing the same mechanism of action for kallikrein inhibition, berotralstat and lanadelumab differ in efficacy. This indicates that there remains a need for additional LTP options with alternative mechanisms of action, durable efficacy, a favorable safety profile, and convenient administration (with regard to frequency, route, and fixed dosing) to optimize patient compliance.

We published the Canadian 2003 International Consensus Algorithm for the Diagnosis, Therapy, and Management of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE; C1 inhibitor [C1-INH] deficiency) in 2004.

- **Objective**: To ensure that this consensus remains current.

- **Methods**: In collaboration with the Canadian Network of Rare Blood Disorder Organizations, we held the second Canadian Consensus discussion with our international colleagues in Toronto, Ontario, on February 3, 2006, and reviewed its content at the Fifth C1 Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop in Budapest on June 2, 2007. Papers were presented by international investigators, and this consensus algorithm approach resulted.

- **Results**: This consensus algorithm outlines the approach recommended for the diagnosis, therapy, and management of HAE, which was agreed on by the authors of this report. This document is only a consensus algorithm approach and continues to require validation. As such, participants agreed to make this a living 2007 algorithm, a work in progress, and to review its content at future international HAE meetings.

- **Conclusions**: There is a paucity of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on the treatment of HAE, making levels of evidence to support the algorithm less than optimal. Controlled trials currently underway will provide further insight into the management of HAE. As with our Canadian 2003 Consensus, this 2007 International Consensus Algorithm for the Diagnosis, Therapy, and Management of HAE was formed through the meeting and agreement of patient care professionals along with patient group representatives.

### Hereditary angioedema: Diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition.

Effective management of HAE must consider routine/long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, e.g. surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated the development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^111pR1zs]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, chronic disease characterized by unpredictable, recurrent angioedema attacks primarily mediated by uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity and overproduction of bradykinin. Excess bradykinin leads to vasodilation, vascular leakage, and consequent swelling. HAE attacks most commonly affect the extremities, face, abdomen, and larynx. Although less frequent, laryngeal attacks are potentially life-threatening because of the risk of rapid onset of respiratory obstruction and asphyxiation. For this reason, international guidelines recommend that all patients should have access to on-demand medication for treatment of acute attacks.

The clinical manifestations of HAE and the unpredictability of attacks can result in significant physical, emotional, and economic burdens for patients and families, including higher levels of anxiety and depression, inability to perform daily activities, and high direct and indirect care costs. Therefore, it is important that management of HAE focuses on reducing the frequency and severity of future attacks with prophylactic treatment in addition to on-demand therapies.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of hereditary angioedema in the emergency department [^114kaCZH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Angioedema (AE) is a clinical syndrome marked by localized swelling of the subcutaneous layer of the skin or the submucosal layer of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. While AE is commonly mediated by histamine (allergic AE), some types result from excessive bradykinin activity, including hereditary AE (HAE), acquired AE, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced AE. These are less common but important to consider given different treatment requirements and potentially serious outcomes, including death from laryngeal swelling.

This review describes the pathophysiology and clinical features of AE, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of AE in the emergency department (ED). Bradykinin-mediated AE does not respond to antihistamines and corticosteroids. However, several targeted, effective therapies are available, including C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates, which replace the missing protein activity underlying some bradykinin-mediated AE, and medications that directly lessen bradykinin activity (e.g. ecallantide and icatibant). Urticaria is generally absent in bradykinin-mediated AE and serves as a primary differentiating factor in the clinical diagnosis. Relevant laboratory assessments may include C1-INH levels, C1-INH function, and C4 complement. Patients with HAE or a family member can communicate their known diagnosis when presenting to the ED, and some may even bring their own medication(s) with them. Patients newly diagnosed with HAE in the ED should be referred for specialized outpatient care upon ED discharge.

### Managing chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema differently with advancing age [^111rSW99]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Angioedema and urticaria affect people of all ages. Accurate diagnosis and optimal management are essential for healthy aging. Older individuals continue to experience mast cell-mediated urticaria and angioedema, with a higher prevalence of autoimmune and a lower prevalence of autoallergic disease. Bradykinin-mediated angioedemas are more common in the elderly due to their association with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment. Acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, another bradykinin-mediated angioedema, occurs predominantly in older people, whereas hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency continues to cause symptoms, even in old age.

Drug-induced angioedemas disproportionately affect older individuals, the most frequent users of ACEIs, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment can prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Second-generation antihistamines with omalizumab, if required, are effective and well-tolerated in older individuals with mast cell-mediated urticaria. For bradykinin-mediated angioedemas, these drugs are ineffective. C1-inhibitor replacement or blockade of kallikrein or the bradykinin B2 receptor of the contact pathway is required to treat hereditary angioedema and may be considered in other bradykinin-mediated angioedemas if supportive treatment is insufficient. For aspirin-related angioedema and urticaria, alternative medications or, exceptionally, desensitization may be required.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for the treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only one medication is approved for the treatment of children under 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for the treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in the recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

Regarding the medical management for hereditary angioedema, especially with respect to prophylactic treatment, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend administering any of the following options for long-term prophylaxis in patients with HAE:

- **Low-to-moderate doses of anabolic androgens**: This is considered an effective and relatively safe option for many patients.

- **Antifibrinolytic agents**: These are somewhat effective and relatively safe, although generally less effective than androgens.

- **Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement**: This is recognized as an effective and safe option.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^116ySmwM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Early identification of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is critical to reducing mortality and morbidity and developing an appropriate management plan. The first HAE episode may be a laryngeal attack, which can be fatal. An analysis of 70 patients with HAE who had asphyxiated during a laryngeal attack showed that mortality was higher in patients with undiagnosed HAE (63 cases) than in patients with diagnosed HAE (7 cases). Upper airway swelling is also more severe in pediatric patients due to the smaller diameter of the airway, which increases the risk of asphyxiation.

Barriers to early diagnosis include poor recognition of HAE symptoms by healthcare professionals, a lack of appropriate family screening tools, and a lack of access to simple laboratory tests to help establish a diagnosis. Symptoms typically present in childhood, and delays in diagnosis can subject patients to inappropriate treatment and unnecessary medical interventions.

Despite its familial association, many family members of patients with HAE are not screened for the disorder. A survey of patients with HAE found that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested for the condition. With the availability of effective therapies, screening of family members has increasingly been emphasized as a way to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with HAE. Each child of a parent with HAE has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder; therefore, all infants with a family history of HAE should be considered to have the disorder until the diagnosis is ruled out.

### Anaphylaxis: Guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^116hCcjF]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, specifically with respect to epinephrine, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend prescribing at least one epinephrine autoinjector for patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Previous anaphylaxis**: Triggered by food, latex, or aeroallergens
- **Previous exercise-induced anaphylaxis**
- **Previous idiopathic anaphylaxis**
- **Coexisting conditions**: Unstable or moderate-to-severe, persistent asthma and a food allergy (excluding pollen food syndrome)
- **Venom allergy**: In adult patients with previous systemic reactions (not receiving maintenance Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy) and pediatric patients with more than cutaneous/mucosal systemic reactions
- **Underlying mast cell disorders**: Elevated baseline serum tryptase concentrations along with any previous systemic allergic reactions to insect stings, even in Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy-treated patients.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects approximately 1 in 50,000 persons. There are no known surveys of US physicians' knowledge and experience regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of HAE.

- **Objective**: This survey of physicians treating patients with HAE assessed physician characteristics, diagnostic and treatment practices, factors that influence physician and patient treatment choices, and physician awareness of new therapies.

- **Methods**: From October 2009 to February 2010, physicians (N = 172) voluntarily completed an online survey developed by physician-investigators. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Most physicians (73.8%) managed 5 patients or fewer in diverse practice settings. Laboratory testing was considered most important in establishing a diagnosis. Fresh frozen plasma and C1 esterase inhibitors were the most frequently administered treatments for acute events; nearly 50% of respondents prescribed C1 esterase inhibitor for acute attacks. More than 80% of respondents prescribed androgens for long-term prophylaxis. Approximately half of respondents were aware of, and likely to use, new therapies for HAE. Other than efficacy, adverse effects were the most important factor that influenced physicians' treatment recommendations, whereas physicians perceived that patients were most influenced by adverse effects and cost.

- **Conclusions**: Wide variability exists in the treatment of patients with HAE. Many patients experience acute attacks that require emergency care or hospital.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, specifically with respect to epinephrine, the clinician-delivered AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 guidelines recommend recognition that there may be circumstances where self-injectable epinephrine is deferred, such as in resolved anaphylaxis and drug triggers with a high likelihood of successful avoidance. In such cases, shared decision-making may play a role.

### A focused parameter update: Hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^11449PFm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, particularly in patients with acquired angioedema, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend treating patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency similarly to those with HAE, while recognizing the following significant differences:

- **Increased efficacy**: Antifibrinolytic agents have increased efficacy.
- **Decreased efficacy**: C1 inhibitor replacement shows decreased efficacy.
- **Underlying condition**: It is necessary to treat an underlying condition associated with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by allergy and immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach for managing patients through dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines, followed by the use of omalizumab, and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases.

In select patients, particularly those with refractory chronic urticaria, nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals can have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. The optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often handled similarly to chronic spontaneous urticaria.

Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies on targeted therapies have generally been disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for managing hereditary angioedema.

Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

### Diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema: an emergency medicine perspective [^11685w3u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and often debilitating condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the absence of appropriate intervention. An underlying deficiency in functional C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein induces a vulnerability to unchecked activation of the complement, contact, and coagulation/fibrinolytic systems. The clinical consequence is a pattern of recurring attacks of non-pitting, non-pruritic edema, the urgency of which varies by the affected site. Laryngeal edema can escalate rapidly to asphyxiation, and severe cases of abdominal swelling can lead to hypovolemic shock.

- **Objectives**: This report reviews the emergency diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema and the impact of recently introduced treatments on treatment in the United States.

- **Discussion**: Until recently, emergency physicians in the United States were hindered by the lack of rapidly effective treatment options for HAE attacks. In this article, general clinical and laboratory diagnostic procedures are reviewed against the backdrop of two case studies: one patient presenting with a known history of HAE and one with previously undiagnosed HAE. In many countries outside the United States, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate has for decades been the first-line treatment for acute attacks. The end of 2009 ushered in a new era in the pharmacologic management of HAE attacks in the United States with the approval of two new treatment options for acute treatment: a plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate and a kallikrein inhibitor.

- **Conclusion**: With access to targeted treatments, effective management of HAE during emergencies has significantly improved.

### Is there a need for clinical guidelines in the United States for the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema and the screening of family members of affected patients [^1117NMgA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH) protein or function. Guidelines do not exist regarding diagnostic criteria or routine testing of family members of patients with HAE. Laboratory data for diagnosis include complement factor 4 level, C1 INH antigenic protein level — which is reduced in approximately 85% of patients with HAE — and C1 INH functional assay, which is considered an unreliable test in the United States due to inconsistent standardization of assays.

- **Objectives**: To assess the shortcomings of diagnosing HAE and to determine whether family members of patients with HAE are being adequately screened.

- **Methods**: The top physician prescribers of danazol in the United States were screened via an internet questionnaire focusing on the diagnosis and management of HAE. To assess the patient perspective on HAE, affected individuals in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and The Netherlands participated in the web-based International Survey of Patient Experience of Hereditary Angioedema.

- **Results**: All 80 physicians who completed the survey were allergists or immunologists with a mean of 7 patients with C1 INH deficiency in their practices. Almost 84% of physician respondents used C1 INH level and function for diagnosis, and 63.8% used complement factor 4 levels. A total of 313 patients with HAE completed the survey. Respondents noted that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested.

- **Conclusion**: Guidelines are necessary to improve the diagnosis and screening of hereditary angioedema in the United States, especially to enhance the screening rates among family members of affected individuals.

### Global frequency, diagnosis, and treatment of hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor [^112mXA86]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) largely focus on HAE-C1INH Types 1 and 2. Recommendations specific to HAE with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE-nC1INH) have not been fully developed due to the challenges in confirming a diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH. This is because standardized, validated biochemical diagnostic tests are lacking, and genetic tests for the fraction of cases with known disease-causing mutations are not widely available. The 2021 World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines recommend the following for the differential diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH: suspicion of HAE should prompt laboratory testing to assess C1INH function, C1INH protein levels, and C4 levels. Patients suspected of having HAE who present with normal C1INH levels and function should undergo genetic testing for known mutations underlying HAE-nC1INH. Additionally, these guidelines state that diagnostic procedures, such as genetic testing, should be used where available, and other options should be considered when recommended procedures are not accessible. The guidelines note that family history is an important tool for identifying patients with HAE-nC1INH. Unlike HAE-C1INH Types 1 and 2, treatment of HAE-nC1INH has not been established by randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

A recent survey of real-world practice provided estimates of HAE-nC1INH prevalence and described diagnoses and management strategies in the United States leveraging claims data; however, these may not be globally representative. To address this gap, physicians treating HAE in certified centers have been investigated.

### A consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema in the emergency department [^111yKS4p]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively common occurrence and life-threatening potential, the management of angioedema in the emergency department (ED) lacks a structured approach. It is paramount to distinguish the different etiologies of angioedema, particularly differentiating histaminergic-mediated angioedema from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, especially in light of the more novel treatments available for bradykinin-mediated angioedema.

This consensus parameter for the evaluation and management of angioedema provides a working framework for emergency physicians (EPs) in diagnosing and managing patients with angioedema in the ED. Developed from a collaborative effort among EPs and leading allergists with expertise in angioedema, the consensus guideline document emerged after rigorous debate, literature review, and expert opinion. It has been endorsed by the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM).

### Kalbitor [^111VixqE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Kalbitor to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in adolescents and adults were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (EDEMA4 and EDEMA3), involving 168 patients with HAE. Patients experiencing an attack of hereditary angioedema, at any anatomical location, with at least one moderate or severe symptom, were treated with 30 mg subcutaneous Kalbitor or placebo. Due to the allowance for patients to participate in both trials, a total of 143 unique patients participated. Among these, 94 were female, 123 were Caucasian, and the mean age was 36 years (ranging from 11 to 77). There were 64 patients with abdominal attacks, 55 with peripheral attacks, and 24 with laryngeal attacks.

In both trials, the effects of Kalbitor were evaluated using the Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score and the Treatment Outcome Score (TOS). These endpoints evaluated attack severity (MSCS) and patient response to treatment (TOS) for an acute HAE attack. The MSCS score is a point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline, and post-dosing at 4 hours and 24 hours, patients rated the severity of each affected symptom on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patient-reported severity was based on each patient's assessment of symptom impact on their ability to perform routine activities. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. The endpoint was reported as the change in MSCS score from baseline. A decrease in the MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptom severity.

### US HAEA medical advisory board 2020 guidelines for the management of hereditary angioedema [^116iocJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Scientific and clinical progress, together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options, has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence.

- **Classification, diagnosis, and treatment**: Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, and prophylactic treatment.
- **Special considerations**: Special considerations for women and children are addressed.
- **Comprehensive management**: Development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan is encouraged.
- **Burden of illness assessment**: Assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor is discussed.

Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### Specialist advice support for management of severe hereditary angioedema attacks: A multicenter cluster-randomized controlled trial [^112N2biu]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease associated with unpredictable attacks of potentially life-threatening edema. Management of severe attacks is currently suboptimal because emergency medical teams are often unaware of new specific treatments. The objective of this trial is to test whether a dedicated national telephone care-management strategy would reduce resource use during severe hereditary angioedema attacks.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cluster-randomized multicenter prospective trial of patients with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I, II, or FXII hereditary angioedema). Participants were enrolled between March 2013 and June 2014 at 8 participating reference centers. The randomized units were the reference centers (clusters). Patients in the intervention arm were given a national free telephone number to call in the event of a severe attack. Emergency physicians in the SOS-hereditary angioedema (SOS-HAE) call center were trained to advise or prescribe specific treatments. The primary outcome was the number of admissions for angioedema attacks. Economic evaluation was also performed.

- **Results**: We included 100 patients in the SOS-HAE group and 100 in the control group. During the 2 years, there were 2,368 hereditary angioedema attacks among 169 patients (85%). The mean number of hospital admissions per patient in the 2-year period was significantly greater in the usual-practice group (mean 0.16 [range 0 to 2] versus 0.03 [range 0 to 1]); the patient risk difference was significant: -0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to -0.04; p = 0.02).

### Consensus on treatment goals in hereditary angioedema: A global Delphi initiative [^112iD5xe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by episodes of subcutaneous or submucosal angioedema. The ultimate goals of treatment for HAE remain ill-defined.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this Delphi process was to define the goals of HAE treatment and examine which factors should be considered when assessing disease control and normalization of the patient's life.

- **Methods**: The Delphi panel comprised 23 participants selected based on involvement with scientific research on HAE or coauthorship of the most recent update and revision of the World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guideline on HAE. The process comprised three rounds of voting. The final round aimed to aggregate the opinions of the expert panel and achieve consensus.

- **Results**: Two direct consensus questions were posed in round two, based on responses received in round one, and the panel agreed that the goals of treatment are to achieve total control of the disease and normalize the patient's life. For the third round of voting, 21 statements were considered, with the participants reaching consensus on 18. It is clear from the wide-ranging consensus statements that the burdens of disease and treatment should be considered when assessing disease control and normalization of patients' lives.

- **Conclusions**: The ultimate goal for HAE treatment is to achieve no angioedema attacks. The availability of improved treatments and disease management over the last decade now makes complete control of HAE a realistic outcome.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^111zrKrA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

It is important to be aware of hereditary angioedema (HAE) as a cause of swelling in the absence of urticaria. The fact that 25% of patients do not have a family history is not an impediment to diagnosis because a C4 level and C1 inhibitor determination by protein and by function is diagnostic and has the potential to decrease the unnecessary lag time between clinical presentation and the initiation of appropriate therapy.

Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured, but effective treatments can reduce disease burden and improve quality of life (QoL) in children with HAE. Initial clinical symptoms of HAE typically occur in childhood. Early recognition by all health care professionals, particularly those caring for pediatric patients, reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality as well as unnecessary interventions. Alternative modalities, such as music therapy and other complementary therapies, can supplement medical management and improve a pediatric patient's treatment experience by facilitating administration and reducing the child's stress, anxiety, pain perception, and fear. Such approaches can also relieve parental concerns about multiple injections, contributing to an increased QoL for children with HAE.

Multiple therapies are available that can abort acute episodes of angioedema and therapy that can be administered regularly as prophylaxis to prevent them. These can be life-saving given the known mortality statistics when this disorder is untreated.

### On-demand treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks: Patient-reported utilization, barriers, and outcomes [^117Dvkkr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous and submucosal swelling.

- **Objective**: To investigate real-world timing, potential barriers, and the impact of delaying on-demand treatment (OD) of HAE attacks.

- **Methods**: Patients with HAE (type I or II) aged 12 years or older, with at least one treated (Treated Cohort) or untreated (Untreated Cohort) attack in the past three months, were recruited by the US HAE Association. Respondents completed a 20-minute, self-reported, online survey about their last HAE attack.

- **Results**: In the Treated Cohort (n = 94), 67% reported treating their attack early, but only 26% administered OD in less than one hour. Furthermore, 79% (n = 74) reported treatment-related anxiety, which correlated with treatment delay. Time to treatment paralleled changes in attack severity; 33% of mild attacks were treated in 8 hours, taking an average of 2.7 days. In the Untreated Cohort (n = 20), 50% of respondents described their last untreated attack as mild, but experienced progression to moderate or severe, and 25% reported spread to another site, including the larynx and face. Untreated attacks lasted a mean of 2.3 days.

- **Conclusion**: The disparity between respondents' perception of treating early and the actual time to OD administration is striking. Treatment-related anxiety was a common reason for delaying OD. Increased treatment intervals translated into the progression of HAE attack severity, duration, and spread to other sites.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^113ybp7z]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Rare laryngeal attacks are experienced by approximately 50% of hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients at least once in their lifetime and represent a continuous threat because they mostly occur spontaneously and without warning. An increased risk of developing laryngeal edema has been associated with several factors: age between 11 and 45 years, general anesthesia with intubation, history of laryngeal edema, dental surgery, and facial edema. Although the first clinical symptoms of HAE are generally abdominal or facial attacks, laryngeal attacks can occur later in life. However, a laryngeal attack can also be the first clinical symptom of HAE and may be life-threatening, as demonstrated in the case of a 9-year-old boy who died from a laryngeal attack, which was the first clinical sign of his known C1-INH deficiency.

The rapid onset of relief observed in our study, with all attacks being treated successfully, provides reassurance that the recommended dose of 20 U/kg for C1-INH concentrate is a reliable therapeutic option for the emergency treatment of laryngeal HAE attacks.

- **Time period available for treatment**: The time period for the emergency treatment of laryngeal edema lies between the start of the attack and its maximum development. This period was an average of 8.3 hours for untreated attacks in 61 HAE patients and was relatively constant in patients experiencing more than one laryngeal attack. In our study, C1-INH concentrate was mostly administered during the critical time before maximum development of the laryngeal attack, with the infusion being given a median of 2.8 hours after the estimated start of the attack.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: A systematic review [^117NWsmx]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

The applied methods for this systematic review are described in the supplementary material. Eleven papers describing 13 eligible trials were identified (referenced in the Supplementary). Definitions of all outcome measurement instruments used in the included trials are shown in Table S1.

Thirteen unique primary outcomes were collapsed into nine standardized outcome terms, representing outcomes with the same meaning but with differing wording. Table 1 provides these standardized primary outcomes, while Table 2 displays the standardized outcome terms used as secondary outcomes in the included trials. The majority (81%) of these standardized outcomes were not used as secondary outcomes in more than one trial. The exploratory outcomes are summarized in Table S2. Notably, two outcome measures which were planned in the trial protocol were not mentioned in the full paper or supplementary material (Table S3).

- **Standardized primary outcomes**: We identified 72 standardized efficacy outcome terms reported in studies evaluating on-demand treatment of acute attacks in hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients, of which nine were used as a primary outcome measure. No outcome measure was reported consistently in all 13 trials. Eleven instruments were utilized by 74% of the standardized outcomes, which can be broadly divided into instruments evaluating location-specific symptoms and instruments providing a general classification of overall attack severity.

- **On treatment response measures**: Outcomes measuring treatment response were predominantly either time-based (e.g. time to symptom relief) or symptom-based (e.g. change in severity at a predefined time).

### A cross-sectional questionnaire assessing patient and physician use of short-term prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema [^114N9pe4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend short-term prophylaxis (STP) before invasive procedures to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks; however, adherence to these guidelines may be variable because this indication lacks Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States.

- **Objective**: To ascertain the STP experiences of patients with HAE and HAE-treating physicians.

- **Methods**: Online questionnaires focusing on STP experiences were distributed by the US Hereditary Angioedema Association to the first 250 patients with HAE and to registered HAE-treating physicians. SAS 9.3 was used to perform descriptive statistics and to test the difference between patients who underwent procedures and those who did not using Pearson χ² test, Fisher exact test, and 2-sample t test.

- **Results**: For the patient survey, 219 respondents met the criteria for HAE type 1 and 2; 37 (17%) underwent 66 invasive procedures, and all reported receiving STP. Eight patients (22%) reported failed STP, but only 3 required on-demand therapy. For STP, anabolic steroids and plasma-derived C1 inhibitor were the most and second-most commonly used, respectively. For the physician survey, 37 physicians reported caring for 433 patients with HAE. Depending on the procedure, 19% to 54% of physicians used STP, and 30% to 86% prescribed on-demand therapy; 69% and 78% of physicians prescribed plasma-derived C1 inhibitor as STP for minimally invasive and invasive procedures, respectively. Physicians reported excellent efficacy for the STP treatments used.

- **Conclusion**: Physicians reported excellent outcomes using STP treatments.

### Radiologic manifestations of angioedema [^1117hMqg]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Angioedema attacks can last from 1 to 5 days depending on the causes and symptoms. Importantly, acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) and acquired angioedema (AAE) do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or steroids. Consequently, treatment is often mainly supportive, consisting of intravenous fluids and upper airway management. Allergen and drug-induced angioedema are treated with the elimination of causative agents. For acute attacks of HAE and AAE, treatments such as C1-INH concentrate, kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, bradykinin B2 antagonist icatibant, or fresh frozen plasma are administered.

- **Imaging findings**:
	- **Head and neck**: Upper airway obstruction can be a life-threatening complication from angioedema. In emergent cases, airway management precludes imaging. In less urgent cases, a lateral plain radiograph of the neck can be used for the initial imaging assessment (Fig. 1). On plain film, attention should be paid to the presence or absence of swelling in the retropharyngeal soft tissue, epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and soft palate. Computed tomography (CT) — with lateral scanogram of the neck and multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images — is also useful in evaluating upper airway obstruction (Fig. 2).

	- **Figure 1**: A 33-year-old female with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The soft tissue swelling of the neck during angioedema attacks. The patient complained of neck swelling. The lateral radiograph of the neck shows thickening of the retropharyngeal soft tissue (asterisk), enlargement of the epiglottis with narrowing of the vallecula (large arrow), and thickening of the aryepiglottic folds (small arrow).

### Anaphylaxis: Guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^112vURqw]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anaphylaxis, particularly concerning epinephrine, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of epinephrine as an infusion by appropriately experienced intensive care, emergency department, and critical care physicians. This should be done with appropriate cardiac monitoring in patients who have shown an inadequate response to two or more doses of intramuscular epinephrine.

### Prodromes predict attacks of hereditary angioedema: Results of a prospective study [^114FxSGF]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) prodromes represent a continuity of pathophysiologic events, initiated by the activation of the bradykinin-forming cascade and ending with a breach in vascular endothelial integrity. In this study, we aimed to capture the critical elements of prodromes and their association with consequent attacks, evaluating their predictive power as an early warning sign. The HAE-EPA instrument reliably captures patients' experiences by using consistent metrics, and the prospective design better reflects patients' experiences in real-time, which may have been missed in our previous study.

The study highlights the predictive value of prodromes as forecasters of attacks. It affirms that patients can clearly distinguish prodromes from attacks. The positive correlations support our fundamental assumption that prodromes could predict attack location and severity, particularly in the abdomen. High-intensity attacks were predated by high-intensity prodromes, substantiating our observations on interpersonal differences among subjects. The mean disease duration of the cohort (27 years) suggests that the study subjects were experienced patients who could recognize early pre-attack cues.

Although the study was not designed to investigate on-demand medication use, there is evidence that early treatment of attacks, even at the prodromal stage, may enhance their resolution. Therefore, experienced patients can use prodromes as an efficient strategy in managing their condition.

### Emergency department management of hereditary angioedema attacks: Patient perspectives [^111CQwr5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has been hindered by misdiagnosis and limited treatment options. Food and Drug Administration approval of four on-demand HAE therapies starting in 2009 and the publication of ED guidelines for angioedema management in 2014 should facilitate improvement of HAE management in the ED.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to identify patient-reported areas for improvement in ED management of HAE attacks.

- **Methods**: Patients with self-reported HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency who attended the 2015 HAE Association Patient Summit were asked to complete an anonymous 30-question survey. Questions addressed patient characteristics and HAE management in the ED.

- **Results**: Patients indicated that understanding of HAE in the ED needed improvement (99%, 104 of 105 patients). Recognition of HAE as a diagnosis (48%, 50 of 105 patients), appreciation of HAE as a serious disease (45%, 47 of 105 patients), and medication management (59%, 62 of 105 patients) were identified as areas needing improvement. Among 39 patients who required ED care within the last year, 6 did not receive any HAE-targeted therapy, and treatment with corticosteroids (n = 3), epinephrine (n = 2), and antihistamines (n = 7) was reported. Among 68 patients whose treatment plan was to receive home on-demand therapy, 26 required ED care because of an inability to receive on-demand therapy at home as outlined in their treatment plan. Having a treatment plan was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving HAE therapy in the ED (99% vs 74%).

### Lanadelumab demonstrates rapid and sustained prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks [^114sd2V2]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

An understanding of what to expect from therapy, including how quickly a protective effect against attacks is likely to begin and how long it is expected to continue, can assist with deciding whether to initiate and how long to continue prophylactic treatment. This knowledge may help encourage patients to adhere to treatment. In the authors' clinical experience, understanding the durable protection from attacks provided by lanadelumab may help patients feel less concerned about the continual need to avoid possible triggering factors.

In conclusion, findings from these ad hoc analyses demonstrate a rapid onset of action and sustained prevention of attacks with lanadelumab in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Patients can expect to achieve a favorable early response and a comparable or improved response over time.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^115toqpb]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by unpredictable episodes of edema at various body locations due to an inherited functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). C1-INH is a crucial control protein within the complement and kallikrein–kinin cascade systems. During HAE attacks, these plasma proteolytic cascades are activated, and either the complete lack of C1-INH (type I HAE) or the expression of dysfunctional C1-INH (type II HAE) results in enhanced vascular permeability, leading to local subcutaneous or submucous swellings.

The most frequent symptoms of HAE include acute episodes of skin swellings or abdominal pain, which can be inconvenient and painful but are generally not life-threatening. In contrast, the rare but potentially life-threatening episodes of laryngeal edema (approximately 1% of HAE attacks) present a risk of asphyxiation, making them a major concern for patients with HAE. Clinical manifestations of laryngeal attacks include hoarseness, stridor, dyspnea, the sensation of a lump in the larynx, dysphagia, and voice changes.

The first-line therapy for acute HAE attacks is replacement therapy with C1-INH concentrate, as recommended in the 2007 International Consensus Algorithm for the Management of HAE. Before effective treatments were available, up to 25% to 30% of patients with HAE died from laryngeal edema. Even higher mortality rates, approximately 50%, have been reported for patients with undiagnosed HAE. Since the introduction of C1-INH concentrate in severe cases…

### Isolated angioedema: A review of classification and update on management [^116Ko4pV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to provide insights into the various types of angioedema, focusing on their diagnosis and treatment.

- **Data sources**: A PubMed search of articles in English related to various types of angioedema.

- **Study selections**: Articles relevant to the subject were selected and thoroughly reviewed.

- **Results**: This review uses a case-based approach to discuss major types of angioedema, including hereditary angioedema types I and II, normal complement, acquired angioedema, angiotensin-converting enzyme-induced angioedema, and histaminergic and nonhistaminergic angioedema. The review explores emerging treatments for hereditary angioedema, focusing on targets such as prekallikrein, DNA vector technology for C1-INH protein replacement, and CRISPR technology targeting prekallikrein among others. Additionally, other causes and mimickers of angioedema are briefly examined. A novel algorithm is proposed to assist physicians in the workup and management of patients with suspected idiopathic angioedema that is unresponsive to conventional antihistamine therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Over the years, significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of various types of angioedema and expanding treatment options. It is crucial for clinicians to be aware of emerging treatment options. We provide a novel practical algorithm to guide clinicians in managing challenging cases of idiopathic angioedema refractory to antihistamines.

### Hereditary angioedema: A current state-of-the-art review, III: Mechanisms of hereditary angioedema [^112x8tmA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

To review the available evidence on the pathophysiologic mechanism of episodes of edema in hereditary angioedema (HAE), MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using the following keywords: hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor, complement system, contact system, and bradykinin.

Studies were selected based on their relevance to the pathophysiologic features of HAE. Early studies from the 1970s and 1980s disagreed as to whether the symptoms in HAE were mediated via complement or contact system activation. Studies have demonstrated that, in vitro, in C1 inhibitor (C1-INH)-deficient plasma, only contact system activation results in the generation of a vascular permeability enhancing factor. Furthermore, individuals who express a variant C1-INH that is a normal inhibitor of contact system proteases but is deficient in the ability to inactivate complement system proteases do not develop angioedema. The blood of patients with HAE, during attacks, contains elevated levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen and bradykinin. Last, C1-INH-deficient mice develop increased vascular permeability that is mediated via contact system activation.

In conclusion, hereditary angioedema attacks are mediated by bradykinin generated via contact system activation. The specific factors that trigger attacks remain unclear.

### International consensus on the use of genetics in the management of hereditary angioedema [^112si9wD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is becoming much more genetically complex than was initially considered. Thus, the role of HAE genetics is expanding beyond research laboratories, and the genotyping of subjects suffering from HAE has become diagnostically indispensable in clinical practice. The synthesis and interpretation of the clinical and biochemical analyses to facilitate appropriate genetic test selection has thus also become significantly more complex.

With this in mind, an international multidisciplinary group of 14 experts in HAE genetics and disease management was convened in October 2018. The objective was to develop clear, actionable, evidence- and consensus-based statements aiming to facilitate the communication between physicians treating patients with HAE and clinical geneticists, and thus promote the effective use of genetics in the management of the disease.

Eleven consensus statements were generated, encompassing considerations regarding the clinical indications for genotyping patients with angioedema, the methods of detection of HAE-causative variants, the variant pathogenicity curation, the genotyping of patients with HAE in the clinic, and genetic counseling. These statements are intended both to guide clinicians and to serve as a framework for future educational and further genetic testing developments, as the field continues to evolve rapidly.

### The spectrum and treatment of angioedema [^111SAmKh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Angioedema manifests as episodes of localized swelling in the dermis and submucosa. The key to successful management is detection and avoidance of triggers, early recognition of attacks, and aggressive airway management when warranted. A review of a patient's medication list may identify drugs that include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers as the cause. Initial treatment in a patient presenting with most forms of angioedema includes antihistamines and glucocorticoids if required. Epinephrine should be administered if there is concern for laryngeal edema. Patients who have a known history of hereditary angioedema should receive C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma.

### Prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema: A United Kingdom Delphi consensus [^114LHmVx]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare inherited disorder causing episodes of swelling that can be potentially life-threatening. Treatment of HAE can be divided into on-demand treatment for swelling and prophylaxis. The last UK consensus on HAE was in 2014, and since then, new medications for prophylaxis have been developed, with more drugs in the pipeline. International guidelines currently recommend the use of long-term prophylaxis (LTP) as the only way of achieving disease control and normalizing patient lives.

Modern prophylactic medications are available in the UK, although access is restricted primarily by HAE attack frequency. To establish an updated view of UK clinicians and patients, a Delphi process was used to develop statements regarding LTP as well as other aspects of HAE management. There was consensus that UK access criteria for modern LTP agents, based on numerical frequency of attacks alone, are too simplistic and potentially disadvantage a cohort of patients who may benefit from LTP.

Additionally, there was agreement that patients should be seen in expert centres, remote monitoring of patients is popular post-pandemic, and the use of patient-reported outcome measures has the potential to improve patient care. Psychological health is an area in which patients may benefit, and recognition of this is important for future research and development.

### Hereditary angioedema: Current and emerging treatment options [^116EfGJo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Angioedema can result from allergic, hereditary, and acquired conditions. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks are disabling at the time of occurrence and can be life-threatening; they often result in hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. Although there are several variants of HAE, they share a final common pathway: unopposed activation of multiple kinins and mediators, including kallikrein and bradykinin. This leads to increased vascular permeability, which in turn produces the edema after which the condition is named.

Older treatment options licensed in the United States, such as anabolic steroids and antifibrinolytics, have troublesome side effect profiles and may not reverse a severe acute attack. In Europe, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates have been used since 1974 for both preventing and terminating attacks. Two of these have now been licensed in the United States for use in HAE patients, one for prophylaxis and the other for treating acute abdominal and facial HAE attacks. The first kinin pathway modulator, ecallantide, has also been licensed recently in the United States for treating HAE attacks.

The objective of this article is to describe HAE and review the available options for managing patients, as well as different drugs currently under investigation. Specific attention is given to the perioperative management of patients with HAE.

### Interplay between on-demand treatment trials for hereditary angioedema and treatment guidelines [^116mmj2W]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Over the past two decades, guidelines for the on-demand treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks have undergone significant evolution. Early treatment guidelines, such as the Canadian 2003 International Consensus Algorithm, often gated on-demand treatment by attack location and/or severity. Pivotal trials for on-demand injectable treatments (plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor, icatibant, ecallantide [United States only], and recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor), which were approved in the United States and the European Union between 2008 and 2014, were designed accordingly. Subsequent post hoc analyses of clinical trial data, alongside real-world evidence, led to a paradigm shift.

In 2013, the US Hereditary Angioedema Association guidelines recommended that all attacks, irrespective of location or severity, be considered for treatment as early as possible after onset to minimize morbidity and mortality. This approach remains the cornerstone of treatment guidelines and has shaped the design of recent clinical trials, such as those for the investigational agents, oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor sebetralstat and oral bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist deucrictibant. This narrative review discusses the evolution of on-demand treatment guidelines, the clinical trial and real-world data that prompted significant revisions, and the subsequent changes to trial designs introduced to facilitate guideline compliance.

### Hereditary and acquired angioedema: Problems and progress: Proceedings of the third C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshop and beyond [^115RXuk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare but life-threatening condition, manifests as acute attacks of facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling or abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), the inhibitor of the first complement system component, these attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis. Despite the availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States.

- **The biennial C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshops**: These meetings resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. It includes cumulative genetic investigations, multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations, pathogenesis hypotheses, suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment (including home treatment), future treatment options, and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed.

- **Collaborative patient and physician efforts**: Emphasized as crucial in rare diseases, these efforts are intended to raise awareness and aid in the diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment options, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: A systematic review [^115Wwr1E]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by recurrent swellings of subcutaneous and mucosal tissue. Access to effective on-demand medication to treat acute attacks is vital for every HAE patient. Clinical trials investigating new acute treatment options focus on increased efficacy, easier routes of administration, and reduced side effects. The outcome measures reported in these studies have been varied. This range of efficacy outcomes is, at least partly, caused by the difficulty in developing a unique uniform outcome measure that captures the heterogeneity in attack location, symptoms, severity, and temporal patterns. In addition, these efficacy outcomes depend heavily on patient-reported outcomes, as sensations such as relief of discomfort, disability, and pain cannot be measured objectively by clinicians.

The heterogeneity in outcome measures hinders trial comparison, leads to selective outcome reporting bias, and the large quantity of outcome measures used in a single trial puts a significant burden on participants. It is unclear which primary outcome parameters best reflect the efficacy of the investigated acute treatment options. These issues can be addressed with a Core Outcome Set (COS); "an agreed standardized collection of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area". This systematic review aims to summarize the efficacy outcome measures reported in studies evaluating acute treatment in HAE patients as a first step in the development of a COS.

### Hereditary angioedema: A current state-of-the-art review, IV: Short- and long-term treatment of hereditary angioedema: Out with the old and in with the new [^114TpZFQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

To provide a context to understand the opportunity for novel therapeutic modalities to transform the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE), MEDLINE and PubMed were searched to identify studies involving the treatment of HAE in the United States. Studies were selected based on their relevance to the treatment of HAE.

The HAE treatment strategy is far from satisfactory, and its limitations create an unmet clinical need. Prophylactic treatment exposes patients with HAE to significant risk of adverse effects, and the efficacy of prophylactic treatment, although generally good, is far from perfect.

No specific treatment is currently available in the United States for acute HAE attacks that will reliably work, resulting in a significant unmet clinical need. The emergence of several promising drugs for the treatment of HAE attacks is, thus, an extraordinarily important development in the management of these patients.

### A focused parameter update: Hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^111m8iJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary angioedema, particularly in patients with acquired angioedema, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend diagnosing acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency based on the following features:

- **Reduced C1 inhibitor function**: This indicates a lack of necessary proteins to control inflammation and swelling.
- **Activation of complement**: This condition involves the inappropriate triggering of the complement system, leading to excess inflammation.
- **Reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1)**: A lower level suggests an underlying deficiency that contributes to the disorder.
