## Question

A 23-year-old woman presented to the clinic for her first prenatal appointment with fatigue and pain in the perineum for the past 8 days. The past medical history is benign and she claimed to have only had unprotected intercourse with her husband. She had a documented allergic reaction to amoxicillin 2 years ago. The vaginal speculum exam revealed a clean, ulcerated genital lesion, which was tender and non-exudative. No lymphadenopathy was detected. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test revealed a titer of 1:64 and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA- abs) test was positive. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Penicillin desensitization, then intramuscular benzathine penicillin, G 2.4 million units
B. Oral tetracycline, 500 mg 4 times daily x 1 week
C. Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily x 14 days
D. Delay treatment until delivery

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the best next step in managing a pregnant patient with confirmed syphilis and a reported amoxicillin allergy, choosing among penicillin desensitization, doxycycline, tetracycline, or delaying treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging of syphilis. Then, I should verify the implications of pregnancy on treatment choice and maternal–fetal risk. Next, I will evaluate the reported amoxicillin allergy and whether desensitization is indicated. After that, I need to compare guideline-supported treatment options and explicitly exclude contraindicated alternatives. Finally, I will outline the correct regimen, monitoring, and counseling, and then select the best answer from the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage of disease. The patient has a compatible genital ulcer with a reactive nontreponemal test (RPR 1:64) and a positive treponemal test (FTA-ABS), which together confirm active syphilis; the clinical picture is most consistent with primary syphilis given the single, clean, tender, non-exudative ulcer and relatively recent onset of symptoms, although I should remember that many patients with primary syphilis do not have palpable lymphadenopathy at presentation, so the absence of nodes does not exclude primary disease [^1125VNSQ] [^116e1xhx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I anchor the pregnancy-specific risks. I need to ensure I emphasize that untreated maternal syphilis poses substantial risks to the fetus, including congenital infection, stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal disease, and that the risk correlates with maternal nontreponemal titer; here the RPR titer of 1:64 is high, indicating high infectivity and significant fetal risk, so treatment cannot be delayed [^116iVEvj].

> Next, I should review the standard of care in pregnancy. I should confirm that parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with proven efficacy for preventing congenital syphilis, and that when a pregnant patient reports penicillin allergy, desensitization followed by penicillin therapy is recommended; alternatives like doxycycline or tetracycline are not acceptable in pregnancy due to fetal risks, and delaying therapy is unsafe given the potential for vertical transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^114BEoJy] [^115eFFri].

> Wait, let me verify the reported amoxicillin allergy before committing to desensitization. I initially thought a remote amoxicillin reaction two years ago might automatically mean we must desensitize, but hold on, I should verify the nature of that reaction because most reported penicillin allergies are not true IgE-mediated allergies and many patients can safely receive penicillin after evaluation; however, in pregnancy, even when the allergy history is uncertain, guidelines prioritize maternal–fetal safety and recommend desensitization to ensure receipt of penicillin rather than risk undertreatment or use of inferior alternatives, so desensitization remains indicated here [^114BEoJy] [^112vP8gX].

> I will now examine the non-penicillin options to ensure I am not overlooking a safe alternative. Doxycycline and tetracycline are contraindicated in pregnancy due to risks of maternal hepatotoxicity and fetal effects including bone and teeth effects, so both proposed oral regimens are inappropriate; ceftriaxone has insufficient evidence for preventing congenital syphilis and is not a substitute for penicillin in this setting, reinforcing that penicillin via desensitization is the only acceptable path [^115eFFri] [^114BEoJy].

> Let me think about the correct regimen and administration. I should confirm that benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly is the standard dose for primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in pregnancy, and that if early syphilis is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy, fetal ultrasound evaluation for congenital infection is recommended; I also need to ensure we counsel about the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and arrange appropriate obstetric monitoring if treatment occurs later in gestation, with consideration of fetal and contraction monitoring after 20 weeks when sonographic signs of fetal infection are present [^114BEoJy] [^115eFFri].

> But wait, what if the gestational age is early first trimester and ultrasound would not change immediate management; I should double-check that this does not alter the need for prompt therapy. Regardless of gestational timing, penicillin treatment should not be delayed, and sonography is adjunctive rather than a prerequisite to therapy; therefore, the immediate next step remains desensitization followed by benzathine penicillin G without delay [^114BEoJy] [^115eFFri].

> Next, I should review follow-up and public health steps. I need to ensure maternal nontreponemal titers are monitored for a fourfold decline appropriate to stage, repeat serology in the third trimester and at delivery, and coordinate partner notification and testing with treatment to prevent reinfection; I should also confirm that the newborn team will be informed of maternal serologic status and treatment details to guide neonatal evaluation and management at birth [^115eFFri] [^116iVEvj].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the best answer choice. Given that penicillin is the only proven therapy in pregnancy and that alternatives are unsafe or unproven, the correct next step is penicillin desensitization followed by intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units, which corresponds to option A; options B and C are contraindicated in pregnancy, and option D is unsafe because it delays definitive therapy and increases fetal risk [^114BEoJy] [^115eFFri].

---

The correct answer is **A. Penicillin desensitization, then intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units**. Penicillin is the only treatment with proven efficacy for syphilis in pregnancy [^114BEoJy], and **desensitization is required** for patients with a true penicillin allergy [^115eFFri]. Doxycycline and tetracycline are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal risks, and delaying treatment increases the risk of congenital syphilis and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^115eFFri] [^116iVEvj].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and clinical staging

The patient presents with a **compatible clinical lesion** and serologic confirmation of syphilis [^1125VNSQ]. The **RPR titer of 1:64** indicates active infection, and the positive FTA-ABS confirms treponemal infection [^116e1xhx]. Given the solitary, clean, tender, non-exudative ulcer without lymphadenopathy, this is most consistent with primary syphilis [^notfound].

---

## Treatment guidelines for syphilis in pregnancy

According to the CDC and USPSTF, **penicillin G is the only treatment with documented efficacy** for syphilis in pregnancy [^114BEoJy]. It effectively prevents maternal-fetal transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital syphilis, stillbirth, and preterm birth [^115eFFri]. For pregnant patients with a penicillin allergy, **desensitization is recommended**, followed by standard penicillin therapy [^115eFFri].

---

## Risks associated with alternative antibiotics

Doxycycline and tetracycline are **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal risks, including:

- **Maternal hepatotoxicity**: Particularly with tetracyclines.
- **Fetal bone and teeth effects**: Tetracyclines can cause discoloration and impaired development of fetal bones and teeth.
- **Congenital anomalies**: Potential risk of congenital malformations.

Therefore, **options B and C are contraindicated** in pregnancy.

---

## Risks associated with delaying treatment

Delaying treatment for syphilis in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of:

- **Congenital syphilis**: Vertical transmission to the fetus.
- **Adverse pregnancy outcomes**: Including stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal death [^notfound].
- **Maternal complications**: Progression of syphilis infection.

Thus, **option D is not appropriate** due to these significant risks.

---

## Penicillin desensitization protocol

Penicillin desensitization is a **safe and effective** method for temporarily inducing drug tolerance in patients with confirmed penicillin allergy [^112vP8gX]. The process involves administering gradually increasing doses of penicillin under close medical supervision until therapeutic levels are achieved. Desensitization is temporary and must be repeated if penicillin therapy is required again in the future.

---

## Recommended treatment regimen

Following successful desensitization, the **recommended treatment regimen** is **benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly** as a single dose [^115eFFri]. This regimen is highly effective in treating primary syphilis and preventing maternal-fetal transmission.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After treatment, the patient should undergo regular serologic monitoring to ensure **adequate treatment response**. A fourfold decline in nontreponemal titers (RPR) within 12–24 months is expected. Additionally, fetal ultrasound evaluation is recommended in the second half of pregnancy to assess for signs of congenital syphilis [^115eFFri].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's confirmed syphilis infection, pregnancy, and documented penicillin allergy, the most appropriate next step is **penicillin desensitization** followed by **intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units**. This approach ensures effective treatment of syphilis, prevents maternal-fetal transmission, and minimizes risks to both the mother and the fetus [^115eFFri].

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Syphilis in pregnancy with HIV — penicillin-based management, monitoring, and fetal considerations are as follows: There is some evidence to suggest that additional therapy (a second dose of benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million IU administered 1 week after the initial dose) may be considered for pregnant women with early syphilis (BII). Because of concerns about the efficacy of standard therapy in pregnant women who have HIV infection, a second injection in 1 week should also be considered for pregnant women with HIV infection (BIII). Since no alternatives to penicillin have been proven effective and safe for prevention of fetal infection, pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy should undergo desensitization and treatment with penicillin (AIII). Erythromycin and azithromycin do not reliably cure maternal or fetal infection (AII); tetracyclines should not be used during pregnancy because of concerns about hepatotoxicity and staining of fetal bones and teeth (AII). Data are insufficient on use of ceftriaxone for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of congenital syphilis (BIII). Treatment of syphilis during the second half of pregnancy may precipitate preterm labor or fetal distress if it is associated with a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, and pregnant women should be advised to seek obstetric attention after treatment if they notice contractions or a decrease in fetal movement. During the second half of pregnancy, sonographic fetal evaluation for congenital syphilis can facilitate management but should not delay therapy; sonographic signs of fetal or placental syphilis indicate a greater risk of fetal treatment failure and such cases should be managed in consultation with high-risk obstetric specialists. After 20 weeks of gestation, fetal and contraction monitoring for 24 hours after initiation of treatment for early syphilis should be considered when sonographic findings indicate fetal infection. At a minimum, repeat serologic titers should be performed in the third trimester and at delivery for women treated for syphilis during pregnancy, and clinical and non-treponemal antibody titer responses should be appropriate for the stage of disease although most women will deliver before their serologic response can be definitively assessed. Maternal treatment is likely to be inadequate if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, if a woman has clinical signs of infection at delivery, or if the maternal antibody titer is four-fold higher than the pre-treatment titer; the medical provider caring for the newborn should be informed of the mother's serologic and treatment status so that proper evaluation and treatment of the infant can be provided.

Traditional algorithm — syphilis serologic testing in people with HIV emphasizes paired testing and consistent methods: Rapid treponemal assays are available to screen for syphilis; however, these tests can not differentiate recent or past infection, so testing with a nontreponemal test is indicated to inform further patient management, and use of only one type of serologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient for diagnosis and can yield false-negative or false-positive results. Individuals with a reactive nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test to confirm the syphilis diagnosis, and nontreponemal test antibody titers can correlate with disease activity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Sequential serologic tests should be performed using the same testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same laboratory; VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays, quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared directly, and RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers. Nontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment and can become nonreactive with time, but antibodies might decrease less than fourfold after treatment or might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and persist; atypical nontreponemal serologic test results might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic tests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended for people with risk factors for syphilis, and use of other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining and PCR of lesion) should be considered; for most people with HIV, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response to treatment.

Special considerations during pregnancy — screening and treatment: Pregnant women should be screened for syphilis early in the first prenatal visit, and in high-prevalence areas or high-risk women, serologic testing should also be performed twice in the third trimester (ideally at 28–32 weeks gestation) and at delivery. Syphilis screening also should be offered at emergency departments, jails, and prisons for high-risk pregnant women. Antepartum screening with non-treponemal testing is typical but treponemal screening is being used in some settings; reactive treponemal screening tests should have additional quantitative non-treponemal testing, and positive EIA/CIA screens should be confirmed with a quantitative, non-treponemal test (RPR or VDRL); if the non-treponemal test is negative and the prozone reaction is ruled out, then the results are discordant and a second treponemal test should be performed, preferably on the same specimen. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without documentation of maternal syphilis serologic status determined at least once during pregnancy, and all women who have a fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation also should be tested for syphilis. Rates of transmission to the fetus and adverse pregnancy outcomes for untreated syphilis are highest with primary, secondary, and early-latent syphilis and decrease with increasing duration of infection; pregnancy does not appear to alter adult syphilis manifestations or test results; concurrent syphilis is associated with increased risk of perinatal transmission of HIV. Pregnant women with reactive syphilis serology should be considered infected unless adequate prior treatment with appropriate serologic decline is documented; risk of fetal infection relates to maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if it is ≥ 1:8; serofast low titers might not require additional treatment, but rising or persistently high titers may indicate reinfection or treatment failure and treatment should be considered. Penicillin is recommended for the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy.

Genital lesions — HIV testing linked to genital, anal, or perianal lesions is specified as follows: Because many genital lesions exhibit an inflamed epithelium that enhances the transmission of HIV, screening with an enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) HIV antibody test is recommended in all patients presenting with genital, anal, or perianal lesions. Rapid point-of-care (POC) or home HIV tests can enable a preliminary diagnosis, but the majority of rapid antibody assays become reactive 3 months after exposure and thus can yield negative results in people recently infected; all FDA-cleared laboratory-based HIV-1/2 diagnostics are Ag/Ab combination immunoassays and are highly sensitive and specific. Whenever acute HIV infection is suspected and initial CDC algorithm testing is negative or indeterminate, testing for HIV RNA is recommended.

Congenital syphilis diagnosis in neonates — The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; all infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] slide test, rapid plasma reagin [RPR], the automated reagin test) from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum; umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of potential maternal blood contamination; specific treponemal tests such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate; there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, however such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

### Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117Y4hdh]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and screening approach — This recommendation applies to all adolescents and adults who are pregnant, whether or not risk factors for syphilis are present. Screening for syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis. Treponemal tests, such as the T pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test, detect an antibody response to antigens specific to T pallidum, whereas nontreponemal tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory or rapid plasma reagin test, detect antibodies that may reflect tissue damage. A 2-step process is used to improve diagnostic accuracy; a traditional screening algorithm is a 2-step process that begins with a non-treponemal test followed by a confirmatory treponemal test for persons with positive nontreponemal test results, and a reverse sequence algorithm uses an automated treponemal test.

Genital lesions — herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnostics and typing are described as follows: For suspected cases of HSV genital lesions, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the standard of care (SOC), and NAATs are the preferred diagnostic method because they provide typing to specify HSV type 1 or 2 and are the most sensitive; although direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) can assess specimen adequacy and is more specific than a Tzanck preparation, it is labor-intensive and less sensitive than NAAT. All specimens if positive should be typed to determine if they are HSV-1 or -2 because 12-month recurrence rates are more common with HSV-2 (90%) than HSV-1 (55%). Serology cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 unless a type-specific glycoprotein G (gG)–based assay is performed, and point-of-care tests for HSV-2 may yield false positive results in low-likelihood populations and in pregnant patients testing is not recommended. Most laboratories performing NAATs usually offer HSV-1 and -2 as well as VZV from the same specimen; typically, a generic lesion swab in universal transport medium (UTM) that can be transported at room temperature is acceptable, and consultation with the laboratory before specimen collection is appropriate.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115anYew]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pregnancy — delivery planning, suppressive therapy, and neonatal transmission emphasizes that the rate of neonatal HSV transmission is highest with primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection during late pregnancy, and cesarean delivery is recommended for pregnant women with a genital herpes prodrome or visible HSV genital lesions at the onset of labor (AII). For pregnant women with past genital herpes, suppressive therapy with either valacyclovir or acyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation (AI), and for primary outbreaks in the third trimester, continuing antiviral therapy until delivery may be considered. All of these interventions are likely to be similarly effective in people with HIV as in those without. Suppressive therapy for pregnant women who are seropositive for HSV-2 but without history of genital lesions is not recommended (BIII). Postnatal transmission can occur rarely, and to prevent postnatal transmission, pregnant women with herpetic lesions on any part of the body should take special precautions with handwashing prior to handling the neonate.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117HhMps]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy with HIV/HSV coinfection — maternal management and delivery: Transmission of HSV to fetuses and neonates can occur, but the likelihood is low, and effective ART regimens may decrease, but not prevent, maternal genital HSV shedding and recurrence of genital lesions. In women who do not have HIV, use of acyclovir or valacyclovir near term suppresses genital HSV outbreaks and shedding and reduces the need for cesarean delivery for recurrent HSV, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends suppressive antiviral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks of gestation. The safety and efficacy of this strategy have not been evaluated in women with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection, there is not sufficient data to base a specific recommendation regarding this strategy, and neonatal HSV disease can occur despite maternal suppressive therapy. Elective cesarean delivery, preferably before rupture of membranes, is recommended for all women, both those with and without HIV, who have active genital HSV lesions at the onset of labor.

### Acyclovir [^116mmZS3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Dosage adjustment is recommended when administering acyclovir to patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Caution should also be exercised when administering acyclovir to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic agents since this may increase the risk of renal dysfunction and/or the risk of reversible central nervous system symptoms such as those that have been reported in patients treated with intravenous acyclovir. Adequate hydration should be maintained.

Information for Patients:

Patients are instructed to consult with their physician if they experience severe or troublesome adverse reactions, they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant, they intend to breastfeed while taking orally administered acyclovir, or they have any other questions.

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Herpes Zoster: There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

Genital Herpes Infections: Patients should be informed that acyclovir is not a cure for genital herpes. There are no data evaluating whether acyclovir will prevent transmission of infection to others. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes can also be transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1171MG3x]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy — screening for sexually transmitted infections and group B Streptococcus (GBS) is outlined as follows: In pregnant patients, screening for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), CT, NG, and HCV if prevalence is > 0.1%. Some states require routine syphilis serologic screening of pregnant women at first prenatal visit, at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis, women with HIV infection, or those who are at increased risk for syphilis acquisition. AAP and ACOG recommend universal antepartum screening for GBS, and the screening interval has shifted in gestation from 35–37 weeks to 36 0/7–37 6/7. A single flocked swab is obtained from the vagina first and then from the rectum and placed in a liquid-based transport medium; swabs incubated in selective enrichment broth are recommended for culture and/or NAATs, but direct antepartum testing with NAATs is not recommended by ASM. Susceptibility testing of GBS is not routinely performed and recommended only in patients allergic to penicillin. NAATs are recommended because of performance parameters as well as ability to use noninvasive specimens.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Av9c1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Muscle endurance and fatigue in COPD — volitional and nonvolitional assessments show that quadriceps endurance is decreased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with the magnitude of decrease highly variable (range, 32–77%), of similar magnitude in men and women and in patients with and without depleted fat-free mass, and present in mild to moderate COPD while only poorly associated with the degree of physical activity; endurance is more severely reduced in the presence of hypoxemia. Endurance of upper limb muscles is largely preserved, with the endurance of the elbow flexor muscle, the biceps, and the triceps and posterior deltoid preserved in patients with COPD, whereas the adductor pollicis is slightly reduced in the presence of chronic hypoxemia. Many patients with COPD stop exercise primarily because of leg fatigue complaints before becoming ventilatory limited, and objective contractile leg fatigue after exercise has been reported in 48 to 58% of patients, increasing to 58 to 81% when potentiated twitch rather than nonpotentiated twitch measurement is used; EMG median frequency is a valuable indirect marker to predict contractile fatigue.

First family discussion and early alignment — this first conversation is very important and sets the stage for future communications and family interactions, and the discussion provides realistic expectations for the family. Communicate compassionately in a concise manner that is free of jargon, listen and acknowledge difficult emotions, and note that for patients with severe comorbid illnesses and/or unsurvivable injuries, this first family discussion could occur in the emergency department (ED); this early conversation could lead to early alignment of care with patient goals and the avoidance of further aggressive care, and on occasion, family members may agree to the process of withdrawing life-sustaining therapy in the ED. Schedule the date and time for the next meeting at the conclusion of this first meeting, document the initial discussion in the medical record including essential factors such as advance directives or new decisions regarding treatment preferences, and communicate to other members of the health care team to reduce the risk for mixed messages between the trauma team and the critical care nursing and medical team.

### Cimetidine [^111tZYyH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Maintenance Therapy in Duodenal Ulcer

Treatment with a reduced dose of cimetidine tablets have been proven effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers.

In numerous placebo-controlled studies conducted worldwide, the percent of patients with observed ulcers at the end of 1 year's therapy with 400 mg of cimetidine tablets at bedtime was significantly lower (10% to 45%) than in patients receiving placebo (44% to 70%). Thus, from 55% to 90% of patients were maintained free of observed ulcers at the end of 1 year with 400 mg of cimetidine tablets at bedtime.

Factors such as smoking, duration and severity of disease, gender, and genetic traits may contribute to variations in actual percentages.

Trials of other anti-ulcer therapy, whether placebo-controlled, positive-controlled or open, have demonstrated a range of results similar to that seen with cimetidine tablets.

Active Benign Gastric Ulcer

Cimetidine tablets have been shown to be effective in the short-term treatment of active benign gastric ulcer.

In a multicenter, double-blind U.S. study, patients with endoscopically confirmed benign gastric ulcer were treated with 300 mg of cimetidine tablets 4 times a day or with placebo for 6 weeks. Patients were limited to those with ulcers ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in size. Endoscopically confirmed healing at 6 weeks was seen in significantly* more patients treated with cimetidine tablets than in patients receiving placebo, as shown below:

In a similar multicenter U.S. study of the 800 mg bedtime oral regimen, the endoscopically confirmed healing rates were:

Similarly, in worldwide double-blind clinical studies, endoscopically evaluated benign gastric ulcer healing rates were consistently higher with cimetidine tablets than with placebo.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

In 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and endoscopically proven erosions and/or ulcers, cimetidine tablets were significantly more effective than placebo in healing lesions. The endoscopically confirmed healing rates were:

In these trials cimetidine tablets were superior to placebo by most measures in improving symptoms of day- and night-time heartburn, with many of the differences statistically significant. The 4 times-daily regimen was generally somewhat better than the twice-daily regimen where these were compared.

Sexually transmitted infection screening and diagnostics in HIV primary care — nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the most sensitive screening method for chlamydia and gonorrhea and should be obtained from all sites of sexual exposure. For persons with a vagina/neovagina, swabs from that area are more sensitive than urine, while urine is acceptable for persons with a penis. Diagnosis of syphilis generally relies on serologic testing that consists of a nontreponemal test (with positive results expressed in titers) and a treponemal test, and self-testing based on treponemal antibody may be falsely negative in early infection or positive long after an initial infection has been treated. All persons with syphilis should be screened for ocular and otic syphilis and for neurologic signs and symptoms; a lumbar puncture is not required unless neurologic signs or symptoms are present, but is indicated in those with neurologic findings and those whose nontreponemal titer has increased 4-fold (sustained for more than 2 weeks) without evidence of reinfection, and if titers have not decreased 4-fold by 24 months clinicians should examine clinically and a CSF examination and retreatment may be considered when treatment fails. Pregnant persons should be screened for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and trichomonas at the first prenatal visit, 28 weeks, and also at delivery for syphilis, and treponemal antibody tests often remain positive for life despite effective treatment. For trichomoniasis, screening should be conducted using an NAAT or an FDA-approved rapid test and repeated in 3 months for those who test positive; during pregnancy, screening should occur at the first prenatal visit and during the third trimester, at minimum, with treatment delivered as needed.

### Penicillin skin testing… [^112vP8gX]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

655–658). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8. 3% of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy. Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication. The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies. Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection.

Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-site infections, methicillin-resistant. Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage. The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term "allergy" by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E -mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive. In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.

1% of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy obtaining a thorough medical history, including previous exposures to penicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics; 2) performing a skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor determinants; and 3) among those who have a negative penicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with 250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment with the indicated ß-lactam therapy. For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used.

For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance is required. Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment. Because the remaining 1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured by this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE antibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with an observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour of observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both negative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero and is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported an allergy to penicillin.

### Complications of pregnancy… [^116WqPyp]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Common complications of pregnancy include anemia, gestational diabetes, infections, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia. Presence of these types of complications can have implications on monitoring lab work, imaging, and medical management during pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy can sometimes arise from abnormally severe presentations of symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy, which usually do not significantly interfere with activities of daily living or pose any significant threat to the health of the birthing person or fetus. For example, morning sickness is a fairly common mild symptom of pregnancy that generally resolves in the second trimester, but hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of this symptom that sometimes requires medical intervention to prevent electrolyte imbalance from severe vomiting.

Several non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors predispose women to the development of this condition, such as a female fetus, psychiatric illness history, high or low BMI pre-pregnancy, young age, African American or Asian ethnicity, type I diabetes, multiple pregnancies, and a history of pregnancy affected by hyperemesis gravidarum. Treatments for this condition focus on preventing harm to the fetus while improving symptoms and commonly include fluid replacement and consumption of small, frequent, bland meals. First-line treatments include ginger and acupuncture. Second-line treatments include vitamin B₆ ± doxylamine, antihistamines, dopamine antagonists, and serotonin antagonists. Third-line treatments include corticosteroids, transdermal clonidine, and gabapentin. Treatments chosen are dependent on the severity of symptoms and response to therapies.

Pelvic girdle pain Pelvic girdle pain disorder is pain in the area between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal fold, beginning peri or postpartum caused by instability and limitation of mobility. It is associated with pubic symphysis pain and sometimes radiation of pain down the hips and thighs. For most pregnant individuals, PGP resolves within three months following delivery, but for some, it can last for years, resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight-bearing activities. PGP affects around 45% of individuals during pregnancy: 25% report serious pain, and 8% are severely disabled. Risk factors for complication development include multiparity, increased BMI, physically strenuous work, smoking, distress, history of back and pelvic trauma, and previous history of pelvic and lower back pain.
- **Caused by**: Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability as a physiological response in preparation for the potential bleeding during childbirth.
- **Treatment**: Prophylactic treatment, e.g., with low molecular weight heparin may be indicated when additional risk factors for deep vein thrombosis are present. Infection Pregnancy is a critical period for the expectant mom to experience additional dangers associated with infections. Moreover, a mother and baby's health is exposed to danger when she is in this condition. The prenatal physiology complexity and immunity modulation inherently increase the risk of influenza, hepatitis E, and cytomegalovirus transmission. Avoidance actions like vaccines and strict infectious control protocols can be given priority in the policies aimed at limiting the risk of transmission among high-risk populations. In addition, early diagnosis and management of maternal infections are among the main methods to prevent vertical transmission and fetal aberrations. A pregnant woman is more susceptible to certain infections.
