## Question

Plantar fibromatosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and its pathophysiology. Then, I should establish diagnostic criteria and appropriate imaging to distinguish it from plantar fasciitis. Next, I will evaluate treatment options in a conservative-to-invasive sequence with attention to evidence quality and recurrence. After that, I should outline outcome measures and prognosis. Finally, I will integrate these into stage-based recommendations and identify key evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm what plantar fibromatosis is and why it matters clinically; it is a benign, hyperproliferative fibroblastic process of the plantar aponeurosis presenting as nodules that can impair function and cause pain, often associated with other superficial fibromatoses like Dupuytren's and Peyronie's, and tends to involve the medial plantar fascia with nodular thickening rather than diffuse fasciopathy [^115eXGib] [^111LY9cv]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating epidemiology from single-center imaging texts; while reports suggest male predominance and bilateral or multinodular disease in a subset, these are largely from observational series, so I should be cautious and cross-check consistency across sources before using them to drive management decisions [^115eXGib].

> Next, I should review how to diagnose it accurately; clinically, discrete palpable nodules within the plantar fascia — often medial — should prompt consideration of fibromatosis rather than classic plantar fasciitis, which typically presents with proximal plantar medial heel pain and first-step pain without nodularity, and plantar fibromatosis is explicitly listed in heel pain guidelines' differential diagnostics, reminding me not to anchor prematurely on fasciitis when nodules are present [^114FpotK]. Hold on, let me verify the imaging pathway; ultrasound can detect small fascial-based nodules with hypoechoic/heterogeneous echotexture and offers dynamic, bilateral comparison, whereas MRI helps delineate extent and surgical planning, with typical T1 hypointensity and variable T2 signal; importantly, ultrasound may be more sensitive for small fibromas against the fibrillar fascia background, a nuance I shouldn't miss in equivocal cases [^111c6pR2] [^115eXGib]. I should confirm when to escalate imaging; in chronic or atypical heel pain not responding to standard care, ultrasound or MRI is recommended to clarify diagnosis, which aligns with the need to separate nodular fibromatosis from fasciitis and other mimickers like fat pad atrophy or tarsal tunnel syndrome [^111xKqNm] [^114FpotK].

> Now, I will examine conservative management, but wait, I need to be explicit that high-credibility data are largely from plantar fasciitis and must be extrapolated carefully to fibromatosis; plantar fascia–specific stretching, taping, load management, footwear education, and short-term orthoses can reduce pain and improve function in plantar heel pain, and these may palliate symptoms around fibromatosis nodules even if they do not modify disease biology, so a trial is reasonable in early or mildly symptomatic cases while we monitor nodular behavior [^notfound] [^116nYyF7] [^112E4c4h] [^111FGgSQ]. I should double-check the message: these measures are first-line for heel pain syndromes, but we must counsel that discrete nodules will not typically regress with stretching or orthoses alone, and lack of improvement should pivot evaluation toward fibromatosis-directed options rather than escalating fasciitis-centric care [^114FpotK] [^111xKqNm].

> I will now examine minimally invasive options tailored to nodular disease; ultrasound-guided cryoablation shows marked short-term pain reduction and improved ambulation with low morbidity in small series, though evidence quality is low and recurrence beyond one year remains uncertain, so I should frame it as a promising, low-morbidity option for focal, painful nodules after conservative care fails [^111hxN3C]. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum has isolated case-level success in recurrent plantar fibromatosis extrapolating from Dupuytren's biology, but given single-case evidence and off-label use, it should be reserved for highly selected patients with careful informed consent and expectation management [^111Li9qF]. Radiation therapy, particularly orthovoltage in European series and electron therapy in North American cohorts, can achieve symptom relief and local control in early-stage disease with acceptable toxicity and the option for reirradiation, yet I need to emphasize that randomized data are lacking and optimal dosing remains debated, warranting multidisciplinary review for multifocal or recurrent disease where surgery risks are high [^111LY9cv]. Hold on, let me verify that I'm not overgeneralizing; yes, all three modalities show promise but rest on small, nonrandomized cohorts, so shared decision-making around uncertainty is essential [^111LY9cv] [^111hxN3C] [^111Li9qF].

> Turning to surgery, I should confirm recurrence patterns; local excision is associated with very high recurrence, even approaching 100% in some series, whereas total plantar fasciectomy reduces but does not eliminate recurrence, with around 25% reported in a long-term single-center experience, and wound complications and nerve injury contribute to morbidity, so surgery should be reserved for highly symptomatic, refractory cases after weighing function and recovery [^111agq82]. Let me reconsider adjuvant strategies; in that series, adjuvant radiotherapy suggested lower recurrence than surgery alone, but this signal needs prospective validation before becoming standard, highlighting the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary planning in extensive or recurrent disease [^111agq82] [^111LY9cv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought endoscopic plantar fascia procedures might translate here, but those data pertain to fasciitis rather than fibromatosis nodules, so I should not conflate the two surgical indications or outcomes [^115ZzsbP].

> For advanced, unresectable, or multifocal disease impacting function, I need to check systemic options; small case series of sorafenib in Dupuytren and Ledderhose disease report objective responses and symptom improvement with PDGFRβ expression as a putative target, but evidence is preliminary and off-label, so this should be considered in specialized centers for select patients after failure of local therapies and within shared decision-making that accounts for risks and uncertainty [^114VP4QX] [^116FVsrE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; systemic therapy is not standard for typical plantar fibromatosis and should not precede less morbid focal approaches for limited disease [^114VP4QX] [^116FVsrE].

> Next, I should review outcome measures and follow-up; for heel pain and foot function, validated instruments like the FAAM, FHSQ, and FFI are recommended to track pain, first-step pain, and functional limitations, and these can be adapted to monitor fibromatosis care while also documenting nodule size clinically or by ultrasound over time, ensuring at least 12 to 24 months of follow-up given the propensity for delayed recurrence [^115ETGxk] [^114FpotK]. I need to ensure I'm capturing disease-specific elements; serial palpation tenderness over nodules, shoe tolerance, and activity-related pain, combined with objective imaging when nodules change, help distinguish symptomatic progression from stable disease that may be observed [^111c6pR2] [^111xKqNm].

> Synthesis into practice now requires careful staging and shared decisions; for small, asymptomatic nodules, observation with footwear modification is reasonable, with counseling on benign histology and variable growth, whereas symptomatic disease warrants a 3 to 6 month trial of stretching, taping, load management, and orthoses to mitigate global heel loading even though they will not shrink nodules, after which focal therapies should be considered if pain persists or nodules progress [^111agq82] [^116nYyF7] [^112E4c4h]. If symptoms are recalcitrant and disease is focal, cryoablation offers a minimally invasive path with encouraging short-term results; in multifocal or early active disease where surgery poses morbidity, radiation therapy can provide pain relief and local control with low toxicity; for large, deforming, or refractory lesions, total plantar fasciectomy is preferred over local excision to reduce recurrence, with discussion of recovery, footwear, and potential adjuvant radiotherapy in select situations, and systemic therapy remains investigational for unresectable cases in expert centers [^111hxN3C] [^111LY9cv] [^111agq82] [^114VP4QX]. I should double-check that patients understand trade-offs between faster symptom relief and recurrence risk, and that decisions reflect their functional goals and comorbidities [^111agq82] [^111LY9cv].

> Finally, I should identify what we do not know; there are no high-credibility randomized trials directly comparing cryoablation, radiation therapy, collagenase, and surgery in plantar fibromatosis, optimal radiation dosing and modality remain unsettled, and misclassification of recalcitrant heel pain as fasciitis rather than nodular fibromatosis may delay appropriate care, all of which argue for prospective, multicenter studies and development of disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures and imaging response criteria [^111LY9cv] [^114yQthM]. But wait, what if future biomarker-driven selection improves outcomes; early signals like PDGFRβ expression connected to sorafenib activity suggest a path to personalized therapy, underscoring the need for translational studies integrated with clinical trials [^114VP4QX] [^116FVsrE].

Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease) is a **benign fibroproliferative disorder** [^115eXGib] of the plantar fascia, presenting as **firm, slow-growing nodules** on the medial plantar arch. It is associated with Dupuytren's and Peyronie's disease, diabetes, epilepsy, and alcohol use, and is **more common in middle-aged men** with bilateral involvement in 20–50% of cases [^115eXGib]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by ultrasound [^111c6pR2] or MRI when needed [^115eXGib].

First-line management is **conservative**, with orthotics, stretching, and corticosteroid injections [^114WzAeB]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases but has high recurrence (25–100%) [^111agq82] and complications. Emerging options include radiotherapy [^111LY9cv], collagenase [^111Li9qF], cryoablation [^111hxN3C], and tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^114VP4QX], but evidence is limited. Prognosis is benign but persistent, with significant recurrence after surgery [^111agq82].

---

## Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Clinical features include **firm, slow-growing nodules** on the medial plantar arch [^115eXGib] that are often bilateral and may cause pain with weight bearing or shoe pressure. The condition is **more common in middle-aged men**, with bilateral involvement in 20–50% of cases [^1121o3PV]. Associations include Dupuytren's disease (40%), Peyronie's disease, diabetes, epilepsy, and alcohol use [^115eXGib].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathology is characterized by benign proliferation of **fibroblasts and myofibroblasts** [^115eXGib] with excess collagen in the plantar fascia [^1121o3PV]. The **biology** appears reactive rather than clonal, with Wnt signaling alterations implicated.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on characteristic nodules and exam [^111c6pR2].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound shows hypoechoic nodules [^111c6pR2]; MRI shows low T1 and variable T2 signal with fascial continuity [^115eXGib].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Plantar fasciitis, plantar fibroma, soft tissue sarcoma, lipoma, ganglion cyst [^1121o3PV].

---

## Treatment options

### Conservative management

Conservative measures include custom or prefabricated **orthotics** to offload pressure on the plantar fascia, along with calf stretching. Corticosteroid injections may reduce nodule size and pain [^1121o3PV].

---

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: Refractory cases with significant pain or functional impairment [^111agq82].

- **Procedures**: Local excision, wide excision, or total plantar fasciectomy.

- **Recurrence**: High (25–100%), especially with limited excision [^111agq82].

- **Complications**: Wound healing issues, nerve injury, persistent pain [^111agq82].

---

### Emerging therapies

- **Radiotherapy**: Electron or orthovoltage for early-stage disease; 83% local control in one series [^111LY9cv].

- **Collagenase injections**: Off-label use with reported success [^111Li9qF].

- **Cryoablation**: Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation shows promising pain relief [^111hxN3C].

- **Tyrosine kinase inhibitors**: Sorafenib shows objective responses in small series [^114VP4QX].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **benign but persistent**; spontaneous regression is rare. Recurrence after surgery is high, especially after **limited excision** [^111agq82].

---

## Patient education and support

Education should explain the **benign nature** [^115eXGib], recurrence risk, and treatment options, while **support** involves providing resources and connecting patients with support groups.

### Patient-reported outcomes after electron radiation treatment for early-stage palmar and plantar fibromatosis [^111LY9cv]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Palmar and plantar fibromatosis (PPF) is a progressive connective tissue disorder of the hand and foot that often leads to debilitating functional impairment. In Europe, orthovoltage radiation therapy (RT) has been demonstrated to prevent local disease progression in up to 80% of patients with early-stage PPF. However, there are limited data reporting outcomes for populations outside of Europe or using electron RT.

Between 2008 and 2013, 44 early-stage PPF cases received RT. RT fields involved clinically defined targets encompassing involved areas, including skin changes, cords, and nodules, with at least 1.5-cm margins. En face electrons (6–12 MeV) and bolus (0.5–1 cm) were selected individually. Outcomes are reported for patients who participated in an institutional review board-approved standardized questionnaire and chart review.

Thirty-three patients received 66 treatments on 45 hands, 15 feet, and 6 reirradiations. The most frequent dose schemes were 21 Gy (3 Gy in 7 fractions) and 30 Gy (3 Gy in 10 fractions with 6- to 8-week breaks after 15 Gy). The median time to follow-up survey was 31 months. Disease progression at any location within or outside the RT treatment field occurred in 20 of 33 patients (61%). Fourteen of 60 sites (23%) developed in-field progression, but 4 sites were successfully reirradiated, resulting in final local control in 50 of 60 sites (83%). RT improved pretreatment symptoms of pain with strain at 30 of 37 sites (81%) and itch/burn sensations at 17 of 21 sites (81%). There were no reported grade ≥ 2 late toxicities, even with reirradiation.

### Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation for symptomatic plantar fibromas [^111hxN3C]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

We report our experience in treating painful plantar fibromas with percutaneous cryoablation. We retrospectively identified patients with symptomatic plantar fibromas who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation between June 2014 and June 2015. In total, four patients (two male, two female) with five plantar fibromas undergoing a total of seven ablation procedures were identified. Each procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a single freeze-thaw cycle. The electronic medical record, procedure reports, and pain scores from a brief pain inventory administered before and after treatment were reviewed. Average and worst pain in 24 hours and time to peak symptom improvement post-procedure were compared. Complications were reviewed using the SIR classification.

Five plantar fibromas were treated (mean size 2.2 ± 1.6 cm). Four of the five lesions were present for more than six years, and one was present for less than one year. Surgical excision was previously performed on three of the five lesions, all with short-term recurrence. The mean worst pain score in 24 hours and average pain score in 24 hours (scale of 10) at initial evaluation were 7.1 ± 1.8 and 5.8 ± 1.9, respectively, reduced after cryoablation to 0.8 ± 0.8 and 0.4 ± 0.6, respectively. The average time to symptom improvement was 2.8 ± 0.98 weeks (range 2–4 weeks). All patients reported improved ambulation and weight-bearing, and complete cessation of pain medication after treatment. The improvement was sustained on follow-up at 12 months. No major complications occurred. Minor complications occurred in three of the five patients.

### Recurrence of plantar fibromatosis after plantar fasciectomy: Single-center long-term results [^111agq82]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Plantar fibromatosis is a rare, hyperproliferative, benign lesion of the plantar aponeurosis with an unknown cause. Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and risk of complications. The goal of this study was to determine the recurrence rate of plantar fibromatosis after plantar fasciectomy at the authors' institute during the past three decades and the factors associated with an increased risk for recurrence.

- **Methods**: The study group consisted of 27 patients with plantar fibromatosis, who underwent 40 operations on 33 feet, including 13 right (39 percent) and 20 left (61 percent) feet.

- **Results**: The overall recurrence rate was 60 percent. Treating a primary lesion with total plantar fasciectomy was associated with the lowest recurrence rate (25 percent), whereas local resection of the lesion was associated with the highest recurrence rate (100 percent). There was a relation between the existence of multiple nodules in one foot and a higher recurrence rate. The recurrence of a primary lesion treated with fasciectomy combined with postoperative radiotherapy seemed to be lower in comparison with the recurrence rate after surgery only.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical treatment of plantar fibromatosis is associated with a high recurrence rate and is indicated only when the lesions are highly symptomatic and conservative measures fail. Total plantar fasciectomy is the most successful treatment in this study, particularly for primary lesions. The role of postoperative radiotherapy should be evaluated further. A prospective multicenter study comparing different surgical approaches is necessary.

### The effects of collagenase Clostridium histolyticum on plantar fibromatosis: A case study [^111Li9qF]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Plantar fibromatosis, also known as Ledderhose's disease, is a rare disorder characterized by benign fibroblast proliferation involving the plantar aponeurosis (i.e. plantar fascia). Traditionally, surgical intervention has been the most common treatment for plantar fibromatosis. However, numerous studies have reported high recurrence rates after surgical intervention, as well as difficulties in wound healing and nerve injury. Plantar fibromatosis often coexists with other superficial fibrous diseases such as Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses suggest a relationship between Ledderhose's disease and Dupuytren's contracture. The US Food and Drug Administration approved collagenase Clostridium histolyticum for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in 2010 and Peyronie's disease in 2013. This case study presents the successful treatment of Ledderhose's disease almost four years (45.5 months) after off-label use of collagenase C. histolyticum injection in a 22-year-old white female who had recurrent plantar fibromatosis after surgical intervention.

### MRI imaging of soft tissue tumours of the foot and ankle [^115eXGib]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Plantar fibromatosis

The plantar fascia is a connective tissue structure that helps to maintain the longitudinal arch of the foot. It extends from the medial tubercle of the calcaneus, covering the flexor digitorum brevis, and divides into branches that insert into the metatarsophalangeal joints. There are central and lateral bands, with a thinner medial band arising from the mid portion of the central band.

Plantar fibromatosis, also known as Ledderhose disease, is a common benign proliferative disorder of the plantar fascia composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibers. It predominantly affects individuals in the 4th to 6th decades of life, with males being more commonly affected than females. Bilateral disease is present in 20–50% of cases, and multiple nodules are seen in 33% of cases. It is more common in individuals with diabetes, epilepsy, and alcohol excess and is associated with other fibrotic diseases such as palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's disease), which coexists in 40% of cases, and penile fibromatosis (Peyronie's disease). Plantar fibromatosis more often affects the distal two-thirds of the fascia, although proximal nodules also occur. It manifests as a discretely palpable mass, which is not usually painful unless very large.

Ultrasound alone may be sufficient for diagnosis in plantar fibromatosis. It appears as a fusiform hypoechoic or heterogeneous mass arising from the plantar fascia. Similarly, on MRI, it is seen as a fusiform mass arising from the plantar fascia, more often medial than lateral. It is usually heterogeneous in signal intensity and hypointense to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted (T1W) imaging.

### Sorafenib in Dupuytren and Ledderhose disease [^114VP4QX]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Palmar and plantar fibromatosis are benign proliferative processes that present as diffuse thickening or nodules of the hands and/or feet and may lead to flexion contractures, pain, and functional impairment, known as Dupuytren and Ledderhose diseases, respectively. Treatments are noncurative and associated with significant morbidity. Here, we report on the outcomes of five patients with advanced disease, who were no longer surgical candidates and were treated with sorafenib. Sorafenib exhibited an expected safety profile. All five patients demonstrated objective responses, as evaluated by a decrease in tumor size and/or tumor cellularity from baseline, and all five patients reported subjective pain relief and/or functional improvement. Mechanistically, immunohistochemistry revealed patchy positivity for PDGFRβ, a known target of sorafenib. The outcomes of these five patients suggest the safety and efficacy of a relatively well-tolerated oral agent in the treatment of Dupuytren and Ledderhose diseases and highlight the need for future controlled studies.

### Management of plantar heel pain: A best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^116Wk9TZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Taking into consideration each patient's past treatment history and experience, the best practice guide (BPG) can guide patients and clinicians. It can also inform healthcare commissioners and help design future research. Patients having access to summary resources, such as figures 1 and 2, should reduce some of the inconsistency they report when seeking guidance from the internet and other resources. Commissioners may consider funding the necessary resources, such as ESWT devices. Audit, monitoring, and checklist tools do not yet exist, but should be developed locally and may serve as a useful stimulus to intervention adoption. Finally, future research may be guided by consideration of the gaps in the evidence base and the expert views on research priorities identified by our work (online supplemental file 1).

- **Flow diagram for study selection process**: Figure 3 displays the study selection process. RCT refers to randomised controlled trial.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The overall quality of the research in the plantar heel pain (PHP) field is low. Of the 362 trials evaluating any intervention for PHP that were assessed for quality using the PEDro and RoB criteria, only 51 met the inclusion criteria. These stringent quality criteria, without topic restriction, were used to strengthen recommendations. The highest quality recent review included 20 trials, which we excluded due to low quality or high risk of bias (RoB). Additionally, this same review did not include 35 studies that were part of our more comprehensive review. Trials that met the PEDro cut-off score were further evaluated for bias against the standards outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration.

### Percutaneous bipolar radiofrequency microdebridement for recalcitrant proximal plantar fasciosis [^114MFKpR]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Success rates for traditional methods of surgical intervention for chronic plantar fasciosis are low and associated with high rates of complications and long recovery times. The purpose of this prospective case series was to assess the effectiveness of percutaneous bipolar radiofrequency microfasciotomy for the treatment of recalcitrant proximal plantar fasciosis in 21 patients. The mean preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score was 22.10 ± 12.96 (out of a possible 68 points), and the mean postoperative AOFAS hindfoot score was 59.57 ± 13.23 points; this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001).

- **Outcome measures**: A total of 7 (33.33%) patients experienced satisfactory pain relief within 1 to 4 weeks, and 10 (47.62%) did so within 1 to 4 months, whereas 2 (9.52%) patients required longer than 4 months, and 2 (9.52%) others never attained satisfactory relief of symptoms. Fourteen (66.67%) patients subjectively rated their outcome as excellent, 4 (19.05%) as good, 1 (4.76%) as fair, and 2 (9.52%) as poor. One (4.76%) patient experienced iatrogenic flexor hallucis longus tendonitis.

The results of this clinical investigation indicate that bipolar radiofrequency microdebridement plantar fasciotomy safely alleviates recalcitrant heel pain. The technique is minimally invasive and simple to perform, sparing the overall integrity of the plantar fascia without being associated with undue complications.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: Revision 2014 [^113XYk32]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for plantar fasciitis, particularly concerning patient history and physical examination, the APTA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining a detailed history and performing a physical examination to assess for specific findings for the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis:

- **Plantar medial heel pain**: Most noticeable with initial steps following a period of inactivity but also worse following prolonged weight bearing.

- **Heel pain precipitated by increased activity**: Recent increase in weight-bearing activity can lead to heel pain.

- **Palpation pain**: Pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia.

- **Positive windlass test**: A diagnostic indicator of plantar fasciitis.

- **Negative posterior tarsal tunnel syndrome testing**: Helps to differentiate from other conditions.

- **Limited dorsiflexion ROM**: Limited active and passive dorsiflexion at the talocrural joint.

- **Abnormal foot posture**: An abnormal Foot Posture Index score may be observed.

- **High BMI in nonathletic individuals**: Recognized as a contributing factor.

### Plantar fasciitis [^111xKqNm]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for plantar fasciitis, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound or MRI in patients with chronic heel pain despite conservative measures.

### Asymptomatic plantar nodules in a 1-year-old healthy girl [^114ZpswC]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Juvenile plantar fibromatosis**: Incorrect. In juvenile plantar fibromatosis, the lesions are generally asymptomatic, unilateral, and indurated on palpation. Usually, this condition develops in the second or third decade of life. On histopathology, it is characterized by the presence of fibrous tissue attached to the plantar fascia.

- **Calcified nodules**: Incorrect. The common cause of calcified nodules is frequent needle insertion in the heel for drawing blood during the neonatal period. They are usually painful and may be dystrophic in nature.

- **Piezogenic papules**: Incorrect. Piezogenic papules are pressure-induced and appear only upon standing. The lesions are usually located on the lateral aspect of bilateral heels. They are caused by fat herniation into the dermis. Physical strain is an important risk factor; thus, the term "piezogenic" describes the pressure-induced changes in these lesions. The affected individuals include obese patients, marathon runners, and patients whose occupations require them to stand for a long time.

- **PCFH**: Correct. PCFH is a benign skin disorder characterized by asymptomatic nodules on the plantar surface of the feet. The skin lesions in PCFH are classically bilateral, solitary, skin-colored, nonpruritic, and nontender nodules in the medial plantar aspect of the foot. These nodules can present at infancy or during the first few months of life. This condition was first defined by Larralde de Luna et al. in 1990, and it was originally named pedal papules in the newborn. Several names have been used to describe PCFH, including infantile…

### Medial plantar flap for hand reconstruction: A systematic literature review and its application for post-sarcoma excision [^111EYgpK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The reconstruction of soft tissue defects on the volar aspect of the hand represents a special challenge for the hand surgeon. Even though local and regional options have been described, a free flap is preferred in some cases due to their complexity. The medial plantar free flap offers a unique reconstructive alternative by providing glabrous skin resurfacing for the palm and digits. The aim of this article is to present a systematic literature review on the use of the medial plantar free flap for hand surgery and a case report in which this flap was used for reconstructing a thenar eminence defect after sarcoma excision. Twenty-five relevant articles were found, and their findings are included in our study. The fasciocutaneous medial plantar flap and its musculocutaneous, flow-through, venous, perforator, and chimeric variants offer a wide range of reconstructive options for complex hand injuries.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^115sBE5j]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Data extraction and management

A data extraction form was used to record outcome data related to pain, first step pain, and function by pairs of authors and checked by MC. The mean and SD, median and IQR, or difference in outcomes from baseline was extracted for continuous data. In addition, dichotomous data, such as successful outcomes, were extracted. Data were extracted for each outcome at all time points and entered into RevMan (V.5.3; Copenhagen: The Nordic Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).

Dealing with missing data

For studies that did not report the number of participants at specific time points, or where participants were lost to follow-up, the meta-analyses were based on the published intention-to-treat data. Where data were missing or not in a usable format, we attempted to contact the corresponding author of the study. If a request for data was not provided, we attempted to calculate SDs from SEs, CIs, or p-values according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

For studies that reported median and range data, we estimated the mean and variance from the median, range, and the size of a sample. Where the sample size was greater than 25, the median value was used to estimate the mean. To estimate the variance for samples of size greater than 15 but less than or equal to 70, we used the formulas range/4 and range/6, respectively, to calculate the SD.

Evaluating efficacy and the strength of the evidence

An intervention was considered to demonstrate efficacy if adequately powered included trials demonstrated (i) primary proof of superiority compared with sham or placebo or (ii) [content cutoff, please provide complete text for a thorough revision].

### Immediate reconstruction for plantar melanoma: A paradigm shift [^112GWRmq]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Plantar melanoma tumors are traditionally treated with broad local excision based on the depth of invasion, followed by delayed reconstruction once negative surgical margins are confirmed. However, delayed reconstruction involves the management of an open wound, a prolonged treatment course, and the requirement for an additional surgery. Immediate reconstruction has been shown to be oncologically safe in head and neck melanoma, but there is limited literature describing its application in plantar melanoma. We present our experience with immediate reconstruction following wide local excision for lower extremity plantar melanomas.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with biopsy-proven plantar melanoma who underwent wide local excision followed by immediate reconstruction of any type between 1999 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco. Patient demographics, postoperative complications, reoperation rates, and oncologic outcomes were collected.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients were identified, with a mean follow-up of 34 months. Skin grafts were the most common method of reconstruction, followed by primary closure, local flaps, and free flaps. Only one patient experienced a major complication, which was skin graft loss requiring reoperation. Eight patients had either local or distant recurrence (21%).

Immediate reconstruction for plantar melanomas can be safely performed, with recurrence rates comparable to and in line with previously published studies of wide local excision for plantar melanoma. This technique has the potential to enhance treatment outcomes for patients.

### Custom insoles versus sham and GP-led usual care in patients with plantar heel pain: results of the STAP-study - a randomised controlled trial [^111FGgSQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis or fasciopathy, is a common cause of foot pain and accounts for an estimated 8% to 15% of all foot complaints requiring medical care in adults. It typically affects highly physically active people, such as running athletes, but is also common in middle-aged (40 to 60 years) women with a high body mass index (BMI). In Dutch general practice, the incidence of plantar heel pain is approximately 3.8 per 1000 patient-years. The clinical course is considered favorable, with remission occurring after 12 to 24 months in 60% to 80% of patients. However, given the effect of the complaints on everyday and sports activities, the burden on patients is substantial. There is a need for effective treatment options that can expedite recovery and limit impact.

- **Management of plantar heel pain**: Plantar heel pain can be managed by various treatments in clinical practice. Orthoses, especially in-shoe foot insoles, are commonly used by clinicians. Two systematic reviews have found conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of orthoses on pain in plantar heel pain. Whittaker et al. found a small but statistically significant beneficial effect of insoles on heel pain at 7 to 12 weeks compared with sham. In contrast, a more recent systematic review concluded that insoles are not superior to sham in reducing pain in individuals with plantar heel pain. Of the three trials comparing custom-made insoles to sham, none were conducted in a primary care setting. Additionally, no study has compared orthoses to usual care, despite customizations.

A case report about extensive osseous metaplasia of a plantar fibromatosis is presented. The authors are unaware of previous reports in the literature describing osseous metaplasia within plantar fibromatosis in this manner. This case shows that plantar fibromatosis may undergo osseous metaplasia in a fashion similar to fibromatous lesions elsewhere.

### Two different treatment options for intramuscular plantar hemangioma: Surgery versus percutaneous sclerotherapy [^111TYYxS]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Intramuscular hemangiomas are benign neoplasms usually seen in children and adolescents. They tend to occur in the deep fascia and muscle, more often in the lower extremity, although they are rarely encountered in the plantar musculature. Surgical excision, ultrasound- or fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy, and angiographic embolization are all treatment options. Surgical excision is the most prevalent form of therapy, although this can be difficult in the hands and feet. For this reason, ultrasound- and fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy is a useful treatment option for pedal intramuscular hemangioma. In the present report, we describe two cases of intramuscular hemangioma in children: one treated by excision and one by percutaneous sclerosis.

Criteria for selecting studies

- **Type of studies**: Published RCTs evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention for PHP were considered for inclusion. No language restrictions were imposed. All other designs, including quasi-experimental studies, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, editorials, and conference abstracts, were considered ineligible.

- **Characteristics of participants**: An RCT was included if the participants were clinically diagnosed with PHP with explicit reference to pain on the underside of the heel that was most noticeable on weight-bearing after periods of rest but also worse following prolonged weight-bearing. All participants were over the age of 16 years and had experienced symptoms of any duration. RCTs were excluded if participants' PHP was related to fractures, tumors, or infections or confounded by other conditions that might be rheumatological, neural, vascular, or dermatological in origin.

- **Types of interventions**: Any RCT that investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of an intervention compared with another intervention, placebo, sham, or wait and see was included, provided there was a follow-up of at least 2 weeks.

- **Outcome measures**: Studies that reported at least one of the three outcome measures — patient-reported pain, first step pain, or foot-related function — were included. Where multiple methods of quantifying the same outcome were reported, the author's main prespecified outcome metric was accepted, or that of the metric with the lower level of effect. This was done to avoid making recommendations based on type 1 error with the rati.

### The effect of high-intensity versus low-level laser therapy in the management of plantar fasciitis: Randomized participant blind controlled trial [^114SxdFi]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

- **Measurement and outcomes**: Measurement at baseline and pain reduction after the treatment, as well as in the follow-up at specified times, was assessed using a visual analogue scale, pressure algometry, and examination of plantar fascia thickness difference between the healthy and affected side.

- **Efficacy assessment**: The efficacy of laser therapy was evaluated according to the subjects' ratings, which were shown as percentages based on the number of participants in each group.

- **Harms and adverse events**: The possible harms were evaluated during the treatment. The treatment used in this study did not result in any adverse events or complications; however, some participants in the high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) group noticed a temporary increase in pain for a short period during the middle of the treatment.

### Management of plantar heel pain: A best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^111JMDR1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

For studies reporting continuous data, we calculated standardized mean differences (SMD), irrespective of whether the outcomes were similar or different, but ensured only outcomes of a similar construct were combined. Effect sizes were set as 0.20–0.49 for small, 0.50–0.79 for medium, and 0.80 or above for large. Final scores at each follow-up period were evaluated in preference to mean or median change from baseline values, unless only change scores were available, as the use of follow-up scores is more conservative and less likely to find significant results. For studies reporting dichotomous data to represent treatment success, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. For studies that included three or more active treatment arms and reported continuous outcomes, the active arms were combined and compared with the control group to avoid a unit of analysis error, using accepted methods according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Comparable studies reporting continuous data were pooled using an inverse variance weighting method within a random-effects model. For dichotomous outcome variables, the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate an association between a treatment and outcome. The χ² test and I² statistic were used to evaluate statistical heterogeneity. Finally, to evaluate the overall outcome of an intervention of proven efficacy, individual studies that evaluated a specific intervention were combined to determine the size of within-group changes.

### Midterm outcomes of endoscopic plantar fascia debridement in 125 patients: A 5-year follow-up [^116xerXJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common pathologies addressed by foot and ankle surgeons. Despite advances and overall success rates for conservative therapy, many recalcitrant cases proceed to require surgical correction. Partial to complete release of the fascia is often performed, altering foot biomechanics and severing the windlass mechanism. Endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia allows for direct visualization and removal of the inflammatory tissue while leaving the fascia and its function intact. A total of 125 feet were evaluated, with a minimum follow-up time of 5 years. Gender, body mass index, and duration of symptoms were all evaluated and documented.

Visual analog scale scores (VAS), American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), and Foot Function Index (FFI) were collected both pre- and postoperatively. The AOFAS, FFI, and VAS scores improved from a pre-operative mean of 57.6, 89.4%, and 8.6 to 89.1, 13.4%, and 0.7, respectively (p < .05) at final follow-up. Of the 125 patients, 98% stated they were satisfied with the operative outcome and would undergo the procedure again. At final follow-up, no patient suffered rupture of the fascia or recurrence. Patients were able to bear weight immediately following the surgery in a walking boot, and on average, patients were able to return to work at 3.4 days following surgery. This is a novel technique that does not compromise the plantar fascia or alter foot biomechanics, with promising 5-year outcomes.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114DqDWJ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis results from inflammation and degeneration due to microtears in the plantar fascia. A plantar fascia thickness greater than 4 mm is considered abnormal. Several RCTs have used plantar fascia thickness to evaluate the efficacy of PRP and CS treatments. Our meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in plantar fascia thickness between PRP and CS treatments at 1, 3, and 6 months. However, both interventions were associated with a significant reduction in thickness over time. This reduction is clinically meaningful, likely reflecting a decrease in inflammation and a potential restoration of normal fascial architecture — key therapeutic objectives in managing plantar fasciitis.

The ability of ultrasound to detect these subtle changes in thickness underscores its utility as an objective marker for treatment efficacy. Given its high sensitivity, noninvasive nature, and capacity for precise, repeatable measurements, ultrasound is an indispensable tool not only for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis but also for the ongoing monitoring of treatment outcomes. The increased thickness of the plantar fascia in patients with plantar fasciitis is primarily attributed to inflammation and degenerative changes within the fascia. Inflammation leads to fluid accumulation within the tissue, causing edema and contributing to the increase in thickness. Degenerative changes, including collagen fiber disorganization, fibrosis, and fibroblast proliferation, also contribute to the overall thickening of the fascia. On ultrasound imaging, inflammation is typically manifested as…

### Does a corticosteroid injection plus exercise or exercise alone add to the effect of patient advice and a heel cup for patients with plantar fasciopathy? A randomised clinical trial [^112t9zH4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Design**: This randomised, single-blinded superiority trial with a three-group parallel design was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and the trial protocol was published before the inclusion of the final participant. The trial reporting follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, TIDieR, and the CHAMP statement.

- **Participants**: Individuals with plantar fasciopathy (PF) were recruited from general practices of the North Denmark Region or via Facebook. The inclusion criteria were inferior heel pain lasting for three or more months, pain on palpation of the medial calcaneal tubercle or the proximal plantar fascia, plantar fascia thickness of 4.0 mm or more as measured using ultrasonography, and mean heel pain of 30 mm or more on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the previous week. Exclusion criteria included being below 18 years of age, having diabetes, a history of inflammatory systemic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis), prior heel surgery, pregnancy or breastfeeding, receiving a corticosteroid injection specifically for PF within the previous six months, experiencing pain or stiffness in the first metatarsophalangeal joint to an extent where the exercises cannot be performed, known hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or local anaesthetics, skin or soft tissue infection near the injection site, receiving any treatment by a healthcare professional for PF within the previous 12 weeks, or making any substantial changes to usual self-care of the condition in the last four weeks (for example, starting to use insoles, beginning stretching exercises, or making a substantial decrease in physical activity level).

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: Indications, protocol, intermediate results, and a comparison of results to fasciotomy [^111sFs5N]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A review of the history, mechanism of action, and application of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for chronic plantar fasciitis is presented. The results of 40 feet treated with this modality are reviewed following a mean follow-up time of 8.4 months. All procedures were performed under intravenous sedation and local infiltrative anesthesia. An electrohydraulic shock wave with a mean of 20.6 kV combined with a mean of 2,506 pulses was used. The results of a similar demographic class of patients who underwent a percutaneous plantar fasciotomy at our institution were compared to the results of this cohort of shock wave patients. Eighty-two percent of the patients treated with extracorporeal shock wave therapy were successfully treated, compared to 83% with a percutaneous plantar fasciotomy. The mean score on the 11-point visual analog scale for satisfied patients was 7.9 preoperatively and 2.95 within 7 days postoperatively. After 3 months, the mean visual analog score was 4.2, or 50% of the preoperative value, following a mean of 8.4 months following treatment. Eighty-three percent of the patients treated stated that shock wave therapy improved their symptoms. There were no complications encountered in any patient in this study. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is an effective treatment, which significantly reduces the symptoms associated with chronic plantar fasciitis and compares favorably to the results achieved with surgical intervention in the form of a percutaneous plantar fasciotomy.

### Current treatment of plantar fasciitis [^1169zmf8]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2002). High credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is associated with various symptoms. Pain is often relieved by rest and can be worsened in the morning. Clinical indicators include a positive windlass test, calcaneal spur, and calf tightness. Factors such as obesity, pes cavus (high arch), and pes planus (flat feet) also contribute. Patients often experience heel tenderness or pain, perifascial edema, and Achilles tendinopathy. Observations may include decreased ankle dorsiflexion, gait disturbances, difficulty walking, and limping. Pain may be aggravated by weight-bearing, standing for prolonged periods, or participating in sports. Additionally, increased plantar fascia thickness can be noted on examination.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: Findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^113DFDaF]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Plantar fascia (PF) disorders are prevalent in the adult population, causing pain and disability that may hinder athletic activities, work-related tasks, or routine duties. Imaging plays a crucial role in achieving accurate diagnosis, facilitating appropriate treatment, and determining prognosis. Awareness of the normal and pathological imaging appearances of the PF is therefore essential.

This review article aims to provide radiologists and clinicians with straightforward and systematic guidelines for evaluating PF disorders. It specifically focuses on key features suggestive of PF disease that need to be identified on conventional radiographs, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These guidelines are derived from our centers' experiences, complemented by a thorough analysis of literature from the past 20 years (1996–2016).

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed using keywords such as "plantar fascia" or "plantar aponeurosis", combined with "radiography", "X-ray", "ultrasound", "sonography", "magnetic resonance imaging", or "imaging". Additional terms included "fasciitis", "fibromatosis", "tear", "rupture", "xanthoma", "diabetes mellitus", "infection", or "foreign body". References of identified publications were also reviewed. The study included original research studies and review articles in English focusing on the imaging description of PF and related disorders, with case reports and case series selected based on clinical relevance.

### Is radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham-rESWT or a standardised exercise programme in combination with advice plus customised foot orthoses more effective than advice plus customised foot orthoses alone in the treatment of plantar fasciopathy? A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^1174GQj3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). High credibility.

In this randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a four-arm parallel-group design, participants were blinded to rESWT and sham-rESWT treatments but not to other treatments. The trial was conducted at the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Oslo University Hospital from March 2018 to January 2023. The study's protocol was previously published (online supplemental file 2), and the trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The reporting follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist, the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template checklist, and the CHAMP statement.

Patients between 18 and 70 years of age who were referred by local general practitioners (GPs) to the outpatient clinic for heel pain were eligible for inclusion in the study. Inclusion criteria were pain for greater than 3 months localized to the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia on the medial calcaneal tuberosity and tenderness to palpation corresponding to the painful area. Participants had to report a pain intensity during activity in the previous week on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 3 or higher, be residents of Norway, and understand oral and written Norwegian. The exclusion criteria were treatment with rESWT within the last 3 months, spondyloarthropathy or rheumatoid arthritis, plantar fibromatosis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy, previous surgery with osteosynthesis material remaining in the foot or ankle, and presence of contraindications for rESWT.

### Benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood: A distinct form of plantar fibromatosis [^11356ps2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Plantar fibromatosis is a benign but sometimes locally aggressive proliferation of fibrous tissue that usually arises in adolescence or early adulthood. Pediatric presentation with asymptomatic, bilateral nodules on the anteromedial heel pad may be a cause for cosmetic concern, but is otherwise harmless. Awareness and clinical diagnosis of benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood will prevent unnecessary and possibly unsuccessful surgery. We present a case of anteromedial plantar nodules and a brief review of the literature. We propose the term "benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood" to describe and define this clinically distinctive form of plantar fibromatosis.

### Abdominal and intra-abdominal fibromatoses: Outcomes over time [^117QdYz6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall and intra-abdominal fibromatoses are locally aggressive, nonmetastasizing neoplasms. Surgery has been the mainstay of local control, but new forms of therapy have been developed that may influence the clinical course and morbidity. We studied the clinical features and outcomes of patients with abdominal and intra-abdominal fibromatoses over time.

- **Methods**: Ninety-one patients — 46 with abdominal wall and 45 with intra-abdominal fibromatosis — were treated in our hospital systems between 2009 and 2023. The patients were allocated to one of two groups based on the year of their initial treatment: before and including 2016 vs. 2017–2023. Medical records and available histologic slides were reviewed.

- **Results**: Forty-six patients were treated between 2009 and 2016, and 45 patients were treated between 2017 and 2023. Patient ages ranged from 1 to 85 years (median, 39 years), and most patients (70%) were women, with a gender ratio of 2:2 men to women. Patients self-reported as Hispanic (49%), followed by White (28%), Black (20%), and Asian (3%). A subset (21%) had familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)/Gardner syndrome. Individuals with intra-abdominal fibromatoses (37%) were more likely to have FAP than individuals with abdominal wall fibromatosis (4%) (p < 0.0001). The most common initial treatment before and during vs. after 2016 was surgical excision (78% and 51% respectively; p = 0.02), followed by active surveillance with other medical intervention (9% and 18%, respectively; p = 0.28) and use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (0% and 18%, respectively; p = 0.014).

### Aggressive fibromatosis [^112kV6im]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent literature and define the optimal treatment of patients with aggressive fibromatosis. Data indicate the likelihood of local recurrence after surgery is high, particularly if margins are positive. Moderate-dose radiotherapy alone for gross disease, or following a microscopically incomplete resection, yields local control rates of approximately 75% to 80%. Treatment with pharmacologic agents results in objective response rates of approximately 40% to 50%, although the duration of response is variable. Thus, the optimal management for aggressive fibromatosis depends on tumor location and extent.

- **Surgical considerations**: Surgery is indicated if the lesion appears to be completely resectable with acceptable function and cosmesis.

- **Radiotherapy considerations**: Radiotherapy is indicated for patients with unresectable tumors. Those with positive margins after resection should be considered for adjuvant radiotherapy, depending on the location and extent of the tumor.

- **Pharmacologic treatment considerations**: Pharmacologic treatment should be considered for patients with progressive disease after unsuccessful local-regional therapy.

### Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on Achilles tendinopathy [^113hqBwg]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Submodule 4.3: Non-surgical treatment options

Which non-surgical treatment is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Non-surgical treatment is usually the first choice for managing Achilles tendinopathy. These treatments can be divided into several categories, which can be evaluated using different control groups. Consequently, the following non-surgical intervention categories were defined: a wait-and-see policy, placebo treatment, exercise therapy, orthoses, shockwave therapy, medication, acupuncture, injection therapy, and multimodal treatments. From our national patient survey, it was found that the majority of patients receive multiple treatments from these categories, leading to significant healthcare consumption. This high consumption is mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the comparative effectiveness of the different treatment options. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary, accompanied by tables and/or figures, are presented in online supplemental file module 4.

### Development of multiple epidermal inclusion cysts after radiofrequency microtenotomy for plantar fasciitis: A case report [^111LnNQV]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Epidermal inclusion cysts are slowly developing intradermal lesions that form after the implantation of epidermal tissue into the dermal tissue. These cysts occur infrequently in the foot but can emerge following traumatic episodes, including surgically induced trauma. While epidermal inclusion cysts have been documented as a complication of minimally invasive foot and ankle surgery, they are infrequently described as a complication of radiofrequency microtenotomy. To our knowledge, only one other case study exists discussing the development of a singular epidermal cyst following radiofrequency microtenotomy.

The purpose of the present case report was to discuss a case involving the development of multiple epidermal inclusion cysts of the plantar heel after radiofrequency microtenotomy for treating plantar fasciitis. Following radiofrequency coblation in November 2017, the patient developed multiple plantar heel cysts, which were surgically removed in February 2018 and again in June 2018. By October 2018, upon presentation to our office, multiple cysts persisted on her heel despite two surgical excisions. Seventeen months after the surgical excision in February 2019, the patient remained cyst-free.

### Facial paediatric desmoid fibromatosis: a case series, literature review and management algorithm [^116L9Tdy]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Desmoid fibromatosis, known also as infantile or aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare soft tissue tumor occasionally observed in children. Despite being histologically benign, its growth pattern is highly aggressive, often invading surrounding musculature and bone. Frequently located in cosmetically sensitive areas, its complete excision can present significant challenges. However, incomplete surgical excision is associated with high recurrence rates. Although the disease responds to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both treatments carry significant risks for young children.

The management of four cases of pediatric desmoid fibromatoses occurring in the midface is discussed. Recent and relevant literature is thoroughly reviewed, and a management algorithm for pediatric desmoid fibromatoses is proposed.

### Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy; deep fascial versus superficial fascial approach: a prospective randomized study [^115ZzsbP]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In the present randomized prospective study, two different surgical techniques of endoscopic plantar fascia release were compared. Of 547 patients with a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, 46 with no response to conservative treatment for ≥ 6 months were included. Of the 46 patients, five were lost to follow-up. In group 1 (n = 21), plantar fascia release was performed using a deep fascial approach (DFA), and in group 2 (n = 20), the superficial fascial approach (SFA) with a slotted cannula technique was used.

Patients were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale and visual analog scale at baseline and 3 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial surgery. At the final follow-up appointment, the Roles-Maudsley score was used to determine patient satisfaction. At the final follow-up examination, the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale scores had increased from 53.12 to 83.68, with a decrease in the mean visual analog scale score from 7.95 to 1.65 noted. According to the Roles-Maudsley score, the success rate after 1 year was 90.47% for the DFA group, 95% for the SFA group, and 92.68% for all patients.

Although no significant difference was found between the final functional scores, better early postoperative scores were found in the SFA group. The mean duration of the procedure was measured as 27.22 ± 9.41 minutes overall, 35 ± 5.62 minutes in the DFA group, and 19.05 ± 4.01 minutes in the SFA group. Two early and two late complications occurred in the DFA group, with none reported in the SFA group.

### Successful application of focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy for plantar fasciitis in patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer [^115RoBA8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Focused extracorporeal shock wave therapy (fESWT) has been shown to be effective in a large number of musculoskeletal disorders. Until 2016, cancer was considered a contraindication for fESWT. The goal of this commentary is to address the subject of fESWT in cancer patients and present a case of a successful application of fESWT in a breast cancer patient with metastatic bone disease, suffering from debilitating heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis.

- **Methods**: The subject of fESWT application in cancer patients is discussed using the example of a 75-year-old female with breast cancer and metastatic bone disease, suffering from bilateral inferior heel pain, who was referred to our clinic with a tentative diagnosis of polyneuropathy. Patient history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic testing, and radiological findings all indicated plantar fasciitis, rather than polyneuropathy. The possibility of metastatic bone lesions in the treatment area was excluded and the patient was consequently treated with five weekly applications of low-energy fESWT.

- **Results**: The treatment led to a reduction in pain of approximately 80% with no adverse events.

- **Conclusion**: fESWT may be a viable treatment option for plantar fasciitis even in cancer patients, provided certain conditions are met.

### Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy improves early postoperative results: a retrospective comparison of outcomes after endoscopic versus open plantar fasciotomy [^114cJgKc]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciotomy is offered to patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Few studies have characterized the functional outcomes over time for the endoscopic approach compared with the open approach. We hypothesized that patients undergoing endoscopic surgery will have better postoperative functional outcomes early in the postoperative period, but equivalent long-term outcomes compared with patients undergoing open surgery.

We analyzed the prospectively collected data of all patients undergoing plantar fasciotomy at our institution from December 2007 to August 2014. A total of 42 feet of 38 patients were included in the analysis. The clinical data were collected preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months and 1 year.

- **Functional outcomes analyzed**: Included the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale, the Medical Outcomes Study, Short-Form, 36-item Health Survey, and patient satisfaction and expectations.

Patients undergoing endoscopic surgery had significantly greater American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot and SF-36 Health Survey scores and lower pain scores at the 3-month period. They were also significantly more likely to be satisfied with and have had their expectations met by the surgery. Compared with the open approach, the patients who had undergone endoscopic plantar fasciotomy experienced significantly greater improvements in the subjective and objective functional outcomes, with less pain and greater satisfaction, and had had their expectations met earlier in the recovery period, with equivalent long-term outcomes.

### A novel case of polyfibromatosis and interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis [^112unprG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Polyfibromatosis is a rare condition where several cutaneous fibrotic conditions, such as Dupuytren's contracture, keloid formation, Peyronie's disease, and plantar fibromatosis, may coexist. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis is also a rare condition characterized by arthritis and infiltrated rope-like lesions with granulomatous histologic features. We report a case of the simultaneous occurrence of both conditions in the same individual. To our knowledge, this has not been previously described. The clinical course has been slow, progressive, and recalcitrant to treatment.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroids in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QHc6Y]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Typically, the first line of treatment for plantar fasciitis is nonsurgical, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, orthotics, and physical therapy. For patients who do not respond to these interventions, different types of injections are available. The standard for local injection therapies includes corticosteroid (CS) injections, which provide short-term pain relief in approximately 70%–80% of patients. The effects generally last between 4 and 12 weeks, with the greatest relief observed around 4 weeks after injection. In most cases, a single injection is sufficient to achieve significant pain reduction. However, in refractory cases, up to three injections may be administered, although this increases the risk of complications. These complications may include plantar fascia rupture, infection, skin pigmentation changes, muscle damage, and fat pad atrophy. Although many patients experience partial improvement, the benefits tend to diminish over time, and full resolution of symptoms is not guaranteed.

In recent years, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have gained prominence in the treatment of plantar fasciitis by leveraging the regenerative potential of platelets and leukocytes. PRP releases a concentrated array of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), all of which are pivotal in tissue repair and regeneration. These growth factors enhance cellular proliferation, stimulate collagen synthesis, and promote angiogenesis, which are critical for the restoration of damaged tissues.

### Sorafenib in Dupuytren and Ledderhose disease [^116FVsrE]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Palmar and plantar fibromatosis are benign proliferative processes that present as a diffuse thickening or nodules of the hands and/or feet, potentially leading to flexion contractures, pain, and functional impairment known as Dupuytren and Ledderhose diseases, respectively. Treatments are noncurative and are associated with significant morbidity. Here, we report on the outcomes of five patients with advanced disease, who were no longer surgical candidates, treated with sorafenib.

Sorafenib exhibited an expected safety profile. All five patients demonstrated objective responses as evaluated by a decrease in tumor size and/or tumor cellularity from baseline, and all five patients reported subjective pain relief and/or functional improvement. Mechanistically, immunohistochemistry revealed patchy positivity for PDGFRβ, a known target of sorafenib. The outcomes of these five patients suggest the safety and efficacy of a relatively well-tolerated oral agent in treating Dupuytren and Ledderhose diseases and highlight the need for future controlled studies.

### The effect of plantar calcaneal spur excision on plantar fascia surgery outcomes [^116zuZ9A]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Plantar heel pain is a prevalent condition affecting 10% of the population, with plantar fasciitis being the most common cause. Plantar calcaneal spurs are frequently associated with plantar fasciitis, yet their role in the condition and surgical outcomes remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of plantar calcaneal spur excision on the outcomes of plantar fascia surgery, utilizing a radiofrequency microtenotomy and bone marrow aspiration technique. A retrospective review of 136 plantar fascia surgeries was conducted, with 83 cases including plantar calcaneal spur excision. Demographic and operative factors were analyzed, with outcomes including time to weight-bearing in a boot and shoes, symptom resolution, and complications.

- **Statistical significance**: Plantar calcaneal spur excision was associated with a statistically significant delay in symptom resolution (p = 0.006) and time to weight-bearing in shoes (p = 0.020).

- **Operative laterality**: A statistically significant difference was observed regarding operative laterality, with right-sided surgeries demonstrating an increased time to symptom resolution (p = 0.007) and a higher retreatment rate (p = 0.017) compared to left-sided surgeries.

There was no significant difference in complication rates or the need for retreatment between excision and non-excision groups. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of plantar calcaneal spur excision in surgical planning for plantar fasciitis, with implications for patient education and management strategies.

### Getting to the heel of the problem: Plantar fascia lesions [^1121o3PV]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a frequent disabling symptom. Clinical diagnosis can often be challenging due to the wide range of potential diagnoses. Lesions of the plantar fascia are a significant group within these diagnoses. This review describes common lesions of the plantar fascia, including plantar fasciitis, plantar fascia rupture, plantar fibromatosis, and plantar xanthoma. These conditions are illustrated with appropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging. Additionally, the review addresses foreign-body reactions, enthesopathy, and diabetic fascial disease.

### Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans growing around plantar aponeurosis: Excision by Mohs micrographic surgery [^115D6wbw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a spindle cell malignancy known for its high local recurrence rate after excision, especially when there is minimal or no immediate tissue margin assessment. DFSP is exceedingly rare on the palms and soles.

- **Objective**: To report a case of a locally aggressive DFSP on the sole excised using Mohs micrographic surgery.

- **Methods**: Case report and review of the literature.

- **Results**: Mohs micrographic surgery revealed tumor infiltration that extended around the plantar aponeurosis and into the underlying plantar muscle fascia.

- **Conclusion**: Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered the treatment of choice for DFSP, particularly in acral locations. This technique allows surgeons to trace deep tumor extensions that may wrap around underlying tendons, a finding that may not be clinically apparent.

### Recent developments in the understanding and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^112PKc9X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

In a study from our center investigating physical and mental quality of life scores among patients at a tertiary center, female patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) had decreased quality of life compared with the general and healthy U.S. population. Headache, neck pain, and abdominal pain were significant contributing factors to reduced quality of life scores. Thus, pain management is vitally important. Patients with chronic disease often experience psychological distress, and FMD is no exception. Compounding patient symptoms and potential need for invasive procedures is the anxiety related to having an uncommon disease with which many health care providers are entirely unfamiliar. Therefore, referral to psychology and/or psychiatry colleagues to develop healthy coping practices is appropriate for those patients experiencing significant distress. The FMD Society of America provides an online source for patient and health care provider information and support.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: Findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^111c6pR2]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

In cases of atypical clinical presentation or where imaging findings do not confirm the presence of plantar fasciitis, differential diagnosis includes other causes of plantar fascia (PF) disease, such as plantar fibromatosis, trauma, and infection, as well as disorders arising from structures other than the PF. Ultrasound has several advantages over MRI in the assessment of Ledderhose disease or plantar fibromatosis. Plantar fibromas may appear as small hypointense lesions on MRI and are difficult to differentiate from the low signal intensity of the PF. However, small plantar fibromas are more easily detected on ultrasound because of the contrast between their poorly reflective echotexture and the fibrillar appearance of the normal PF. Moreover, both feet can be examined together using ultrasound. Examining both feet together using MRI reduces the in-plane resolution, whereas examining them separately is time-consuming compared to ultrasound.

A significant overlap exists between the presentation of plantar fasciitis and that of a traumatic partial tear. In our experience, ultrasound is superior to MRI in differentiating true fiber interruption and tearing from edema. Confirmation of a complete tear is best achieved by proving widening of the gap between the two ends of the PF with dynamic maneuvers. In cases of a complete tear, MRI allows precise estimation of PF retraction with prognostic implications for the surgical reparability of the lesion. In cases of infectious fasciitis, MRI provides high anatomic detail and an accurate depiction of the extent of the inflammatory process.

### An update on the management of sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis: A European consensus initiative between Sarcoma Patients EuroNet (SPAEN) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) [^116dkWKN]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare and locally aggressive monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Currently, there is no established or evidence-based treatment approach available for this disease. Therefore, in 2015, the European Desmoid Working Group published a position paper giving recommendations on the treatment of this intriguing disease.

Here, we present an update of this consensus approach based on professionals' and patients' expertise following a roundtable meeting. This meeting brought together sarcoma experts from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group, along with patients and patient advocates from Sarcoma Patients EuroNet. In this paper, we focus on new findings regarding the prognostic value of mutational analysis in desmoid-type fibromatosis patients and new systemic treatment options.

### Proximal plantar fibroma as an etiology of recalcitrant plantar heel pain [^114yQthM]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Prompted by repeated pathology reports of fibromas at the origin of the plantar fascia after fasciectomy for chronic plantar heel pain, this study examined the incidence of proximal plantar fibroma. A retrospective study of 100 pathology specimens from 97 patients with the preoperative diagnosis of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis was conducted. Patients ranged in age from 36 to 82 and included 31 males and 66 females. The specimens consisted of medial and central bands of the fascia obtained from transverse plantar fasciectomies. The fasciectomies were performed by four surgeons between July 1994 and March 2008. One quarter of the cases studied had a histological appearance of plantar fibroma. This new finding has not been reported in any literature in connection with recalcitrant heel pain.

- **Histologic findings**: The specimens were placed into three groups: neoplastic involvement (25%, 21 female and 6 male), inflammation without neoplastic involvement (21%, 13 female and 6 male), and other, which consisted of having no inflammatory or neoplastic response (54%, 32 female and 19 male).

All of the patients failed a 3- to 6-month conservative treatment regimen, which included anti-inflammatory medication, modification of activities, injection of corticosteroids, night splints, custom-molded orthotics, and physical therapy. Only three patients underwent bilateral plantar fasciectomies. No patient required a revisional procedure. The authors conclude that 25% of recalcitrant heel pain is neoplastic in origin and that patients presenting with these lesions require excision and not fasciotomy.

### Management of plantar heel pain: A best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^116nYyF7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

We synthesized high-quality RCTs, elicited expert clinical reasoning, and surveyed patients to produce this best practice guide (BPG). Our work meets the majority of the relevant AGREE II criteria and the high-quality criteria previously reported for guideline development.

The BPG defines a core approach to management which consists of the simple but active, supported self-management interventions of plantar fascia stretching and taping (labeled 'DO' in figure 2) to support the plantar fascia, alongside less well-defined educational interventions (labeled 'DECIDE' in the figure). The interviews with experts gave clear direction that this education should encourage individual assessment, footwear advice to ensure comfort in shoes that allow a small rearfoot to forefoot drop while also considering social acceptability to improve adherence, load management to break up long periods of static loading or problematically rapid training changes in more athletic populations, and support to address comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (online supplemental file 1). Additionally, it should involve teaching patients the parameters required to self-monitor the pain response to activity and how to interpret pain with respect to tissue damage in order to allay fears of long-term consequences.

The educational delivery should adopt a realistic tone as recovery may take several weeks or months but stress the positive prognosis, a recommendation that came through strongly in the expert interviews.

- **The role of ESWT**: The systematic review showed ESWT had the best evidence of modalities that have been evaluated.

### Management of plantar heel pain: A best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^111ckZio]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Adequate sample size was calculated using G*Power (Universitat Dusseldorf) at a power of 80%, a minimum important difference of 19 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) score for first step pain, an SD of 28, and a 5% alpha level defining a minimum sample size of 38 per group. This outcome measure was chosen as it is arguably the pathognomonic feature of PHP. Additionally, 38 per group also represented the lowest calculated sample size for all our prespecified outcome measures (i.e. overall pain and function) that we evaluated. If studies did not have an adequate sample size to be considered for primary or secondary proof of efficacy, they were included in the meta-analysis where their results could be pooled with an adequately powered study.

To evaluate the overall strength of the evidence for each intervention, we used the levels of evidence system designed by van Tulder et al, which was adapted to reflect study inclusion being limited to high-quality studies and applied for both positive and negative findings. Evidence was rated as:

- **Strong evidence/positive effect**: Meta-analysis revealed multiple high-quality trials demonstrated efficacy/a positive effect in favour of the intervention.

- **Moderate evidence/positive effect**: Analysis revealed one high-quality trial demonstrated efficacy/a positive effect in favour of the intervention.

- **Limited evidence/positive effect**: Analysis revealed one high-quality trial, which did not meet the required sample size, demonstrated efficacy/a positive effect in favour of the intervention.

- **Strong evidence/neutral effect**: Meta-analysis revealed multiple

### Outcomes of management of recurrent Dupuytren contracture: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128PLt5]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

Dupuytren disease is an inherited, benign, chronic fibroproliferative disorder of palmar fascia, digital fascia, and adjacent soft tissue that impairs digit extension. Given that existing treatment options address Dupuytren contracture rather than Dupuytren disease, both recurrence and extension of the disease are common. The risk factors for recurrence include the following: plantar fibromatosis, Garrod nodules, radial side involvement, early onset (< 50 years of age), and male sex.

Treatment for the disease is complicated by the lack of a universally agreed-upon definition of recurrence. The only consensus-based definition, via the Delphi method, defines recurrence as greater than 20° of contracture at a joint 1 year after treatment compared with 6 weeks after treatment. Recurrence rates of 12% to 39%, 50% to 58%, and 10% to 31% have been reported for open partial fasciectomy, needle aponeurotomy, and collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection, respectively. The most common treatment modality for recurrent Dupuytren contracture is open partial fasciectomy, considering the significant scarring, altered anatomy, and poor definition of diseased tissue. Open fasciectomy for Dupuytren contracture appears to afford greater initial correction and better visualization of nerves, arteries, and flexor tendons, whereas CCH and needle aponeurotomy have a more benign complication profile and faster recovery. For the purpose of this review, CCH and needle aponeurotomy are referred to as nonsurgical treatment modalities for Dupuytren disease.
