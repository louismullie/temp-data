## Question

If patient has ASCVD score of 24%, should you start a statin? High or moderate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 10-year ASCVD risk of 24% means the patient should start a statin, and if so, whether to use high-intensity or moderate-intensity therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this risk category and what the ACC/AHA thresholds are. Then, I should verify the guideline-directed statin intensity for high-risk primary prevention. Next, I will consider the expected LDL-C reduction target and whether to escalate if it's not achieved. After that, I should review risk enhancers and the role of coronary artery calcium if the decision is uncertain. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions or special populations that might modify intensity.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. A 10-year ASCVD risk of 24% places the patient in the high-risk category, which is defined as ≥ 20% by ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines, so statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in this scenario [^1171dFqY] [^111QWr6D].

> Wait, let me verify the intensity recommendation. For adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes who are at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), the guideline recommends initiating statin therapy with the intent to reduce LDL-C by 50% or more, which corresponds to high-intensity statin therapy, not moderate-intensity [^111QWr6D] [^1142AHoJ].

> I should confirm the LDL-C reduction target. High-intensity statins are expected to lower LDL-C by at least 50% on average, and the guideline explicitly advises aiming for a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction in high-risk primary prevention patients, which operationalizes the choice of high-intensity therapy in this case [^111QWr6D] [^1142AHoJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about escalation. If the patient cannot tolerate high-intensity therapy due to adverse effects or drug–drug interactions, then moderate-intensity statin therapy is an appropriate alternative, with the aim of achieving a 30–49% LDL-C reduction, and this switch should be documented in the chart as the reason for not using high-intensity therapy [^111QWr6D] [^1142AHoJ].

> Next, I should review risk enhancers and whether they change the starting intensity. In high-risk patients, risk enhancers such as family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, or inflammatory disorders support statin therapy but do not independently mandate a higher starting intensity beyond what is already recommended for high risk; they reinforce the need for therapy and may influence monitoring or add-on decisions if goals are not met [^111QWr6D] [^111SpaeW].

> Let me consider coronary artery calcium (CAC) briefly. CAC is most useful when the risk decision is uncertain in borderline or intermediate risk, not when risk is clearly high. In a 24% risk patient, CAC testing is not routinely recommended to decide whether to start a statin, though if done and the score is very high (for example, ≥ 300), that could further support high-intensity therapy in shared decision-making, but it would not change the initial indication to treat [^111QWr6D] [^115XMRYn].

> I should double-check special populations. If the patient is older than 75 years, the approach shifts toward individualized assessment and often moderate-intensity therapy due to competing risks and frailty, but for ages 40–75 without diabetes, high-intensity remains the default for 10-year risk ≥ 20% unless contraindicated or not tolerated [^111QWr6D] [^116TMavT].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Yes, initiate statin therapy now because the 10-year ASCVD risk is 24%, which is high risk. Use high-intensity statin therapy with the goal of achieving at least a 50% LDL-C reduction, and if high-intensity is not tolerated, use moderate-intensity with a 30–49% LDL-C target and document the reason for the change [^111QWr6D] [^114Vu9ZA].

---

Start a **high-intensity statin** for a 10-year ASCVD risk of 24% [^111QWr6D], as this exceeds the ≥ 20% high-risk threshold [^1171dFqY]. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended to achieve a **≥ 50% LDL-C reduction** [^111QWr6D] and reduce cardiovascular events [^115HERYE]. If high-intensity therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statins with a 30–49% LDL-C reduction target [^111QWr6D] [^1142AHoJ]. Always incorporate shared decision-making and address lifestyle and risk enhancers [^111Ksvaj] [^111SpaeW].

---

## Risk stratification and guideline recommendations

The ACC/AHA guidelines classify 10-year ASCVD risk into **four categories** [^1171dFqY]:

| **Risk category** | **10-year ASCVD risk** | **Recommended statin therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Low | < 5% | Lifestyle modification |
| Borderline | 5% to < 7.5% | Consider moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers present [^111QWr6D] |
| Intermediate | 7.5% to < 20% | Moderate-intensity statin [^111QWr6D] |
| High | ≥ 20% | High-intensity statin [^111QWr6D] |

---

A 24% 10-year ASCVD risk places the patient in the **high-risk category**, for which high-intensity statin therapy is recommended [^111QWr6D].

---

## Evidence supporting high-intensity statin therapy

High-intensity statins achieve a **≥ 50% LDL-C reduction** [^1142AHoJ] and significantly lower cardiovascular event risk in high-risk primary prevention patients [^115HERYE]. The HOPE-3 trial showed that rosuvastatin 10 mg reduced ASCVD events in intermediate-risk patients, supporting the use of statins in this risk range [^117BSkmW]. Meta-analyses also show greater risk reduction with high- versus moderate-intensity statins in high-risk patients [^114QFLn9].

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

Before initiating high-intensity statin therapy, consider the following:

- **Age**: Patients > 75 years may require individualized assessment and shared decision-making due to potential increased adverse effects [^111QWr6D].
- **Comorbidities**: Evaluate for hepatic impairment, renal dysfunction, or myopathy risk factors [^115wBqQf].
- **Drug interactions**: Assess for potential interactions with concomitant medications [^115wBqQf].
- **Patient preferences**: Engage in shared decision-making to discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^111Ksvaj].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After initiating statin therapy, monitor the following:

- **Lipid panel**: Recheck 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change to assess LDL-C reduction and adherence [^notfound].
- **Liver enzymes**: Baseline and as clinically indicated thereafter [^1119L2xg].
- **Muscle symptoms**: Monitor for myalgias or weakness, and check creatine kinase if symptoms occur [^notfound].

---

## Alternative therapy if high-intensity statins are contraindicated

If high-intensity statins are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider **moderate-intensity statins** (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg or rosuvastatin 5–10 mg) with a target LDL-C reduction of 30–49% [^111QWr6D] [^1142AHoJ]. If LDL-C goals are not met, add ezetimibe or consider PCSK9 inhibitors based on risk and patient preference [^112nizyu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

A patient with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 24% should start a **high-intensity statin** to achieve a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and reduce cardiovascular events [^111QWr6D] [^115HERYE]. Use shared decision-making, assess contraindications, and monitor lipids and safety parameters. If high-intensity therapy is not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statins with additional LDL-C–lowering therapy as needed [^111QWr6D] [^112nizyu].

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^115XMRYn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Statin therapy allocation using CAC thresholds — Based on MESA and guideline‑consistent framing, a CAC score ≥ 100, associated with a 10‑year ASCVD risk > 7.5%, is a clear indication to engage in a clinician patient discussion about initiation of statin therapy, and in most such patients a moderate intensity statin is initiated. For those with a CAC score > 300 per MESA or > 400 in the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, with 10‑year hard ASCVD risk in the 13 to > 15% range, moderate or possibly high intensity statin therapy is reasonable. For scores > 1000, the use of high intensity or maximally tolerated statins and concomitant statin add‑on LDL‑C lowering therapy may be warranted in those with an LDL‑C threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL.

### High-intensity statin use among patients with atherosclerosis in the U.S [^1134v8Rf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preventive therapy among patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is generally underused. Whether new guideline recommendations and a focus on implementation have improved the use of high-intensity statins is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the patterns and predictors of statin use among patients with ASCVD.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, pharmacy and medical claims data from a commercial health plan were queried for patients with established ASCVD between January 31, 2018, and January 31, 2019. Statin use on an index date of January 31, 2019, was evaluated, as was 12-month adherence and discontinuation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent associations with statin use of varying intensities.

Results

Of the 601,934 patients with established ASCVD, 41.7% were female, and the mean age was 67.5 ± 13.3 years. Overall, 22.5% of the cohort were on a high-intensity statin, 27.6% were on a low- or moderate-intensity statin, and 49.9% were not on any statin. In multivariable analysis, younger patients, female patients, and those with higher Charlson comorbidity score were less likely to be prescribed any statin. Among statin users, female patients, older patients, and those with peripheral artery disease were less likely to be on a high-intensity formulation, whereas a cardiology encounter in the prior year increased the odds. The majority of high-intensity stain users achieved high levels of adherence.

Conclusions

Substantial underuse of statins persists in a large, insured, and contemporary cohort of patients with ASCVD from the United States. In particular, concerning gaps in appropriate statin use remain among younger patients, women, and those with noncoronary ASCVD.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^1119L2xg]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Excluded populations… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk.

Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality.

The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins. PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent. Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe.

### Optimisation of lipids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in a primary care [^115dcKcD]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

In an effort to reduce the global burden of ASCVD, the ACC/AHA released guidelines in 2013 for treatment of blood cholesterol for reducing the risk of ASCVD in adults. These guidelines replaced the 2004 National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III guidelines that focused on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels for prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease. Instead, the current guidelines have shifted the emphasis on management of risk of ASCVD in adults. Estimated risk is based on the pooled cohort equation to predict the risk of having a cardiovascular event. Patients are stratified into high-risk, moderate-risk or low-risk categories and accordingly started on high-intensity or medium-intensity statin medications. Additionally, for high-risk patients with clinical ASCVD, LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, diabetes history and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% should be on a high-intensity statin. Prior to this quality improvement, Internal Medicine Clinic patients were treated for hyperlipidaemia based on ATP III guidelines. Current evidence validates the efficacy of implementation of therapies based on ASCVD risk scores. However, less than 1% of the Internal Medicine Clinic population had ASCVD risk scores completed; therefore, implementation of the current evidence-based treatment guidelines is the most effective way to increase primary prevention and management of ASCVD in the Internal Medicine Clinic.

Limitations

This quality improvement project has several limitations: (1) We were unable to retrieve the rate of new statin prescriptions and rate of modification (change in dose or intensity) of prescriptions for primary prevention of ASCVD based on ACC/AHA guidelines in Internal Medicine Clinic. (2) This quality improvement was conducted in a safety-net primary care clinic in patients with multiple comorbidities. These results are not generalisable to other settings. (3) We did not analyse the results of specific types of patient-related barriers to the acceptance of statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia: In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more.

### Statin use in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease according to 5 major guidelines… [^114NmGvK]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

The NNT10 to prevent 1 ASCVD using moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy, respectively, was 32 and 21 for CCS criteria, 30 and 20 for ACC/AHA criteria, 30 and 20 for NICE criteria, 27 and 18 for USPSTF criteria, and 29 and 20 for ESC/EAS criteria. For estimation of the absolute risk reduction achieved by following each guideline, we assumed a 25% relative risk/event reduction per 38. 7-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C among individuals free of ASCVD. 14 In this analysis, high-intensity and moderate-intensity statin therapy was expected to reduce LDL-C by approximately 50% and approximately 30%, respectively. 15 The calculations of relative risk reductions with LDL-C lowering was appropriately scaled on the natural logarithm scale: Using high-intensity statins, the NNT10 varied from 18 with the USPSTF guideline to 21 with the CCS guideline. The corresponding numbers for the moderate-intensity statins were 27 and 32, respectively.

Importantly, the estimated number of prevented ASCVD events was several times higher than the expected additional diabetes cases with all guidelines. low ASCVD risk. 11, 22 Second, the NNTs from RCTs are based on intention-to-treat analyses irrespective of whether participants are adherent to treatment. 17 Third, primary prevention studies have mostly used low-intensity to intermediate-intensity statins, with less effect on ASCVD prevention than high-intensity statins. Thus, when taking the guidelines as a whole, what seems to work best is the combination of an appropriately calibrated risk score that addresses an end point of interest together with evidence-based and risk/benefit-based treatment thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity for ASCVD events by assigning statin therapy according to the 5 major guidelines differ markedly.

Compared with the USPSTF and ESC/EAS guidelines, the CCS, ACC/AHA, and NICE guidelines assign statin therapy to many more of the individuals who later develop ASCVD. Nevertheless, the estimated NNT to prevent 1 ASCVD event is nearly identical between the 5 major guidelines. Taken together, our results therefore suggest that the CCS, ACC/AHA, or NICE guidelines should be preferred in clinical practice for primary preven.

### Optimisation of lipids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in a primary care [^115NExkL]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The ACC/AHA guidelines focus on ASCVD risk reduction, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of HMG-CoA-enzyme reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line therapy and using a Pooled Cohort Equation risk calculator to calculate a patient's 10-year risk score, which is used to guide initiation of statin therapy. Based on this 10-year percent risk, patients are stratified into high-risk, moderate-risk or low-risk categories and are accordingly started on high-intensity or medium-intensity statin medications. Therefore, identification of patients who are eligible to receive statin therapy as per current ACC/AHA guidelines is not possible without calculation of the Pooled Cohort ASCVD risk score.

Primary prevention of ASCVD includes a heart healthy lifestyleas well as the use of medications, including lipid lowering statins, which target modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and have been shown to reduce coronary artery disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. There are multiple comorbidities that are significant risk factors for coronary artery disease, including obesity and hyperlipidaemia, and predispose patients to future cardiovascular events. Over 70% of the Internal Medicine Clinic patient population has a diagnosis of hypertension and obesity (body mass index of 30 or greater). The majority of these patients have associated comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes mellitus and nicotine dependence. Many of these patients have undiagnosed hyperlipidaemia and are at risk for major cardiovascular mortality and morbidities such as coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure and premature death. Therefore, diagnosing comorbidities and implementing statin therapy based on an ASCVD risk score is crucial to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Since the majority of the Internal Medicine Clinic patients did not have ASCVD risk score assessment, the aim of this quality improvement project was to increase ASCVD risk score assessment in patients between the ages of 40 and 75 years from a baseline rate of less than 1% to 10%, within 12 months. The ultimate goal was improving treatment of blood cholesterol for the primary prevention of ASCVD in the Internal Medicine Clinic.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia — Synopsis emphasizes that patients have a high lifetime risk and decisions about statins do not require atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scoring; benefits are linked to interventions that increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing greater risk reduction with statins than placebo and greater reduction from higher- versus moderate-intensity statins. Ezetimibe plus a moderate-intensity statin is associated with greater LDL-C reduction than statin monotherapy in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and reduces ASCVD risk more than moderate-intensity monotherapy in those with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In selected patients whose LDL-C remains inadequately controlled on drug therapy, LDL apheresis is an option, and referral to a lipid specialist may be indicated.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD (chronic coronary syndrome), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving a 30–49% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Chronic inflammatory disorders and HIV — synopsis guidance states that after a 3- to 6-month trial of lifestyle improvements, including cessation of cigarette smoking, the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk estimate should be reassessed, and if the patient's ASCVD risk estimate is ≥ 5% over 10 years, it is reasonable to begin moderate-intensity statin therapy. If uncertainty about statin therapy remains or prior side effects exist, a CAC scan can be used to improve risk assessment; the absence of CAC in a nonsmoking man ≥ 40 years of age or a nonsmoking woman ≥ 45 years of age would indicate that the patient is likely at very low risk of an ASCVD event over the subsequent decade and such patients can then focus on lifestyle habits and delay the decision about statin therapy for about 5 years. A CAC score > 75th percentile for a patient's age and sex or an absolute score ≥ 100 Agatston units would support the decision to use statin therapy and intensify lifestyle modifications.

In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

Adults aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus — primary prevention statin therapy — are generally at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, a meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy is associated with a risk reduction of 25%, and therefore moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus for primary prevention. The ASCVD risk score, however, does not determine whether statin intensity should be increased; residual risk in trials remained high (eg, 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes mellitus as they age or develop risk modifiers (Table 5), although no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out in cohorts of patients exclusively with diabetes mellitus.

### Primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention: optimally active, agile, and accountable [^111tuzpR]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) affects 24 million adults (1 in every 10) in the United States. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a main causal risk factor for ASCVD, such that there is an estimated 22% relative risk reduction of ASCVD events for every 39 mg/dL LDL-C lowering with statin therapy. Statins remain the foundation of ASCVD prevention and likely confer pleiotropic effects beyond lipid-lowering. Nonetheless, challenges remain with respect to the optimal implementation of guideline-directed approaches to statin initiation.

The 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol provides a Class I recommendation for the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL as well as those with an intermediate risk (7.5–20%), or high risk (≥ 20%) based on the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk calculator. Among select adults with a borderline risk (5–7.5%) or all adults with an intermediate risk (7.5%-20%), there is a Class IIa recommendation to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to facilitate clinician-patient risk discussions regarding consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. Measurement of CAC has been shown to help reclassify risk and better identify those most likely to derive net clinical benefit from statin therapy, as the 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 1 ASCVD event is more than 2-fold lower for statin-eligible candidates with incident CAC vs long-term absence of CAC.

Regarding medical management for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, CDC/HIVMA/IDSA/NIH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with HIV infection and a 10-year ASCVD risk estimate of < 5%.
Recognize that the absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, consider the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk when deciding to initiate a statin. Use the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — pre-treatment assessment and lifestyle measures: The clinician and patient should assess statin adherence by assessing the number of missed statin doses per month and evaluating any barriers to adherence. If an adherent patient has not been tried on a high-intensity statin, the dose should be increased to a high-intensity dose. Patients who are unable to tolerate even moderate-intensity statin therapy should be evaluated for statin intolerance and considered for referral to a lipid specialist. The clinician and patient should attempt to intensify lifestyle modifications and may consider the incorporation of soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols as part of this approach, and other major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, including tobacco use, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and obesity, should be addressed as needed and controlled as well.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk-based therapies identify persistently elevated triglycerides (nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dl) as a risk-enhancing factor and outline statin thresholds and effects. In primary prevention patients without diabetes mellitus or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5% to < 20%, the presence of persistent hypertriglyceridemia supports a decision to initiate at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, and for 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% to < 7.5% patient-clinician discussion is recommended regarding initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. Statins provide a 10% to 30% dose-dependent reduction in triglycerides in patients with elevated triglyceride levels; similarly, statin therapy should be initiated or maximized if such patients have a history of diabetes mellitus or ASCVD, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated at ≥ 500 to 999 mg/dL following initiation of statin therapy, the clinician should consider intensification and monitor adherence to therapy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111XpJM9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia management — older patients (Chart 6) states that primary prevention strategies in patients 65–79 years of age should be managed in accordance with the NLA Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia-Part 1, and that for patients age ≥ 65 to < 80 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, moderate or high intensity statin therapy should be considered after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio. For secondary prevention in patients ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon a provider-patient discussion of the risks and benefits of such therapy, consideration of drug-drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations, and patient preference. Risk calculators such as the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Risk calculator or the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator can be used in select older individuals with one additional risk factor to further assess risk, using the thresholds for high risk of ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham risk calculator; however, these risk calculators have several limitations for use in older patients and may result in overestimation of lower risk older individuals. Older, primary prevention patients who are statin-eligible should undergo a patient-centered discussion with their provider about the risks and benefits of statin therapy, and if unable to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification, the provider should discuss the pros and cons of drug therapy and, if feasible, prescribe moderate intensity statin therapy, particularly when risk exceeds the high risk threshold. CAC scoring may be useful to further assess risk in older patients for whom questions remain about whether to prescribe drug therapy. If statin intolerance is an issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens or low dose statin combination therapy or non-statin monotherapy, with a goal of at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C.

Visit 3 — follow-up and potential initiation: If goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol have been attained, responses to therapy should be monitored at intervals of 6 to 12 months. Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy should be considered for very high-risk patients irrespective of atherogenic cholesterol levels, and if goal levels have not been attained and the patient's levels remain above the threshold for consideration of drug therapy, drug treatment might be initiated.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statin intensity and LDL-C lowering in primary prevention describes that an RCT enrolling men ≥ 55 years and women ≥ 65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor had placebo 10-year 'hard ASCVD' risk 8.7% and expanded endpoint 10%, and after 5.6 years rosuvastatin 10 mg per day produced significant absolute risk reduction. If maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with increased benefit especially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 20%. In JUPITER, men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL assigned rosuvastatin 20 mg per day achieved a median LDL-C reduction of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and the magnitude of percent LDL-C reduction achieved determined benefit.

### Evaluating algorithmic fairness in the presence of clinical guidelines: the case of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation [^116CDEtq]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

While risk stratification models are central to personalising care, their use can worsen health inequities. In an effort to mitigate harms, several recent works propose algorithmic group fairness — mathematical criteria which require that certain statistical properties of a model's predictions not differ across groups. However, identifying which statistical properties are most relevant to fairness in a given context is non-trivial. Hence, before applying fairness criteria for evaluation or model adjustment, it is crucial to examine how the model's predictions will inform treatment decisions — and what effect those decisions will have on patients' health.

Here, we consider the 2019 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which codify the use of 10-year ASCVD risk predictions to inform a clinician-patient shared decision-making on initiating statin therapy. These guidelines recommend that individuals estimated to be at intermediate risk (> 7.5%–20%) be considered for initiation for moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy, and that those at high risk (> 20%) be considered for high-intensity statin therapy. Individuals at borderline risk (> 5%–7.5%) may be considered for therapy under some circumstances.

### Five-year residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk prediction model for statin treated patients with known cardiovascular disease [^111CyKNr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite statin therapy, many patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) still suffer from ASCVD events. Predictors of residual ASCVD risk are not well-delineated. We aimed to develop an ASCVD risk prediction model for patients with previous ASCVD on statin use. We utilized statin-treated patients with ASCVD from the AIM-HIGH trial cohort. A 5-year risk score for subsequent ASCVD events with known ASCVD was developed using Cox regression, including potential risk factors with age, sex, and race forced in the model. Internal discrimination and calibration were evaluated. We included 3,271 patients with ASCVD (85.4% male, mean age 63.6 years, 65% on moderate- and 24% on high-intensity statin) with complete risk factor data and mean follow-up of 4.18 years. Overall, the estimated 5-year ASCVD risk was 21.1%: 10.2% of patients had a 5-year risk of > 30%, and 38.8% had risk of between 20% and 30%. In the model, male sex, hemoglobin A1c, alcohol use (inversely), family history of cardiovascular disease, homocysteine, history of carotid artery disease, and lipoprotein(a) best predicted residual ASCVD risk. Niacin treatment status did not enter the model. A C-statistic of 0.59 was obtained, with the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino test showing excellent calibration. We developed a risk prediction risk model for predicting 5-year residual ASCVD risk in statin-treated patients with known ASCVD that may help in identifying such persons at the highest risk of recurrent events. Validation in larger samples with patients on high-intensity statin is needed.

### Limitations of the SCORE-guided European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention [^117PdGLD]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Unfounded high-risk threshold preserved since 1994

The 5% high-risk threshold introduced by the SCORE-based 2003 ESC prevention guidelineswas chosen because 5% 10-year risk for fatal ASCVD was considered to equate with 20% 10-year risk for fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) arbitrarily defined as high-risk under previous ESC guidelines. No rationale was provided for choosing ≥ 20% 10-year CHD risk as high risk when introduced in 1994, neither for preserving it as ≥ 5% 10-year risk for fatal ASCVD.

Hence, except for UK and possibly a few other European countries, the most important threshold for initiating primary prevention with statins has not been revised in Europe for more than 20 years, during which time long-awaited generic and inexpensive statins became available, and their efficacy and safety convincingly documented. Considering that the prevalence and treatment costs of ASCVD remain high, such a development would normally favour a more widespread use of statins in primary prevention. However, because SCORE depends solely on the ultimate cause of death, in countries with declining ASCVD mortality it is becoming harder and harder to qualify for SCORE-based statin therapy, even though this treatment is contributing to the lower mortality. This and other limitations of SCORE are discussed in this view-point.

Thresholds for consideration of drug therapy — risk-based initiation: Because of available inexpensive, generic statins with favorable safety and demonstrated efficacy, the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that risk thresholds for initiating drug treatment should be lowered as compared with the NCEP ATP III but raised as compared with ACC/AHA 2013 recommendations; based on the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, most men > 60 years of age and most women > 70 years of age would be eligible for statin therapy, and recommendations involve a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Some clinicians may prefer to prescribe drug therapy to patients with lower levels of risk or atherogenic cholesterol, and such an approach may be considered based on clinical judgment and patient preferences in light of primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing risk reduction at projected 10-year ASCVD event rates as low as approximately 5% to 7.5%.

Because of a variety of factors, changes to guidelines may not be efficiently adapted and implemented. 8 With significant changes such as with the cholesterol guideline, the uptake may be delayed as well as vary greatly in extent between regions, patient populations, and physician types. From a public health perspective, the impact of a change in guideline should be evaluated. To date, 2 studies have been published that assess the impact of the guideline on statin prescribing patterns in patients with an ASCVD diagnosis. Both of these studies were limited to a single health system, and neither assessed changes in statin treatment patterns for primary prevention of ASCVD. 9, 10 The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the new guideline on statin‐initiating treatment patterns with regard to statin intensity for primary and secondary ASCVD prevention in the 2 years following its release. This will provide useful insight to help inform healthcare decision makers with regard to the use of moderate‐ and high‐intensity statin therapies in the near and longer terms as this guideline becomes more thoroughly integrated into clinical practice.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116iJYWW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

Long-term and lifetime ASCVD risk perspective — atherosclerosis often begins early and progresses for decades, so both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing risk-reduction therapies; clinical trials of statins generally indicate that each 1% decrease in LDL-C concentration is associated with about a 1% decrease in risk for CHD, and maintaining a lower serum cholesterol concentration for periods longer than typical clinical trials (averaging roughly 5 years) has the potential to yield a greater reduction in ASCVD risk than the approximate 1% to 1% relationship; many multivariate risk calculators were created to predict intermediate-term (eg, 10 year) risk for an ASCVD event.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older people with HIV — People with HIV have about a twofold higher ASCVD risk and are diagnosed about a decade younger than people without HIV; ASCVD risk prediction tools for the general population tend to underestimate risk, and the relative increase is greater among women with HIV than age-matched men with HIV. In the general population, statin therapy is recommended for all people at high 10-year ASCVD risk (defined as ≥ 20%). For people with HIV, recent REPRIEVE trial findings provided evidence for statin primary prevention at low-to-intermediate ASCVD risk (i.e., < 20%); in those aged 40 to 75 years on antiretroviral therapy (ART), pitavastatin 4 mg daily was associated with a 35% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events over a median follow-up of 5 years. Results from REPRIEVE informed the Panel's recommendation on the use of at least moderate-intensity statin therapy as primary prevention among people with HIV age 40 to 75 years, with a stronger recommendation for those with ASCVD risk score ≥ 5%.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Treatment for moderate and high ASCVD risk patients may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk. In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals. When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Limitations of the SCORE-guided European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention [^115CRBoy]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, primary prevention with statins was liberalized in the USA and UK but restricted in many comparable European countries. Supported by risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, the 2013 ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association)and 2014 UK-NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence)risk assessment and prevention guidelines lowered the risk threshold above which primary prevention with statins should be considered. In contrast, the 2016 update of the European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, issued jointly by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and nine other societies, continued a conservative position on statin use in primary prevention by preserving the high-risk decision threshold introduced in 2003: 5% 10-year risk for fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) estimated by SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation).

### Limitations of the SCORE-guided European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention [^114pExaZ]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Inherent limitations of the mortality-based SCORE model are discussed, including the SCORE prevention paradox (if a drug can keep patients alive, there is no need to use it in primary prevention), restricted age range (not applicable beyond 65 years), unreliable cross-sectional recalibration approach, and too few fatal events to allow for reliable sex-specific recalibration of SCORE in the intended target population. It may indeed be questioned whether it is possible to update the SCORE model to meet current needs in primary ASCVD prevention. With the conservative position taken by the 2016 ESC guidelines, SCORE-based statin therapy is soon going to be phased out in European countries with low and/or declining ASCVD mortality despite high morbidity and treatment costs.

New approaches are needed to guide primary prevention with statins that do not rely solely on traditional natural history studies, taking the burden of both fatal and non-fatal ASCVD into account, and providing guidance on statin therapy also in the elderly population. Risk-based treatment thresholds should be supported by transparent risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

Clinical considerations for ASCVD risk assessment — The risk calculator tool is a particularly important aspect of risk factor assessment with greatest utility for individuals at intermediate ASCVD risk where treatment decisions may be uncertain, and it is best used in shared decision-making to decide whether to initiate lipid-lowering medication. This tool should not be widely used when the decision to offer pharmacologic treatment is already supported by clinical findings or assessment, and its applicability is limited in those who have no CVD risk factors; risk calculators should be used before the initiation of treatment, and if a person has not begun pharmacotherapy, repeat calculations can be performed to monitor changes during lifestyle modification. Many risk calculators may not be suitable for individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia; several risk assessment tools are interchangeable and appropriate for routine care, and there are inherent issues with inappropriate use of race in many algorithms. The task force issued a good practice statement recommending the use of a validated ASCVD risk assessment tool to determine an individual's 10-year ASCVD risk for persons 40 to 79 years of age.

### Cardiovascular disease risk-based statin utilization and associated outcomes in a primary prevention cohort: insights from a large health care network [^115vBTsv]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend using the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to guide statin therapy for primary prevention. Real-world data on adherence and consequences of nonadherence to the guidelines in primary are limited. We investigated the guideline-directed statin intensity (GDSI) and associated outcomes in a large health care system, stratified by ASCVD risk.

Methods

Statin prescription in patients without coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke were evaluated within a large health care network (2013–2017) using electronic medical health records. Patient categories constructed by the 10-year ASCVD risk were borderline (5%-7.4%), intermediate (7.5%-19.9%), or high (≥ 20%). The GDSI (before time of first event) was defined as none or any intensity for borderline, and at least moderate for intermediate and high-risk groups. Mean (± SD) time to start/change to GDSI from first interaction in health care and incident rates (per 1000 person-years) for each outcome were calculated. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for incident ASCVD and mortality across risk categories stratified by statin utilization.

Results

Among 282298 patients (mean age ≈50 years), 29134 (10.3%), 63299 (22.4%), and 26687 (9.5%) were categorized as borderline, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. Among intermediate and high-risk categories, 27358 (43%) and 8300 (31%) patients did not receive any statin, respectively. Only 17519 (65.6%) high-risk patients who were prescribed a statin received GDSI. The mean time to GDSI was ≈2 years among the intermediate and high-risk groups. At a median follow-up of 6 years, there was a graded increase in risk of ASCVD events in intermediate risk (hazard ratio = 1.15 [1.07–1.24]) and high risk (hazard ratio = 1.27 [1.17–1.37]) when comparing no statin use with GDSI therapy. Similarly, mortality risk among intermediate and high-risk groups was higher in no statin use versus GDSI.

Conclusions

In a real-world primary prevention cohort, over one-third of statin-eligible patients were not prescribed statin therapy. Among those receiving a statin, mean time to GDSI was ≈2 years. The consequences of nonadherence to guidelines are illustrated by greater incident ASCVD and mortality events. Further research can develop and optimize health care system strategies for primary prevention.

### ACC / AHA release updated guideline on the treatment of… [^117PWpLb]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice The guideline emphasizes that lifestyle modification remains a critical component of ASCVD reduction. Four groups most likely to benefit from statin therapy are identified:

1. Patients with any form of clinical ASCVD
2. Patients with primary LDL-C levels of 190 mg per dL or greater 3. Patients with diabetes mellitus, 40 to 75 years of age, with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL
4. Patients without diabetes, 40 to 75 years of age, with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7. 5%. to 189 mg per dL but without clinical ASCVD; and persons without clinical ASCVD or diabetes who have LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% or greater. The guideline identifies high- and moderate-intensity statin therapy for use in primary and secondary prevention. Less evidence is available to support nonstatin therapy for ASCVD prevention.

The absolute risk reduction in ASCVD events associated with statin therapy can be estimated by multiplying the 10-year ASCVD risk by the anticipated relative risk reduction based on the intensity of the statin. The net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit is approximately the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with statin therapy vs. the number of potential excess adverse effects. PRIMARY PREVENTION IN PERSONS WITHOUT DIABETES AND WITH LDL-C LEVEL OF 70 TO 189 MG PER DL. The Pooled Cohort Equations should be used to estimate the 10-year ASCVD risk in persons without clinical ASCVD to guide initiation of statin therapy. In persons 40 to 75 years of age without clinical ASCVD or diabetes and with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% or greater, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be used. If the 10-year risk of ASCVD is 5% to less than 7. 5%, treatment with a moderate-intensity statin is reasonable.

Before initiating statin therapy, it is reasonable for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion about the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences.

Low risk definition and management thresholds: Individuals with 0 or 1 major ASCVD risk factors are generally at low risk for an ASCVD event (< 5% 10-year ASCVD event risk), quantitative risk scoring is not typically necessary, lifestyle therapies are primary, and consideration may be given to pharmacotherapy in those with non–HDL-C of 190 to 219 mg/dL (LDL-C of 160 to 189 mg/dL); information about additional risk indicators or subclinical disease should also be considered when making pharmacotherapy decisions.

Risk classification and lipid-lowering therapy by CAC — CAC scoring is used to guide the initiation and intensity of statin therapy. High intensity statin therapy is recommended in any patients with a CAC ≥ 300 or above the 75th percentile for age/gender/race, consistent with the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention Guidelines. Moderate to high intensity statin treatment is recommended for patients with CAC 100–299; for CAC 1–99, moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended for those with CAC percentile < 75% and moderate to high intensity for those with CAC percentile ≥ 75%. Patients with CAC = 0 are considered to be at lowest risk and statins are not uniformly recommended, with the exception of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.

### Guidelines impact cholesterol management [^117A4sQ4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous research demonstrates increased utilization of high-intensity statins, but unchanged low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, immediately after the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline release.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine achievement of statin therapy goals in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) before and up to 4 years after the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline release compared with LDL-C goals of < 70 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL previously recommended by other professional societies.

Methods

The single-system cohort study used medical records, laboratory results, and claims data (November 2012-October 2017) of adults with ≥ 1 claim for a statin, ≥ 1 ASCVD diagnosis in propensity score-matched analyses.

Results

Among 1938 patients (mean age 70 ± 11, 48% female) with ASCVD, the percentage on high-intensity statin therapy significantly increased over time: 24% in 2013, 34% 2014, 42% 2015, and 49% 2016 (P < .0001). The increase in high-intensity statin use was 13 to 22% higher among patients managed by subspecialists (cardiologist and endocrinologists) compared with those managed by primary care providers. Mean LDL-C level was slightly, but not significantly, lower in 2013 (80 mg/dL) than in other years: 85 mg/dL in 2014, 83 mg/dL in 2015, and 82 mg/dL in 2016. The proportion of patients reaching LDL-C goals ranged from 51% to 56% for the < 70 mg/dL target and 77% to 85% for the < 100 mg/dL target over time.

Conclusion

High-intensity statin use among secondary prevention patients increased significantly immediately after the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines release, primarily in those managed by subspecialists. However, the mean LDL-C and the proportion of patients reaching LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL remain unchanged across comparison cohorts.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117MxcDT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) primary prevention — statin therapy by age, diabetes status, and risk categories is specified as follows: For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), no risk assessment is performed and high-intensity statin (Class I) is used. For diabetes mellitus and age 40–75 y, moderate-intensity statin (Class I) is indicated, with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa). In adults age 40–75 y without diabetes mellitus, 10-year ASCVD risk percent begins risk discussion with categories of < 5% "Low Risk" with emphasis on lifestyle (Class I); 5%– < 7.5% "Borderline Risk", where if risk enhancers are present then discuss moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb); 7.5%– < 20% "Intermediate Risk", where risk enhancers favor statin and initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk", where initiating statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% is advised (Class I). For age > 75 y, clinical assessment and risk discussion are recommended, and for age 20–39 y clinicians estimate lifetime risk to encourage lifestyle and consider statin if family history of premature ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L).

### Lipid management beyond the guidelines [^116vPDwE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline builds on the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline statin recommendations to provide more detailed recommendations for the use of nonstatin therapy risk stratification for primary prevention statin use. New information has become available after the development of the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline that can further inform clinical practice. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type-9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies are now a reasonable or even good value following over 60% reductions in their acquisition price, and the identification of high risk patient groups most likely to benefit from further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. Meta-analyses and clinical trial data now show that patients with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl are more likely to experience progressively greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality and coronary heart disease events for progressively higher LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a highly concentrated form of modified EPA has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in high risk patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia on statin therapy. Comparisons with other statin guidelines revealed that statin initiation for those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is the most effective strategy for reducing the most ASCVD events for the proportion of the population treated. Data from younger populations finally became available for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring (mean age of 51 years) which confirmed the value of CAC > 0 for identifying individuals at increased ASCVD risk most likely to benefit from statin initiation. This analysis also found that statins could keep CAC = 0 in those with risk factors. Epidemiologic pooling studies now clearly show that LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in young adulthood confer excess risk for ASCVD later in life. Accumulating data support earlier risk factor intervention trials as the next research priority.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115o4LbU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) and CAC-guided risk refinement — An essential tenet of patient-centered imaging is that patients have a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of an imaging test in an SDM discussion, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline was the first guideline to strongly emphasize the importance of SDM before initiating statin therapy to discuss patient preferences, adverse effects, and the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits. Because of the issues with risk factor-based risk prediction, physicians may wish to refine treatment decisions based on CAC. The most widespread application is likely to be in the 10-year ASCVD 15–20% risk group in which CAC = 0 and a low CAC scores would largely refine risk downward to lowest or low strata. In the 10-year ASCVD 5–15% risk group, downward risk reclassification may be considered with 0 or low CAC scores. There is little role for risk reclassification in the 10-year ASCVD > 20% risk group, other than to provide persuasive confirmation of high risk in patients reluctant to take statins or to provide reassurance to those who are statin intolerant if they have 0 or low risk CAC. In the 10-year ASCVD < 5% risk group, a 0 or low CAC score would confirm low risk status and higher scores would identify those targeted for a greater intensity of lifestyle recommendations and treatment.

### Statins and primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention-what we know, where we need to Go, and… [^115keNEX]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated recommendations pertaining to statin therapy use for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. 1, 2 For statin efficacy, the recommendations were based on an extensive updated evidence review that included 22 randomized clinical trials was made that clinicians initiate statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40 to 75 years with at least 1 CVD risk factor and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk 10% or greater. These recommendations from the USPSTF1, 2 are sensible and practical. A few issues need further discussion.

First, these recommendations take a conservative approach with a B recommendation for adults aged 40 to 75 years with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or greater and a nuanced approach among those with 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% to 10%. For example, the 10-year hard ASCVD event rates in 3 trials of pure primary prevention showed benefits of statin therapy ranging from 5. 1% to
7. 6%. 4 Indeed, statin therapy shows efficacy at even lower 10-year ASCVD risk levels, and there is some indication that the relative benefits of statin therapy may be higher among individuals with lower 10-year ASCVD risk. 5 For most therapies, treating individuals with lower ASCVD risk comes at a price of treating a large number of individuals for a longer period of time.

With statin therapy, this strategy could still be considered by clinicians, given more than 40 years' worth of efficacy and safety data; excellent cost-effectiveness, even for individuals with 10-year ASCVD risk of at least 5%6; availability of statin therapy as a low-cost generic medication; and. Fourth, clinicians should consider titrating the intensity of therapy to the risk of the individual. Therefore, patients who belong to high-risk primary prevention groups may derive further benefit from the use of high-intensity statin therapy.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided risk in adults aged ≥ 75 years is characterized by MESA data and a shared decision-making approach: In the MESA study, CAC scores of 1–100, 101–300, and > 300 were noted in 30%, 20%, and 31% of individuals aged 75 years or older, with corresponding 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event rates of 14.3, 18.1, and 24.7%. Using a cut-off score of 100, approximately 50% of individuals older than 75 years will be identified as "high-risk". Prevalence of CAC ≥ 100 varies by sex and ethnicity. An age, sex, race-based CAC score ≥ 75th percentile may identify patients at high-risk of short-term ASCVD events, and in adults aged 76–80 years with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL with a CAC score of ≥ 100 or CAC ≥ 75th percentile, it may be reasonable to engage in shared decision making regarding initiation of statin therapy; the decision should incorporate patient values and preferences and consider competing health risks, functional/cognitive status, and life expectancy.

### Association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115rxdHG]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, statin therapy in general, and high-intensity statin therapy in particular, is underused in patients with established ASCVD.

Objective

To determine the association between all-cause mortality and intensity of statin therapy in the Veterans Affairs health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients aged 21 to 84 years with ASCVD treated in the Veterans Affairs health care system from April 1, 2013, to April 1, 2014. Patients who were included had 1 or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASCVD on 2 or more different dates in the prior 2 years.

Exposures

Intensity of statin therapy was defined by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and use was defined as a filled prescription in the prior 6 months. Patients were excluded if they were taking a higher statin dose in the prior 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death from all causes adjusted for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins.

Results

The study sample included 509 766 eligible adults with ASCVD at baseline (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years; 499 598 men and 10 168 women), including 150 928 (29.6%) receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232 293 (45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 33 920 (6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92 625 (18.2%) receiving no statins. During a mean follow-up of 492 days, there was a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality, with 1-year mortality rates of 4.0% (5103 of 126 139) for those receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 4.8% (9703 of 200 709) for those receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 5.7% (1632 of 28 765) for those receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 6.6% (4868 of 73 728) for those receiving no statin (P < .001). After adjusting for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins, the hazard ratio for mortality was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88–0.93) for those receiving high- vs moderate-intensity statins. The magnitude of benefit of high- vs moderate-intensity statins was similar, for an incident cohort hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.01). For patients aged 76 to 84 years, the hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87–0.95). Patients treated with maximal doses of high-intensity statins had lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94) compared with those receiving submaximal doses.

Conclusions and Relevance

We found a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in a national sample of patients with ASCVD. High-intensity statins were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with moderate-intensity statins, even among older adults. Maximal doses of high-intensity statins were associated with a further survival benefit.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### Department of veterans affairs (VA) and U.S. department of defense (DoD) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease risk reduction: putting evidence in context [^114xrQG4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) and incurs significant cost to the healthcare system. Management of cholesterol remains central for ASCVD prevention and has been the focus of multiple national guidelines. In this review, we compare the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Cholesterol guidelines. We review the evidence base that was used to generate recommendations focusing on 4 distinct themes: 1) the threshold of absolute 10-year ASCVD risk to start a clinician-patient discussion for the initiation of statin therapy in primary prevention patients; 2) the utility of coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician-patient risk discussion pertaining to the initiation of statin therapy for primary ASCVD prevention; 3) the use of moderate versus high-intensity statin therapy in patients with established ASCVD; and 4) the utility of ordering lipid panels after initiation or intensification of lipid lowering therapy to document efficacy and monitor adherence to lipid lowering therapy. We discuss why the VA/DoD and AHA/ACC may have reached different conclusions on these key issues.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Diabetes aged 40–75 years — statin response targets and nonstatin discussion: For patients aged 40–75 years with diabetes who have elevated 10-year ASCVD risk and high-risk features or diabetes-specific risk enhancers, use of high-intensity statin therapy (anticipated LDL-C reduction ≥ 50%) is supported. If response is achieved with ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitor. If high-intensity statin therapy results in < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication, and if no additional medication is pursued, it is reasonable to continue current therapy and monitoring.

### Statin use in older adults with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^117MHci7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Older adults (> 75years of age) represent two-thirds of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) deaths. The 2013 and 2018 American multi-society cholesterol guidelines recommend using at least moderate intensity statins for older adults with ASCVD. We examined annual trends and statin prescribing patterns in a multiethnic population of older adults with ASCVD.

Design

Retrospective longitudinal study using electronic health record (EHR) data from 2007 to 2018.

Setting

A large multi-specialty health system in Northern California.

Participants

A total of 24,651 adults older than 75years with ASCVD.

Measurements

Statin prescriptions for older adults with known ASCVD were trended over time. Multivariable regression models were used to identify predictors of statin prescription (logistic) after controlling for relevant demographic and clinical factors.

Results

The study cohort included 24,651 patients older than 75years; 48% were women. Although prescriptions for moderate/high intensity statins increased over time for adults over 75, fewer than half of the patients (45%) received moderate/high intensity statins in 2018. Women (odds ratio (OR) = 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74, 0.80), patients who had heart failure (OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.65, 0.74), those with dementia (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.82, 0.95) and patients who were underweight (OR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.73) were less likely to receive moderate/high intensity statins.

Conclusions

Despite increasing prescription rates between 2007 and 2018, guideline-recommended statins remained underused in older adults with ASCVD, with more pronounced disparities among women and those with certain comorbidities. Future studies are warranted to examine reasons for statin underuse in older adults with ASCVD.

CVD risk guided pathways for cancer patients and survivors — intermediate-risk pathway: for patients characterized as having intermediate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, the algorithm lists "CAC scan or available non-gated non-contrast CT scan if calculated ASCVD risk is uncertain", with the footnote that "If available, CAC scan is the preferred method to evaluate CAC quantitatively using the Agatston score in patients with Intermediate ASCVD risk", and that "Non-gated non-contrast CT scans for cancer imaging may be used for qualitative assessment of CAC-DRS risk categories and it should be part of a comprehensive CVD evaluation". Therapeutic options displayed under the CAC-DRS categories include "Moderate intensity statin" and "Moderate to high intensity statin and aspirin".

### Statin eligibility in primary prevention: from a risk-based strategy to a personalized approach based on the predicted benefit [^117PxV5a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines have recommended statin initiation based on the absolute cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that a strategy based on the predicted cardiovascular benefit, compared with the risk-based approach, modifies statin eligibility and the estimated benefit in a population in primary cardiovascular prevention. The study included 16,008 subjects (48 ± 6 years, 73% men) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 70 to < 190mg/dl, not on lipid-lowering drugs, who underwent a routine health screening in a single center. For the risk-based strategy, criterion for statin eligibility was defined as a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of ≥ 7.5%. In the benefit-based strategy, subjects were considered for statin according to the predicted absolute cardiovascular risk reduction, so that the number of statin candidates would be the same as in the risk-based strategy. The benefit-based strategy would replace 11% of statin candidates allocated in the risk-based approach with younger, lower risk subjects with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Using the benefit-based strategy, 13% of subjects with 5.0% to < 7.5% ASCVD risk would shift from a statin-ineligible to a statin-eligible status, whereas 24% of those with 7.5% to < 10.0% ASCVD risk would become statin ineligible. These effects would transfer the benefit from higher to lower risk subjects. In the entire population, no clinically meaningful change in the benefit would be expected. In conclusion, switching from a risk-based strategy to a benefit-based approach, while keeping the same rate of statin use in the population, is expected to promote substantial changes in statin eligibility in subjects at intermediate cardiovascular risk, modifying the subpopulation to be benefited by the treatment.
