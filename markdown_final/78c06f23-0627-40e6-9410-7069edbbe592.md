management of kleinfelter syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about life-course management of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and phenotype characterization. Then, I should verify the baseline multidomain evaluation, including endocrine, reproductive, neurocognitive, and comorbid conditions. Next, I will examine age-specific management: prenatal/neonatal, prepubertal, adolescent decisions around fertility preservation and testosterone, followed by adult protocols for testosterone replacement and fertility. After that, I should review psychosocial care, long-term comorbidity surveillance, and special populations such as transgender individuals and mosaics. Finally, I will summarize monitoring timelines, acknowledge evidence gaps, and emphasize shared decision-making across the lifespan.

> Let me first confirm how to establish the diagnosis and map phenotype severity. I need to check that conventional karyotyping on peripheral blood, ideally with at least 40 metaphases, remains the gold standard to confirm 47, XXY and detect mosaicism, and I should also verify the role of microarray and its limitations for low-level mosaicism detection; yes, karyotype confirms KS and mosaic variants and is the accepted reference standard, while microarray can support detection in many settings but may miss low-level mosaicism, so cytogenetics with adequate metaphase count is critical for definitive diagnosis and phenotype counseling [^113UPooE] [^117KJvos]. Wait, let me verify prenatal issues: NIPT has increased prenatal XXY identifications, but I should confirm that positive NIPT needs invasive confirmatory testing via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis because of false positives, which is correct and influences counseling around variable expressivity and early developmental surveillance planning [^117Hkody] [^117FthPZ]. I will now examine core phenotypic anchors: small testes usually under 5–6 mL in adults, gynecomastia, and variable virilization, noting that mosaic 46, XY/47, XXY often presents with milder phenotypes and better preserved gonadal function, which should be documented at baseline with careful anthropometry and genital exam [^114ZAPeG] [^115hPxgz].

> Hold on, I should verify the endocrine profile and avoid a common pitfall. Some secondary sources have occasionally described "hypogonadotropic hypogonadism" in KS, but that is not accurate for the typical phenotype; KS is classically a primary testicular failure with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, often preceded by a compensated phase where total testosterone can be low-normal with elevated LH, especially in early adulthood, so I must correct that misstatement if it appears in charts or notes [^114ZAPeG] [^1147PJWg]. Let me consider the baseline endocrine panel: total testosterone, LH, FSH, SHBG, and estradiol are essential, and I should be alert that 15–30% of adults may show normal total testosterone with elevated LH, signaling compensated hypogonadism, while adolescents typically progress through early puberty with near-normal testosterone before evolving to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism by mid-puberty, which aligns with longitudinal pediatric data [^114ZAPeG] [^1147PJWg].

> I will now examine the reproductive evaluation. I should confirm Tanner staging, Prader orchidometer for testicular volume, and, in post-pubertal patients, at least one semen analysis to identify rare ejaculated sperm since around 8% may have sperm present, which has major implications for immediate cryostorage discussions if desired [^notfound]. Wait a minute, I should double-check the expected gonadotropin trajectory: LH and FSH typically rise from early to mid-adolescence even when testosterone is still apparently adequate, which helps distinguish compensated from overt hypogonadism and guides timing for counseling about fertility and testosterone therapy [^1147PJWg].

> Next, I should review neurocognitive and psychological screening. Let me think about the range: language delay, executive dysfunction, ADHD symptoms, and autism spectrum traits are variably reported and can affect educational planning and quality of life, so screening with appropriate tools and early supports is prudent [^113Lxbnh] [^111N9DA3]. I need to ensure depression and anxiety are actively screened; prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms is high, approaching 69% in survey data, and perceived stigma and coping styles correlate with symptom burden, warranting routine screening and referral pathways in clinics [^116uTBQm]. Hold on, I should verify guidance gaps: scoping reviews highlight inconsistent pathways for mental health management, underscoring the value of integrated, multidisciplinary care and development of KS-specific PROMs to capture lived experience and track outcomes longitudinally [^111N9DA3] [^114cdezf].

> I will now examine comorbidity screening beyond reproduction. I should confirm increased venous thromboembolism risk in KS, which may be compounded by polycythemia under testosterone therapy, so a careful VTE history, risk mitigation, and proactive hematocrit monitoring during TRT are critical elements of safety surveillance [^1178BApW] [^111eTvWb]. Let me consider skeletal health: bone density deficits are common; DEXA at baseline and intervals, plus vitamin D and calcium optimization, should be incorporated into longitudinal care plans alongside lifestyle counseling for fracture prevention [^111N9DA3]. Wait, I should review autoimmune associations and GI considerations: signal reports link KS with autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis and eosinophilic esophagitis, so symptom-triggered screening and low thresholds for rheumatology or gastroenterology referrals are reasonable in the right clinical context [^112hwewY] [^113Qg4UA]. But wait, what if a testicular mass is suspected or incidentally found during mTESE? Rare tumors such as Leydig cell tumors have been reported; ultrasound and appropriate urologic oncology follow-up are indicated when abnormalities are detected [^112565XV].

> For prenatal and neonatal diagnoses, let me verify counseling priorities. Families need clear communication about variable expressivity and a proactive developmental surveillance schedule at approximately 9–15 months, 18–24 months, and 30–36 months, with early referral to speech and occupational therapy as indicated, which is facilitated by timely confirmatory testing after positive NIPT and coordinated pediatric follow-up [^117FthPZ] [^111PUMhC]. I should confirm that connecting families with support organizations and multidisciplinary clinics improves navigation and uptake of services during the early life-course, which can mitigate later academic and psychosocial impacts through earlier interventions [^111N9DA3].

> In prepubertal childhood, I need to ensure we avoid premature androgen exposure. Oxandrolone has been studied, and wait, let me verify the risk profile: a randomized trial shows significantly earlier gonadarche and pubarche — on average about two years earlier — with oxandrolone compared to placebo, without clear long-term gonadal benefit, so routine use should be avoided outside specific indications and research contexts [^1137o346]. I should confirm that the focus remains on developmental supports such as speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, and individualized educational adjustments, while also screening for cryptorchidism given higher association in KS and referring promptly to urology when indicated [^117ToYq5]. Let me consider psychosocial scaffolding: parents are often the primary supports in childhood; structured parent education and access to KS-specific resources can buffer stress and improve care coordination ahead of adolescence [^1144yN48].

> Adolescence represents a critical decision window for fertility and androgen management, so I should proceed carefully. First, on fertility preservation, I need to check that mTESE retrieval rates in adolescents can be as high as 70% at select centers but vary with age and do not consistently outperform adult retrieval rates around 43–50%, which challenges the notion that all adolescents should undergo TESE preemptively [^113PPr7Q] [^111qDeUi]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: postponing TESE to adulthood has not been shown to worsen outcomes, and adolescents may struggle to provide informed consent for abstract future fertility; I should emphasize risks including anesthesia, cost, emotional burden, and a potential prolonged testosterone decline after TESE that may last 12 months or more in some reports when counseling families [^112pNFQF]. Let me verify a pragmatic algorithm: if a mature adolescent (> 15 years) has adequate support and prioritizes fertility, TESE can be offered after thorough counseling; if early adolescent or uncertain, prioritize semen analysis and cryopreservation if sperm is present and defer TESE; and if testosterone therapy is urgently indicated, undertake TESE before initiating exogenous testosterone because of spermatogenesis suppression risk, documenting the counseling process carefully [^113PPr7Q] [^111qDeUi].

> Now, on adolescent testosterone therapy, I should confirm that reflexive initiation is not appropriate. Many adolescents with KS maintain normal testosterone through early puberty with rising gonadotropins, consistent with compensated hypogonadism; therefore, the threshold for treatment should be clinical hypogonadism symptoms with low testosterone and elevated gonadotropins, or significant psychosocial distress from delayed virilization after shared decision-making, rather than karyotype alone [^1147PJWg]. Wait, I should verify concerns about germ cell dynamics: exogenous testosterone may further suppress residual spermatogenesis; some literature advocates early hormonal therapy, but high-quality evidence linking early testosterone to improved fertility is lacking, so I should avoid overstating benefits and prioritize fertility preservation before starting testosterone when fertility is a priority [^112vF4g9] [^111qDeUi]. I need to check safety and adherence patterns: topical preparations are generally well tolerated in teens with good biochemical responses when used, but longitudinal fertility effects remain uncertain, reinforcing careful monitoring and re-evaluation of goals over time [^112t1acp].

> For adolescent monitoring, I should double-check cadence and content. Semiannual clinical and laboratory follow-up to track virilization, testicular volume (often progressively declining), gonadotropins, testosterone, mood and school functioning, and to revisit fertility preservation discussions is a prudent framework that balances endocrine, reproductive, and psychosocial domains during this dynamic period [^113PPr7Q] [^111N9DA3]. Let me reconsider transition planning: early engagement with adult services and multidisciplinary teams can minimize care gaps and consolidate decisions about fertility and testosterone as autonomy increases [^111N9DA3].

> In adult care, I will now examine testosterone replacement therapy indications, formulations, and monitoring. I should confirm initiation for symptomatic hypogonadism with persistently low testosterone, or compensated hypogonadism with significant symptoms after shared decision-making, setting clear expectations that TRT improves androgen deficiency symptoms but does not improve fertility and typically suppresses spermatogenesis, which must be documented in counseling [^115hPxgz]. Let me verify formulation patterns: topical gels are commonly used with high adherence in adolescent cohorts and are similarly practical for adults; alternatives include injectables and pellets, with choice individualized to patient preference, absorption, and safety profile [^112t1acp]. I need to ensure safety monitoring at 3 months and then every 6–12 months, including testosterone trough levels, hematocrit to mitigate polycythemia, PSA where age-appropriate, and periodic bone and metabolic assessments, especially given cardiometabolic risks and VTE concerns in KS and under TRT [^111N9DA3] [^111eTvWb].

> For adult fertility management, I should confirm a simple, patient-centered algorithm. If ejaculated sperm are present, immediate cryopreservation is advisable given the risk of future azoospermia; if azoospermic, microsurgical TESE followed by ICSI yields sperm retrieval around 43–50% at experienced centers, with robust counseling about probabilities and burdens before proceeding [^113PPr7Q] [^115hPxgz]. Hold on, I should verify what to do if the patient is already on TRT: withhold testosterone for 3–6 months to reduce suppression and then attempt TESE, proceeding to cryopreservation of any sperm retrieved before resuming TRT based on symptoms and shared goals [^113PPr7Q]. If TESE fails, I should discuss alternatives such as donor sperm or adoption, ensuring psychological support around grief, identity, and relationship impacts [^111N9DA3].

> I need to check that psychological care remains an essential pillar throughout. Elevated rates of depressive symptoms, perceived stigma, and fertility-related distress argue for routine screening, integrated mental health services, and access to peer support groups, which can measurably improve coping and quality of life across adolescence and adulthood [^116uTBQm] [^112A1rQV]. Let me consider gender identity considerations: qualitative data suggest some men with KS may question gender identity more than peers; clinicians should open space for discussion without assumptions, coordinating with experienced behavioral health and, where applicable, gender services in a non-stigmatizing, patient-led manner [^11282qrB] [^115Q1ST5].

> I will now examine long-term comorbidity management. Cardiovascular risk factor screening, bone health surveillance with periodic DEXA, breast cancer awareness including clinical exams, and metabolic screening for diabetes and insulin resistance should be embedded in annual care plans, tailored to individual risk and TRT exposure, with prompt action on polycythemia if hematocrit exceeds accepted thresholds by adjusting TRT or addressing contributory factors [^111N9DA3] [^1178BApW]. Wait, I should verify that patient education covers self-exams and timely reporting of new breast or testicular changes, considering the small but real neoplasia risks described in KS cohorts and case series, especially under hormonal therapies [^115hPxgz].

> Let me think about genetic counseling for offspring when using ART. I should confirm that KS sperm exhibit higher rates of sex chromosomal and autosomal aneuploidy than controls, prompting a discussion of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A) and, alternatively or additionally, prenatal diagnostic testing, with explicit documentation of counseling around residual risks and ethical preferences of the couple [^116eguqf] [^115hPxgz].

> Special populations require additional nuance. I should confirm that transgender individuals presumed male at birth have a higher observed prevalence of KS in karyotyped cohorts around 0.88–1.02%, and that fertility counseling should occur before starting feminizing gender-affirming hormones, mirroring the counsel to complete sperm harvest prior to testosterone therapy in cisgender KS males, given the shared concerns about suppression of spermatogenesis and VTE risks [^117DamJp] [^11344Asi]. Hold on, I should verify the care priorities: address azoospermia counseling, baseline VTE and bone health assessment, and breast screening considerations in the context of individualized gender-affirming regimens and risk profiles, with multidisciplinary coordination between endocrinology, reproductive urology, and gender services [^117GVK44] [^116F85GS].

> For mosaic KS, I need to ensure the plan reflects milder phenotypes and a relatively higher chance of spontaneous fertility, with individualized surveillance intensity based on testicular function and patient goals, while acknowledging that germ cell loss still progresses, albeit sometimes more slowly than in non-mosaic XXY [^114ZAPeG]. For high-grade aneuploidies like 48, XXXY, I should confirm that more severe neurodevelopmental and endocrine phenotypes are expected, justifying earlier and more intensive multidisciplinary interventions than in classical XXY, with careful cardiac and gonadal imaging and endocrine evaluation per standardized protocols where available [^113UPooE] [^117KJvos].

> Quality of life and care coordination must be integrated, not appended. Let me verify socioeconomic impacts: men with KS report lower educational attainment, income, and both mental and physical quality of life, suggesting benefits from vocational counseling, disability and insurance navigation, and structured transition programs to adult services to mitigate attrition and under-treatment [^114sws9Z]. I should confirm that peer support and family or partner engagement reduce isolation and support adherence, and that developing KS-specific PROMs would better capture outcomes that matter to patients and guide iterative care planning across the lifespan [^115ovxZt] [^114cdezf].

> I should double-check a concise monitoring cadence across ages to operationalize this. In early childhood (0–4 years), developmental surveillance approximately every six months is reasonable; during school years (5–12 years), annual review focusing on educational supports and avoidance of early androgens is prudent; in adolescence (13–18 years), semiannual visits to monitor puberty, endocrine status, mental health, and revisit fertility preservation are important; in early to mid-adulthood (19–40 years), annual endocrine, fertility, and comorbidity screening is typical; and in later adulthood (> 40 years), annual cancer surveillance and cardiovascular risk management should be emphasized, with intervals individualized by risk [^111N9DA3].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and calibrate recommendations to uncertainty. Much of the literature in key decision areas such as the timing of TESE and long-term effects of adolescent testosterone is low credibility, with few prospective or randomized data; thus, I should explicitly frame counseling using ranges and acknowledge uncertainty, employ shared decision-making repeatedly as values evolve, and document decisional capacity and preferences, especially in adolescents [^1157yU5i] [^112pNFQF]. Let me reconsider the fertility message: while adolescent sperm retrieval can be successful in select patients, there is no compelling evidence that deferring to adulthood harms outcomes on average, so the default should be individualized, not automatic intervention, with yearly re-assessment and flexible planning [^111qDeUi] [^112pNFQF].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure this is a life-course, multidisciplinary plan that avoids a one-size-fits-all approach. Early diagnosis and proactive developmental supports, judicious and symptom-driven testosterone therapy with fertility-first counseling, structured surveillance for cardiometabolic, skeletal, and oncologic risks, integrated mental health and social supports, and tailored pathways for special populations together define best practice today while we await stronger evidence from registries and prospective studies to refine timing and selection of interventions across the lifespan [^111N9DA3] [^115Q1ST5] [^1157yU5i].

Management of Klinefelter syndrome centers on **testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)** [^114ZAPeG] to address hypogonadism, typically initiated in mid-to-late puberty [^112t1acp] and continued lifelong to maintain adult male testosterone levels. Fertility preservation should be discussed early; if sperm are present, **cryopreservation** [^111qDeUi] is considered, and **testicular sperm extraction (TESE)** with **intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)** [^115hPxgz] is offered when needed [^113PPr7Q]. Management also includes regular monitoring and treatment of metabolic, cardiovascular, and bone health risks, as well as psychological and neurocognitive support [^1157yU5i]. A multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinology, urology, fertility, psychology, and primary care is essential for comprehensive care [^111N9DA3].

## Hormonal management

### Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)

- **Indication**: TRT is indicated for hypogonadism [^114ZAPeG], typically initiated in mid-to-late puberty (Tanner stage 3–4) [^112t1acp] and continued lifelong to maintain adult male testosterone levels.

- **Benefits**: TRT improves secondary sexual characteristics, muscle mass, bone density, mood, energy, and sexual function.

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of testosterone levels, hematocrit, lipid profile, liver function, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is recommended.

---

## Fertility management

### Fertility preservation and assisted reproductive techniques

- **Early counseling**: Early discussion of fertility preservation is essential [^113PPr7Q], as spermatogenesis declines rapidly after puberty.

- **Sperm cryopreservation**: If sperm are present in ejaculate, cryopreservation is recommended [^113PPr7Q] before initiating TRT.

- **Testicular sperm extraction (TESE)**: TESE combined with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is the standard approach [^115hPxgz] for azoospermic patients, with sperm retrieval rates of 40–70% [^113PPr7Q].

- **Timing**: TESE can be performed in adolescence or adulthood [^112pNFQF], with no clear advantage to early adolescence.

---

## Management of comorbidities

### Metabolic and cardiovascular health

Metabolic and cardiovascular health should be addressed through **regular screening** for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^1157yU5i]. Management emphasizes **lifestyle measures** — including diet, exercise, and weight management — and pharmacological treatment of identified metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors as indicated [^117Hkody].

---

### Bone health

Bone health management includes periodic dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (**DEXA**) to assess bone mineral density [^1157yU5i]. **Calcium and vitamin D supplementation** is recommended to prevent osteoporosis; bisphosphonates are considered for significant osteoporosis.

---

### Psychological and neurocognitive support

Psychological and neurocognitive support involves regular **neuropsychological assessment** for cognitive, language, and learning difficulties [^116uTBQm]. **Counseling and support groups** address anxiety, depression, and social challenges [^114sws9Z]; individualized educational plans and speech therapy are provided as needed.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

- **Endocrinologist**: Hormonal management and monitoring [^111N9DA3].

- **Urologist/andrologist**: Fertility preservation and reproductive health [^1157yU5i].

- **Fertility specialist**: Assisted reproductive techniques [^115hPxgz].

- **Psychologist/psychiatrist**: Mental health support [^116uTBQm].

- **Primary care physician**: Coordination of care and management of comorbidities [^117Hkody].

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies and research directions include **investigational gene therapy** approaches targeting the genetic mechanisms underlying Klinefelter syndrome. Studies are evaluating novel hormonal strategies, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors [^113PPr7Q], and **personalized medicine** efforts to tailor treatment to individual genetic and phenotypic profiles [^114cdezf].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education and support prioritize providing comprehensive information on Klinefelter syndrome, available treatment options, and potential complications [^111N9DA3]. Participation in **support groups** is encouraged for emotional and social support [^115ovxZt], and **genetic counseling** is essential for patients and families to understand genetic implications and reproductive options [^115hPxgz].

---

Management of Klinefelter syndrome requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach [^1157yU5i] that incorporates **TRT as the cornerstone** of hormonal management, early fertility preservation, and regular monitoring of comorbidities. Psychological support and patient education are essential for improving quality of life [^114sws9Z].

### Fertility considerations in adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: Current practice patterns [^111qDeUi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Damani et al. demonstrated the feasibility of TESE in adolescent males with KS and wondered whether TESE should be considered in the adolescent KS as a means to optimize success rates and preserve biological paternity potential. However, since then, many studies have shown that sperm retrieval rates in early adolescents are not as high as in older adolescents, which are, in turn, equivalent to those in adults (~50%). Therefore, the literature does not support the mandatory need for TESE in adolescents compared with simply waiting until the patient and his partner are desirous of conception. However, as can be seen by the survey results, this strategy is still seen as advantageous by some providers.

The clinical value the KS adolescent derives from testosterone treatment and the need for such therapy is based upon the notion that testosterone levels, which are typically normal or low normal in late puberty, decrease rapidly after puberty, and that the KS male will eventually need testosterone replacement. However, the testosterone levels in the majority of adolescents with KS remain relatively stable into early adulthood. Therefore, there is no need for reflex replacement in all men with KS. Since testosterone treatment would be expected to suppress whatever endogenous testosterone production and whatever minimal level of spermatogenesis might be present, harvesting and cryopreservation of sperm prior to starting testosterone replacement is indicated. However, there may be no need for TESE if there is no need for testosterone therapy, as seen by the survey results.

### A clinical algorithm for management of fertility in adolescents with the Klinefelter syndrome [^113PPr7Q]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The review presents a clinical algorithm for the evaluation and treatment for adolescents with Klinefelter's syndrome who desire fertility preservation.

Sperm is present in the ejaculate in around 8% of men with Klinefelter's syndrome. Although most are severely oligospermic/azoospermic, 43–45% of men will have sperm found during a testicular sperm extraction, reaching up to 70% in adolescents.

Klinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY) causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and severe oligospermia/azoospermia, rendering natural conception rare. During puberty, boys often require testosterone replacement therapy to develop secondary sexual characteristics, which can further decrease spermatogenesis. There is a progressive decrease of testicular germ cells after the onset of puberty, suggesting that fertility evaluation and preservation should begin shortly thereafter.

In adolescents desiring fertility evaluation, any testosterone therapy should be discontinued, hormones and gonadotrophins measured, and a semen analysis obtained. Adolescents with low testosterone are administered aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and/or human chorionic gonadotropin to increase endogenous testosterone production. After testosterone levels are normalized, semen analysis is performed, and cryopreservation is encouraged if sperm is present. For those without sperm in the ejaculate, a testicular sperm extraction is offered.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^114ZAPeG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common congenital cause of primary male hypogonadism. Individuals with the classical phenotype (XXY) typically exhibit diminished testicular size and function, as well as impaired spermatogenesis, although this presentation varies, especially in cases of mosaicism. Testicular dysfunction results from progressive gonadal failure, characterized by tubular atrophy, sclerosis, and maturation arrest, leading to fibrosis and hyalinized tissue due to germ and Sertoli cell loss. Histological examination reveals apparent Leydig cell hyperplasia due to the loss of virtually all Sertoli cells, as well as interstitial tissue proliferation. Testicular volume in KS patients rarely exceeds 5 to 6 mL, with degeneration becoming most apparent at the cusp of puberty, when testicular function and architecture begin to decline.

Testosterone levels vary considerably, particularly in younger individuals and those with mosaicism (46, XY/47, XXY). While most men with KS have subnormal total testosterone levels, approximately 20% to 30% maintain total testosterone within the low-normal range, particularly in milder cases or mosaic forms. Elevated luteinizing hormone is observed in more than 80% of adult KS patients, even in patients with normal or low total testosterone levels, indicating compensated hypogonadism. One study investigating different forms of hypogonadism in men with KS found 15.6% had normal total testosterone values at presentation, 51.4% had compensated hypogonadism, and 33% had primary hypogonadism.

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome [^112t1acp]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

We investigated the safety and tolerability of testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome. We reviewed the medical records of all consecutive adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome evaluated between 2007 and 2012. Patients receiving testosterone replacement and aromatase inhibitor therapy were identified. Data on demographics, physical characteristics, medical history, and serum hormone concentrations were collected for each patient. We evaluated longitudinal changes in serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone as well as changes in body mass index after the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy.

We identified 151 adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome. The mean age at presentation was 11.6 years. Testosterone replacement therapy and aromatase inhibitors were initiated in 110 and 75 patients, respectively, at an average age of 13 to 14 years. Topical testosterone replacement therapy was used in 95% of patients with good clinical efficacy and compliance based on serial serum testosterone values. After the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy, average serum testosterone improved from 240 to 650 ng/ml. Serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone increased with the progression of puberty from 2.6 to 16.6 and 7 to 42 mIU/ml, respectively. No adverse outcomes related to testosterone replacement therapy were reported.

Hormone supplementation with testosterone and aromatase inhibitors in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome appears to be effective and well-tolerated.

Thematic synthesis

- **Diagnosis**: The consensus for diagnosing KS in suspected patients is to use microarray or karyotyping analysis. These methods are the gold standard for confirming KS, as they directly detect chromosomal anomalies. More severe chromosomal aneuploidies (XXXY or greater) are typically linked to worse phenotypic outcomes. However, despite the availability of these diagnostic tools, the average diagnosis age remains notably late, around 25 years. This delay is partly due to the lack of widespread implementation of newborn screening or noninvasive prenatal screening, which could potentially improve early detection rates. The limited early screening methods likely contribute to the lack of timely diagnosis. It is plausible that only the most severely affected boys are diagnosed early when symptoms related to speech, language, and associated psychosocial challenges prompt further investigation. In approximately 75% of cases, diagnosis does not become evident until later in life, typically due to infertility.

Empirical studies have shown that adult patients with KS exhibit significantly greater autism spectrum disease symptoms and various adverse behavioural traits (depression, anxiety, social exclusion, communication skills, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) compared to HCs. Research completed on a US military veteran population found that clinical diagnosis of KS, even if delayed, was associated with reduced medical morbidity. This is speculated to be due to increased hospital appointments managing various comorbidities.

### Epigenetics in Turner syndrome [^11414QoL]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Both Turner syndrome (TS) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are associated with several clinical features that exhibit a wide range of inter-individual expressivity, and their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Understanding the effect of the loss (45, X) and gain (47, XXY) of the X chromosome on gene transcription, and its correlation to their variable clinical phenotypes, would be very beneficial.

Systematic studies comparing genome-wide expression and epigenetic modifications of sex chromosome aneuploidies, such as 45, X versus 47, XXY, could provide insight into the mechanisms involved in their pathophysiology. Several studies have focused exclusively on one condition or the other, often analyzing a limited number of samples from a single tissue type (e.g. schizophrenic brain, testis, whole blood, fibroblast, or amniotic fluid). At the time of writing, this issue had been addressed in both populations only by Sharma et al, who demonstrated that the loss of an X chromosome has a much more profound consequence than the gain of an additional X chromosome, as about five times more loci are affected in TS than in KS subjects. Additionally, when only autosomal CpG sites were analyzed, approximately 80% of the modifications in TS individuals represented hypomethylation of these loci, whereas KS individuals displayed nearly equal numbers of hypo- and hypermethylated CpG sites. Therefore, gene ontology analysis and the etiopathogenesis in both conditions may be completely different.

### Mere coincidence or an association? Case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome [^112hwewY]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Our case raises several questions regarding JIA in patients with KS. Our knowledge is largely based on studies on autoimmune disorders in adults with KS. While RA is known to be associated with KS, there is limited literature on the concurrence of JIA and KS to reliably infer any association or causal relationship. We have yet to decipher how the biological environment of KS might contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of JIA. Testosterone treatment for KS has demonstrated improved outcome in acute RA flares. The effect of hormone replacement therapy remains to be explored in our patient. Given the rarity of its concurrence, additional studies are required to understand any association between KS and JIA.

### A patient with Klinefelter's syndrome and thalassemia intermedia [^116oMSxP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features, such as tall stature, eunuchoid proportions, testes disproportionately small for the level of pubertal development, gynecomastia, and behavioral problems. The association of KS with thalassemia intermedia has not been previously reported. A male patient with thalassemia intermedia was diagnosed with KS at the age of 14 years when endocrine evaluation for delayed puberty showed hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Thyroid function was normal; however, basal and GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin concentrations were raised while serum testosterone was low. Karyotype analysis revealed KS (47, XXY). Testosterone replacement therapy started soon after diagnosis, and now at the age of 20 years, the patient's height is 178.3 cm, with a U/L ratio of 0.91. Testicular volume is 12 mL (Prader orchidometer), and his pubic hair is stage 4. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient suffering from KS and thalassemia intermedia reported in the literature.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^1144yN48]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

While the actual content of what was disclosed varied, the act of disclosing one's diagnosis of KS to others in their trusted support system generally provided relief. This is consistent with earlier research, which has shown that the versions of disclosure, specifically the amount of details shared, can vary depending on the closeness of the person being disclosed to.

The present study found that one factor that may affect what information is shared with an individual is the role that individual plays in the participant's support system. Participants identified romantic partners as being the most likely to be affected by KS due to the associated infertility and consequently disclosed their diagnosis to their romantic partners, thereby integrating them into their support system for coping with challenges related to KS. Prior research has shown that AYA with DSDs felt like their infertility had a significant impact on their relationships, with some even feeling as though they had already disappointed their future partners. However, those feelings were not shared by AYA with KS in the present study. Rather, participants did not largely feel as though it has a significant impact on their romantic partners, viewing it instead as a potential future scenario perhaps due to participants' younger ages.

In addition to romantic partners, many participants indicated that their parents play an important role in their support system, with their main role being assisting with medical aspects.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117DamJp]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review to determine the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in trans and gender-diverse individuals presumed male at birth, and to identify the clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome that may result in treatment considerations in trans people undergoing feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy. We found a 0.88% prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome, which is higher than previous analyses in the general population. Expected clinical and biochemical features of Klinefelter syndrome were reported. Azoospermia and venous thromboembolism were reported in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome before the commencement of feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy and represent unique considerations for trans individuals with Klinefelter syndrome.

### Fertility considerations in adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: Current practice patterns [^112pNFQF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is not without some downsides; it is a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia, imposes a financial and emotional burden, and may be associated with a decrease in circulating testosterone levels that could persist for 12 or more months after the procedure. Furthermore, it is often difficult for an adolescent boy to make an informed decision about future fertility, which may appear abstract at that age.

The adult with Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) and his partner may be in a substantially better position to take into account the intensity of their desire to have a child, the success rates of TESE and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and the financial and emotional burdens of a surgical procedure on the patient and that of the treatment cycle to harvest oocytes from his partner. Thus, there is no compelling reason that TESE has to be performed during adolescence, and no definitive evidence suggests that postponing the procedure to early adulthood worsens outcomes.

However, it should be recognized that the choices made by men with KS and their partners and families are influenced by many factors, including important non-medical considerations. These include the natural longing of men and women to have children, complex social and cultural pressures, and the financial and emotional burden associated with these procedures. Furthermore, individual patients with KS and their partners may weigh the trade-offs between the probability of successful treatment outcomes (approximately 16%) and the risks and costs associated with TESE and ICSI differently depending upon their unique life situations. Ultimately, such complex life decisions require careful consideration.

### Prevalence and psychosocial correlates of depressive symptoms among adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome [^116uTBQm]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of depressive symptoms among adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome, a study was conducted involving individuals aged 14–75 years (n = 310) with self-reported Klinefelter syndrome. Participants were recruited from regional and national support networks to complete a web-based survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Additionally, perceived consequences were measured by the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, perceived stigma by the Perceived Social Stigmatization Scale, and coping strategies by the Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised. These factors were evaluated as correlates of depressive symptoms.

Overall, 68.8% of participants reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, indicated by a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ≥ 16. The study found significant associations between depressive symptoms and the use of emotion-focused coping strategies (P < 0.01), perceptions of stigmatization (P < 0.01), perceived negative consequences of Klinefelter syndrome (P < 0.01), and the importance placed on having children in the future (P < 0.05).

The findings suggest that individuals with Klinefelter syndrome may be at increased risk for depression. Therefore, routine screening for depressive symptoms and appropriate referral and evaluation are recommended.

### Are adolescent boys with Klinefelter syndrome androgen deficient? A longitudinal study of Finnish 47, XXY boys [^1147PJWg]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Testosterone (T) substitution therapy is widely used in adult patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) to prevent symptoms and sequels of androgen deficiency, but it is currently unknown if adolescent boys with KS benefit from early T therapy. To evaluate the optimal age to start T substitution, we searched for signs of androgen deficiency in pubertal boys with KS. Fourteen nonmosaic 47, XXY boys, aged 10–13.9 years, were followed up for 4–37 months with staging of puberty and frequent reproductive hormone measurements. Furthermore, indices reflecting androgen action (serum SHBG, leptin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels) were studied.

- **Puberty progression and hormone levels**: Both onset and progression of puberty according to Tanner stages were normal in boys with KS. Consistently, serum T concentrations increased as expected and remained normal throughout follow-up. Changes in the indices of androgen action, such as decreases in serum SHBG and leptin and an increase in serum PSA concentrations, occurred normally, except that average leptin levels were higher in the boys with KS (KS boys 11.8 ± 7.0 µg/L; controls 7.6 ± 4.7 µg/L; p = 0.033).

- **Gonadotropin levels**: Despite normal T concentrations, KS boys displayed elevated serum FSH and LH levels from the age of 13 years, and exaggerated gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone. These data do not demonstrate an unequivocal androgen deficiency in adolescent boys with KS that would necessitate androgen supplementation therapy during early puberty.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^111jTgM7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Identifying and effectively using care pathways for psychiatric comorbidities may improve patient outcomes. Martin et al. explored an innovative neurocognitive-behavioral treatment program designed to address specific vulnerabilities associated with KS. The new social management guideline focused on addressing executive dysfunction and tailoring interventions to behavioral and cognitive characteristics specific to KS. When used, this was shown to be a promising and effective approach for enhancing self-control and social adaptation.

The identified guidelines emphasize the importance of psychological intervention when there are clinical concerns; however, there is limited guidance on assessing the psychiatric profile of patients with KS. As a result, psychiatric and HR-QoL issues for patients with KS may not be adequately addressed. This could be attributed to a multitude of factors, such as limited clinical consultation time, lack of awareness about the condition, and a shortage of psychiatric guidelines for treating mental health in KS.

Klinefelter syndrome can negatively affect HR-QoL at all stages of life. Clinicians and guidelines should focus on interventions to minimize impairments. Although there is no apparent phenotype or distinct developmental profile for children with KS, research shows several areas that experience developmental delays, such as speech, motor skills, language, cognitive function, behaviors (including social behaviors), testicular development/function, and growth. However, these findings represent only a small percentage of cases.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^116LkqbK]. Clinical endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were used in the development of this systematic review. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42021227916.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies that used karyotyping to determine the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in cohorts of trans individuals presumed male at birth were included in this review. To assess clinical features, we included case series and case reports of trans individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. Only publications in peer-reviewed journals and in the English language were eligible for inclusion.

- **Information sources and search strategy**: A literature search was conducted on EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The reference lists of retrieved studies were assessed for further relevant publications. A search strategy was developed from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text words related to Klinefelter syndrome and trans people from inception up to 31 December 2021. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy. Covidence was used to exclude duplicates, and predetermined selection criteria were used to assess eligibility. This was defined as (1) Klinefelter syndrome based on karyotype analysis, (2) trans individuals, (3) all study types including case reports were eligible for inclusion, and (4) published in a peer-reviewed journal.

### It's not all about the testes: Medical issues in Klinefelter patients [^1178BApW]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Important medical conditions associated with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are categorized as follows:

1. **Motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction**. These dysfunctions impact various aspects of the patient's life.

2. **Tumors**. The presence of tumors is a noted complication in KS patients.

3. **Vascular disease**. This includes issues related to the cardiovascular system.

4. **Endocrine/metabolic and autoimmune diseases**. These conditions affect the hormonal and immune systems.

Earlier diagnosis of KS may lead to earlier intervention with effective treatment.

### A qualitative exploration of experiences of gender identity and gender questioning among adults with Klinefelter syndrome/XXY [^11282qrB]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was conducted from a phenomenological perspective, using data generated by individual semi‐structured interviews. The data were analyzed using experiential reflexive thematic analysis, which is concerned with exploring the truth or truths of participants' contextually situated experiences, perspectives, and behaviors. The Singular Framework for Methodological Integrity (Levitt et al.) and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (Tong et al.) were followed to ensure fidelity and utility. The study protocol was approved by the University of Derby Research Ethics Committee (Reference ETH2122‐1547).

- **Participants**: The participants were adults with KS/XXY. The inclusion criteria included having a confirmed diagnosis of KS/XXY, being 18 years or older, and being able to give informed consent. The exclusion criterion was having a known psychological condition that could put participants at risk of psychological distress. Participants were recruited via the Klinefelter's Syndrome Association, the XXY Project, and various KS/XXY Facebook support groups.

### Should we be offering fertility preservation by surgical sperm retrieval to men with Klinefelter syndrome [^111qzpgJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in surgical sperm retrieval have greatly increased the chances of men with Klinefelter syndrome achieving biological paternity. Despite this, the vast majority of attempts to achieve fertility by using extracted gametes to fertilize eggs in vitro do not result in viable pregnancies. A powerful obstacle to success lies with the natural history of seminiferous tubule and germ cell function in Klinefelter syndrome, which typically peak and thereafter steeply decline up to a decade before most individuals would be contemplating paternity. Herein we discuss, in relation to a real clinical case, both the exciting technical advances in surgical sperm retrieval and the logistic and ethical factors that, in practice, may act to limit their successful application.

### Klinefelter syndrome: Expanding the phenotype and identifying new research directions [^117TLvab]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to summarize new data on the etiology and clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome to derive research priorities.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted using critical reviews of selective topics, emphasizing less well-recognized clinical findings.

- **Results and conclusions**: The phenotype of the prototypic 47, XXY case is well recognized, featuring seminiferous tubule dysgenesis as well as androgen deficiency. Less well appreciated is the varied expressivity of 47, XXY Klinefelter syndrome, particularly neurological and cognitive perturbations like language and behavioral problems. Effective therapies are available. Reproductive technologies allow 47, XXY men to sire offspring through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); however, genetic counseling is complex and success is low. Behavioral and expressive language difficulties are amenable to treatment with androgen therapy and psychological help. Early treatment may be imperative for an optimal outcome.

### State-wide increase in prenatal diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome on amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling: Impact of non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome conditions [^117FthPZ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Low credibility.

Using a population-based data collection with full capture of amniocentesis and CVS procedures, we show an unprecedented rise in the prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA) since 2016, predominantly driven by the detection of 47, XXY via non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). While NIPT became available on a self-funded basis in late 2012, there was no statistically significant increase in the prenatal detection of SCA prior to 2016. The subsequent increase likely reflects the rapid uptake of NIPT after this time, including screening for SCAs.

Traditionally, only children with SCAs on the more severe end of the spectrum present with clinical features at birth or indeed for medical care at any time across the life course, with up to 75% of males with 47, XXY remaining undetected. Although the clinical phenotype cannot be predicted on the basis of chromosomal findings alone, there is evidence that early detection can be beneficial. Prospective studies of infants with 47, XXY diagnosed by newborn screening identify speech-language delays in 75% and motor skill delays in 50%; early identification and intervention for these infants results in improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is currently recommended that children with a diagnosis of 47, XXY undergo comprehensive developmental assessments at 9–15 months, 18–24 months, and 30–36 months, which can only be facilitated by antenatal or perinatal diagnosis. Antenatal detection also affords the opportunity to actively screen for, and address, somatic outcomes such as the evolution of hypogonadism (pre- and post-puberty) and osteoporosis.

### Successful thrombolysis of normotensive pulmonary embolism with life-threatening hypoxia in a young man with Klinefelter syndrome [^111eTvWb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Our patient had multiple risk factors for VTE. KS is known to increase the risk of VTE. He had a family history of unprovoked DVT, although the thrombophilia screening for both him and his father could not identify a hereditary cause. His polycythaemia could have predisposed him to VTE and was likely multifactorial from hypoxia, dehydration, and testosterone therapy. The fact that he tolerated an SPO2 down to 74% in the community was remarkable, and we postulate that the secondary polycythaemic response may have allowed him to tolerate such severe hypoxia. Although he was not hypotensive, severe hypoxic respiratory failure with signs of right ventricular strain prompted the decision for thrombolysis.

Guidance for PE thrombolysis mostly depends on failed haemodynamics and suggests close monitoring and consideration of rescue thrombolysis for cases like our patient. Several researchers have highlighted the need for thrombolysis in severe hypoxic respiratory failure with preserved haemodynamics. Percutaneous catheter-directed therapy is currently recommended for haemodynamically unstable PE with contraindications for thrombolysis. As our patient did not have any contraindications for thrombolysis, this was not considered. Our patient clearly improved with thrombolysis, with normalisation of his oxygenation from SPO2 of 74% to 100% within hours, and his full recovery without any evidence of pulmonary hypertension speaks to the dramatic improvement achieved with this therapy. Polycythaemia is one of the most common side effects of testosterone therapy.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^115ovxZt]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 47, XXY) is the most common chromosomal aneuploidy, affecting approximately 1 in 600 male births. Due to recent technological advances, KS is diagnosed more often in young individuals. This emerging population of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with KS seeking care makes it increasingly important to understand the unique experiences and perspectives of these individuals. This qualitative study explored the psychosocial well-being of AYA with KS and the resources and support systems AYA with KS utilize to cope with challenges related to their diagnosis.

The study included 13 participants aged 14–23 (mean age 16 years) who completed semi-structured individual interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was used. Three themes were generated concerning the psychosocial well-being, resources, and support systems of AYA with KS:

- **Rejecting stigmatization**: Participants integrated a diagnosis of KS into their identity, with many expressing, "I'm a little different", yet not wanting to be labeled as "disabled".
- **Lessons learned in disclosure**: When disclosing one's diagnosis of KS, participants learned the importance of telling trusted others and expressed that disclosure often provides a sense of relief.
- **Building blocks of a support system**: Participants voiced the importance of having a varied support system that includes individuals like parents, friends, and romantic partners, with sentiments like, "They accept me for who I am".

This study enhances understanding of the support resources AYA with KS are using or not using and provides insight into their experiences.

### Klinefelter's syndrome [^115hPxgz]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Klinefelter's syndrome is the most common genetic cause of human male infertility, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to substantial variation in clinical presentation and insufficient professional awareness of the syndrome itself. Early recognition and hormonal treatment of the disorder can substantially improve quality of life and prevent serious consequences. Testosterone replacement corrects symptoms of androgen deficiency but has no positive effect on infertility. However, patients with Klinefelter's syndrome, including the non-mosaic type, need no longer be considered irrevocably infertile, as intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers an opportunity for procreation even when there are no spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a substantial number of azoospermic patients, spermatozoa can be extracted from testicular biopsy samples, and pregnancies and live births have been achieved.

The frequency of sex chromosomal hyperploidy and autosomal aneuploidies is higher in spermatozoa from patients with Klinefelter's syndrome than in those from normal men. Thus, chromosomal errors might, in some cases, be transmitted to the offspring of men with this syndrome. The genetic implications of the fertilization procedures, including pre-transfer or prenatal genetic assessment, must be explained to patients and their partners.

### Quality of life in men with Klinefelter syndrome: The impact of genotype, health, socioeconomics, and sexual function [^114sws9Z]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is associated with lower socioeconomic status and greater morbidity. However, relatively little is known about the quality of life for men with KS or how KS and other factors combine to determine it.

A total of 132 men with KS were recruited in clinics, and 313 matched controls were identified by Statistics Denmark. Demographics, socioeconomic status, health problems and behaviors, sexual function, medical follow-up, and mental and physical quality of life (MQoL and PQoL, respectively) were assessed for all participants through surveys.

Men with KS reported significantly lower education attainment levels, income, physical activity, and both PQoL and MQoL, as well as more illness, medication, and sexual dysfunction. KS status was associated directly with lower PQoL, as well as indirectly through reduced income, physical activity, sexual function, and increased body mass index. KS status and younger age were associated directly with lower MQoL, as well as indirectly through reduced income, physical activity, and partner status (for KS status), or through partner status (for age).

KS status is associated with lower PQoL and MQoL through both direct and indirect paths. These results suggest the need for more comprehensive research and clinical approaches to addressing quality of life for men with KS.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^1152s38L]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Data from this study were collected via semi‐structured interviews assessing the following three areas: (1) resources and support systems adolescents and young adults (AYA) with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) utilize to cope with challenges related to their condition, (2) psychosocial well-being of AYA with KS and how KS is perceived to impact it, and (3) attitudes of AYA with KS about testicular dysfunction, specifically the likely need for testosterone replacement and fertility-related interventions. The study reports data on the first and second areas.

The authors collaboratively developed an interview guide to assess these content areas based on three primary factors:

- **Interview guide**: Developed by Papadakis et al. exploring fertility-related healthcare and decision-making needs for AYA with disorders of sex development (DSDs).
- **Literature review**: Works by Dennis et al, Richardson et al, and Turriff et al.
- **Authors' expertise**: Caring for children and AYA with KS in a multidisciplinary clinic at a single pediatric institution. Individuals with KS make up a significant portion of the patient population that authors AW, CF, and JP care for, which contributed to their motivation to explore the topics in this study, aiming to contribute to the development of comprehensive care for this patient population. Additionally, the research team included individuals with qualitative research expertise along with experience in genetic counseling.

Semi‐structured interviews were completed by one author (AT) with each consented participant.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^11344Asi]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 451 studies were identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE. After removing duplicates, 344 studies remained. A review of the title and abstract led to the exclusion of a further 282 studies. Of the remaining 62 articles assessed for eligibility, 47 were excluded as they did not report outcomes relevant to this systematic review. Consequently, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria (Figure 1).

A summary of studies that investigated the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals presumed male at birth is included in Table 2. A total of 1376 individuals were covered in 11 retrospective cohort studies, with 14 of them (1.02%) diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. In seven studies where karyotyping was undertaken for all individuals, the prevalence was found to be 9 out of 1013 (0.88%; 95% CI, 0.41%−1.68%).

- **Figure 1**: Selection of studies for inclusion.

- **Table 2**: Prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in individuals presumed male at birth with gender incongruence.

Clinical data from 15 individuals reported in case reports or series is shown in Table 3. These individuals were diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome at age 16 or older. Among the seven case studies that reported serum testosterone concentration, five (71%) had levels below the lower limit of the male reference range. Additionally, seven articles discussed testosterone therapy prescription in nine individuals, with three showing poor compliance or ceasing testosterone following the development of secondary male sex characteristics.

### New horizons in Klinefelter syndrome: Current evidence, gaps, and research priorities [^1157yU5i]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) is caused by the presence of a supernumerary X chromosome (conferring the classical 47, XXY karyotype) and is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in men. The clinical features described in the early characterization of the syndrome include tall stature, small testes, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and neurodevelopmental deficits. However, the syndrome presents a broad phenotypic spectrum that seems to be evolving, along with environmental and general health changes. Although a proportion of men with KS are asymptomatic, others experience numerous severe comorbidities ranging from cardiovascular to autoimmune disorders. Once considered a hallmark of the syndrome, the inability to conceive can now be overcome with assisted reproductive technology. The neuropsychological stigmata, once overstated and then inadvertently dismissed, now demand a more balanced and objective approach.

Significant advances have been made in our understanding of KS over recent years, including the molecular machinery involved in the chromosomal disjunction that gives rise to the syndrome. Our understanding of the risk-benefit of testosterone replacement therapy has greatly improved; however, many gaps persist. Future work should be prioritized according to the needs of people with KS. There are opportunities for new research addressing the fields of fertility, cardiovascular prevention, neurodevelopment, quality of life, and bone health. Above all, solid registries and extensive prospective longitudinal studies are needed to enroll people with KS to determine their evolving needs and outcomes.

### New concepts in Klinefelter syndrome [^117SB7ey]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY, and its variants are the most common chromosomal aberrations among men, with an estimated frequency of 1:500 among newborns. Men with Klinefelter syndrome present with sequelae of hormonal and spermatogenic testicular failure, such as infertility, low testosterone, erectile dysfunction, and low bone mineral density. This review aims to provide practicing urologists with an important source of clinically relevant information about Klinefelter syndrome.

Sperm can be found in over 50% of men with Klinefelter syndrome, indicating that men with this condition are not sterile. Recent evidence suggests that children with Klinefelter syndrome are born with spermatogonia and lose large numbers of germ cells during puberty. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life and overall health of men with Klinefelter syndrome.

Growing interest in Klinefelter syndrome among translational scientists and clinicians will result in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of testicular failure. In some states, screening programs for Klinefelter syndrome are already in place, which will increase the number of patients with Klinefelter syndrome seen by practicing urologists in the near future. Diagnosis and management of patients with Klinefelter syndrome are within the scope and training of urologists. The development of randomized clinical trials comparing different forms of interventions in men and children with Klinefelter syndrome will allow us to standardize the care of these patients.

### Birth of a healthy boy using fresh testicular sperm in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome [^114dK2Dv]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to present a case of Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome. The study is set in a private IVF center and involves a 35-year-old man with these conditions, which cause primary infertility. The interventions included testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

- **Main outcome measures**: Sperm recovery, fertilization, and live birth.

- **Results**: Ovulation induction of the female partner, recovery of spermatozoa by TESE from the male partner, and ICSI of nine metaphase II oocytes resulted in the fertilization of two oocytes. The transfer of one 4-cell grade 1 embryo led to the birth of a healthy boy with normal anatomy and a 46, XY karyotype.

- **Conclusions**: This case is unique due to the presence of nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener's syndrome and highlights revolutionary aspects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) concerning male factor infertility.

### Tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome improved by testosterone administration [^114MN8b8]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome has been believed to be essential tremor since the publication of "Klinefelter's syndrome and essential tremor" in 1969. However, the author also suggested that tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome might differ from essential tremor. This case describes a 71-year-old man with Klinefelter's syndrome who suffers from postural hand tremor. An electromyogram indicated lower motor neuron disturbance and chronic neurogenic change, while a muscle biopsy showed neurogenic muscle atrophy. Upon testosterone administration, the amplitude of tremor was reduced, and a gradual improvement in handwriting was observed. The tremor in this patient was different from essential tremor. The foresight by Baughman in 1969 proved to be true in this patient. This case report provides new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome, offering potential benefits to patients suffering from this tremor.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117MGCPV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Transgender (trans) individuals, including those with a binary and/or non-binary gender identity, represent a growing population with unique healthcare needs. Some trans individuals experience gender dysphoria, which refers to the distress that arises from incongruence between one's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. A complex set of factors determine one's gender identity, and there has been increasing research into the potential genetic basis of gender incongruence. At the time of writing, variations in the oestrogen receptor, oestrogen receptor coactivators, as well as androgen receptor have been reported in trans individuals. Past studies have also suggested a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst trans individuals presumed male at birth compared to the expected prevalence in the general population.

Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is the most common sex chromosomal disorder in individuals presumed male at birth, affecting 0.02%−0.22% of the population. Klinefelter syndrome is a significantly underdiagnosed condition with estimates suggesting only 25%−50% of individuals are diagnosed. Diagnosis is frequently made in adulthood during fertility assessment. Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have primary testicular failure, with resultant clinical features including small testes, gynaecomastia, sparse male-pattern body hair, and eunuchoid proportions.

Klinefelter syndrome is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, breast cancer, and infertility, which could have treatment implications before and following the initiation of feminizing gender-affirming therapy.

### Toward a potential association between eosinophilic esophagitis and Klinefelter syndrome: A case series and review of the literature [^113Qg4UA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common disorder of male sex aneuploidy, consisting of an additional X chromosome and occurring in 1 in every 500–1000 male births. Several disorders and a higher risk of autoimmune diseases have been reported in KS.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder occurring in 1 in 2000 people. Although antigens play a pivotal role in EoE, a genetic predisposition has been demonstrated. A potential pathogenic contributing role of genes located on the X chromosome has been suggested despite male predominance.

We recently identified three subjects with KS among our cohort of 150 male adult EoE patients. The CARE guidelines and checklist were applied in the data collection process and drafting of the article. The aim of this work was to describe these three patients and to review the literature for similar cases yielding a possible pathophysiological explanation.

### Leydig cell tumor found incidentally during microscopic testicular sperm extraction in patient with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome: Case report [^112565XV]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). High credibility.

To report the finding and management of a case of Leydig cell tumor discovered during the infertility evaluation of a patient with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome, a single case report was conducted in an academic hospital.

The patient, who was seeking assistance with fertility following a diagnosis of mosaic Klinefelter syndrome, underwent microscopic testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) for sperm identification. During mTESE, abnormal testicular tissue was identified and histologically confirmed to be a Leydig cell tumor. The patient was informed of this incidental discovery and subsequently underwent orchiectomy for conservative oncologic control.

Histologic testicular assessment was the main outcome measure. The patient was found to have no viable sperm on mTESE but achieved oncologic control with bilateral orchiectomy.

The presented case emphasizes the importance of awareness and expeditious appropriate management to achieve oncologic control of a rare tumor with low malignant potential discovered during routine mTESE. In particular, it highlights the role of the infertility specialist in aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of incidental and rare findings.

### The genetic origin of Klinefelter syndrome and its effect on spermatogenesis [^116eguqf]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most prevalent chromosome abnormality and genetic cause of azoospermia in males. The availability of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has allowed men with Klinefelter syndrome to father their own genetic offspring. When providing ART to men with Klinefelter syndrome, it is important to counsel them properly on both the chance of finding sperm and the potential effects on their offspring.

The aim of this review is twofold: [1] to describe the genetic etiology of Klinefelter syndrome and [2] to describe how spermatogenesis occurs in men with Klinefelter syndrome and the consequences this has for children born to men with Klinefelter syndrome.

### Klinefelter syndrome: A review [^111frEJ6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025).

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is an uncommonly recognized condition typified by gynecomastia, small testes, and aspermatogenesis. It is caused by a supernumerary X chromosome, resulting in a 47, XXY karyotype. Since its first description, the phenotype of KS has evolved, and there is a much greater appreciation of the subtle features of the condition.

- **Method**: In this review, we explore the phenotype of KS with particular consideration to patients with prenatal and early infancy diagnosis, given that this is becoming increasingly common. The understanding of the genetic mechanisms of KS, caused by a supernumerary X chromosome, is explored and the genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed.

- **Results**: The implications of the condition both in childhood and later development are explored in detail, with particular focus on social and educational implications. Potential treatments, with emphasis on preservation of fertility, are discussed. We highlight the optimal therapeutic conditions in which fertility preservation is most likely to be achieved, compared to those which can be more challenging. Finally, we discuss the other health challenges which can be associated with KS. These include poor bone health, diabetes, cardiovascular complications, and malignancy. The challenges in managing these co-morbid conditions and the most up-to-date management recommendations are also explored.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^114cdezf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Future research using genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data could clarify the molecular basis of this heterogeneity. Polygenic risk scores may also aid in assessing individual risks for KS-related conditions, supporting personalized clinical management.

Strategies to improve clinical decision-making, evaluate intervention effectiveness, and support further research are vital for optimizing patient care. There is a clear need for condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), as existing PROMs do not fully address the unique challenges faced by people with KS. Developing PROMs that capture the lived experience of people with KS would advance clinical practice and research.

### Klinefelter's syndrome and precocious puberty: A harbinger for tumor [^114jj8bM]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Boys with Klinefelter's syndrome are at an increased risk of precocious puberty, with most cases being either idiopathic or due to a mediastinal tumor. Patients with Klinefelter's syndrome have a high risk of primary, extragonadal germ cell tumors, which are usually nonseminomatous but can also be of a mixed type with seminomatous elements. The differential diagnosis of precocious puberty includes mediastinal tumors, especially in boys with Klinefelter's syndrome.

Results

- **Data synthesis**: A thematic synthesis was completed by analyzing the key chosen themes, namely: "diagnosis, metabolic disorders and body composition, cardiovascular and thrombosis risk, bone disorders, neoplasia, fertility management and treatment, testosterone (T) replacement therapy, psychological health and neurocognitive function, and KS through the lifespan". The chosen themes were selected on an a priori basis, reflecting the most prominent health domains affected. These areas were also dominant in key literature.

- **Characteristics of included studies**: From the initial search, 949 records were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria, providing guidelines on treating and caring for people with KS. These studies covered both general and domain-specific management areas. Table 1 presents a summary of the characteristics extracted from each study providing insight into management approaches. Further studies were included that provided insight into the key domains of health mentioned, but they were not management guidelines.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^111N9DA3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This scoping review aims to provide a concise, up-to-date synthesis of the approach to managing Klinefelter syndrome (KS). The review was conducted through an extensive literature search followed by a thematic synthesis, combining management guidelines, recommendations, and recent research across the subdomains of physical health, mental well-being, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). The literature search was completed using an a priori thematic framework to ensure critical areas of health affected in KS were included. Health domains were chosen from key literature on KS.

The research objectives are the following:

- **Highlight the management and treatment guidelines**: For individuals with KS in the key health domains described.
- **Discover how management guidelines address HR-QoL deficits**: This involves identifying areas of guidelines that focus on improving quality of life measures for those with KS.
- **Identify future areas for investigation**: That have the potential to reduce health inequalities and improve HR-QoL outcomes in individuals with KS.

The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsychINFO, and EMBASE were searched. A gray literature search followed, including key paper references and online searches of medical guideline organizations; where available, their publications and proposed guidelines were assessed, including the European Society of Endocrinology, the National Institutes of Health (USA), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK), and the National Health Service (UK). All databases were searched from their inception until December 2024.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^111yBfLy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome and gender incongruence have been documented in various observational studies, which suggest a potentially higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome among transgender individuals presumed male at birth compared to the general population. Despite these observations, the link between Klinefelter syndrome and gender incongruence remains unclear. The literature suggests a twofold explanation for the predisposition to gender incongruence. First, a fetus with Klinefelter syndrome is exposed to reduced levels of androgens, potentially contributing to different gender identity development. Second, typical features of Klinefelter syndrome, such as gynecomastia and sparse body hair, may be perceived as feminine, possibly making individuals more susceptible to doubts surrounding their masculine identity. This aligns with findings from two case reports where gender incongruence improved following testosterone treatment, although this outcome is dependent on the individual and remains speculative.

Another aspect to consider is the prevalence of gender incongruence among individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. One study examined the Gender Identity/Gender Dysphoria Questionnaire for Adults and Adolescents (GIDYQ‐AA) in 46 individuals with Klinefelter syndrome compared to 43 eugonadal cisgender male controls. Although individuals with Klinefelter syndrome had lower GIDYQ‐AA scores, indicating higher gender dysphoria than the control group, no individual scored below the GIDYQ‐AA cut-off of < 3 for gender dysphoria, nor did any meet DSM-V criteria for gender dysphoria.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^111iwJa2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

- **Lessons learned when disclosing one's diagnosis**: All 13 participants had disclosed their KS diagnosis to at least one individual; however, the specifics of what was shared and the level of detail provided varied. Some participants did not use the term "Klinefelter syndrome" when disclosing and instead focused on medical aspects of their diagnosis, such as testosterone treatment or infertility. For example, regarding disclosure to friends, one participant stated, "I don't know if this sounds kind of weird but when bodybuilders say they're taking testosterone I say, 'Haha I take this'", but when asked if he had told any friends that he has KS, this participant stated "no, not specifically Klinefelter".

	- There was also variability in whether participants were more likely to have shared broad information about KS. For example, one participant stated, "my therapist said just describe it as a rare, I guess, chromosome condition". Others provided more detailed information regarding symptoms they attribute to KS or anticipate experiencing as a result of the condition, with most participants having chosen the latter. For example, when one participant was asked what he recalls telling his friends about KS, he stated, "just like the rundown just basic things that come with it. Like I take testosterone for it, without it I'm really tired and just my English is not that good because of it. Just things along those lines".

### What should we consider in the case of combined Down- and 47, XY,+i(X)(q10) Klinefelter syndromes? The unique case of a male newborn and review of the literature [^111avxUA]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Double 48, XXY,+ 21 trisomy

Since the first description of double 48, XXY,+ 21 trisomy, 82 postnatal and 17 prenatal cases have been reported. Interestingly, in 1963, Wright and his colleagues reported two independent sibling duos with single aneuploidies. There was one child with Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) and one with Down Syndrome (DS) in each family, further examples of the common combination of these aneuploidies and the increased predisposition for non-disjunction events. Prenatal hints of similar cases could be the ultrasound signs of DS and the increased maternal serum marker levels. Keeping in mind that ultrasound signs are not obligatory, simultaneous screening of biomarker levels is essential. Prenatal ultrasound examinations of the presented patient did not show any pathological alterations. Since the mother was under 35 years of age, no serum biomarker testing was conducted. Our patient's case supports the relevance of combined prenatal testing in uncomplicated pregnancies.

In cases of combined DS and KS, the incidence of congenital heart disease could be higher compared to the isolated forms of these aneuploidies. In 12 previously described 48, XXY,+ 21 cases, atrial and atrioventricular septal defects were the most frequent abnormalities.

- **Mental health considerations**: In addition, the spectrum of different mental problems could be wider, and their risk could be higher in this group of patients.

The phenotype of 48, XXY,+ 21 double aneuploidy is characterized by classical DS features in children, who then develop additional KS symptoms from the age of puberty. If we experience the following symptoms, we should suspect the presence of these combined conditions.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117GVK44]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of infertility in azoospermic males. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of testicular architecture into hyalinized tissue and fibrosis, along with disruption of spermatogenesis. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection have been performed in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. There are currently no established guidelines regarding the timing of TESE and choice of harvesting technique.

It is recommended that sperm harvest should be completed before the initiation of testosterone therapy, or testosterone should be withheld if previously commenced. A similar principle should apply to hormonal treatment for transgender individuals, where discussions regarding fertility should be undertaken before the commencement of feminizing gender‐affirming hormone therapy.

### The impact of living with Klinefelter syndrome: A qualitative exploration of adolescents and adults [^112A1rQV]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) is a common yet significantly underdiagnosed condition with considerable medical, psychological, and social implications. Many health care providers lack familiarity with XXY, resulting in medical management challenges and a limited understanding of the personal impact of the condition. Genetic counselors benefit from understanding the challenges adolescents and men with XXY face to effectively address their medical and psychosocial needs. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of living with XXY as an adolescent or an adult. Individuals aged 14 to 75 years with self-reported XXY were recruited from online support networks to complete a web-based survey that included open-ended questions. Open-ended responses were coded and analyzed thematically (n = 169 to 210 for each open-ended question).

Over half of respondents to the open-ended questions reported challenges in finding health care providers who are knowledgeable about XXY, with many describing an extensive diagnostic odyssey and relief when receiving a diagnosis. Individuals sought support in coping with the challenges they face and acknowledgment of the positive aspects of XXY. Recommendations are made for how genetic counseling can enhance the quality of life for individuals living with XXY.

Decreased serum testosterone can be caused by various conditions, including liver cirrhosis, Klinefelter syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, testicular trauma, hereditary hemochromatosis, Down's syndrome, chronic kidney disease, hypogonadism, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, myotonic dystrophy, and cryptorchidism. Additionally, certain medications such as prednisolone, prednisolone acetate, sirolimus, caffeine, morphine, oxymorphone, ramelteon, sufentanil, tapentadol, morphine ER, and mitotane can also lead to decreased serum testosterone.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^117Hkody]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Our review identifies considerable gaps in managing Klinefelter syndrome (KS), particularly regarding health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Research and clinical guidelines must evolve to better address the multifaceted needs of individuals with KS, especially concerning early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, the risk profiles of various cancers, and comprehensive physical and psychological support.

Early diagnosis of KS could benefit from a collaborative approach; the inclusion of noninvasive prenatal screening can detect KS early, followed by confirmatory testing. Pediatricians should monitor developmental progress, especially on the brink of puberty, while information from educators can provide valuable insights into speech, motor, and social challenges. Combining medical and educational assessments could lead to earlier identification and referrals to genetic testing.

Research in related conditions, such as autism, suggests early detection can significantly enhance long-term HR-QoL. While specific studies in KS are lacking, the potential benefits of early diagnosis and intervention remain largely unexplored. Future investigations should focus on whether early intervention of physiological comorbidities, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), and psychological support can bring about improvements across the lifespan.

A considerable gap exists in understanding the psychological phenotype of KS and its resulting effect on HR-QoL. Further questions arise about management strategies, diagnosis, and clinical knowledge of the psychological profile within KS. Clinicians need integrated approaches to address these challenges effectively.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^113Lxbnh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Psychological health and neurocognitive function**: Psychological comorbidities associated with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) include anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder symptoms, psychosis, reduced intelligence, attention span, and neurocognitive disorders such as cognitive function. However, symptom variability is considerable, with no distinct psychological phenotype being identified in people with KS. Negative associations between psychological symptoms and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with KS have been identified.

There are several hypotheses concerning the increased risk of cognitive and psychological disorders in people with KS. Studies have identified neuroanatomical changes, including significant differences in total brain, gray, and white matter volume compared to the general population. Gray and white matter volume were reduced in the insula, putamen, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, right parahippocampal region, cerebellum, temporal lobe, and frontal inferior orbital, with widespread alterations in global functional connectivity among the inferior frontal gyrus, temporal-parietal area, and hippocampus in boys aged 8 to 17 years with KS.

It is understood that these changes are associated with functional impairment and language abnormalities, as well as vulnerability to schizophrenia, psychosis, autism spectrum disease, mood, and anxiety disorders.

### State-wide increase in prenatal diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome on amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling: Impact of non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome conditions [^111PUMhC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). High credibility.

Until recently, the prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome condition was most commonly an incidental finding following a diagnostic procedure performed for another indication. The introduction of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) over the past decade has not only reduced the total number of invasive procedures performed but also created new opportunities for women to obtain specific prenatal screening information on sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). Non-invasive prenatal testing became clinically available in Australia on a self-funded basis in late 2012 and is now utilized by at least 20% of women electing to have screening in Victoria.

The most common SCA, 45, X (Turner syndrome), is the only sex chromosome aneuploidy with the potential for detection via specific fetal ultrasound findings such as cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, increased nuchal translucency, or cardiac and renal anomalies. The other SCAs include 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), 47, XYY (Jacob syndrome), and 47, XXX (Triple X). Children with these conditions often have a normal phenotype at birth and typically present across the life course with issues including developmental delay, reproductive abnormalities, and reduced fertility. Their highly variable presentation and the less accurate performance of NIPT for these conditions has created debate over whether sex chromosomes should be analyzed in NIPT. A joint statement by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Human Genetics Society of Australasia recommended that while there is no precedent for screening for SCA at the population level, if it is to be considered, a comprehensive approach should be adopted.

### Oxandrolone treatment results in an increased risk of gonadarche in prepubertal boys with Klinefelter syndrome [^1137o346]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a common genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome. KS is associated with testosterone deficiency, neurodevelopmental delays, and cardiometabolic disorders. There has been recent interest in prepubertal androgen treatment; however, the effects on puberty and gonadal function are unknown.

- **Objective**: To compare the onset of puberty and testicular function in prepubertal boys treated with 2 years of oxandrolone (Ox) versus placebo (Pl).

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Single tertiary care referral center.

- **Participants**: Eighty prepubertal boys with KS with a mean age of 8.0 ± 2.2 years (range: 4 to 12).

- **Interventions**: Ox 0.05 mg/kg versus identical-appearing Pl capsule given for 2 years.

- **Outcome Measures**: Onset of gonadarche (testicular volume ≥ 4 mL) and onset of pubarche (Tanner 2 pubic hair); change in testicular hormone concentrations.

- **Results**: The Ox-treated group had 20.5 times higher odds of reaching gonadarche (OR 95% CI: 6.5, 77.8) and 28.1 times higher odds of reaching pubarche (OR 95% CI: 8.8, 110.4) during the 2-year study period after adjusting for baseline age. Gonadarche and pubarche both occurred at a younger age in the Ox group (gonadarche: 9.8 ± 1.5 vs. 12.1 ± 1.0 years, P < 0.001; pubarche: 10.2 ± 1.1 vs. 11.6 ± 1.3 years, P = 0.02). Serum concentrations of testicular hormones and gonadotropins were not different between groups.

- **Conclusions**: Two years of Ox treatment in prepubertal boys with KS results in an increased risk of early gonadarche, on average 2 years earlier than in Pl-treated boys.

### Klinefelter syndrome: an argument for early aggressive hormonal and fertility management [^112vF4g9]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective: To investigate the impact of early hormone replacement therapy (HT) on sperm retrieval rates in patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS).

Design: A systematic review of the relevant literature using the PubMed NLM database.

Results: There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of HT on sperm retrieval or reproductive outcomes in men with KS. On average, surgical sperm retrieval rates in men with KS are around 51%, with a range of 28%-69%. Young patient age is the most consistent positive predictor of sperm retrieval. Lower retrieval rates have been reported in a small subset of KS adults who previously received exogenous T, although the nature, duration, and reason for such therapy in these patient subsets are unknown.

Conclusions: Early HT is recommended in patients with KS, but its effect on fertility potential has not been definitively studied. Larger studies are needed to better answer this question. Cryopreservation of sperm-containing semen or testicular tissue from a significant proportion of affected adolescents is possible, even when containing very low numbers of spermatozoa, and should be considered to maximize future fertility potential.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^115Spx8L]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

While studies have demonstrated that potential infertility and psychological comorbidities have an adverse impact on individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (Turriff et al.) most of the research at the time of writing has focused on the adult population. Among research done in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population, much of it has been conducted with samples that include both Klinefelter syndrome and other differences of sex development (DSD; a group of diagnoses in which sex chromosomes, hormone levels, internal reproductive anatomy, and/or external genital appearance differ from typical binary male or female pathways of development; Hughes et al.), which makes it difficult to know how findings are representative of AYAs with Klinefelter syndrome.

Because the uptake of cfDNA screening technology during pregnancy is leading to Klinefelter syndrome being diagnosed more frequently at younger ages, it is increasingly important to understand the unique experiences and perspectives of AYAs with this condition. The present study aimed to explore the perspectives of AYAs with Klinefelter syndrome regarding their experiences with making meaning of their diagnosis, how they decide to disclose their diagnosis to others, and the support systems used to cope with challenges related to living with the condition. Exploration of these perspectives may help clinicians better understand the patient experience and how these factors contribute to psychosocial well-being, which may lead to improvements in clinical practice.

### From Klinefelter syndrome to high grade aneuploidies: Expanding the gene-dosage effect of supernumerary X chromosomes [^117KJvos]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We enrolled 23 patients with high-grade aneuploidies (HGAs) followed at the Endo-ERN and Regional Rare Endocrine and Andrological Disease Centre at the Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy ("Policlinico Umberto I" Hospital). All HGA patients with available data were included and randomly matched by age (± 1 year), at a 1:2 ratio, with 46 patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) followed in our center. An additional cohort of 46 subjects with KS, matched by pubertal status at a 1:2 ratio, was included for validation of significant findings, as well as gonadal development and function parameters. In all patients, the diagnosis was established by postnatal peripheral blood karyotype analysis conducted on at least 40 metaphases, thus excluding mosaicism. All patients underwent a thorough clinical examination, a hormonal and metabolic evaluation, and a detailed ultrasonographic study of the testes, according to the European Academy of Andrology ultrasound Standard Operating Procedures. Additionally, an examination of the heart was performed.

Pubertal stage was evaluated according to Tanner's original description for external genitalia appearance (i.e. scrotum, penis, pubic hair). At the time of evaluation, none of the patients was taking testosterone replacement therapy or any other hormonally or metabolically active drugs.

Written informed consent was obtained from participants of legal age able to do so, whereas for minors, it was obtained from the participant's parents (Local Ethics Committee Approval Ref. CE 7155, Protocol no. 0414/23 of March 5, 2023).

Double aneuploidies — especially in combination with structural aberrations — are extremely rare among liveborns. The most frequent co-occurrence is of Down syndrome (DS) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (coincidence 0.098%), because they are common and relatively well-tolerated chromosome abnormalities in humans. Although their features are separately well described, their co-occurrence and association with i(X)(q10) structural abnormality needs a specific approach.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^116F85GS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals. We undertook a systematic review to determine the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals presumed male at birth and summarize the clinical features and potential treatment implications for individuals with Klinefelter syndrome commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

- **Design**: Using preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 31 December 2021. All studies reporting on the prevalence or clinical features of transgender individuals with Klinefelter syndrome were included.

- **Results**: Our search strategy retrieved 11 cohort studies comprising 1376 transgender individuals. In all, 14 of 1376 (1.02%) individuals were diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. Based on the seven studies in which karyotype was undertaken in all individuals, the prevalence is 9/1013 (0.88%; 95% CI, 0.41%-1.68%). Case reports highlight unique treatment considerations in this population, including azoospermia, venous thromboembolism, and monitoring of breast cancer and bone health.

- **Conclusions**: Compared to the general population, observational studies document a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals, though underdiagnosis in the general population limits conclusions. Routine karyo

### A qualitative exploration of experiences of gender identity and gender questioning among adults with Klinefelter syndrome/XXY [^115Q1ST5]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

The study findings have potential implications for several aspects of care for people with KS/XXY, which is currently provided through different services. Multidisciplinary clinics aim to provide comprehensive, integrated care, and there are presently 13 such KS/XXY clinics in the United States, two in the United Kingdom, and one in Denmark. However, a common care pathway is for a general or family practitioner to arrange genetic testing and then refer the person to a general endocrinologist if KS/XXY is confirmed. Standards of care may vary, and there is no detailed practical guidance for GPs, endocrinologists, and other healthcare providers about how to approach and handle issues related to gender identity among people with KS/XXY.

- **Considering gender identity issues more routinely**: More research is needed, but the present findings suggest that people with KS/XXY would benefit from opportunities to explore potential gender identity issues in a more routine way, without needing to raise the issue or express a wish to begin transitioning. This would help with the implementation of existing recommendations for the care of people with KS/XXY, which include "considering psychosexual and psychiatric issues in all adult patients with KS" and giving "attention to the putative existence of gender incongruence in patients with KS" [Zitzmann et al. p. 157]. An obvious opportunity for this might be the transition from pediatric to adult care, or the first clinical appointment in adult care.
