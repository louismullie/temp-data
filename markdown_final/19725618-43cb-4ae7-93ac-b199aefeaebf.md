## Question

Rhabfomyelitis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rhabdomyolysis, specifically seeking a detailed, step-by-step explanation that preserves the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and confirming the correct diagnosis. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology and why myoglobin matters. Next, I will review etiologies and risk factors, followed by clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria. After that, I need to check the laboratory patterns and monitoring cadence. Then, I will examine complications and risk stratification. Finally, I will outline acute management, special populations, and follow-up, making sure each step aligns with guideline-level evidence and correcting any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. The term "rhabfomyelitis" appears to be a typographical error, and the correct entity is rhabdomyolysis, defined as skeletal muscle breakdown with release of intracellular contents into circulation, with diagnostic thresholds commonly set at CK greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal or greater than 1000 IU/L, often alongside clinical features such as myalgia, weakness, and myoglobinuria in more severe presentations [^1123GacT] [^114qoNNp].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology is framed correctly. The unifying mechanism is sarcolemmal disruption with unregulated calcium influx, ATP depletion, and protease activation leading to myocyte necrosis, with myoglobinuria contributing to AKI via tubular obstruction, oxidant injury, and vasoconstriction, particularly in acidic urine, so early volume expansion to maintain high urine flow is central to prevention and treatment [^113vW8Xu] [^112d4681].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes. I should categorize etiologies into exertional, traumatic or compressive, toxic or drug-induced, infectious, metabolic or genetic, and ischemic or compartmental, noting that in adults drugs and trauma are common while in children infections predominate, and that statins, illicit substances, and heat-related illness are frequent culprits depending on context [^115WUnUi] [^111t9w5z] [^115DmySp].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical presentation. The classic triad of myalgia, weakness, and tea-colored urine is specific but insensitive, with many patients lacking pain or weakness, so a high index of suspicion is warranted in at-risk settings such as crush, prolonged immobilization, extreme exertion, high fevers, or statin exposure, and dark urine should prompt urinalysis and CK testing [^1157DtUA] [^113mW9bn] [^111dZZ2c].

> I should double-check the diagnostic criteria. Most studies and guidelines accept CK greater than 5 times ULN or greater than 1000 IU/L as diagnostic, with myoglobin providing supportive evidence but limited by rapid clearance, and I must remember that AST and ALT elevations can reflect muscle injury rather than hepatocellular disease, so I should interpret LFTs cautiously in this context [^1123GacT] [^114qoNNp] [^113vW8Xu].

> Next, I should review the laboratory trajectory. CK typically rises within 12 hours, peaks at 24 to 72 hours, and declines by roughly 40% per day, so serial CK measurements are essential to track the course, whereas myoglobin rises and falls faster and may be missed if testing is delayed, which is why CK remains the cornerstone for diagnosis and monitoring [^113vW8Xu] [^116KXUVA].

> I will now examine complications and risk stratification. AKI is the most consequential complication and correlates with illness severity, with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, compartment syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, and DIC also on the differential, and risk tools may help estimate dialysis or mortality risk but should not delay supportive care [^113K5v7J] [^117Qagnw] [^111ajLhX].

> Let me think about immediate management. Early aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation is the cornerstone, with lactated Ringer's or saline acceptable and a reasonable starting rate around 400 mL/hour titrated to urine output goals of 1 to 3 mL/kg/hour or approximately 300 mL/hour in adults, while avoiding fluid overload and adjusting for comorbidities, and I should confirm that bicarbonate and mannitol lack robust evidence for routine prophylaxis against AKI [^115ZxpDm] [^112d4681] [^111bKUG1].

> But wait, what if the patient is oliguric or anuric? I should confirm that continued aggressive fluids without renal clearance risks pulmonary edema and compartment syndromes, so in refractory cases or when traditional AKI indications arise, renal replacement therapy should be offered based on standard AKI criteria rather than as a preventive strategy for rhabdomyolysis alone [^112d4681] [^117L9yXt] [^1146qjuR].

> I need to check electrolyte management. Hyperkalemia must be corrected promptly to mitigate arrhythmia risk, hypocalcemia is often observed and may be managed conservatively unless symptomatic, and metabolic acidosis should be addressed as part of overall resuscitation while avoiding overcorrection [^1138FSbc] [^111Bsg8M].

> Let me reconsider adjunctive therapies. Although urine alkalinization and mannitol have been used historically, contemporary guidance emphasizes that evidence for improved renal outcomes is limited, so these should not be routine and, if considered, should be individualized and secondary to adequate volume resuscitation and correction of acid-base status [^111bKUG1] [^116B1SRS].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pediatrics, infections are the leading trigger and prognosis is generally favorable with AKI occurring in about one fifth of cases but low progression to CKD, so I must tailor etiologic workup accordingly and apply the same early hydration principles with pediatric urine output targets [^111t9w5z] [^114Yb6p8].

> Hold on, I should verify exertional rhabdomyolysis nuances. Most cases are physiological and recover with rest and graded return, but red flags for underlying myopathy include recurrent episodes, disproportionate CK rise, family history, or delayed recovery, prompting neuromuscular evaluation and possible genetic testing using pragmatic frameworks such as RHABDO to guide workup [^114yd8g7] [^111AHmcL] [^115d6pPD].

> I should confirm statin-related rhabdomyolysis specifics. The incidence is very low at standard doses, risk rises with drug interactions, high dose, renal or hepatic impairment, and certain comorbidities, and management includes immediate statin cessation, aggressive hydration, and avoidance of rechallenge in cases of true rhabdomyolysis, with lipid management alternatives considered thereafter [^1135hJbH] [^115NFtLi] [^115FofgK].

> Let me verify COVID-19 associations. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported as an initial or early manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both adults and adolescents, so in the right clinical context I should maintain a high suspicion and screen appropriately while managing complications per general rhabdomyolysis principles [^112mRnJv] [^113d7UUB] [^1122ygA7].

> I need to ensure follow-up and monitoring are explicit. Serial CK should be tracked until a clear downtrend is established, typically over 24 to 72 hours, with renal function, electrolytes, and acid-base status monitored closely, and return to activity should be gradual only after clinical resolution and CK normalization to reduce recurrence risk [^111bexD2] [^1132yyR1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bicarbonate might be routinely indicated to prevent myoglobin precipitation, but I should correct that. Current consensus finds insufficient evidence for routine bicarbonate or mannitol, so the emphasis remains on early, adequate crystalloid resuscitation, vigilant complication surveillance, and timely RRT when AKI indications emerge rather than for prophylaxis [^111bKUG1] [^112d4681] [^117L9yXt].

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of intracellular contents into the circulation, most notably **creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin** [^114qoNNp], which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) and electrolyte disturbances [^113K5v7J]. Diagnosis relies on **CK > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L** [^1123GacT], with supportive findings of myoglobinuria, elevated LDH, AST, ALT, potassium, phosphate, and uric acid [^113vW8Xu] [^114XGSSo]. Management centers on **early aggressive IV hydration** [^113qDRET] to maintain urine output ≥ 1–3 mL/kg/h [^115ZxpDm], correction of electrolytes [^1138FSbc], and treatment of the underlying cause; bicarbonate or mannitol are not routinely recommended [^112d4681]. Complications include AKI, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, compartment syndrome, and DIC [^113K5v7J] [^112WZ4M1]; prognosis depends on severity, etiology, and timeliness of treatment [^114Skvxb] [^111mXdEU] [^114vP6pP].

---

## Pathophysiology

Rhabdomyolysis results from **muscle cell injury** with release of intracellular contents — CK, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase, potassium, phosphate, and uric acid — into the bloodstream [^114qoNNp]. The key mechanism is **sarcolemmal disruption** from direct trauma, ischemia, metabolic derangements, or toxins, leading to unregulated calcium influx, activation of calcium-dependent proteases, and cell death [^117SPTVb]. Myoglobinuria causes renal tubular obstruction, oxidative injury, and vasoconstriction, precipitating AKI [^112d4681].

---

## Etiology

Rhabdomyolysis has diverse causes; **trauma and crush injuries** are classic triggers [^111dZZ2c], while nontraumatic causes are increasingly common [^116SRnv9]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic | - Crush injuries <br/> - Blunt trauma <br/> - Prolonged immobilization <br/> - Compartment syndrome [^116SRnv9] |
| Non-traumatic | - Extreme exertion <br/> - Heat stroke <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Malignant hyperthermia <br/> - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^115WUnUi] |
| Drugs and toxins | - Statins <br/> - Fibrates <br/> - Cocaine <br/> - Alcohol <br/> - Amphetamines <br/> - Snake venoms [^115WUnUi] |
| Infections | - Influenza <br/> - COVID-19 <br/> - Legionella <br/> - Salmonella <br/> - Streptococcus [^115WUnUi] |
| Metabolic and genetic | - Glycogen storage diseases <br/> - Mitochondrial disorders <br/> - Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility [^115d6pPD] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation varies from **asymptomatic CK elevation** to life-threatening illness with myoglobinuria and AKI [^111dhbCP]. Classic features include:

- **Muscle pain (myalgia)**: Common but not universal [^113Nf4QD].
- **Muscle weakness**: Often proximal [^notfound].
- **Swelling**: Localized muscle swelling or edema [^113Nf4QD].
- **Dark urine (myoglobinuria)**: Tea- or cola-colored urine [^113mW9bn].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise [^112WZ4M1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis combines **clinical suspicion** with laboratory confirmation:

- **Creatine kinase (CK)**: Most sensitive marker; > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L is diagnostic [^1123GacT] [^114qoNNp].
- **Myoglobin**: Rapidly cleared; urine myoglobin supports diagnosis [^116KXUVA].
- **Electrolytes**: Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia [^111Bsg8M].
- **Renal function**: Elevated creatinine, oliguria/anuria [^113vW8Xu] [^111wTrVt].
- **Urinalysis**: Positive for blood without RBCs suggests myoglobinuria [^116KXUVA].

---

## Complications

Rhabdomyolysis can cause **severe complications**, including:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Occurs in ~13–50% of cases [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis [^112WZ4M1].
- **Compartment syndrome**: From muscle swelling/edema [^113K5v7J].
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Late complication [^notfound].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: From hyperkalemia and acidosis [^1138FSbc].

---

## Management

Management focuses on **early aggressive hydration** and correction of complications:

- **Intravenous fluids**: Early, aggressive resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) targeting urine output ≥ 1–3 mL/kg/h [^113qDRET] [^115ZxpDm].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Prompt management of hyperkalemia, acidosis, and other disturbances [^1138FSbc].
- **Avoidance of nephrotoxins**: Discontinue offending agents [^notfound].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or AKI [^117L9yXt].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Bicarbonate alkalinization and mannitol are not routinely recommended due to limited evidence [^112d4681].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with severity, etiology, and timeliness of intervention. Mild cases typically resolve without sequelae, whereas severe cases with AKI carry higher morbidity and mortality [^114Skvxb]. Early recognition and aggressive management — especially **prompt hydration** — significantly improve outcomes [^111mXdEU].

---

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious condition requiring rapid recognition and aggressive management to prevent complications such as AKI and electrolyte disturbances. Early, aggressive **IV hydration** and correction of electrolyte abnormalities are critical to improving outcomes [^113qDRET].

### Rhabdomyolysis as the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 in an adolescent [^113d7UUB]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has created a global pandemic, with many cases affecting the elderly. However, children have been affected as well, with ∼2.4% to 3.7% of cases reported. This case is the first published case of an adolescent presenting with rhabdomyolysis as the first sign of novel coronavirus disease 2019, with extremely elevated creatinine kinase levels, approaching almost 400000 U/L. This case adds to the growing body of literature of a variety of life-threatening manifestations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and highlights the importance of how prompt recognition of these unique presentations of the disease is important to mitigate complications.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: outcomes and prognostic factors [^111BGDUL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a common condition in older adults, often associated with falls. However, prognostic factors for rhabdomyolysis have mainly been studied in middle-aged populations.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that age influences rhabdomyolysis prognostic factors.

Methods

This retrospective single-center observational study included all patients with a creatine kinase (CK) level greater than five times normal, admitted to Rennes University Hospital between 2013 and 2019. The primary endpoint was 30-day in-hospital mortality rate.

Results

343 patients were included (median age: 75 years). The mean peak CK was 21,825 IU/L. Acute renal failure occurred in 57.7% of the cases. For patients aged 70 years and over, the main etiology was prolonged immobilization after a fall. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 10.5% (23 deaths). The Charlson score, number of medications and CK and creatinine levels varied according to age. Multivariate analysis showed age to be a factor that was associated, although not proportionally, with 30-day in-hospital mortality.

Conclusion

Factors influencing rhabdomyolysis severity were not randomly distributed according to age. The term rhabdomyolysis encompasses various clinical realities and is associated with different mechanisms. More research is needed to better understand the physio-pathological and prognostic factors of rhabdomyolysis, especially in older adults.

### Managing statin myopathy [^1124PhEZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### Acute rheumatic fever… [^113TZDvt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation. One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes.
- As of July 10, 2025, there is a voluntary recall of Bicillin L-A, a preferred antibiotic to prevent recurrences. Find details in the Prevention section below.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with acute rheumatic fever. Overview Cause Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of pharyngitis and skin infections, such as impetigo, due to Streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria are also called group A Streptococcus. Streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection typically precedes the onset of acute rheumatic fever by 1 to 5 weeks.

Manifestations by organ system Organ systems involved commonly include the
- Cardiovascular system
- Central nervous system
- Musculoskeletal system
- Skin Cardiovascular system Carditis is the major cardiac manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. It occurs in 50% to 70% of first episodes and is associated with valvulitis of the mitral valve, or less commonly, the aortic valve. Treatment Patients with acute rheumatic fever should start on therapy for the management of
- Acute rheumatic fever
- Cardiac failure, if necessary Therapy for acute rheumatic fever includes salicylates and anti-inflammatory medicines to relieve inflammation and decrease fever. Antibiotics These patients should also be started on antibiotics to eliminate any residual group A strep bacteria. Treatment is indicated regardless of the presence or absence of pharyngitis or positive Strep test at the time of diagnosis.

Prophylaxis typically involves one of the following:

- An intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin every 3–4 weeks
- Oral penicillin V twice daily Sulfadiazine or oral macrolides can be taken daily by individuals who are allergic to penicillin. The American Heart Association no longer recommends bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis unless the patient with rheumatic heart disease has a prosthetic valve.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis in the athlete: a clinical review [^1132yyR1]. Sports Health (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AOSSM 2014 guidelines recommend to regard the following patients to be at low risk in the context of exertional rhabdomyolysis:

- rapid clinical recovery and CK normalization after exercise restrictions

- sufficiently fit or well-trained athlete with a history of intense training/exercise

- no personal or family history of rhabdomyolysis

- existence of other group or team-related cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis during the same exercise sessions

- suspected or documented concomitant viral illness

- ingestion of a drug or dietary supplement likely contributed to the development of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by primary (mechanical) or secondary (metabolic) skeletal muscle injury, resulting in cell death and release of potentially toxic substances into circulation. Management often centers on prevention or treatment of the primary complication of the condition, acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we briefly review the causes, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis.

In what patient populations should rhabdomyolysis be suspected?

Trauma patients

Recommendation

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in patients with a large burden of traumatic injury involving muscular tissue, especially patients with crush injuries involving the extremities or mangled extremities. Patients with vascular injuries or muscle ischemia with subsequent reperfusion are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is the result of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of potentially toxic substances such as electrolytes, myoglobin, and sarcoplasmic proteins into the bloodstream. The pathophysiology underlying all cases of rhabdomyolysis is disruption of the myocyte cell membrane and leakage of cell contents into circulation. This may result from direct myocyte injury related to trauma or from metabolic disturbances affecting supply of ATP within the myocyte.

Traumatic injuries are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis. One study has shown some degree of biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis (abnormal creatine kinase (CK)) among 85% of critically injured patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit setting, although only 10% developed renal failure and only 5% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients with multisystem trauma, crush injuries involving the extremities or torso, and those with compartment syndrome of one or more extremities are at highest risk. Other independent risk factors for rhabdomyolysis among trauma patients include age older than 55 years, Injury Severity Score greater than 16, penetrating trauma with vascular injury, severe extremity injury, male sex, and body mass index greater than 30 kg/m². Patients who fall with subsequent prolonged immobilization are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis, particularly if their limbs are compressed by their head or torso for a significant period of time, leading to muscle hypoxia. Conditions leading to skeletal muscle ischemia, such as direct compression or compartment syndrome, may lead to irreversible damage to the muscle; much of the injury may actually occur with reperfusion, in addition to injury sustained during the period of ischemia. Trauma is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, but less than 20% of all cases of rhabdomyolysis are thought to be related to direct injury; metabolic or medical causes of rhabdomyolysis are more common.

CK elevation

The presence of elevated serum myoglobin was once used routinely to diagnose rhabdomyolysis; however, this parameter is not widely available for diagnostic testing and unreliable because myoglobin is rapidly cleared from the blood. Laboratory testing in urine (a positive dipstick for blood with absence of red blood cells on microscopic urinalysis serves as an indirect marker of urinary myoglobin) offers a fast screening tool if serum myoglobin testing is not readily available. Serum CK is the most reliable diagnostic marker of rhabdomyolysis. It usually peaks 24–36 hours after exertion and then decreases back to baseline at a rate of about 40% per day (figure 2).

Figure 2
Rise and fall of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) during the course of rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin is the first enzyme that increases, but returns to normal levels within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. CK increases a few hours later, reaches its peak value within the first 24 hours, and remains at these levels for 3 days. Even though the presence of myoglobin in serum is the key feature of rhabdomyolysis, CK is considered to be a more useful marker for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of muscular injury due to its delayed clearance from the plasma and the wide availability for diagnostic testing. (Reprinted from Giannoglou et al Copyright 2007, with permission from Elsevier).

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the exact level of CK increases required to fulfil the definition of ERM, with suggested CK levels ranging from > 5, > 10, > 20 or even > 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is, however, some agreement that the limit of a CK value of > 5 times the ULN is very conservative, as it does not take into account documented baseline differences as a function of gender, ethnicity and training levels. These ULN levels vary considerably: 217 and 414 IU/L in Caucasian women and men, and 336 and 801 IU/L in African women and men, respectively.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for rhabdomyolysis [^112p2MCx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that is characterised by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue and leakage of intracellular myocyte contents into circulating blood. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Studies have indicated that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis by removing potentially damaging myoglobin and stabilising haemodynamic and metabolic status.

Objectives

We aimed to: i) assess the efficacy of CRRT in removing myoglobin; ii) investigate the influence of CRRT on mortality and kidney-related outcomes; and iii) evaluate the safety of CRRT for the treatment of people with rhabdomyolysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 January 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure (from 1 January 1979 to 16 April 2013) and the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (to 16 April 2013).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that investigated clinical outcomes of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Main Results

Of the three included studies (101 participants), one evaluated continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis and two investigated continuous venovenous haemofiltration; all included conventional therapy as control. We found significant decreases in myoglobin in patients among whom CRRT therapy was initiated on days four, eight, and 10 (day 4: MD -11.00 (μg/L), 95% CI -20.65 to -1.35; Day 8: MD -23.00 (μg/L), 95% CI -30.92 to -15.08; day 10: MD -341.87 (μg/L), 95% CI -626.15 to -57.59) compared with those who underwent conventional therapy. Although CRRT was associated with improved serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; reduced duration of the oliguria phase; and was associated with reduced time in hospital, no significant differences were found in mortality rates compared with conventional therapy (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.37). The included studies did not report on long-term outcomes or prevention of AKI. Overall, we found that study quality was suboptimal: blinding and randomisation allocation were not reported by any of the included studies, leading to the possibility of selection, performance and detection bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Although CRRT may provide some benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis, the poor methodological quality of the included studies and lack of data relating to clinically important outcomes limited our findings about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis. There was insufficient evidence to discern any likely benefits of CRRT over conventional therapy for people with rhabdomyolysis and prevention of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI.

### Recent advances in our understanding of genetic rhabdomyolysis [^115d6pPD]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of rhabdomyolysis.

Recent Findings

Rhabdomyolysis is the acute breakdown of myofibres resulting in systemic changes that can be life-threatening. Environmental triggers, including trauma, exercise, toxins and infections, and/or gene defects can precipitate rhabdomyolysis. A schema (aptly titled RHABDO) has been suggested for evaluating whether a patient with rhabdomyolysis is likely to harbour an underlying genetic defect. It is becoming increasingly recognized that defects in muscular dystrophy and myopathy genes can trigger rhabdomyolysis, even as the sole or presenting feature. Variants in genes not previously associated with human disease have been identified recently as causative of rhabdomyolysis, MLIP, MYH1 and OBSCN. Our understanding of the pathomechanisms contributing to rhabdomyolysis have also improved with an increased awareness of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in LPIN1, FDX2, ISCU and TANGO2 -mediated disease.

Summary

An accurate genetic diagnosis is important for optimal clinical management of the patient, avoiding associated triggers and genetic counselling and cascade screening. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetics contributing to rhabdomyolysis, many patients remain without an accurate genetic diagnosis, suggesting there are many more causative genes, variants and disease mechanisms to uncover.

### Early fluid resuscitation in patients with rhabdomyolysis [^111mXdEU]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Extensive rhabdomyolysis is often lethal unless treated immediately. Early mortality arises from hypovolemic shock, hyperkalemia, acidosis and myoglobinuric acute kidney injury (AKI). Many individuals with rhabdomyolysis could be saved, and myoglobinuric AKI prevented, by early vigorous fluid resuscitation with ≥ 12 l daily intravenous infusion of alkaline solution started at the scene of injury. This regimen stabilizes the circulation and mobilizes edema fluids sequestered in the injured muscles into the circulation, corrects hyperkalemia and acidosis, and protects against the nephrotoxic effects of myoglobinemia and hyperuricosuria. This regime results in a large positive fluid balance, which is well tolerated in young, carefully monitored individuals. In patients with rhabdomyolysis caused by muscle crush syndrome, mortality has been reduced from nearly 100% to < 20% over the past 70 years through utilization of this intervention. This Perspectives discusses the lifesaving and limb-saving potential of early vigorous fluid resuscitation in patients with extensive traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis.

Management

What is the optimal crystalloid type, rate of administration, and urine output goals to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

Either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) is an acceptable fluid for resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. A starting rate of 400 mL/hour can be initiated, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 cc/hour.

Discussion

Although early-volume resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis is well accepted as a mainstay of promoting renal tubule flow, diluting nephrotoxins such as myoglobin, and supplying adequate renal perfusion to prevent AKI, the best type of crystalloid for this purpose remains controversial. The two most commonly cited fluids used for this resuscitation are lactated Ringer's solution and saline (0.9% or 0.45%). Saline is promoted due to its lack of potassium; in rhabdomyolysis, crush injury can lead to hyperkalemia and there is a theoretic concern for worsening this issue by using a potassium-containing fluid for resuscitation. Conversely, receiving large amounts of resuscitation with normal saline can lead to metabolic acidosis, which can be counterproductive if urine alkalinization is desired. The only randomized controlled trial comparing these crystalloid fluid types evaluated patients with doxylamine-induced rhabdomyolysis. Of note, in this study, urine pH was a targeted end goal, with a goal pH > 6.5. In patients who received lactated Ringer's solution, urine and serum pH were significantly higher after 12 hours of aggressive resuscitation with significantly less need for bicarbonate administration to achieve goal urine pH, and there was no difference between groups in serum potassium level. However, there was also no difference in median time to serum CK less than 200 IU/L, which arguably is the most clinically relevant outcome in the study. There have been no other randomized controlled trials comparing lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline or 0.45% saline and therefore no clear recommendation as to which fluid type is better. It does appear that use of either type of fluid is safe in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis, so although this area certainly requires further study, at this time the type of fluid used for management of rhabdomyolysis may be at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis and renal replacement therapy: a critical review [^114qhQVX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a clinical syndrome characterized by injury to skeletal muscle fibers with disruption and release of their contents into the circulation. Myoglobin, creatine phosphokinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase are the most important substances for indicating muscle damage.

### Rhabdomyolysis [^115Qf2cD]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known clinical syndrome of muscle injury associated with myoglobinuria, electrolyte abnormalities, and often acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia and compartment syndrome are additional complications of rhabdomyolysis that must be treated effectively. A definite need exists for well-designed prospective studies to determine the optimal management of rhabdomyolysis.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^114hocVS]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical condition characterized by destruction of skeletal muscle with release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. Intracellular contents released include electrolytes, enzymes, and myoglobin, resulting in systemic complications. Muscle necrosis is the common factor for traumatic and non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. The systemic impact of rhabdomyolysis ranges from asymptomatic elevations in bloodstream muscle enzymes to life-threatening acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities. The purpose of this clinical consensus statement is to review the present-day diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients who develop rhabdomyolysis.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis [^114Yb6p8]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric rhabdomyolysis is a common diagnosis that pediatricians need to be able to recognize because prompt treatment can prevent potential complications, such as acute kidney injury. The triggers for rhabdomyolysis are extensive, with viruses being the most common cause in pediatric patients. The pathophysiology behind rhabdomyolysis is complex and still being researched, but having a firm understanding of the cascade that results when muscle injury occurs is essential for proper management. Guidelines for managing pediatric rhabdomyolysis currently do not exist, but this article aims to review the available literature and give clinicians a general approach to aid in history taking, physical examination, diagnosis, acute management, follow-up, and prevention.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: outcomes and prognostic factors [^117Kfmq6]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In our study, the prognostic factors of rhabdomyolysis were not randomly distributed according to age. In view of the decrease in muscle mass with age, the CK and creatinine thresholds usually used in prognostic scores may be questioned: the 5000 IU/L threshold may need to be verified in an older population. The impact of phosphorus and polypharmacy requires further studies on larger samples. Our results highlight age-related clinical and prognostic specificities of patients with rhabdomyolysis, which point to the necessity of further studies in the geriatric population concerning diagnosis, prognostic criteria, and ultimately therapeutic approaches of this pathology, which is quite frequent in old age.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^115ce2P4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome that comprises destruction of skeletal muscle with outflow of intracellular muscle content into the bloodstream. There is a great heterogeneity in the literature regarding definition, epidemiology, and treatment. The aim of this systematic literature review was to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the epidemiologic data, definition, and management of rhabdomyolysis.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted using the keywords "rhabdomyolysis" and "crush syndrome" covering all articles from January 2006 to December 2015 in three databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect). The search was divided into two steps: first, all articles that included data regarding definition, pathophysiology, and diagnosis were identified, excluding only case reports; then articles of original research with humans that reported epidemiological data (e.g., risk factors, common etiologies, and mortality) or treatment of rhabdomyolysis were identified. Information was summarized and organized based on these topics.

Results

The search generated 5632 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, 164 articles were retrieved and read: 56 articles met the final inclusion criteria; 23 were reviews (narrative or systematic); 16 were original articles containing epidemiological data; and six contained treatment specifications for patients with rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusion

Most studies defined rhabdomyolysis based on creatine kinase values five times above the upper limit of normal. Etiologies differ among the adult and pediatric populations and no randomized controlled trials have been done to compare intravenous fluid therapy alone versus intravenous fluid therapy with bicarbonate and/or mannitol.

Rhabdomyolysis, a clinical syndrome caused by damage to skeletal muscle and release of its breakdown products into the circulation, can be followed by acute kidney injury (AKI) as a severe complication. The belief that the AKI is triggered by myoglobin as the toxin responsible appears to be oversimplified. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and following AKI could widen treatment options, leading to preservation of the kidney: the decision to initiate renal replacement therapy in clinical practice should not be made on the basis of the myoglobin or creatine phosphokinase serum concentrations.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a review [^117SPTVb]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with leakage of muscle contents, is frequently accompanied by myoglobinuria, and if sufficiently severe, acute renal failure with potentially life-threatening metabolic derangements may ensue. A diverse spectrum of inherited and acquired disorders affecting muscle membranes, membrane ion channels, and muscle energy supply causes rhabdomyolysis. Common final pathophysiological mechanisms among these causes of rhabdomyolysis include an uncontrolled rise in free intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases, which lead to destruction of myofibrils and lysosomal digestion of muscle fiber contents. Recent advances in molecular genetics and muscle enzyme histochemistry may enable a specific metabolic diagnosis in many patients with idiopathic recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department evaluation and management of rhabdomyolysis [^114XGSSo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a medical condition caused by muscle breakdown leading to potential renal damage. This can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not rapidly identified and treated.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by the breakdown of muscle cells leading to the release of numerous intracellular molecules, including potassium, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and creatinine kinase. There are a number of potential etiologies, including exertion, extreme temperature changes, ischemia, infections, immobility, drugs, toxins, endocrine causes, autoimmune reactions, trauma, or genetic conditions. Findings can include myalgias, muscle weakness, or dark-colored urine, but more often include non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis is often determined with an elevated creatinine kinase greater than five times the upper-limit of normal. Severe disease may result in renal failure, electrolyte derangements, liver disease, compartment syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, as well as aggressive intravenous hydration with a goal urine output of 300 mL/h. Bicarbonate, mannitol, and loop diuretics do not possess strong evidence for improved outcomes. Renal replacement therapy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Most patients are admitted, though some may be appropriate for discharge.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management that may result in significant complications if not appropriately identified and treated. Emergency clinician knowledge of this condition is essential for appropriate management.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^1147Wp6H]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Rhabdomyolysis remains a major clinical challenge. Non-specific symptoms, multiple etiologies, and systemic complications obscure the diagnosis and complicate the treatment of this condition. The pathophysiology of myoglobin-induced injury to the renal parenchyma has been elucidated and aggressive fluid therapy remains the keystone of therapy. However, RCTs are sorely lacking regarding the use of both fluids and adjuvant pharmacological therapies (mannitol and bicarbonate) for AKI prevention. CRRT improves myoglobin clearance but does not change mortality. Several important aspects of rhabdomyolysis should be addressed in the future: a homogenous definition should be created for this syndrome, data from past cases should be pooled to derive and validate the best marker for predicting development of AKI, and multicenter RCTs that compare standardized intravenous fluid therapy alone with fluids with sodium bicarbonate and/or mannitol should be planned.

### Prevention of kidney injury following rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review [^116B1SRS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic literature review to evaluate evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of rhabdomyolysis-associated acute renal failure (ARF).

Data Sources

PubMed (1966-December 2012), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane databases (1970-December 2012) were searched. There were no language restrictions.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies selected dealt with treatment of rhabdomyolysis (crush syndrome) or prevention of ARF in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Articles excluded did not present original data or described only the management of ARF after it developed. Single case reports were excluded. Extracted data included study type; population; definitions of rhabdomyolysis and ARF; fluid, sodium bicarbonate, and mannitol dosages; and study findings.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. No controlled trials compared intravenous fluid administration plus sodium bicarbonate to fluid administration alone. Three concluded that there was no significant difference in the rates of ARF between patients receiving and those not receiving sodium bicarbonate; however, urine alkalinization was not documented. Eight investigations concluded that delayed fluid administration increased the risk of ARF. No controlled study compared volumes of fluid administered or targeted urine output goals. Fluid type, therapy duration, and monitoring parameters varied widely; 4 used a urine output goal in adults of more than 300 mL/h or 300 mL/h or more. No evidence supported a preferred fluid type or that sodium bicarbonate with or without mannitol was superior to fluid therapy alone.

Conclusions

Intravenous fluids should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within the first 6 hours after muscle injury, at a rate that maintains a urine output in adults of 300 mL/h or more for at least the first 24 hours. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered only if necessary to correct systemic acidosis and mannitol only to maintain urine output of 300 mL/h or more despite adequate fluid administration.

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^114cUMJh]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Statins reduce cardiovascular disease events in primary and secondary prevention, in men and women, and across all age groups. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised trials have confirmed the safety of statins. Although severe adverse effects are rare, statins increase the risk of myopathy (absolute excess risk about 1 in 10 000 people treated annually), which can progress to severe rhabdomyolysis (about 0.2 in 10 000 people treated annually). Uncertainty persists about less severe muscle symptoms, however. Many people believe that statins frequently cause muscle pain, a view that has been reinforced by results from unblinded observational studiesand media reports. This belief has led to patients discontinuing treatment, exposing them to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

For a patient in routine clinical care, reliably determining whether muscle symptoms are caused by statins is not easy for the clinician or patient. One way to deal with this uncertainty is to conduct blinded n-of-1 trials in individual patients with symptoms during treatment with statins. N-of-1 trials are a randomised trial in individual patientsthat can provide information to help determine the best course of action in an individual. When a number of n-of-1 individuals are combined in an analysis, the result can also be used to assess the overall effect of a treatment.

We describe the results of StatinWISE (Statin Web-based Investigation of Side Effects), a series of n-of-1 trials comparing treatment periods of statins and placebo in people who had previously reported muscle symptoms when taking statins. Our aim was to establish the effect of statins on all muscle symptoms and on muscle symptoms that are perceived to be related to statins.

### Rhabdomyolysis [^112CTP3q]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome resulting from the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers with leakage of muscle contents into the circulation. The most common causes are crush injury, overexertion, alcohol abuse and certain medicines and toxic substances. Several inherited genetic disorders, such as McArdle's disease and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, are predisposing factors for the syndrome. Clinical features are often nonspecific, and tea-colored urine is usually the first clue to the presence of rhabdomyolysis. Screening may be performed with a urine dipstick in combination with urine microscopy. A positive urine myoglobin test provides supportive evidence. Multiple complications can occur and are classified as early or late. Early complications include severe hyperkalemia that causes cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. The most serious late complication is acute renal failure, which occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients with the syndrome. Early recognition of rhabdomyolysis and prompt management of complications are crucial to a successful outcome.

### Clinical perspectives of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis [^115kubXD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Fear of muscle toxicity remains a major reason that patients with hyperlipidemia are undertreated. Recent evaluations of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis offer new insights on the clinical management of both muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is higher in practice than in controlled trials in which high-risk subjects are excluded. Accepted risks include age; renal, hepatic, and thyroid dysfunction; and hypertriglyceridemia. New findings suggest that exercise, Asian race, and perioperative status also may increase the risk of statin muscle toxicity. The proposed causes and the relationship of drug levels to statin rhabdomyolysis are briefly reviewed along with the problems with the pharmacokinetic theory. Data suggesting that patients with certain metabolic abnormalities are predisposed to statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. The evaluation and treatment of patients' muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. Patients whose symptoms are related to other disorders need to be identified. Lipid management of those whose symptoms are statin-related is reviewed including treatment suggestions.

The rate of administration of intravenous fluids in rhabdomyolysis should be targeted to the patient as there is significant risk of volume overload should an excessive amount of fluid be given without goal-directed therapy. A starting rate of 400 cc/hour with a range of 200 cc/hour to 1000 cc/hour is considered reasonable but should be titrated to urine output, ensuring the patient is receiving adequate resuscitation without suffering from fluid creep.

Urine output is the traditional method by which one can determine the adequacy of resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. The most commonly cited urine output goals for intravenous fluid rehydration are 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 mL/hour. However, should the patient remain anuric despite escalating rates of intravenous fluid administration, the need for RRT may be necessary as ongoing aggressive fluid resuscitation without renal clearance could lead to significant and life-threatening volume overload.

Are diuretics and/or bicarbonate administration beneficial?

Recommendation

Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate and/or diuretic use (mannitol, loop diuretics) for prevention of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI are limited by a lack of appropriate control groups, standardized definitions, retrospective design, and low statistical power. Given these significant limitations, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics for prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is not recommended.

Discussion

The precise mechanism of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is controversial and likely multifactorial. The two important factors in the development of myoglobin-induced renal toxicity are hypovolemia and aciduria. Ferrihemate, which is a breakdown product of myoglobin, in the presence of a low pH can generate free radicals which can lead to direct renal cell injury. Furthermore, heme proteins can potentiate renal vasoconstriction, which may have been initiated by hypovolemia and can activate the cytokine cascade. Pigmented casts, which are the hallmark of rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, have been suggested to arise as a result of an interaction between the Tamm-Horsfall protein and myoglobin in an acidic environment. Other mechanisms that have been suggested propose that the precipitation of heme protein and its ability to generate free radicals at a low pH with resultant toxicity to the tubules is what may give way to cast formation. Ultimately, AKI is the result of the combination of vasoconstriction, oxidant injury, and tubular obstruction, which leads to decreased glomerular filtration.

Conclusion

The occurrence of AKI increases the mortality rate of patients with RM. The early evaluation and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention of AKI and improved patient prognosis. Our study demonstrated several risk factors for RM-induced stage II-III AKI and in-hospital mortality in RM patients with AKI. These findings may facilitate the effective prevention and management of RM patients with AKI. However, it also has several limitations. We will conduct further research to improve the study.

Metabolic etiologies

Recommendation

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in any patient with a medical condition causing increased metabolic demands on myocytes in excess of the available supply of ATP. This may result from extreme exertional demands on skeletal muscle from exercise, exogenous agents such as drugs or toxins, genetic defects or myopathies affecting the muscle cell, and infections.

Discussion

Any process that impairs ATP production by skeletal muscle and any state where skeletal muscle energy requirements exceed the available ATP may lead to rhabdomyolysis. With ATP depletion, active transport pumps are no longer able to maintain low levels of intracellular calcium; unregulated increases in intracellular calcium lead to activation of calcium-dependent enzymes with eventual breakdown of the muscle cell. Exertional causes of rhabdomyolysis may include extreme and prolonged exercise or seizure activity such as status epilepticus. Most commonly, drugs and toxins lead to rhabdomyolysis. Alcohol abuse or dependence may actually be the most common risk factor for rhabdomyolysis; ethanol has direct adverse effects on muscle tissue metabolism and cellular integrity including inhibition of active transport pumps. Other illicit substances such as cocaine, heroin, and phencyclidine may also be implicated in cases of rhabdomyolysis. Lipid-lowering agents, especially statins, are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, particularly in patients with concomitant renal or liver insufficiency. Infections such as influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Staphylococcus aureus may rarely lead to rhabdomyolysis. Genetic diseases including disorders of glycolysis or glycogenolysis, lipid metabolism defects, or mitochondrial disorders are rare causes of rhabdomyolysis. Finally, rhabdomyolysis may be seen in patients with extreme alterations in body temperature due to conditions such as malignant hyperthermia, heat stroke, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Metabolic etiology for rhabdomyolysis is very broad and a number of different risk factors may need to be considered in this population.

Conservative measures in rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury

The first step in medical intervention is usually treatment of underlying disease. In the case of preserved diuresis in the setting of RM, we must initiate conservative measures, which usually include massive hydration, use of mannitol, urine alkalization and forced diuresis (Figure 2).

Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase the urine flow rate is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid solutions is the ubiquitous intervention in critical care medicine. One caveat, however, is that these therapeutic measures are not useful in the context of severe oliguria or anuria and may lead to interstitial and pulmonary edema. Clinicians have to be careful about oliguria which is a normal response to hypovolemia and should not be used solely as a trigger or end point for fluid resuscitation, particularly in the post-resuscitation period. Further, while aggressive volume resuscitation may preserve cardiac output and renal perfusion pressure, in the presence of oliguria it is an independent predictor for developing secondary abdominal compartment syndrome with decreased renal perfusion pressure or can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111AHmcL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterised by muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise or normal exercise under extreme circumstances. Key features are severe muscle pain and sudden transient elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without associated myoglobinuria. Mild cases may remain unnoticed or undiagnosed. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is well described among athletes and military personnel, but may occur in anybody exposed to unaccustomed exercise. In contrast, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. Repeated episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis should raise the suspicion of such an underlying disorder, in particular in individuals in whom the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episodes exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed. The present review aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with a particular emphasis on when to suspect an underlying genetic disorder. The pathophysiology and its clinical features are reviewed, emphasising four main stepwise approaches: (1) the clinical significance of an acute episode, (2) risks of renal impairment, (3) clinical indicators of an underlying genetic disorders and (4) when and how to recommence sport activity following an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic backgrounds that appear to be associated with both enhanced athletic performance and increased rhabdomyolysis risk are briefly reviewed.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^1169CFtE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process leads to the release of various cellular components into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, including proteins such as myoglobin and enzymes like creatine kinase (CK), as well as electrolytes. The severity of rhabdomyolysis can vary significantly, ranging from mild cases with minimal symptoms and slightly elevated CK levels to severe, life-threatening cases. Although traumatic injury is a common cause, a wide range of other factors can also trigger this condition. Previous studies and our research have confirmed that factors such as infection, certain medications, pancreatitis, alcohol consumption, electrolyte imbalance, excessive physical exertion, and heatstroke can also lead to elevated CK. The diverse range of potential causes underscores the complexity of this condition and the importance of considering rhabdomyolysis in various clinical scenarios.

Given the diverse etiology of rhabdomyolysis, patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) with critical illnesses are particularly susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to severe complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS). Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and the incidence of AKI. Despite its clinical significance, the specific characteristics and risk factors contributing to mortality or adverse outcomes in ICU patients with rhabdomyolysis are not fully understood. Moreover, the relationship between elevated serum CK levels and increased patient mortality remains controversial. In light of these uncertainties, the objective of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ICU patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and to determine whether rhabdomyolysis constitutes a risk factor for outcomes within this patient population.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of renal dysfunction in rhabdomyolysis [^114BLNZp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a major cause of acute renal failure, and recent experimental data have provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the renal dysfunction. Renal failure is due to renal vasoconstriction, tubular damage caused by oxidant injury, and possibly tubular obstruction. Recent studies have provided greater insight into the rationale behind current therapy and potential treatment strategies. This review thus aims to summarise current understanding of the causes, pathogenesis and treatment of renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis.

Data synthesis

Definition

The clinical studies were very heterogeneous with regard to the definition of rhabdomyolysis; although most authors diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on CK levels five times the upper limit of normal levels (> 1000 U/L), others used alternative criteria for diagnosis (Table 1). In the clinical setting, symptoms were not usually taken into consideration when defining rhabdomyolsysis; however, the most commonly included ones were muscle pain and muscle weakness while the presence of dark urine was not used to define this entity in most studies. When rhabdomyolysis is associated with the use of lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, or a combination of both), the CK level cutoff is considered ten times the upper limit of normal. The definition of severity of rhabdomyolysis varied among studies, some defining "severe rhabdomyolysis" based on different CK cutoff values (> 5000 U/L up to > 15,000 U/L).

Definitions of statin-associated muscle symptoms proposed by the EAS Consensus Panel

In the vast majority of cases, SAMS are not accompanied by marked CK elevation. For SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN, usually referred to as myopathy, the incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 per year with a standard statin dose (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg daily). The risk varies, however, among different statins, and increases not only with the dose of statin, but also with factors associated with increased statin blood concentrations (e.g. genetic factors, ethnicity, interacting drugs, and patient characteristics) (see Box 1). Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of muscle damage associated with very high CK levels with myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria with a concomitantly increased risk of renal failure. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in association with statin therapy is ∼1 in 100 000 per year. In view of the rarity of CK elevations during statin therapy, it is not recommended to routinely monitor CK. Even if an asymptomatic elevation of CK is detected, the clinical significance is unclear.

Box 1
Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms. Adapted from Mancini et al.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are more likely to be caused by statins when elevated CK levels decrease after cessation of either the statin or the interacting drug, or when symptoms regress markedly within a few weeks of cessation of the statin and/or reappear within a month of drug re-challenge. Time to reappearance of symptoms is also influenced by the dose of statin and the duration of the re-challenge. Individual patient drug–placebo clinical trials have been suggested as an approach to confirming diagnosis of SAMS, but are not feasible in the routine outpatient setting.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: outcomes and prognostic factors [^1158gJ38]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinic-biological entity in which striated muscle cells break down and release their contents into the bloodstream. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biological symptoms such as muscle pain, dark-tea colored urine, myoglobinuria and excessive potassium levels. It is confirmed by increased creatine kinase (CK) levels. The most commonly used threshold of CK for diagnosis is usually 1000 UI/l or five times the upper limit of normal levels. Pathophysiological studies of this condition have shown striated muscle cells necrosis, through either direct injury (trauma/prolonged compression) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, leading to a sudden increase in intracellular calcium. Striated muscle cells necrosis leads to the release of their contents into the serum (potassium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, myoglobin, and CK). Precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules and vasoconstriction secondary to hypovolemia can lead to renal failure of varying severity, sometimes fatal.

Different etiologies have been described, and these can be grouped according to their mechanisms: hypoxic, traumatic, chemical, or biological. In adults, the most frequent causes are traumatic, iatrogenic, and infectious. Prolonged immobilization, usually after a fall, is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in older adults. Its occurrence increases with age and comorbidities. In France, approximately 450,000 people over 65 years of age experience a fall each year, resulting in more than 9,000 deaths in 2013. A multicenter French study on 1467 subjects found that 14% of patients aged 65 years or more, hospitalized for an injury caused by a fall, had rhabdomyolysis.

An American study proposed a composite score predictive of the risk of acute renal failure and mortality linked to rhabdomyolysis. It included initial CK level, the presence of acute renal failure, etiology, age, and values of phosphate, calcium, and bicarbonate. This approach was supported by subsequent studies confirming that the composite score better predicted complications than the initial CK level alone. However, these studies are based on data obtained in middle-aged patients (median age: 50.7 years). We found few studies that looked at prognostic factors according to age.

### Rhabdomyolysis and complement-once again, epithelial cells take center stage [^11127xSW]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is frequently associated with kidney injury. Unfortunately, there are no specific treatments for this condition, and patient care primarily consists of supportive measures. In this edition of Kidney International, Boudhabhay et al. demonstrate that myoglobin released from injured skeletal muscle cells triggers tubulointerstitial complement activation. In a mouse model of the disease, interventions that scavenged free heme or that prevented complement activation ameliorated kidney injury, raising the possibility that these strategies may be effective treatments for the condition.

Methods

Information sources

Two authors (LOC and ML) independently searched the medical literature published in three databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect) for articles that included in their title or abstract the keywords "rhabdomyolysis" or "crush syndrome". The search covered all articles from January 2006 to December 2015; we selected this period to increase knowledge and provide an updated review based on the existing literature from the past 10 years. All types of articles, including reviews (narrative and systematic), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control cohorts, case series, and case reports were screened for relevant content. Abstracts from the selected articles were read and, if considered eligible for further review, the complete article was obtained.

Search approach

Data collection and extraction were divided into two steps. The first step was intended to identify the articles with data relevant for extraction regarding definition, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. In order to qualify for inclusion the article was to contain any information regarding the following: definition, etiological classification, pathophysiology, or diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

The second step was intended to identify original research articles that included data regarding the epidemiology (e.g. risk factors, population and subgroup incidence, common etiologies, and morbidity and mortality) or treatment of rhabdomyolysis. To this end we searched MEDLINE using the keywords noted above ("rhabdomyolysis" or "crush syndrome") and added a filter selecting "humans" in the "Species" field. We selected for inclusion only original research articles which contained specifics of human epidemiological data or treatment. Excluded were articles referring to treatment of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI only, case reports, and laboratory investigations of rhabdomyolysis. Repeated publications and articles not in English or Spanish were also excluded. Figure 1 shows a flowchart for study selection.

Flowchart for study selection

Data collection

Controversies regarding article eligibility for data extraction were resolved by a third author (JV). The references from the selected articles that had been retrieved were also screened for additional possible references. After determining the relevance of each paper, the articles were divided into several files according to their topic relevance (definition, etiology and epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment). There was no limit to the number of files an article could appear in. Finally, the data from each topic file were summarized. No additional statistical analysis was performed.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^114Skvxb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate for patients with rhabdomyolysis closely relates to the underlying cause and concurrent comorbidities. Rhabdomyolysis with AKI is a common occurrence, and the impact of rhabdomyolysis on mortality may be mediated through AKI development. ICU patients diagnosed with both rhabdomyolysis and AKI have a reported mortality rate of 59%. Our research found an all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of 27.2% for ICU patients, increasing to 35.3% for those with rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, 10.6% of ICU patients opted to discontinue treatment due to poor prognoses, rising to 17.6% among those with rhabdomyolysis. The significantly higher rate of poor outcomes (POR) in the RML group (52.9%) compared to the control group (33.3%) underscores the association between the adverse prognostic and rhabdomyolysis in ICU settings. Our study investigating rhabdomyolysis and/or AKI revealed that both conditions were independently associated with higher rates of POR. Regarding the finding that the combination of rhabdomyolysis and AKI does not result in a significantly elevated POR compared to having either condition alone, several potential explanations can be considered. First, there may be a pathophysiological overlap between rhabdomyolysis and AKI, as both conditions share related mechanisms, such as myoglobin-induced tubular injury, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation, which may result in non-additive effects on POR. Second, statistical limitations, including the small sample size of patients with both conditions, may have reduced the study's power to detect significant differences in POR. Third, confounding variables, such as male gender, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation, identified as independent risk factors for poor outcomes, may overshadow the combined impact of rhabdomyolysis and AKI. Fourth, effective ICU management strategies, including early recognition and treatment of rhabdomyolysis and AKI, may mitigate their combined impact on outcomes. Further research with larger sample sizes and more detailed analyses of disease severity and treatment effects is needed to better understand these findings. Our findings indicate that AKI patients treated with blood purification therapy (BPT) in the ICU experience high rates of poor outcomes, irrespective of rhabdomyolysis. This likely reflects that BPT is reserved for severe or refractory conditions, meaning it targets critically ill patients already at high risk of adverse events and mortality.

### The risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis in the era of high-intensity statin therapy: does statin type matter? [^116pGtXH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management have placed greater emphasis on high-intensity statin dosing for those with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^111BbLJD]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially fatal disorder resulting from skeletal muscle injury that compromises the integrity of the sarcolemma. In adults, trauma and drugs have been reported as some of the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis. However, the causes of rhabdomyolysis in children vary widely from those in adults. Therefore, the current meta-analysis investigated etiologies, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

Our results have shown that infections are the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in children, accounting for about 40.6% of rhabdomyolysis cases. This finding compares favorably with a previous review article, which reported that infections constitute about one-third of rhabdomyolysis cases observed in pediatric patients. Various bacterial and viral infections have been associated with rhabdomyolysis; however, the available literature suggests that viral infections constitute the majority of infection-induced rhabdomyolysis. Indeed, Harmer and colleagues observed that infections were the predominant cause of rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients in the UK, with 75% attributed to viral myositis. Mannix et al. also indicated that viral myositis constituted 38.2% of all rhabdomyolysis cases in juvenile patients. In addition, Park and colleagues found that out of 26 infection-related rhabdomyolysis cases, 65% were attributed to influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus. These findings are further supported by a previous state-of-the-art review, which reported that viral infections are one of the leading triggers for rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^116vK3qV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

There is no role for RRT (either continuous (CRRT) or intermittent) in rhabdomyolysis to prevent AKI. The utilization of RRT in patients with rhabdomyolysis should be based on traditional indications for AKI and the degree of renal impairment.

In patients with rhabdomyolysis who develop AKI and need RRT, either CRRT or intermittent RRT should be used based on the degree of renal impairment and the clinical status of the patient. There are no recommendations regarding RRT modalities (filtration vs. diffusion), filter type (low vs. high cut-off membranes), or high-flow versus low-flow dialysis.

### Case report: a COVID-19 patient presenting with mild rhabdomyolysis [^115wF9dm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

The news was reported from the Wuhan region of China about a novel corona virus in the end of 2019. After spreading around the world, a pandemic was declared by the WHO. Depending on the different involvement of the disease, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.

Case Report

The patient in this case developed rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute kidney injury. He was treated with passive warming and intravenous fluids, with resolution of the kidney injury. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Patients who present with hypothermia may develop rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute kidney injury. If not identified, renal failure may develop. This is easily preventable if the practitioner is aware of the possible consequences of cold exposure, orders the appropriate test, and administers corrective treatment.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^111t9w5z]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our research indicated that infection was the predominant cause of rhabdomyolysis in children, followed by trauma and exercise. Other etiologies such as drugs, seizures, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, metabolic anomalies, burns, sepsis, and multiorgan failure comprise less than 10% of rhabdomyolysis cases but should not be overlooked as potential etiologies of rhabdomyolysis in children. Moreover, we found that AKI occurs in about 21.3% of children with rhabdomyolysis, but the mortality rate and CKD incidence are low. These findings imply that although AKI is a common complication, the prognosis of pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis is good and very few patients progress to CKD. We also found limited data on the treatment strategies for children with rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, large-sample prospective trials are needed to identify effective treatments for pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^1133yvRH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction.

This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease; explores potential pathogenic mechanisms; reviews current estimates of statin myopathy prevalence; and examines diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Summary

As a class, statins appear to be usually safe, well tolerated agents with an excellent risk: benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood owing to the relative rarity of its existence.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^1157DtUA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a systemic metabolic illness, with roughly 26,000 events recorded per year in the United States alone. This syndrome is typically marked by skeletal muscle necrosis which leads to leaking of muscle cell components, such as myoglobin, into the bloodstream. The disorder may appear as an asymptomatic illness with high creatine kinase (CK) values or become a serious health issue with significant elevation in CK, electrolyte deficiencies, acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Clinically, rhabdomyolysis is characterized by a triad of symptoms, comprising myalgia, weakness, and myoglobinuria, which appears as the generally recognized tea-colored urine. However, this stringent description of symptoms may be deceiving since the trio of symptoms is only found in < 10% of patients, and > 50% of patients have no complaints of muscular pain or weakness, despite presenting with stained urine. Therefore, elevated CK level is an exceptionally sensitive laboratory test for detecting muscular injury that has the potential to produce rhabdomyolysis, providing there is no concomitant heart or brain damage.

In adults, the available literature has shown that the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are drug or alcohol abuse, medicinal drug use, trauma, immobility, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, the data in pediatric patients is skewed towards different causes, with viral myositis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, exercise, and drug overdose being reported as the leading causes of rhabdomyolysis in this population. Moreover, the treatment strategies for pediatric rhabdomyolysis remain an area of ongoing clinical debate. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to identify and categorize etiologies of pediatric rhabdomyolysis, evaluate the different treatment strategies for rhabdomyolysis, and assess the outcomes of children with rhabdomyolysis.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115NFtLi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis risk and nocebo considerations — clinical rhabdomyolysis can involve myoglobinuria and can cause acute renal injury and is estimated to occur in < 1/10,000 individuals treated with a statin over five years, with risk higher in patients with risk factors for SAMS. There is no biochemical test or clinical syndrome complex to determine whether muscle symptoms are directly attributable to statin use, and muscle symptoms ascribed to statins are at least 5-fold more frequent in observational studies than in RCTs; in contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is characterized by the expectation or anticipation of harm, with patients misattributing muscle discomfort to the statin instead of other etiologies such as increased body aches from physical activity.

### A systematic review on the definition of rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis (RML) is an interdisciplinary condition due to muscle cell injury followed by the release of cell components into circulation. Etiology of RML has a broad range; a serious complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite its high relevance, there is no established formal definition for RML.

Objectives

A systematic review, focusing on RML definition, providing a recommendation for clinicians.

Method

Systematic literature research in PubMed and Embase (1968–07/2018).

Results

The database research presented 8136 articles in PubMed and 2151 in Embase. After screening, 614 papers were retained for statistical analysis. A retrospective study was the most used design (44%). A definition of RML was stated in 231 studies (37.6%), including a precise creatine kinase level (CK) cut-off most frequently (67.1%). In 53/231 (22.9%) studies the CK cut-off was > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), and in 64/231 (27.7%) studies > 1000 IU/L. Further components of definitions were elevated CK without specific thresholds, and clinical symptoms. Exclusion criteria referring to the definition of RML were established in 113 studies, including myocardial, renal, cerebral and neuromuscular characteristics.

Conclusion

At present, we recommend a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a CK cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L/ or CK > 5× ULN for the standard definition of a mild RML. Additionally measured myoglobinuria and AKI indicate a severe type of RML. Exclusion criteria as well as the chronological sequence need to be considered for a conclusive RML definition.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^112WZ4M1]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the combination of muscle symptoms (myalgia, weakness and swelling) and a substantial rise in serum CK (> 50 000 IU/L) in the setting of exercise. Serum CK rises after exercise are common and are asymptomatic in up to half of cases. Mean serum CK values 24 hours after marathons are 3322 IU/L for men (22× baseline) and 946 IU/L for women (9× baseline). The clinical significance of the serum CK concentration is unclear: 6000 IU/L has been cited as the minimum necessary for renal failurebut case reports indicate acute kidney injury may occur with a serum CK of 5000 IU/Land other studies suggest no safe serum concentration of CK. Pragmatically, a rise in CK to > 5000 U/L and/or evidence of end-organ damage (eg, myoglobinuria or decline in renal/liver function) is sufficient for a diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis may also experience fever, nausea and decreased/absent urine production. Supportive biochemical findings include hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis are caused by heat-related injuries, specifically heat stroke and heat injury. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision includes four overlapping categories relating to exertional heat conditions (table 1). These symptoms are worth enquiring about since rhabdomyolysis in the context of a clear-cut heat-related condition usually does not require further investigation.

### Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis [^115DmySp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Simvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are one of the most frequently prescribed class of medications in the United States, with over 15 million Americans taking these drugs. Relatively rare adverse effects related to the known toxic effects of these drugs are more common than generally realized. Clinically significant statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon but life-threatening adverse effect. We describe a case of simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Current knowledge of the pharmacology of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and the drug interactions that potentiate these adverse effects are discussed. The clinical features of rhabdomyolysis and current treatment recommendations are presented.

### The myopathy of statins [^1136tDmJ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line drugs for prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease. Despite the fact that statins are generally well tolerated and have a positive impact on human health, their myotoxic properties should keep physicians on alert. Mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy are still not fully understood. Phenotypic characteristics of patients, individual statin properties, and metabolic interaction with other drugs are important factors that may increase risk for statin myopathy. The lowest effective dose of statin should be used during treatment. Early recognition of myopathy and discontinuation of statin is critical in preventing serious sequelae such as rhabdomyolysis with all its complications.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^1128c9Fw]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a complex condition relevant to many medical disciplines, involving the rapid dissolution of damaged or injured skeletal muscle. This disruption of skeletal muscle integrity leads to the direct release of intracellular muscle components, including myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes, into the circulation and extracellular space. Clinical manifestations range from a largely asymptomatic illness with isolated serum CK level elevation (hyperCKaemia) to a life‐threatening condition with profound myoglobinuria, often leading to acute renal failure. Definitions vary, but rhabdomyolysis is most commonly defined as a clinical syndrome of severe myalgia, muscle weakness and swelling, with sudden elevation of CK levels, with or without the presence of myoglobinuria, and subsequent fall of CK levels.

Three retrospective cohort studies in a hospital setting, performed in 2005, 2009 and 2012, described the demographics and different causes of rhabdomyolysis. All three studies, performed when diagnostic genetic testing was not yet widely available, focused on external triggers as a cause for the rhabdomyolysis event and identified exogenous toxins as the most frequently reported trigger, followed by traumatic muscle injury [1, 2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that rhabdomyolysis events can be attributed to a combination of certain environmental factors (e.g. strenuous exercise and/or febrile infection) and a predisposing genotype [4]. A combination of external triggers and genetic predisposition may thus be required for an individual to exceed the threshold for developing rhabdomyolysis (Fig. 1), and the majority of rhabdomyolysis events may therefore have to be considered multifactorial. To identify episodes of rhabdomyolysis suggestive of an underlying genetic susceptibility, we have introduced the acronym RHABDO (Box 1) [5, 6]. This acronym was developed based on an extensive literature review and has been adopted in a recent review on exertional rhabdomyolysis [7]. It aims to distinguish the patients in whom the external triggers are sufficient to explain the episode of rhabdomyolysis from those in whom the external triggers insufficiently explain the (severity of the) rhabdomyolysis event.

### Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis and renal replacement therapy: a critical review [^1135oLgP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This review provides a comprehensive view on AKI induced by RM. Thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology will lead to new approaches for diagnosis and treatment, leading to the preservation of the kidney. Renal replacement methods have a supportive role but they are not the first line of treatment for AKI-induced RM, especially in cases of preserved diuresis. The kidney is a miraculous organ but it can be overwhelmed if the threshold is exceeded. We should try to preserve kidney function where possible by looking at the whole picture.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### Lamotrigine extended-release tablet, film coated… [^116JKUkT]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
- **Life-threatening serious rash and/or rash-related death**: Discontinue at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related.
- Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Consider this diagnosis and evaluate patients immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of systemic inflammation. Discontinue Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets if an alternative etiology is not established. WARNING: SERIOUS SKIN RASHES Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets can cause serious rashes requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of these rashes, which have included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is approximately 0. 8% in pediatric patients receiving immediate-release lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy for epilepsy and
0. 3% in adults on adjunctive therapy for epilepsy.

In a prospectively followed cohort of 1, 983 pediatric patients with epilepsy taking adjunctive immediate-release lamotrigine, there was 1 rash-related death. Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets are not approved for patients younger than 13 years. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or rash-related death have been reported in adult and pediatric patients, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors. Nearly all cases of life-threatening rashes caused by immediate-release lamotrigine have occurred within 2 to 8 weeks of treatment initiation. However, isolated cases have occurred after prolonged treatment. Accordingly, duration of therapy cannot be relied upon as means to predict the potential risk heralded by the first appearance of a rash.

Although benign rashes are also caused by Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets, it is not possible to predict reliably which rashes will prove to be serious or life threatening. Accordingly, Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets should ordinarily be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE.

### Label: ADALIMUMAB-adalimumab-aaty kit… [^112RRWXh]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

- **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA.
- **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis**: reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in patients 2 years of age and older. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
- Administer by subcutaneous injection Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis: Adults: 40 mg every other week.
- Some patients with RA not receiving methotrexate may benefit from increasing the dosage to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.
- Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.

Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Adalimumab-aaty for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis is 40 mg administered every other week. Methotrexate, other non-biologic DMARDS, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, and/or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Adalimumab-aaty.
5. 1 Serious Infections Patients treated with adalimumab products, including Adalimumab-aaty, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.

Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^1172pG6L]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The current study has several limitations that are important to note during the interpretation of its findings. First, a high interstudy heterogeneity was recorded in most pooled outcomes. This heterogeneity might have been contributed by the variation in the definition of rhabdomyolysis, sample size, and geographical region. However, the effect of heterogeneity on the overall effect size was minimized using random-effects model. Second, all included studies were retrospective, indicating that our findings may have been influenced by bias inherent in these studies, since they may not have meticulously documented some patient information or may have overlooked certain patients owing to misclassification. Third, all the studies were conducted in single centers; therefore, results from these studies might have not been representative of the general pediatric population. Fourth, most studies had small sample sizes, meaning our results might be subject to small sample bias. Fifth, only articles written in English were included in the analysis. Therefore, it is possible that our study was subject to selection bias as data from non-English literature was intentionally omitted. Sixth, this meta-analysis exclusively evaluated pediatric rhabdomyolysis; however, we acknowledge that the lack of direct comparison with adult populations might have limited the broader generalizability of our study. Moreover, including separate data for adult populations was beyond the scope of this review and would have confounded our analysis and introduced significant clinical heterogeneity. Therefore, studies directly comparing adult and pediatric rhabdomyolysis are needed to better inform age-specific differences in etiologies, treatment, and outcomes. Finally, due to paucity of data, we did not carry out any meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of different treatment strategies or predictive factors for AKI. As such, future studies reporting these findings can help to address this limitation.

### Rhabdomyolysis and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^113rKW9S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Data Source

Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals.

Conclusions

Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115s1LDh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon but important condition seen in critically ill and injured patients. Surgical critical care providers should be familiar with the less frequently encountered metabolic etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, in addition to the well-known traumatic causes. The diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical and laboratory findings and should lead to prompt intervention to halt any processes causing muscle damage and to prevent or treat known complications of the disease. A consensus summary for the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis is provided in (table 2). Although traditional therapies such as urine alkalinization and diuresis are often employed in an effort to prevent rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, evidence-based treatments with outcome benefits are lacking. There is a critical need for quality research.
