## Question

How is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle of definitive therapy, namely cannabis cessation. Then, I should verify acute emergency department (ED) management priorities and the evidence hierarchy for antiemetics and adjuncts. Next, I will examine pathophysiology to explain treatment resistance, followed by long-term prevention and diagnostic differentiation from cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm while double-checking dosing and regulatory nuances.

> Let me first confirm the bedrock principle: complete cannabis cessation is the only definitive cure for CHS, and all other measures are supportive or abortive in nature, not curative. High-credibility guidance from ESNM/UEG and the AGA CPU emphasizes withdrawal of cannabis as the cornerstone, with resolution requiring sustained abstinence to meet Rome IV diagnostic standards, typically at least 4 weeks and often longer to ensure receptor recovery and clinical durability [^11375CAr] [^113BTxnA] [^111Zm5Mn] [^114ZUYUx].

> Wait, I should verify how long to counsel abstinence before declaring remission. Given THC's lipophilicity and CB1 receptor adaptations, at least 4 weeks is a pragmatic minimum, but several experts recommend following patients for 6–12 months or at least three typical cycles to confirm sustained resolution, with toxicology screening as needed to document abstinence and reduce diagnostic misclassification [^111Zm5Mn] [^116WTWMQ] [^114Dexx5].

> Next, I will examine acute ED priorities. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — supportive care remains universal: treat volume depletion and correct electrolytes aggressively, as dehydration and metabolic derangements are common and prognostically relevant in the hyperemetic phase [^115xHZx6] [^115xHZx6].

> I should confirm "usual care" antiemetics and their limitations. The SAEM GRACE-4 guidance includes serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron 4–8 mg IV/PO, as part of usual care, but acknowledges that CHS frequently shows poor responsiveness to serotonin-targeted agents, necessitating escalation beyond ondansetron when initial doses fail [^115CSzFa] [^115xHZx6] [^1152S7Xq].

> Now, let me evaluate dopamine antagonists, since CHS often responds better to D2 blockade. The GRACE-4 recommendations suggest adding haloperidol or droperidol for symptomatic management in adults with CHS; emerging evidence indicates clinical benefit versus usual care, with shorter stays and reduced rescue antiemetic use in some cohorts, though high-quality RCT data remain limited [^116KJ6ov] [^112vecNt].

> Wait, I need to check dosing and regulatory language to avoid errors. For droperidol, I initially thought the dosing range was 0.625–1.25 mg IV; but hold on, I should verify against the FDA SPL specific to CHS. The SPL lists 0.625 mg IV once for adult CHS, so I will correct to that dose to align with the labeled off-label use summary; for haloperidol, case-based practice in CHS commonly uses 1–5 mg IV with cardiac monitoring as clinically indicated given QT risk, while acknowledging that definitive CHS-specific haloperidol dosing data are still evolving [^1166PsbJ] [^111Gz5m1] [^115xHZx6] [^1152S7Xq].

> I should also consider benzodiazepines when anxiety, autonomic arousal, or refractory nausea are prominent. ESNM/UEG endorses considering benzodiazepines in acute CHS; lorazepam 1 mg IV or diazepam 5–10 mg IV have supportive case-based evidence, though they are adjunctive rather than definitive therapy and must be used judiciously [^113V3F57] [^115xHZx6].

> Next, I will examine topical capsaicin, but wait, evidence has been mixed and I should double-check guideline positioning. GRACE-4 suggests offering topical capsaicin in addition to usual care, and ESNM/UEG concurs; mechanistically, TRPV1 agonism may attenuate emesis via substance P depletion, though meta-analytic and cohort data show variable efficacy and modest effects on ED throughput [^115CSzFa] [^116TFh9f] [^113V3F57] [^114nuRwh] [^112eskrB].

> Hot showering is a hallmark patient behavior, but I need to ensure I do not overinterpret it as therapy. Compulsive hot bathing is common and diagnostically suggestive, yet it is neither necessary nor specific and should be framed as temporary symptomatic relief rather than treatment, with emphasis on nonjudgmental care to mitigate stigma that can impair engagement [^117QTqHp] [^112fVQes] [^1179xBda] [^113med2p].

> Let me consider alternative or lower-evidence agents when first-line measures fail. Promethazine, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine appear in case reports and reviews, and proton pump inhibitors may help pain or esophagitis, but these are not guideline-endorsed CHS-specific therapies and should be individualized with attention to side-effect profiles and QT risk when combined with antidopaminergics [^115xHZx6] [^111zTKFw].

> I will now examine why standard antiemetics often fail in CHS. Chronic THC exposure is thought to downregulate CB1 and dysregulate TRPV1 signaling across gut–brain circuits, which may undermine serotonin-centric antiemesis and explain the relative superiority of dopamine antagonists and TRPV1-targeted strategies in many cases, although mechanistic data remain indirect [^112eskrB] [^1122pdCc] [^111zTKFw] [^112vecNt].

> But wait, what about long-term prevention and care coordination. Sustained cannabis abstinence remains paramount; I should confirm follow-up intervals and monitoring. Follow through at 4 weeks, then extend to 6–12 months to confirm durable remission, consider urine toxicology to verify abstinence when the diagnosis is uncertain, explicitly avoid opioids, and integrate addiction medicine and mental health support to reduce relapse and ED recidivism [^111Zm5Mn] [^116WTWMQ] [^114Dexx5] [^115xHZx6] [^113TRjZG] [^114AAebo].

> Let me reconsider prophylaxis when the phenotype overlaps CVS, especially between episodes. Tricyclic antidepressants can be considered for CVS-like prophylaxis, but responses are mixed in chronic cannabis users and data are limited, so I need to set expectations and prioritize cessation first while using TCAs selectively in refractory cases [^1152S7Xq].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic distinctions and avoid premature labeling. Rome IV requires resolution of vomiting after sustained cannabis cessation; many historical reports lacked adequate follow-up, risking overdiagnosis of CHS, and CHS may be more resistant to ED therapies than CVS, necessitating compassionate, stigma-aware communication and careful longitudinal assessment before final attribution [^114ZUYUx] [^114Dexx5] [^1179xBda] [^113med2p].

> I need to ensure the practical algorithm is coherent and evidence-prioritized. In the ED, start with IV fluids and electrolytes, give ondansetron as usual care with the expectation of limited efficacy, escalate promptly to a dopamine antagonist (e.g., droperidol 0.625 mg IV once or haloperidol 1–5 mg IV with ECG precautions), consider lorazepam for anxiolysis and refractory nausea, and add topical capsaicin when available; all patients should receive strong counseling for cannabis cessation with arranged follow-up to confirm abstinence and recovery [^111Na1MN] [^115CSzFa] [^1166PsbJ] [^115xHZx6] [^113V3F57] [^111Zm5Mn].

The cornerstone of CHS management is **cannabis cessation**, which leads to symptom resolution [^115xHZx6] and prevents recurrence [^11375CAr] [^114GvN6v]. For acute episodes, provide **IV fluids and electrolytes** for dehydration, and use haloperidol or droperidol as first-line antiemetics [^111Na1MN]; topical capsaicin is a recommended adjunct [^115CSzFa]. Standard serotonin antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) are often ineffective [^1152S7Xq], and benzodiazepines may be considered for refractory cases [^113V3F57]. Educate patients on the **link between cannabis use and symptoms** [^113TRjZG], and refer to **addiction services** to support abstinence and reduce relapse risk [^114GvN6v].

---

## Acute management of CHS

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **intravenous fluids and electrolytes**, which are essential to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances from persistent vomiting. **Hot showers or baths** provide temporary symptom relief [^114zBk5a], likely via TRPV1 activation [^112eskrB], but are not definitive treatment [^112hpdVR].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

#### First-line pharmacological treatments

- **Haloperidol**: Recommended for acute symptom control [^111Na1MN]; 0.5–5 mg IV/IM, repeat every 30–60 minutes as needed.

- **Droperidol**: Alternative to haloperidol [^111Na1MN]; 0.625–1.25 mg IV/IM, repeat every 30–60 minutes as needed.

- **Topical capsaicin cream**: Apply 0.075% to the abdomen every 4–6 hours; activates TRPV1 and reduces nausea/vomiting [^115CSzFa] [^114nuRwh].

---

#### Second-line pharmacological treatments

**Benzodiazepines** such as lorazepam 1–2 mg IV/IM may be used for refractory cases or significant anxiety, while **serotonin antagonists** like ondansetron 4–8 mg IV/IM can be tried, though they are often ineffective [^1152S7Xq] [^111zTKFw].

---

#### Potential complications and side effects of treatments

- **Haloperidol and droperidol**: Risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, QT prolongation, and sedation; monitor ECG and use cautiously in patients with cardiac risk factors [^111Gz5m1] [^111Na1MN].

- **Capsaicin cream**: May cause local skin irritation or burning sensation [^114nuRwh].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Risk of sedation, respiratory depression, and dependence with prolonged use [^113V3F57].

---

## Long-term management and prevention of recurrence

### Cannabis cessation

**Cannabis cessation** is the only definitive treatment [^11375CAr], with symptoms typically resolving within weeks to months after stopping cannabis [^112hpdVR] [^114zBk5a]. Patient education explaining the link between chronic cannabis use and CHS improves adherence to cessation. Referral to addiction specialists or counseling services supports abstinence and helps prevent relapse [^114AAebo] [^114GvN6v].

---

### Follow-up care

Regular follow-up is needed to monitor for **relapse** [^114AAebo] and provide ongoing support for **cannabis cessation** [^113BTxnA]. A **psychiatric evaluation** should assess and manage coexisting psychiatric conditions that may complicate cessation.

---

## Patient education and counseling strategies

- **Clear communication**: Explain the association between chronic cannabis use and CHS symptoms [^113BTxnA].

- **Emphasize abstinence**: Highlight that cessation is the only definitive treatment [^11375CAr].

- **Provide resources**: Offer information on addiction support services and counseling [^114GvN6v].

- **Address misconceptions**: Correct beliefs about cannabis's antiemetic properties [^1122pdCc].

- **Encourage follow-up**: Stress the importance of regular follow-up to monitor relapse and support cessation [^114AAebo].

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment phase** | **Recommended interventions** |
|-|-|
| Acute management | - IV fluids and electrolytes <br/> - Haloperidol or droperidol <br/> - Topical capsaicin cream <br/> - Benzodiazepines (second-line) <br/> - Serotonin antagonists (often ineffective) |

In summary, when the literature is considered in aggregate, there are some differences in the demographic profile (male vs. female predominance); however, there is considerable overlap in the acute presentations of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) and cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). Our review of the literature reinforces the proposal that CHS is a subset of CVS, where chronic cannabis use triggers symptoms in patients genetically predisposed to develop CVS.

Future studies should focus on standardized data collection, including cannabis use patterns and accurate phenotyping and genotyping of patients with CVS and CHS. Specifically, the potency of cannabis used, and the antecedent duration and frequency of use should be characterized to assess its impact. Patients with presumed CHS should be advised to abstain from cannabis and should receive ongoing care from a multidisciplinary team, including mental health and substance use experts. These patients should also be offered standard care with prophylactic and abortive therapy similar to patients with CVS. This approach is critical given the gaps in our knowledge about the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CHS, as well as the stigma associated with the disorder.

Future studies should also focus on elucidating the underlying pathophysiology, such as the role of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both CVS and CHS. Advancing our knowledge in these areas may help in the development of novel and targeted therapies. Additionally, government and industry-sponsored funding, along with participation from patient advocacy groups such as the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association, will be crucial.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^115xHZx6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The following expert consensus treatment guideline is available to assist with the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of CHS:

- **Cessation of cannabis use**: This is the only standard treatment reported in the literature. CHS can recur upon the resumption of cannabis use if the patient is in the recovery phase. Generally, cannabinoid receptors are thought to return to normal levels after four weeks of cessation.

- **Avoiding opioids**: This helps to avoid addiction. These actions should be aided by supportive therapy, which includes:
	- IV fluids for dehydration
	- Antiemetic medications such as ondansetron (4–8 mg IV or orally), promethazine (12.5 mg IV), and metoclopramide (10 mg IV)
	- Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (1 mg IV), diazepam (5–10 mg IV), and diphenhydramine (25–50 mg IV) have also been found to be helpful

- **Additional treatments**:
	- A hot shower may alleviate symptoms and be beneficial to the patient.
	- The application of capsaicin cream to the abdomen may provide some symptomatic relief for patients.
	- Education, reassurance, and referral to cessation programs are important management factors.
	- For refractory and severe nausea or vomiting in CHS, haloperidol should be considered.

Awareness of this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations, save costs, and reduce hospital admissions in selected patients.

The following are essential points of in-patient care:

- Good history taking, including illicit cannabis use, may reduce health costs.
- Cessation of cannabis use is the only known successful cure for this condition, as demonstrated in this patient.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^1152S7Xq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Management of CHS primarily depends on the severity of symptoms, development of complications, and prevention of further recurrence. Previous reports indicate that usual antiemetic agents, such as ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and promethazine, are not as effective. Various treatment options have been tried with CHS. In light of the unresponsiveness to usual antiemetic agents, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), capsaicin, and corticosteroids have been administered with variable results.

Given the promising results from intravenous haloperidol, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing it to ondansetron is currently underway. Droperidol use in CHS has been reported rarely, probably due to its restricted use in the US following the 2001 FDA black box warning about potential QT prolongation. Nevertheless, droperidol is associated with less use of antiemetics and shorter total hospital stays. Various mechanisms are involved in symptom cessation via dopaminergic, serotoninergic, substance P, and TRPV1 signaling. The prophylactic use of TCA for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has shown mixed responses in treating symptoms, with or without the use of cannabis.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an episodic syndrome characterized by cyclic vomiting in the context of prolonged cannabis use. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine Toxicology Special Interest Group has provided guidance to assist emergency medicine clinicians in recognizing and treating patients with CHS. Considerations regarding the recognition, investigation, and communication are discussed, alongside recommendations for treatment options, which include haloperidol and capsaicin. The focus is on making recommendations based on the best available evidence.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^113med2p]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

**Emergency department issues and the patient experience**: Despite the best attempts to abort episodes at home, most patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) will seek emergency department (ED) treatment at some point. Repeated visits to the ED can be frustrating for both patients and providers. Stigmatization and perceived patient-blaming of those in a vulnerable state can amplify an already frustrating and complex patient experience. It is worth considering the treatment environment and the processes of care that occur in the ED. Some emergency or urgent care centers offer a calm, reassuring environment where staff acknowledge a CVS/CHS diagnosis and initiate effective treatments. However, this is not always the patient or family's experience. Despite the best efforts of staff, emergency departments are often the last resort for many issues in the healthcare system. The typical ED may be harshly lit, noisy, frightening, unresponsive, or impersonal. Care may not occur for many hours after an initial assessment. Patients who are judged to have non-life-threatening conditions are given a lower priority than those with active bleeding, trauma, or other more dramatic presentations due to the nature of limited resources and the necessity for triage. Consequently, patients and families often find the ED experience frustrating, which may delay their presentation to the ED well into the course of their episode when symptoms might have become more refractory to simpler interventions. Lastly, patients with CVS may use cannabis intermittently, many times specifically to abort an episode.

### Rare but relevant: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^1133nogx]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a rare syndrome that occurs in frequent and chronic cannabis users. It is characterized by cyclical vomiting and gastrointestinal symptoms. CHS is frequently misdiagnosed, resulting in extensive investigations and delayed diagnosis and treatment. Standard anti-emetic treatments are typically not effective, and no standardized treatment protocol exists for CHS. Bathing or showering in hot water is often reported to relieve symptoms.

Little is known about the etiology of CHS, as the literature is predominantly informed by case reports and chart reviews. Similarly, little is known about the demographics and cannabis use patterns of those who develop CHS. The number of CHS cases globally appears to have risen following the liberalization of cannabis regulation and access in some countries, underscoring the need for wider recognition of CHS in emergency care and by the public.

### Pediatric cannabinoid hyperemesis: two cases [^1168FZiU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis has recently been described in the literature. It is a syndrome characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis in the setting of chronic marijuana abuse and, at the time of writing, has been described only in adults. We describe the syndrome in two pediatric patients, for whom extensive gastrointestinal workups failed to identify a clear cause, and cessation of marijuana use resulted in the alleviation of their symptoms. As in most published adult cases, compulsive bathing was present in both of these cases.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^116Gzjnc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Both CHS and CVS are characterized by episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and often abdominal pain that are relentless and debilitating. They are typically self‐limited in nature, with or without supportive therapy. These clinical features support the hypothesis that CHS is a subset of CVS where chronic cannabis use either unmasks or propagates symptoms in individuals predisposed to develop CVS. However, many reports of CHS include patients presenting for the first time with vomiting (often associated with other potential causes of emesis, like pregnancy). Given the limited details provided, these observations reflect the inadequacies of the published reports. They also raise the possibility that chronic cannabis use can cause symptoms of nausea and vomiting that are not episodic in pattern, thus being distinct from CVS. This possibility needs to be confirmed or refuted in future series, perhaps best addressed in a matched cohort study.

- **Treatment options for CHS**: It has been contended that patients with CHS do not respond to standard therapies used for CVS. One report determined that chronic cannabis users with CVS respond less often to prophylactic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants compared to those not using cannabis. However, no multivariate comparisons were performed, and other known confounding factors (use of opioids and associated psychiatric comorbidities), which are associated with poor responses to TCAs, were not considered. Conversely, another case series of patient…

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^116Sis3d]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) are both characterized by episodic, acute transitions from asymptomatic states to highly symptomatic states of nausea, repetitive vomiting, and often severe abdominal pain. Patients with CVS and CHS face significant challenges in aborting or mitigating episodes at home and often require emergency department (ED)-based care.

- **Purpose**: This paper reviews the treatment approach to abort acute CVS and CHS episodes at home and in ED settings. Multiple pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been demonstrated to potentially abort CVS or CHS episodes. Systemic pharmacologic agents often used as abortive therapy include triptans, antiemetics, anxiolytics, NK-1 receptor antagonists, antipsychotics, sedatives in general, and various analgesic/anti-inflammatory medications. Nonsystemic, nonpharmacologic approaches include reducing external stimuli (quiet room, dim lights, etc), and hot water bathing or the application of topical capsaicin cream. More research is needed to develop evidence-based, individualized abortive treatment plans, as well as to determine whether the abortive treatment for CVS requires a fundamentally different approach than for CHS. When home-based approaches fail, all patients with CVS or CHS should receive nonjudgmental, informed, and compassionate care in the ED to abort their episode. Patients with more severe forms of CVS/CHS who require more frequent ED utilization should develop care plans with their ED to assure predictable and effective treatment.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^112tiLzG]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by episodes of severe nausea and vomiting. It is currently defined by the Rome IV criteria. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) shares many clinical features with CVS, except for its association with chronic, heavy cannabis use. CHS was first described in 2004 by Allen et al. in nine patients. This report was followed by several case series and individual case reports describing a similar pattern of episodic nausea and severe vomiting referred to as "hyperemesis". Heavy cannabis use preceded the onset of symptoms in these patients, suggesting that chronic cannabis use leads to hyperemesis. A diagnostic framework for CHS was proposed, although there has been considerable variation in the diagnostic criteria used in the literature to define cases. This heterogeneity has led to significant controversy and uncertainty about CHS as a distinct entity.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^111aLQ9G]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Cannabis use is legalized in many countries. We present a patient in their 40s who complained of abdominal pain and associated nausea and vomiting. The patient had previously been seen in various hospitals, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain. The patient had a chronic history of smoking cannabis and nicotine and drinking alcohol. Abdominal examination revealed no masses, and an abdominal X-ray was normal. Blood tests and gastroduodenoscopy revealed no obvious etiology. Intravenous fluids, together with antiemetics and proton pump inhibitors, were administered. The patient also received counseling and was advised to stop cannabis use. At discharge, the patient was well and was asked to return for a review in 2 weeks, and thereafter monthly for a period of 6 months after stopping cannabis use. The patient reported no symptoms despite continued cigarette and alcohol use. A suspected cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) became a consideration. Awareness of cannabis-related disorders such as CHS may assist in avoiding costly hospital workups.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment-a systematic review [^114zBk5a]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a syndrome of cyclic vomiting associated with cannabis use. Our objective is to summarize the available evidence on CHS diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. We performed a systematic review using MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from January 2000 through September 24, 2015. Articles eligible for inclusion were evaluated using the Grading and Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Data were abstracted from the articles and case reports and were combined in a cumulative synthesis.

The frequency of identified diagnostic characteristics was calculated from the cumulative synthesis, and evidence for pathophysiologic hypotheses as well as treatment options was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The systematic search returned 2178 articles. After duplicates were removed, 1253 abstracts were reviewed, and 183 were included. Fourteen diagnostic characteristics were identified, and the frequency of major characteristics was as follows: history of regular cannabis use for any duration of time (100%), cyclic nausea and vomiting (100%), resolution of symptoms after stopping cannabis (96.8%), compulsive hot baths with symptom relief (92.3%), male predominance (72.9%), abdominal pain (85.1%), and at least weekly cannabis use (97.4%).

The pathophysiology of CHS remains unclear, with a dearth of research dedicated to investigating its underlying mechanism. Supportive care with intravenous fluids, dopamine antagonists, topical capsaicin cream, and avoidance of narcotic medications is recommended.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^111Zm5Mn]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

We (author TV assisted by YP) performed data abstraction on all these CHS cases, including demographic data, cannabis-use patterns (duration and frequency of use), hot shower bathing patterns, and duration of follow-up. We then applied Rome IV criteria to both case series and individual cases to determine the number of patients who actually met the Rome IV criteria for CHS. Rome IV criteria require "sustained cessation of cannabis use resulting in resolution of symptoms" to make a diagnosis of CHS. However, since the Rome IV criteria do not specify the minimum required duration for abstinence from cannabis, we chose a minimum duration of at least a month (4 weeks) of abstinence from cannabis prior to the resolution of symptoms to make a diagnosis of CHS. This particular duration of time was chosen due to the prolonged 2- to 3-month elimination period that results from the lipophilic storage of cannabis in the setting of chronic use. Although this represented a reasonable minimum length of time to demonstrate improvement or resolution of symptoms following abstinence, this duration of time may still be insufficient. Even after THC is cleared, restoration of CB receptor function may take even longer. Thus, patients may need to be followed for a length of time that equals at minimum three typical cycles or a period of 6–12 months to determine whether cannabis cessation truly results in a durable resolution of symptoms.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^117WKYXc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Research indicates that cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. The growing movement in support of cannabis use has led to its legalization for medical purposes in 30 states and for recreational use in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Consequently, an increasing number of adolescents and adults are routinely exposed to cannabis in the United States. Although cannabis contains over 200 constituents, its psychotropic effects are primarily due to THC. Another compound in cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has acute antiemetic effects but does not share the psychotropic effects of THC. Cannabis preparations commonly used for recreational purposes contain increasing amounts of THC relative to CBD content. These changes in the THC:CBD ratio are believed to account for the increasing toxicity associated with cannabis use.

Cannabis has been used for its purported medical benefits as an antiemetic; however, recent reports have linked its use with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS is now defined by Rome IV criteria.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^112SQwo6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Our review of the literature identified a total of 25 case series (n = 271) and 105 individual case reports of patients identified with CHS. Most of the reported case series and case studies predated the publication of Rome IV criteria for CHS. Not surprisingly, these earlier reports had significant heterogeneity in the criteria used to define CHS cases. Some authors diagnosed CHS when patients presented with cyclic vomiting in the context of chronic cannabis use, while others used cyclic vomiting with hot shower bathing patterns as pathognomonic features of CHS.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^116WTWMQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Other important considerations included the length of follow-up after abstinence from cannabis. Ongoing evaluation in an outpatient setting to assess response to abstinence from cannabis, prior to making a diagnosis of CHS, is critical given the episodic nature of the illness. For example, a patient who experienced three cycles per year while regularly using cannabis would need to be followed for at least one year after abstinence from cannabis to establish a diagnosis of CHS. Similarly, a patient with an episode every six weeks would need to be followed for approximately four to five months after cannabis cessation.

Because CHS and CVS both consist of self-limiting episodes of emesis, it is crucial that the clinician who encounters a patient with possible CHS recognizes the need to establish causality prior to ascribing this diagnosis. The exact length of time that one would need to abstain from cannabis before resolution or reduction of CVS episodes occurs is not known, as this will likely depend on the duration, quantity, and potency of cannabis use, as well as genetic factors that could influence the response to cannabis use in individual patients.

We acknowledge that maintaining complete abstinence from cannabis can be a challenge given patient perceptions and beliefs about cannabis use and its potential therapeutic benefits. A limitation of both the Rome IV criteria and our proposed criteria is the challenge with patients who cannot or are reluctant to stop cannabis due to perceived benefits.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis: a case series [^115qpj9g]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid use is prevalent in the United States, with recent reports indicating increased usage among younger Americans. Traditionally, cannabinoids have been used recreationally or as antiemetics; however, recent reports suggest that chronic abuse can result in the paradoxical effect of a cyclic vomiting syndrome, termed cannabinoid hyperemesis.

- **Objective**: We report on this recently described clinical syndrome characterized by severe nausea and hyperemesis in the setting of chronic cannabinoid use.

- **Case reports**: We report the cases of three patients who presented to two academic emergency departments (EDs) on multiple occasions with nausea and vomiting in the setting of chronic cannabinoid use. There were extensive medical evaluations and frequent inpatient hospital admissions before the diagnosis of cannabinoid hyperemesis was considered.

- **Conclusion**: With the relatively high prevalence of cannabinoid use in the United States and increasing interest in the applications of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, this entity may be encountered in the ED. Cannabinoid hyperemesis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with similar symptoms.

### Proper counseling for diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: A case report [^116BNmzX]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an increasingly recognized condition linked to chronic cannabis use, yet it remains frequently overlooked in clinical practice. The syndrome is characterized by cyclic episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, often relieved temporarily by hot showers or baths. With the rising prevalence of cannabis use following its legalization, the incidence of CHS has surged, presenting a significant challenge in both diagnosis and management within primary healthcare settings. Understanding the epidemiology, risk factors, and potential long-term sequelae of CHS is crucial for timely identification and intervention. This case report highlights the challenge of diagnosing and managing CHS in primary healthcare.

- **Objective**: To emphasize the importance of proper counseling and the use of Rome IV criteria in diagnosing CHS. This approach may reduce patient suffering and unnecessary investigation.

- **Case**: A 22-year-old female with chronic, daily cannabis use presented with recurring episodes of intense nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain over a 2-year period. Extensive diagnostic evaluations were inconclusive. A tentative diagnosis of CHS was made by a medical student and family doctor based on published criteria. The Rome IV criteria were then applied for confirmation of diagnosis and management. As part of the management plan, the patient was advised to cease cannabis use for a minimum of 3 months. Initially, symptom improvement was reported with cannabis cessation. However, symptoms recurred following a relapse in cannabis use.

### Endocannabinoid signaling in stress, nausea, and vomiting [^1122pdCc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Classical antiemetics that target the serotonin system may not be effective in treating certain conditions such as cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Consequently, there is a need for improved therapies to manage symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Cannabis is frequently used for its purported antiemetic and anxiolytic effects due to the regulation of these processes by the endocannabinoid system (ECS). However, significant evidence suggests that cannabinoids can also induce nausea, vomiting, and increase anxiety in some cases, particularly at higher doses. This paradoxical effect may be attributable to ECS dysregulation, which alters its ability to maintain these processes and potentially contributes to the pathophysiology of CVS or CHS.

- **Purpose**: This review aims to highlight the role of the ECS in regulating stress, nausea, and vomiting. It explores how prolonged cannabis use, as in CHS, or increased stress can lead to ECS dysregulation and influence its modulation of these functions. The review also examines the evidence for the involvement of ECS and stress systems' dysfunction in CVS and CHS to enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these conditions.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is associated with high disease burden: An internet-based survey [^115KXRG3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is an underrecognized condition associated with recurring vomiting and abdominal pain in individuals with prolonged cannabis use. This study utilized an internet-based survey targeting individuals with self-reported cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome to assess the disease burden and examine associations between heavy cannabis use, early initiation of cannabis use, and episode frequency. A total of 1,052 participants were included, with the majority reporting frequent cannabis use and significant health care utilization, including emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The study highlights the substantial disease burden associated with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in an online support group cohort and underscores the potential risks of heavy daily cannabis use and cannabis use starting in adolescence. Future studies on heavy cannabis users are necessary to further elucidate cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and its link to daily cannabis use and the dangers of heavy use in adolescence.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^1127Zunv]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Cannabis use is legalized in many countries. We present a patient in their 40s who complained of recurrent abdominal pain, associated nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been seen in various hospitals, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain. They had a chronic history of smoking cannabis and nicotine as well as drinking alcohol. An abdominal examination revealed no masses, and an abdominal X-ray was normal. Blood tests and gastroduodenoscopy revealed no obvious etiology. Intravenous fluids, together with antiemetics and proton pump inhibitors, were administered. The patient also received counseling and was advised to stop cannabis use. At discharge, the patient was well and asked to return for review in two weeks, and thereafter monthly for six months after stopping cannabis use. The patient reported no recurrent symptoms despite continued cigarette and alcohol use. Suspected cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) became a consideration. Awareness of cannabis-related disorders such as CHS may assist in avoiding costly hospital workups.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^117Mt18t]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The first description of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) was in 2004. It is characterized by cyclical nausea and vomiting, accompanied by abdominal pain after prolonged high-dose cannabis use. Patients generally have a history of multiple emergency department visits and hospitalizations, followed by extensive workups including diagnostic imaging and invasive procedures. The recent legalization of cannabis in many countries raises concerns about increased use.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^112kiTwH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

CHS is an important manifestation of long-term cannabis use, associated with episodic nausea and vomiting similar to CVS. Rome IV criteria provide objectivity to CHS diagnosis as significant heterogeneity was noted in previous cases for its diagnosis. Despite this, Rome IV may underestimate CHS cases due to a lack of details about the definition of chronic use and the duration of cannabis abstinence.

Pathological hot water bathing is observed in CHS patients more often than in functional nausea and vomiting, although it is neither sensitive nor specific for CHS. The ECS and the ratio of THC to CBs provide important insights into cannabis's biphasic effect on emesis and its role in affecting brain stem and HPA axis signaling.

The management of CHS is primarily conservative, involving aggressive volume repletion, the use of antiemetics, and cannabis cessation with rehabilitation. The prevalence of cannabis use disorder is poised to increase with the decreasing legal thresholds for recreational use. Raising awareness and the availability of further CHS data in the future will pave the way for targeted novel therapeutic interventions for CHS.

### Endocannabinoid system and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: a narrative update [^113KhVR5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cannabis use has been increasing in the United States and throughout the world. It is derived from one of the earliest plants cultivated by humans, *Cannabis sativa*. Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide. The cannabis plant contains more than 400 chemicals, of which over 100 cannabinoids, such as cannabigerol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol, have been identified. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an essential role in the effects of cannabis on end organs.

Although cannabis use has been reported for many decades, some unique adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, termed cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), have been noted recently. The legal status of cannabis in the United States has been rapidly changing, varying from state to state. The incidence of CHS is expected to rise with increased access to cannabis in the United States. Furthermore, CHS is frequently underdiagnosed due to a lack of uniform criteria, the subjective nature of symptoms, and overlap with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS).

Understanding the ECS and its role in the biphasic response (proemetic and antiemetic) of CHS is critical for explaining its pathophysiology. As the use of cannabis increases globally, awareness of CHS is warranted for early recognition and prompt treatment to avoid complications. We describe the putative mechanism of CHS and provide an overview of the clinical features in these patients. Furthermore, we highlight the differences between CHS and CVS, with important differentials to consider.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^114Dexx5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

In summary, the case series provided fewer clinical details on the patients with proposed cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) than did the individual patient reports. This was particularly evident in the larger series by Simonetto et al. (98 patients) and Schreck et al. (29 patients), in which details regarding cannabis cessation were difficult to extract. Follow-up of patients following abstinence from cannabis was also missing in most of the case series and case reports, a major limitation that questions the validity of the diagnosis of CHS in many of these cases. Future reports describing CHS should include greater rigor in characterizing symptom improvement or resolution with prolonged and documented (e.g. toxicology screening for THC) cannabis abstinence to better understand the disorder and to avoid inappropriately invoking this diagnosis when other conditions may be causative of symptoms.

In general, the low numbers of patients who fulfilled Rome IV criteria for CHS in the reported case series and reports resulted largely from inadequate outcome data and length of follow-up. These long-term outcomes data were not systematically captured in previous studies due to the lack of overall diagnostic framework and were admittedly difficult to capture in acute care settings. This likely led to an overestimate of CHS. Transitioning to a more nuanced and defined diagnostic framework will enable a better understanding of the association between cannabis and CHS.

### A case of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome caused by synthetic cannabinoids [^112GSH3k]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) was initially described in 2004 and remains an under-recognized clinical entity that occurs in chronic heavy marijuana smokers.

- **Case report**: We describe the first report of CHS in an abuser of synthetic cannabinoids. CHS is thought to be caused by over-stimulation of the cannabinoid 1 receptor. The synthetic cannabinoids found in K2, Spice, and other commonly abused designer cannabinoids, including those used by our patient (JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-122, AM-2201, and AM-694), are potent agonists of the cannabinoid 1 receptor.

- **Conclusion**: Our report suggests that frequent habitual smoking of synthetic cannabinoids can cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^115aqh9r]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

The development of abortive therapies for CVS and CHS is limited by a lack of understanding of the pathophysiological basis of these disorders. Thus, there has been a largely empiric, rather than mechanistic, foundation for the abortive therapies discussed in this article. Future research into pathophysiological mechanisms that operate in CVS and CHS will be critical to develop the next generation of abortive therapies. For example, as has been well described in migraine, the calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) system may similarly be important for CVS and/or CHS. If so, CGRP inhibitors could have great potential use as novel abortive therapy for these conditions.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^117QTqHp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Are there clinical features that reliably distinguish CHS from CVS? Both disorders commonly affect young people. Overall, there is a male predominance in CHS, which reflects greater use of cannabis products among men. Some studies have shown that CVS is more common in women, though there have been mixed results regarding gender predilection.

Abdominal pain is considered by some to be essential for a CHS diagnosis, but pain is also reported by a substantial proportion of patients with CVS. More significantly, CHS has been prominently linked to a pattern of hot bathing or showering to relieve symptoms. This unusual behavior has been included by some as a mandatory criterion for CHS diagnosis. One retrospective study commented that "the ability of hot water bathing and showering to mitigate symptoms" is the most defining characteristic of CHS, while a second small series commented that these behaviors are "pathognomonic" for CHS. However, nearly 10% of CHS patients do not report this behavior, even in articles which claim hot bathing to be essential for diagnosis.

The specificity of this behavior was rejected in a recent comparison study, in which 48% of CVS patients with no cannabis use reported symptom relief with hot baths or showers compared to 72% who used cannabis. This hot water bathing behavior has also been observed in preadolescent children and adolescents with no exposure to cannabis (BUK Li and D Fleisher, personal communication). Thus, although the majority of studies show that chronic cannabis use is significantly associated with these symptoms, exceptions exist in both populations.

### Endocannabinoid signaling in stress, nausea, and vomiting [^115MxJRs]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Classical antiemetics that target the serotonin system may not be effective in treating certain nausea and vomiting conditions like cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Consequently, there is a need for improved therapies to manage the symptoms of these disorders, including nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Cannabis is often used for its purported antiemetic and anxiolytic effects, given regulation of these processes by the endocannabinoid system (ECS). However, there is considerable evidence that cannabinoids can also produce nausea and vomiting and increase anxiety in certain instances, especially at higher doses. This paradoxical effect of cannabinoids on nausea, vomiting, and anxiety may be due to the dysregulation of the ECS, altering how it maintains these processes and contributing to the pathophysiology of CVS or CHS.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this review is to highlight the involvement of the ECS in the regulation of stress, nausea, and vomiting. We discuss how prolonged cannabis use, such as in the case of CHS or heightened stress, can dysregulate the ECS and affect its modulation of these functions. The review also examines the evidence for the roles of ECS and stress systems' dysfunction in CVS and CHS to better understand the underlying mechanisms of these conditions.

### Efficacy of topical capsaicin for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in a pediatric and adult emergency department [^115fPkZs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain in the context of chronic cannabis use. Symptoms of CHS are frequently unresponsive to standard antiemetic therapy. Topical capsaicin applied to the abdomen has been cited as a potentially effective agent for CHS; however, robust evidence is lacking.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of topical capsaicin in pediatric and adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected or confirmed CHS. The primary outcome assessed was whether the utilization of capsaicin for CHS resulted in more patients achieving an "efficacious" result, defined as only requiring ≤ 1 rescue medication for symptom relief after receiving capsaicin or after administration of the first agent in patients who did not receive capsaicin during their ED course. Secondary outcomes included total ED length of stay, time to discharge after administration of the reference agent (RA), proportion of patients requiring admission, total number of medication doses given for symptom relief, change in pain score and episodes of emesis, and proportion of patients returning to the ED within 24 hours for the same complaint. Additional analyses were performed to explore patient characteristics that may be predictive of capsaicin efficacy.

- **Results**: Two hundred and one patients were included in the final analysis; 25 were under 21 years old and seen in the pediatric ED. A greater proportion of patients in the capsaicin group…

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: Pathophysiology and treatment in the emergency department [^111zTKFw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a challenging clinical disorder. CHS patients frequently present to the emergency department and may require treatment for intractable emesis, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. Thought to be a variant of cyclic vomiting syndrome, CHS has become more prevalent with increasing cannabis potency and use, as enabled by various states having legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

The aim of this review is to investigate the pathophysiology of CHS and evaluate the published literature on pharmacologic treatment in the emergency department. This information may be helpful in providing evidence-based, efficacious antiemetic treatment grounded in knowledge of antiemetic medications' mechanisms of action, potentially precluding unnecessary tests and reducing duration of stay.

The endocannabinoid system is a complex and important regulator of stress response and allostasis, and it is occasionally overwhelmed from excessive cannabis use. Acute episodes of CHS may be precipitated by stress or fasting in chronic cannabis users who may have pre-existing abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback and sympathetic nervous system response. The reasons for this may lie in the physiology of the endocannabinoid system, the pathophysiology of CHS, and the pharmacologic properties of specific classes of antiemetics and sedatives. Treatment failure with standard antiemetics is common, necessitating the use of mechanistically logical sedating agents such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a cause of refractory nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^1131YLSg]. Obstetrics and gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is a condition present among chronic cannabis users resulting in abdominal pain, intractable nausea and vomiting, and compulsive bathing behaviors. Given the recent legalization of marijuana in certain areas of the United States, the incidence of this condition may increase among pregnant women.

Case

We report the case of a pregnant 28-year-old woman with multiple admissions for episodic nausea and vomiting resulting in Mallory-Weiss esophageal tears, dehydration, and abdominal pain who was noted to be showering compulsively during her hospitalizations. After an extensive workup for the etiology of her intractable nausea and pain, she was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, which is treated simply with abstinence from marijuana use.

Conclusion

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome should be considered in pregnant women with intractable nausea relieved by frequent hot bathing. By considering this diagnosis, extensive diagnostic testing can be avoided and the correct therapy, abstaining from cannabis use, can be recommended.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^116AjooU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the most commonly abused drug in the United States (US). Its use dates back to 3900 BC. However, our understanding of its effects has significantly unfolded over the last three decades. The extract of the plant Cannabis sativa has been used for decades in the control of pain and cramps, according to Chinese literature. Recognition of the function of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) was a breakthrough in explaining the effects of cannabis on different organs, at least in part. The primary psychoactive component of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These advances enhanced the understanding of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, which led to a better appreciation of the role of cannabis in inflammation, seizures, emesis, and as an appetite stimulant.

There is a growing body of research indicating the benefit of cannabis in the aforementioned disorders, and its legalization will further augment research on understanding its critical role in new drug developments. However, these changes also come with substantial risks regarding its adverse effects, such as paradoxical hyperemesis, intoxication, and behavioral changes (anxiety, panic attacks, and psychoactive changes). Prolonged cannabis use can also result in dependency, with approximately 9% of individuals who use cannabis reporting dependence at some point. Cannabis can paradoxically act as an antiemetic during acute ingestion at low doses, whereas persistent high-dose ingestion could result in vomiting, a behavior similar to cyclical vomiting.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^1179xBda]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Cannabinoid hyperemesis**: Unlike in CVS, the management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) may be complicated by the implicit assumption that the patient has brought their misfortune on themselves. Most adult patients with CHS use cannabis in the belief that it is an effective antiemetic. In an ED setting, the admission to previous use of cannabis tends to translate into overgeneralizations that any bout of protracted vomiting is the result of conscious overconsumption of a recreational psychoactive drug. This attitude becomes problematic as care can become compromised by moral judgment on the part of providers. Thus, it is incumbent on caregivers to be particularly careful in taking the medical history of the nature of cannabis exposure. The true nature of CHS is still murky due to factors which include the stigma of nonmedical use, uncertainty of the concentration of THC in unregulated products, and drug level achieved through different routes of drug ingestion.

	- CHS may be more resistant to ED treatments than conventional CVS. While most patients will be given ondansetron or even aprepitant, anxiolytic medication or antidopaminergics such as prochlorperazine or haloperidol play a more prominent role in the CHS patient group. Several studies suggest the efficacy of topical capsaicin may be particularly helpful, implying a central mechanism dependent on TRPV1 receptor signaling in cutaneous dermal receptors. Indeed, CHS was first identified in a cohort of patients reporting the use of habitual hot showers and chronic cannabis use, leading to experimentation with the use of topical capsaicin.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in children: A review of epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111LQeFL]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Low credibility.

Cannabis remains one of the most frequently misused substances among adolescents. As recreational cannabis has proliferated across the United States, cannabis-related emergency department visits have increased. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, a variant of cyclic vomiting syndrome, has emerged as a recognized but poorly understood complication of chronic cannabis use among a subset of individuals. Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is characterized by repeated cycles of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting refractory to standard antiemetics, with users reporting the compulsive use of hot showers to mitigate symptoms.

Treatment modalities include intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion, topical application of capsaicin, and the use of antidopaminergics (e.g. droperidol, haloperidol).

### Cannabis use patterns and association with hyperemesis: A comprehensive review [^113s98eF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Cannabis use in the general population is prevalent and rising due to increased acceptance of its use, legalization in most US states, and perceived health benefits. The potency of cannabis products has dramatically increased with higher delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol content. Cannabis has documented antiemetic properties, and cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are used in disorders like chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

- **Purpose**: Forty to eighty percent of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) patients use cannabis products, which reportedly reduce stress and alleviate nausea and vomiting. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) presents similarly to CVS but is associated with longstanding, high-dose cannabis use and is thought to be relieved by sustained cannabis abstinence. Most CHS patients have used cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis for more than two years. Compulsive hot-water bathing behaviors are reported by most CHS patients but are not specific to this disorder, as about half of CVS patients also note them.

Episodic vomiting associated with cannabis use contributes to extensive health resource utilization, including emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations, negatively impacting patients and their families. Treatment for CHS overlaps with CVS, although cannabis abstinence remains the cornerstone of its management. Challenges associated with cannabis use cessation in CHS include patient skepticism regarding the role of cannabis as a cause of symptoms, perceived benefits of cannabis, and a lack of other effective therapies.

In this review, we…

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: An update on the pathophysiology and management [^116HJ7Um]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a form of functional gut-brain axis disorder characterized by bouts of episodic nausea and vomiting exacerbated by cannabis intake. It is considered a variant of cyclical vomiting syndrome observed in cannabis users, especially characterized by compulsive hot bathing or showers to alleviate symptoms. First reported in 2004, an increasing number of cases have been documented since then. As cannabis use rises globally, partially due to decreasing legalization thresholds, the number of users is expected to escalate over time. Despite this trend, a strict criterion for diagnosing CHS is lacking. Early recognition of CHS is crucial to prevent complications related to severe volume depletion. Recent research acknowledges that patients with CHS place a strain on healthcare systems. Understanding the pathophysiology of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is central to explaining the clinical features and identifying potential drug targets for treating CHS. The frequency and prevalence of CHS vary with the doses of tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids in different cannabis formulations. CHS presents uniquely due to cannabis's biphasic effect, acting as an anti-emetic at low doses and a pro-emetic at higher doses, and its association with pathological hot water bathing. This narrative review elaborates on the role of the ECS, management strategies, and the identification of knowledge gaps in understanding CHS to further enhance comprehension in the future.

### Topical capsaicin for the treatment of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nuRwh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that is being recognized and treated more frequently in emergency departments (EDs) across the United States. Currently, ED providers rely on antiemetics, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines to alleviate the symptoms. Topical capsaicin, a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonist, has been proposed in recent years as a low-cost and effective alternative to the traditional antiemetic regimen when treating CHS. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to demonstrate the reliability and the gaps in what is known about this treatment modality.

- **Methods**: Articles were extracted from PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases. Publication dates ranged from the inception of the databases to October 2020. Initial searches found 328 studies. After careful review and screening by two investigators, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in our meta-analysis. Variables that were evaluated included the prevalence of hospital admissions for patients treated with capsaicin, time to relief of symptoms after capsaicin administration, and ED length of stay (LOS). I-square and Q-statistic values were used to assess heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Among the 7 studies, there was a total of 106 patients. Two studies reported time to resolution of symptoms following capsaicin administration and ED LOS. Means for these outcomes were 325 (95% CI 234–787) and 379 (95% CI 10–747) minutes respectively. I-square was 44%, and Q-statistic was 11 with 6 degrees of freedom, with a p-value of 0.1.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^111DvuAp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) presents with cyclical emetic episodes mimicking cyclic vomiting syndrome after long-standing cannabis use. It is often associated with pathologic bathing behaviors and is currently diagnosed using the Rome IV criteria. A systematic review of the literature on CHS shows significant limitations due to incompletely characterized case series and individual cases, particularly in terms of follow-up and variable diagnostic criteria, which preceded the development of Rome IV criteria. The limitations of the Rome IV criteria are discussed with proposed revisions to optimize the future diagnosis of CHS. Future research in CHS focused on pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and natural history is needed to determine whether CHS is a distinct entity or a subset of CVS.

Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a form of functional gut-brain axis disorder characterized by bouts of episodic nausea and vomiting, worsened by cannabis intake. It is considered a variant of cyclical vomiting syndrome seen in cannabis users, particularly characterized by compulsive hot bathing or showers to relieve symptoms. CHS was first reported in 2004, and since then, cases have increasingly been reported. As cannabis use rises globally due to lower legalization thresholds, the number of users is expected to grow. Despite this trend, strict criteria for diagnosing CHS are lacking. Early recognition of CHS is essential to prevent complications related to severe volume depletion. Recent research indicates that patients with CHS impose a burden on healthcare systems.

Understanding the pathophysiology of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) remains central in explaining the clinical features and identifying potential drug targets for CHS treatment. The frequency and prevalence of CHS vary with the dosage of tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids in different cannabis formulations. CHS is unique in its presentation due to cannabis's biphasic effect — anti-emetic at low doses and pro-emetic at higher doses — and its association with pathological hot water bathing.

This narrative review elaborates on the role of the ECS, management strategies, and identifies gaps in our knowledge of CHS to enhance future understanding.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^115Y11Jy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Gaps in knowledge about the basic features of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) and the relationship of chronic cannabis use with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) require attention, especially in light of the varied perceptions and beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of cannabis use. In addition, the growing medical and recreational movements for cannabis liberalization and legalization will likely increase cannabis use in the future.

In this article, we discuss the role of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the regulation of nausea and vomiting as it pertains to both CVS and CHS. We present an overview of the published literature on CHS and use this data to challenge the concept that CHS is distinct from CVS. Furthermore, we propose new strategies to enhance our understanding of CHS and address existing controversies and knowledge gaps.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^115s9SzQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Limited responses to abortive antiemetic medications are often mentioned in articles on CHS, while others report excellent responses to parenteral benzodiazepines (GABA A agonists) such as lorazepam, the neuromodulator olanzapine, or the potent D2 antagonist haloperidol — an agent with overlapping pharmacology to many commonly used antiemetics including prochlorperazine and metoclopramide. Prior studies have proposed selective benefits of topical capsaicin treatments for acute CHS attacks, potentially acting in a similar fashion as hot baths. However, similar treatments have not been employed for patients with CVS without cannabis exposure, so the specificity of these benefits for CHS is uncertain. Because of the paucity of investigations supporting or refuting the use of other CHS therapies, it is imperative that patients with possible CHS are not denied prescription of prophylactic or abortive treatments which benefit patients with CVS.

The treatment of CHS has focused on cannabis cessation leading to the resolution of symptoms. The most comprehensive series at the time of writing by Allen et al. followed patients for more than 2 years, and given that duration, we surmise that cannabis cessation did indeed result in the resolution of vomiting episodes. However, many articles describe brief periods of abstinence from cannabis, as short as a few days of hospitalization, which are not meaningful and challenge their validity in support of a diagnosis of CHS. When more stringent criteria have been applied, very few patients with purported CHS report symptom reduction lasting.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^111wTEem]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

All patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) should receive abortive therapies that can be implemented at home. Multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions can effectively abort CVS/CHS episodes, particularly when implemented early during the prodromic period. Patients with CVS/CHS should access emergency department (ED)-based abortive treatment when home-based therapy fails. Those with frequent ED utilization benefit from developing an ED care plan.

- **Home‐based abortive therapy protocols**: There are several approaches to home‐based abortive therapy for both CVS and CHS. The medications that have been used to abort CVS and CHS attacks are presented in Table 1. Several nonpharmacologic measures may play an adjunctive role, but, in general, most patients will require more than one pharmacologic agent to abort an episode. Systemic pharmacologic agents often used as abortive therapy include triptans, antiemetics, anxiolytics, NK‐1 receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatory agents such as NSAIDs, antipsychotics, sedatives in general, and in some cases cannabis.

Abortive medication therapies in CVS and CHS include nonsystemic, nonpharmacologic approaches such as reducing external stimuli (quiet room, dim lights, etc), relaxation therapies (i.e. deep breathing, meditation), or hot water bathing. The application of topical capsaicin cream has some limited evidence for efficacy in CHS and mostly in ED settings, but in theory capsaicin could be applied at home and potentially could work in CVS.

The relative efficacy of various abortive therapies is summarized in Table 2. More research is needed to develop evidence‐based, individualized abortive treatment plans, as well as to determine whether abortive treatment for CVS requires a fundamentally different approach than for CHS or other subtypes of CVS. It is also uncertain to what extent abortive therapy for CVS subtypes of pediatric patients should differ from adults with CVS. For example, NSAIDs may be particularly helpful as abortive therapy for pediatric patients with a migraine component.

### SAEM GRACE: Dopamine antagonists and topical capsaicin for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in the emergency department: A systematic review of direct evidence [^112vecNt]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Adults with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) are increasingly presenting to the emergency department (ED), and this systematic review evaluates the direct evidence on the effectiveness of capsaicin and dopamine antagonists in its clinical management.

- **Methods**: A bibliographic search was conducted to address the following population-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) question: (P) adults > 18 years old with a diagnosis of acute CHS presenting to the ED; (I) dopamine antagonists (e.g. haloperidol, droperidol) and topical capsaicin; (C) usual care or no active comparator; and (O) symptoms improvement/resolution in ED, ED length of stay, admission rate, ED recidivism, need for rescue medication, and adverse events. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA reporting recommendations.

- **Results**: From 53 potentially relevant articles, seven were included: five observational studies and two randomized controlled trials, comprising a total of 492 patients. Five of these studies evaluated the efficacy of capsaicin cream (n = 386), and two examined dopamine antagonists (haloperidol, droperidol; n = 106). There was mixed evidence for the efficacy of capsaicin in reducing nausea and emesis. Both studies evaluating dopamine antagonists detected clinical benefits compared to the usual care or no active comparator.

- **Conclusions**: There is limited direct evidence on the efficacy of dopamine antagonists or capsaicin for treating CHS in the ED. Evidence is mixed for capsaicin and potentially beneficial for dopamine antagonists.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: An update on the pathophysiology and management [^111p7tg6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is traditionally based on the presence of hyperemesis in the context of chronic cannabis use, often associated with pathological hot bathing behaviors. Previous literature on this diagnosis exhibits considerable heterogeneity in patient categorization. CHS involves three phases: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery.

- **Prodromal phase**: This phase is characterized by nausea, abdominal discomfort, and fear of vomiting.
- **Hyperemetic phase**: Intense and multiple episodes of vomiting occur, which usually prompt medical attention.
- **Recovery phase**: This phase begins once symptoms improve, marked by the establishment of normal eating behaviors.

Episodic nausea and vomiting often accompany a history of chronic cannabis use. Under-recognition of CHS can lead to numerous investigations and heightened healthcare expenses. Patients might report a recent increase in cannabis use or a change in their cannabis source, possibly indicating a change in cannabis potency. Some patients find symptom relief through compulsive use of hot showers.

Other disorders such as Addison's disease, migraine headaches, hyperemesis of pregnancy, bulimia, and psychogenic vomiting can mimic CHS symptoms, although they may coexist with CHS.

A comprehensive history and physical examination, coupled with directed testing for differential diagnoses, can assist in ruling out these other disorders. The Rome IV criteria aid in the diagnosis by categorizing CHS under functional gut-brain disorders.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^112eskrB]. BMJ Case Reports (2024).

Cannabinoids have several types of receptors. The active ingredients (cannabinoids) of cannabis, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol, are thought to be responsible for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) by interacting with the receptors listed below. Their interactions are not yet fully understood, but tetrahydrocannabinol is believed to exert the most effect.

- **CB-1 receptor**: Type 1 (CB-1) receptors cause cannabis-related cognitive and memory disturbances, including nausea and vomiting. Chronic cannabis use can result in derangement of the endogenous CB-1 system, downregulating this receptor and causing rebound vomiting and spasmodic pain. These symptoms resolve and recover upon cannabis cessation.

- **TRPV1 receptor**: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel activated by noxious heat and capsaicin. This receptor is present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including several sensory neurons, enteric neurons in the myenteric plexus, and epithelial cells in the gastric mucosa. It is also found in the central nervous system, especially in the area postrema, also known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Activation of this receptor has a potent antiemetic effect, which is thought to be mediated by the depletion of substance P from neural circuits traveling to the nucleus tractus solitarius.

Both CB-1 and TRPV1 are activated by exogenous cannabinoids. Laboratory studies show that exogenous cannabinoids lead to dephosphorylation and subsequent receptor desensitization. Chronic exposure to cannabinoids could lead to downregulation or desensitization of TRPV1 signaling, explaining how prolonged exposure impacts receptor activity.

### Role of chronic cannabis use: Cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^112fVQes]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

In the case series totaling 271 patients, the mean age was 30.5 ± 7.6 years, and the majority of patients were male (186; 68.6%). The mean duration of cannabis use preceding the onset of symptoms was 6.6 ± 4.3 years. Daily cannabis use was found in two-thirds (68%) of the patients, and weekly cannabis use in about one-sixth (16%). The frequency of cannabis use was not documented for 16% of the sample. A compulsive hot water bathing pattern was noted in 71.5% (194) of patients, with data not available for four patients.

The mean age of patients in individual case reports was 29.4 ± 9 years, and these were similarly composed mostly of males (72.3%). Duration of cannabis use among the case report group was 8.0 ± 8.4 years, with daily cannabis use reported in 69.5%, very similar to the case series group. The hot water bathing pattern in the case report group was noted to be approximately 86%.

Among the case series and individual case reports, only 44 out of 271 (16.2%) and 27 out of 105 (25.7%) respectively had a follow-up period of at least 4 weeks. This limited the ability to make a definite diagnosis of CHS (using Rome IV criteria) in the majority of case series and case reports due to inadequate follow-up. However, among those in both groups who were followed for at least 4 weeks, 86% of case series patients (38 out of 44) and 78% of case report patients (21 out of 27), with a total of 59 out of 71 (83%), met the Rome IV criteria for CHS. Among all 376 cases, only 59 (15.7%) were adequately followed.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in an athlete [^1121to5m]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabis (marijuana) is an increasingly prevalent substance used among college-aged adults. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) is one outcome of chronic cannabis use, characterized by cyclic intractable vomiting that can be temporarily relieved with hot baths or showers. This case discusses a collegiate football athlete who presents with intractable vomiting and underscores the importance of a detailed history to discern CHS from other more common diagnoses. The report highlights key diagnostic characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment options for patients with presumed CHS.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: Clinical trajectories and patterns of use three months following a visit to the emergency department [^114AAebo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a clinical condition characterized by cyclic vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain associated with chronic cannabis use. Despite increased recognition of CHS, there is limited information on cannabis use practices and symptoms over time. Understanding what occurs in the period surrounding the emergency department (ED) visit, including any changes in symptoms and cannabis use practices following the visit, can help inform the development of patient-centered interventions for cannabis use disorder in patients with CHS.

A prospective observational cohort (n = 39) of patients with suspected CHS was recruited from the ED during a symptomatic cyclic vomiting episode and followed for three months. Disease progression, cannabis use practices, and healthcare utilization were monitored.

Participants reported high rates of persistent CHS symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, or cyclic vomiting) in the two-week period immediately following an ED visit, with a median duration of seven days. The frequency and quantity of cannabis use were reduced immediately after the ED visit. However, most participants returned to pre-ED visit cannabis use patterns within a few days. Re-visits to the ED for cyclic vomiting were reported by 25% of participants who completed follow-up during the three-month period.

Participants continued to experience ongoing symptoms after the ED visit, but most managed symptoms independently and did not return to the ED. Longitudinal studies beyond three months are needed to better understand the clinical course of patients with CHS.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in the emergency department: How can a specialized addiction team be useful? A pilot study [^114GvN6v]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic cannabis users may experience cyclical episodes of nausea and vomiting and engage in the learned behavior of hot bathing. This clinical condition, known as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, was first reported in 2004.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to promote early recognition of this syndrome in emergency departments (EDs) and to increase referral to addiction specialists.

- **Methods**: Cannabis abusers were admitted to the ED for vomiting or abdominal pain from June 1, 2014, to January 1, 2015, and diagnosed with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome by a specialized addiction team. Medical records were then examined retrospectively.

- **Results**: Seven young adults were included. Their mean age was 24.7 years (range 17–39 years), and the majority were men (male-to-female ratio 1.2). Biological and toxicological blood samples were taken from all patients. Tetrahydrocannabinol blood levels were measured in four patients, with a mean blood concentration of 11.6 ng/mL. Radiographic examinations, including abdominal computed tomography and brain imaging, were negative, as was upper endoscopy. Five patients compulsively took hot baths in an attempt to decrease symptoms. Treatment was symptomatic, and five patients have started follow-up with the specialized addiction team.

- **Conclusions**: Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is still under-diagnosed, 10 years after it was first described. Physicians should be aware of this syndrome to avoid repeated hospitalizations or esophageal complications. Greater awareness should lead to prompt treatment and prevention of future recurrence through cannabis cessation.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^114ZUYUx]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Cannabis var. sativa is widely distributed in our country, occurring in seven of the nine provinces; var. indica and spontanea occur each in one province only. The patient lived in a province where only var. sativa is available on the market, and it can be assumed they smoked the var. sativa type of cannabis.

The Rome IV criteria state that non-organic nausea and vomiting disorders be subclassified into three categories:

- **Chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome**: Bothersome nausea and vomiting lasting for at least 6 months with no evidence of other organic aetiology.
- **Cyclical vomiting syndrome**: Episodes of vomiting with at least three discrete episodes in the prior year and two episodes in the past 6 months, occurring at least 1 week apart in a stereotypical pattern.
- **Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)**: Stereotypical episodic vomiting in individuals who chronically use cannabis daily. Cessation of cannabis use leads to relief of vomiting episodes.

The diagnostic standards for CHS required by Rome IV are:

- **Episodic and stereotypical vomiting**: Resembling cyclical vomiting syndrome in start, duration, and frequency.
- **Prolonged and excessive cannabis use**: This should follow prolonged use of cannabis.
- **Improvement after cessation**: This should improve after cessation of cannabis use.
- **Pathological washing behavior**: Associated with the syndrome.
- **Prodromal stage**: Includes nausea without vomiting.

### Acute care of cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the home and emergency department [^1153Chuf]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) are both characterized by episodic, acute transitions from asymptomatic states to highly symptomatic states of nausea, repetitive vomiting, and often severe abdominal pain. Patients with CVS and CHS face significant challenges to abort or mitigate episodes at home and often require emergency department (ED)‐based care.

This paper reviews the treatment approach to abort acute CVS and CHS episodes at home and in ED settings. Multiple pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been demonstrated to potentially abort CVS or CHS episodes. Systemic pharmacologic agents often used as abortive therapy include triptans, antiemetics, anxiolytics, NK‐1 receptor antagonists, antipsychotics, and sedatives in general, as well as various analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications. Nonsystemic, nonpharmacologic approaches include reducing external stimuli, such as quiet rooms and dim lights, hot water bathing, or the application of topical capsaicin cream. More research is needed to develop evidence‐based, individualized abortive treatment plans, as well as to determine whether the abortive treatment for CVS requires a fundamentally different approach than for CHS. When home‐based approaches fail, all patients with CVS or CHS should receive nonjudgmental, informed, and compassionate care in the ED to abort their episode. Patients with more severe forms of CVS/CHS who require more frequent ED utilization should develop care plans with their ED to assure predictable and effective treatment.
