## Question

What are differentials and workups for jaw pain, pain in the ear, and pain behind the ear in a 66yo female with HTN associated with diabetes, migraines, Hx of TIA, HLD, DM type 2, asthma and OSA, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and workup for jaw pain, ear pain, and pain behind the ear in a 66-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, prior TIA, hyperlipidemia, migraines, asthma, OSA, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and whether this could be giant cell arteritis. Then, I should verify the most likely causes given her comorbidities and age, including temporomandibular disorders, cervical spondylosis, and secondary otalgia. Next, I will consider neuralgias and migraine variants, and finally, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup with escalation triggers and a management plan, making sure I double-check where normal inflammatory markers do not exclude vasculitis and where imaging is indicated for neuralgias.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and the urgency of excluding giant cell arteritis, because jaw claudication with new headache in a patient over 50 is a classic presentation and carries a risk of irreversible vision loss if treatment is delayed. I should not rely on normal ESR or CRP to exclude GCA, as up to about 10% of biopsy-proven cases can have ESR less than 40 mm/hr, and case series document normal or mildly elevated markers early on, so clinical suspicion must drive urgent temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy if indicated, with prompt high-dose glucocorticoids if suspicion is high while awaiting results [^116fWov9] [^116ZdoTD] [^114QVtSK] [^11381EG6].

> Wait, let me verify the differential beyond GCA so I don't anchor prematurely. Given her age and comorbidities, temporomandibular disorders are highly plausible and often present with jaw pain, ear pain, and pain behind the ear due to shared innervation; cervical spondylosis and cervicogenic headache can refer pain to the occiput and behind the ear; secondary otalgia from dental or pharyngeal sources is common in adults; and trigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia remain considerations if the pain is paroxysmal or focal in those distributions, particularly if there are trigger points or sensory changes [^112k2L19] [^1112AxB9] [^114pziMh] [^113ysnQc] [^114VBsej].

> I will now examine the likelihood of temporomandibular disorder as a primary driver here. TMD affects roughly 5–12% of adults, is more common in women, and frequently coexists with fibromyalgia and migraine; patients report jaw pain, ear fullness or otalgia, clicking or crepitus, and pain worsened by chewing or yawning, with exam findings of TMJ tenderness, limited mouth opening, and masticatory muscle tenderness; conservative therapy is first-line and often effective, reserving invasive options for refractory cases [^112k2L19] [^1112AxB9] [^112iQEVE].

> Hold on, I should verify the cervical contribution because pain behind the ear often reflects C2–C3 referral patterns. Cervicogenic headache and mechanical neck pain from spondylosis can produce occipital and retroauricular pain, sometimes with neck stiffness or restricted motion; diagnostic blocks can aid confirmation in refractory cases, but most respond to conservative measures and targeted physical therapy, which I should prioritize if cervical signs are present [^114pziMh] [^113ysnQc].

> Next, I should review secondary otalgia pathways so I don't miss a non-ear source of ear pain. The ear shares innervation with the TMJ, teeth, pharynx, and neck via cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X and upper cervical roots, so dental disease, pharyngitis, and cervical pathology commonly refer pain to the ear; in adults, secondary otalgia predominates, and a careful head and neck exam including oral cavity, oropharynx, and neck is essential when the ear exam is unrevealing [^113ysnQc] [^111hdLN6].

> Let me consider neuralgias carefully. Trigeminal neuralgia presents with brief, electric, stimulus-evoked paroxysms in V2–V3 distributions and warrants MRI to exclude secondary causes even when the exam is otherwise normal; occipital neuralgia causes sharp, shooting pain in the occipital region radiating behind the ear and responds to diagnostic blocks; glossopharyngeal neuralgia is less common but can present with ear pain and should be considered if there are trigger zones in the oropharynx or autonomic features [^113aNB2p] [^111eccJC] [^114VBsej] [^1158FBRs].

> But wait, what if this is a migraine or a migraine-related facial pain syndrome. Migraine can present with facial pain and ear symptoms, and fibromyalgia is associated with central sensitization and overlapping pain syndromes; I should confirm the pain phenotype, temporal pattern, and associated features such as nausea, photophobia, or allodynia, and remember that red ear syndrome, while rare, can accompany migraine and steer attention toward TMJ or cervical drivers when present [^112iQEVE] [^117JdpDn].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook vascular and neoplastic mimics. Given her age and vascular risk profile, carotid disease and even carotidynia can present with lateral neck or ear pain, though carotidynia remains controversial; persistent unilateral otalgia with risk factors warrants consideration of nasopharyngeal carcinoma or other skull base lesions, prompting nasopharyngoscopy and cross-sectional imaging if symptoms persist or red flags emerge [^115b5k1J] [^113ysnQc].

> Next, I should review the staged diagnostic workup and double-check escalation triggers. Initially, a focused history and examination of the TMJ, masticatory muscles, cervical spine, oral cavity, pharynx, and cranial nerves should guide management; if the diagnosis remains unclear or symptoms persist beyond 2–4 weeks, obtain panoramic dental radiographs for dental pathology, consider TMJ MRI if internal derangement is suspected, and use cervical spine imaging if there are neurologic signs or refractory occipital pain; for suspected neuralgias, brain MRI with high-resolution skull base sequences is indicated to exclude secondary causes; for suspected GCA, order ESR and CRP but do not delay steroids if suspicion is high, and arrange temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy as indicated [^112k2L19] [^114pziMh] [^111eccJC] [^116fWov9].

> Hold on, I should verify the laboratory approach so I don't over-order tests. Basic labs such as CBC, ESR, and CRP are reasonable to screen for systemic inflammation or infection when clinically indicated, but in fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes, repeated or exhaustive testing rarely changes management; I should avoid unnecessary imaging and labs once a working diagnosis is established and focus on functional outcomes and symptom control [^111wqjCw] [^111vGwUD].

> I will now outline management contingencies, making sure they align with the most likely diagnoses. For TMD, start with patient education, soft diet, NSAIDs, heat, and jaw exercises, adding muscle relaxants or low-dose tricyclics if needed, and refer to oral and maxillofacial surgery for refractory cases; for cervicogenic pain, initiate physical therapy and consider occipital nerve blocks if pain is focal and severe; for fibromyalgia, emphasize aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene, and SNRIs or gabapentinoids as appropriate; for trigeminal neuralgia, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are first-line, with surgical options for refractory cases; and if GCA is suspected, start high-dose prednisone urgently while arranging confirmatory testing to prevent vision loss [^112k2L19] [^114pziMh] [^111wqjCw] [^113aNB2p] [^116fWov9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought normal ESR would effectively rule out GCA, but I should correct that assumption. Normal inflammatory markers do not exclude GCA, especially early or atypically presenting cases, so clinical judgment and the presence of red flags like jaw claudication, new headache, or visual symptoms should override normal labs and prompt timely evaluation and treatment to mitigate the risk of permanent visual compromise [^116ZdoTD] [^114QVtSK] [^11381EG6].

In a 66-year-old woman with jaw, ear, and retroauricular pain and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, migraines, TIA, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, asthma, and OSA, the most likely causes are **temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD)** [^112k2L19] and **cervical spondylosis** [^111hdLN6] with referred otalgia, while **giant cell arteritis (GCA)** [^116fWov9] must be urgently excluded given her age and vascular risk. Other considerations include trigeminal neuralgia [^113aNB2p], occipital neuralgia [^114VBsej], dental disease, and secondary otalgia from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sources [^113ysnQc]. Workup should start with a focused history and exam, then **ESR/CRP and temporal artery ultrasound** [^116mKu39] if GCA is suspected; obtain a **panoramic dental radiograph** if TMD is likely, and use MRI [^115Eq88b] for persistent or atypical neuralgic pain or neurologic signs. Management is diagnosis-specific: conservative care for TMD [^112k2L19], neuropathic agents for neuralgias [^1158FBRs], and immediate high-dose steroids if GCA is suspected [^116fWov9].

## Differential diagnosis

### Musculoskeletal and temporomandibular disorders

- **Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD)**: Common in older adults; presents with jaw pain, ear pain, clicking/crepitus, limited mouth opening, and pain worsened by chewing or jaw movement [^112k2L19]. TMD is often comorbid with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis [^notfound].

- **Cervical spondylosis**: Degenerative changes in the cervical spine can cause referred pain to the jaw, ear, and retroauricular region via C2–C3 nerves [^notfound].

- **Osteoarthritis**: Generalized osteoarthritis may involve the TMJ, causing localized pain and dysfunction [^notfound].

---

### Neurological conditions

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Characterized by sudden, severe, electric shock-like facial pain, often triggered by light touch or chewing; may involve the mandibular or maxillary divisions [^113aNB2p].

- **Occipital neuralgia**: Causes sharp, shooting pain in the occipital region radiating to the back of the ear and jaw [^114VBsej].

- **Migraine**: Can present with facial pain, ear pain, and retroauricular discomfort, often accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea [^notfound].

---

### Vascular conditions

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a **critical consideration** in patients over 50 with new-onset jaw pain, especially with headache, scalp tenderness, or visual symptoms; jaw claudication is a classic feature [^116fWov9]. Carotid artery disease may cause referred pain to the jaw and ear due to vascular insufficiency or inflammation [^notfound].

---

### Dental and otolaryngological conditions

Dental disease — including caries, periodontal disease, or abscesses — can cause referred pain to the jaw and ear [^113ysnQc]. Secondary otalgia from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oropharyngeal infection, or other head and neck pathology should be considered, particularly with persistent or unexplained symptoms [^113ysnQc].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Initial evaluation

Begin with a **focused history** detailing pain onset, duration, character, triggers, associated symptoms (e.g. headache, visual changes, dysphagia, fever, weight loss), and a review of systems. Conduct a **physical examination** of the TMJ, cervical spine, cranial nerves, oral cavity, and ears, and palpate the temporal arteries for tenderness or pulsatility [^116fWov9].

---

### Laboratory tests

Order **ESR and CRP** to screen for inflammation, especially if GCA is suspected; normal results do not exclude GCA [^116ZdoNo]. Obtain a **CBC** to assess for anemia or infection.

---

### Imaging studies

- **Panoramic dental radiograph**: Evaluate for dental pathology or TMJ degeneration.

- **MRI of the brain and cervical spine**: Indicated for persistent or atypical neuralgic pain, neurologic deficits, or suspicion of structural lesions (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, cervical radiculopathy) [^115Eq88b].

- **Temporal artery ultrasound**: Non-invasive assessment for GCA; consider if clinical suspicion is moderate to high [^116mKu39].

- **CT scan of the head and neck**: Useful if malignancy or structural lesions are suspected.

---

### Specialist referrals

Refer to **dentistry/oral and maxillofacial surgery** for suspected TMD or dental pathology, and to **neurology** for suspected trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, or other neurological conditions. Refer to **rheumatology** if GCA is suspected or if autoimmune disease is a consideration.

---

## Management strategies

### Temporomandibular joint disorder

Management includes patient education, a soft diet, stress management, and avoidance of parafunctional habits. Use NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and low-dose tricyclic antidepressants for pain control. Physical therapy emphasizes jaw exercises and manual therapy, and consider occlusal splints for bruxism or malocclusion [^112k2L19].

---

### Cervical spondylosis

Use NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and neuropathic agents (e.g. gabapentin) for pain relief. Physical therapy focuses on neck strengthening, flexibility, and posture correction, and consider epidural steroid injections or facet joint injections for refractory pain.

---

### Trigeminal neuralgia

First-line pharmacotherapy includes carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine [^113aNB2p]. Consider microvascular decompression or percutaneous procedures for refractory cases.

---

### Giant cell arteritis

Start **immediate high-dose corticosteroids** (e.g. prednisone 40–60 mg/day) to prevent vision loss [^116fWov9]. Confirm the diagnosis with temporal artery biopsy or ultrasound, and consider long-term steroid-sparing agents (e.g. methotrexate, tocilizumab) [^116fWov9].

---

### Migraine

Use triptans, NSAIDs, and antiemetics for acute attacks, and consider beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiepileptics for prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In a 66-year-old woman with jaw, ear, and retroauricular pain, prioritize **TMD, cervical spondylosis, and GCA** in the differential, with neuralgias and secondary otalgia as additional considerations. Use a stepwise approach: history and exam, targeted labs, and imaging as indicated, escalating to specialist referral when needed. Management is diagnosis-specific, with urgent steroid therapy if GCA is suspected [^116fWov9].

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Headache and facial pain: differential diagnosis and treatment [^111nG9ry]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Headaches affect 90% of the population sometime during their life. Most are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis. The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches are those that occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always necessary.

### Cervical spine meningioma presenting as otalgia: case report [^115kWc4d]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Cervical spine meningiomas have not been reported to present as otalgia. It is important to include otalgia in the differential diagnosis and workup, especially when more common causes of ear pain have been excluded.

Clinical Presentation

A 66-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with severe ear pain. She underwent routine diagnostic testing and eventually was referred to a neurologist. After conservative management failed, the patient underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a large meningioma encompassing C2-C3.

Intervention

The patient underwent a cervical laminectomy with complete resection of the tumor. She experienced immediate postoperative resolution of her symptoms.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the importance of aggressive evaluation of otalgia when routine diagnostic studies are inconclusive. Cervical meningiomas are associated with significant potential morbidity and should be excluded early in the diagnostic process.

Primary headaches are the most common headache disorders. The most common forms are tension-type headaches, migraine, and cluster headache. Knowing the clinical presentation coupled with taking a thorough history taking and performing a thorough physical examination usually helps in arriving at a correct diagnosis. Special attention should be paid to unusual clinical presentations. Further diagnostic work-up should be performed in the presence of atypical and worrisome signs.

Pain in the orofacial region is a common presenting symptom. The majority of symptoms are related to dental disease and the cause can readily be established, the problem dealt with, and the pain eliminated. However, pain may persist and defy attempts at treatment. Intractable oral or facial pain can be diagnostically challenging. To make a definitive diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, a rigorous protocol for evaluation includes a thorough history and an appropriate comprehensive clinical examination and diagnostic testing, including chief complaint, history of present illness, medical history, physical examination, diagnostic studies, including imaging, and psychosocial evaluation.

### Facial pain: clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of pain in the face as the presenting complaint can be difficult. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination, which allows a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses, leading to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterised by stabs of short lasting, lancinating pain, and, although neuralgias are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms. Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination. Facial pain with focal autonomic signs is mostly primary and belongs to the group of the idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, but can occasionally be secondary. Pure facial pain is most often due to sinusitis and the chewing apparatus, but also a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging as well as non-neurological specialist assessment is often necessary in these cases.

### Facial pain [^1158FBRs]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are various cranial nerve lesions that cause complex presentations of headache and facial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and other rarer syndromes. Each present with their distinct patterns and diagnosis is reliant on a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic workup often involves neuroimaging modalities to rule out more common diseases. Treatment is aimed at symptomatic management, with conservative and pharmacologic therapies (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants) as primary treatment. Advanced procedures and surgical intervention are typically reserved for refractory cases.

### Probability-based algorithm using ultrasound and additional tests for suspected GCA in a fast-track clinic [^116mKu39]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a critically ischaemic organ-threatening disease, particularly at the onset. Hence, it is vital to make a secure diagnosis urgently, not only to confirm GCA but also to exclude GCA mimics. Several mimics, such as infection, cancer, head and neck pathology and systemic rheumatological diseases, are equally serious conditions with similar challenges for early diagnosis and treatment. In other less serious, chronic conditions such as non-specific headaches, migraine, fibromyalgia, neuralgia and spondylosis, it is important to avoid inappropriate empirical glucocorticoids (GC) and minimise GC side effects, while offering symptom alleviation, appropriate advice and therapy. Unfortunately, clinical presentations of GCA are protean, and they are often characterised by a mix of constitutional, cranial, ischaemic and polymyalgic symptoms combined with raised inflammatory markers, a clinical scenario that can be difficult to distinguish from symptoms and presenting features of other conditions. In particular, headache is a common but often misleading symptom experienced in GCA. Recent onset of headache, along with the presence of scalp tenderness and/or jaw claudication, may increase the likelihood of GCA. A non-specific response to empirical GC may compound this diagnostic conundrum, resulting in many patients with steroid-responsive headaches being mislabelled as GCA. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 GCA classification criteriaare often mistakenly used to diagnose GCA, but in clinical practice, they have low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value (PPV).

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management [^111wqjCw]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

### Is fibromyalgia a discrete entity? [^112CQJCD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined as chronic widespread pain (CWP) with allodynia or hyperalgesia to pressure pain, and is classified as one of the largest group of soft tissue pain syndromes. Its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, although it is currently believed to be the result of a central nervous system (CNS) malfunction that increases pain transmission and perception. There are no instrumental tests to confirm the diagnosis, but many of the differential diagnoses can be excluded by means of an extensive clinical examination and patient history. Although fibromyalgia is a recognisable clinical entity, it would seem appropriate to consider the entire range of tenderness and distress in clinic patients in order to tailor treatment on an individual basis.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^112pWusf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

### Temporomandibular joint syndrome from an ear versus dental-related standpoint [^1112AxB9]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a prominent reason for visits to medical providers. The presentation of headaches within this population remains a challenging diagnosis, given the prevalence and overlap of symptomatology of both conditions. The literature demonstrates an undeniable association between headaches and TMD. Regardless of causality and etiology, the literature supports that prompt diagnosis and treatment results in improvement or resolution of symptoms, including headaches. Treatment of TMD headaches should begin with conservative measures, including medical management with NSAIDs, heat therapy, and muscle-stretching exercises.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^112SN4wD]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Diagnosis of ear pain [^115Uw72s]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients in primary care present with ear pain (otalgia). When the ear is the source of the pain (primary otalgia), the ear examination is usually abnormal. When the ear is not the source of the pain (secondary otalgia), the ear examination is typically normal. The cause of primary otalgia is usually apparent on examination; the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. The cause of secondary otalgia is often difficult to determine because the innervation of the ear is complex and there are many potential sources of referred pain. The most common causes are temporomandibular joint syndrome, pharyngitis, dental disease, and cervical spine arthritis. If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, options include a trial of symptomatic treatment without a clear diagnosis; imaging studies; and consultation with an otolaryngologist. Patients who smoke, drink alcohol, are older than 50 years, or have diabetes are at higher risk of a cause of ear pain that needs further evaluation. Patients whose history or physical examination increases suspicion for a serious occult cause of ear pain or whose symptoms persist after symptomatic treatment should be considered for further evaluation, such as magnetic resonance imaging, fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement.

### A 36-year-old man with persistent headache [^1177V5Ef]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 36-year-old man who sought evaluation for a persistent headache and numbness on the cheek. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^115kpu6R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^111v6fgu]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0. 25% of adults worldwide. 2 Most people in the United States with arthritis have osteoarthritis, which is a noninflammatory condition. Although inflammatory arthritis is uncommon, studies show that adults presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms often report joint pain, stiffness, or swelling that could be consistent with inflammatory arthritis. SMALL JOINTS Many polyarticular processes involve small joints, and a systematic approach to their evaluation is prudent. The initial inspection should assess for evidence of swelling, erythema, synovitis, or dactylitis. The presence of skin findings such as psoriatic plaques or dystrophic nails should be noted.

The fingers should be examined for bony enlargement at the proximal interphalangeal joints and distal interphalangeal joints that indicate osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are often found where there are pressure points. Tophi are found in the soft tissues, including the helix of the ear and around articular structures. On palpation, synovitis will consist of boggy swelling over the joint. Examination of strength and active and passive range of motion can help assess functional impairment. Special tests such as the log roll in the hip examination can help evaluate hip pathology, and the Lachman test in the knee examination can evaluate for anterior cruciate ligament injury, thus narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Radiographic findings suggestive of osteoarthritis include marginal osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and joint space narrowing. 43 Early changes of RA include soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular osteopenia. The earliest erosions in the metacarpophalangeal joints occur where the joint capsule synovium directly contacts the bone, often referred to as a marginal erosion 44. Late changes include diffuse osteoporosis, large subchondral erosions, uniform joint space loss, and joint subluxation. 45.

### Ear pain: diagnosing common and uncommon causes [^113ysnQc]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Otalgia (ear pain) is a common presentation in the primary care setting with many diverse causes. Pain that originates from the ear is called primary otalgia, and the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. Examination of the ear usually reveals abnormal findings in patients with primary otalgia. Pain that originates outside the ear is called secondary otalgia, and the etiology can be difficult to establish because of the complex innervation of the ear. The most common causes of secondary otalgia include temporomandibular joint syndrome and dental infections. Primary otalgia is more common in children, whereas secondary otalgia is more common in adults. History and physical examination usually lead to the underlying cause; however, if the diagnosis is not immediately clear, a trial of symptomatic treatment, imaging studies, and consultation may be reasonable options. Otalgia may be the only presenting symptom in several serious conditions, such as temporal arteritis and malignant neoplasms. When risk factors for malignancy are present (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, age 50 years or older), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^1139Qtkb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

Temporomandibular disorders affect between 5% and 12% of the population and present with symptoms such as headache, bruxism, pain at the temporomandibular joint, jaw popping or clicking, neck pain, tinnitus, dizziness, decreased hearing, and hyperacuity to sound. Common signs on physical examination include tenderness of the pterygoid muscles, temporomandibular joints, and temporalis muscles, and malocclusion of the jaw and crepitus. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; however, use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if the diagnosis is in doubt. Nonpharmacologic therapy includes patient education (e.g., good sleep hygiene, soft food diet), cognitive behavior therapy, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclobenzaprine, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin. Injections of the temporomandibular joints with sodium hyaluronate, platelet-rich plasma, and dextrose prolotherapy may be considered, but the evidence of benefit is weak. A referral to oral and maxillofacial surgery is indicated for refractory cases.

### A practical approach to assist asthmatics to lose weight [^1179FnpC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Treating patients with obesity, particularly asthmatics, is a complex challenge that requires a unique and individually tailored approach. Obesity, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. It affects approximately 43% of adults and 19% of youth in America. It is a multifactorial disease and should be managed with the same intensity as any other medical problem, for it represents a risk factor for the onset and severity of asthma. Furthermore, it is a comorbid condition that exacerbates rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, anxiety, and depression. Being obese also increases morbidity for cardio/cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, breast and bladder cancer, and migraines. Osteoarthritis, in particular, of the knees and hips, is also associated with obesity, and that too will complicate asthma by hindering a subject's mobility and ability to exercise. This paper reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of obesity, its effect on asthma, and practical strategies to achieve weight loss.

### Giant cell arteritis: reviewing the advancing diagnostics and management [^1163WPEd]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

GCA has heterogeneous clinical features due to the overlapping spectrum of the known clinical phenotypes: cranial GCA (C-GCA), large vessel GCA (LV-GCA), and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (Fig. 2). The majority of people with cranial GCA will have symptoms of new onset headache, jaw claudication and cutaneous allodynia. Nearly half of people with GCA have symptoms of PMR (Fig. 2) while up to one-fifth of people with PMR will be diagnosed with GCA. There may be large vessel involvement in cranial GCA, which may be asymptomatic and revealed by diagnostic imaging alone. Up to 50% of people with GCA will experience constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite, malaise, depression. These may help narrow the differential diagnosis from an ocular cause or pain syndrome (such as migraine or cluster headache) to a systemic cause, however many systemic conditions have the potential to exhibit these symptoms (Table 1).

Fig. 2
Risk factors for GCA.

Table 1
Potential differential diagnoses for those suspected with GCA.

The visual symptoms of GCA are well documented and include amaurosis fugax, double vision to devastating visual loss. The most common ocular manifestations include anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, large peripapillary cotton wool spots, arterial occlusions (cilio-retinal artery or central artery), oculomotor cranial nerve palsy, and posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, with other rarer ocular syndromes having been reported (Table 2). Initiation of treatment may result in reversal of visual loss in the minority.

Table 2
Ocular manifestations of Giant Cell Arteritis.

Ophthalmologists need to beware of the less common presentations of GCA, as they may be asked to examine patients who are suspected of having GCA. For example, symptoms of LV-GCA include intermittent limb claudication or absent pulses according to the vessels affected and chest or back pain if there is aortic involvement. GCA can present without any symptoms of cranial or large vessel involvement, with inflammation or fever of unknown origin (IFUO), anorexia, weight loss and anaemia being the only evidence of an active disease process. Patients with constitutional GCA are at risk of significant diagnostic delay due to the large differential diagnosis of IFUO.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^1115xojq]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

TMD

"TMD" defines a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the TMJ, and associated structures.TMD is considered to be a subclassification of musculoskeletal disordersand is the most prevalent condition for which patients seek treatment. The careful evaluation of these facial structures in conjunction with clinical symptoms is crucial in forming a proper differential diagnosis. The patient may present with jaw ache, earache, toothache, facial pain, and/or headache; however, the complaint may be as benign as general facial fullness or pressure. Treatment planning depend on various factors, including the chief complaint, medical history, presenting symptoms, examination, and diagnosis. In the past, TMD cases have sometimes been considered to be difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat; however, thanks to ongoing research in orofacial pain and pain management, clinicians are able to use a more standardized classification and better diagnostic and therapeutic methods to offer patients a wide range of treatment modalities with higher success rates.

Natural history and epidemiology of TMD

Most epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate that TMD symptoms are more commonly seen in women than in men, and that many symptoms seem to arise in adolescence or the early twenties and may continue intermittently, well into middle age; however, TMD symptomatology does get better with time, supporting a conservative management approach. In a study by Solberg et al,76% of subjects aged 18–25 years had one or more signs associated with TMD and 26% had at least one symptom associated with TMD. Of this group, only 10% had symptoms that were considered by the subjects to be severe enough to seek treatment. Rasmussenfound that most cases of a clicking TMJ did not evolve into an open or closed locking state. Rasmussen noted that, in the natural progression of internal derangement, acute TMD symptoms lasted a mean of 5.5 years and that, although joint noises generally did not disappear, most painful and disabling symptoms subsided in time. Similar results were shown by Könönen et al, who followed 128 Finnish adults over 9 years, in whom the incidence of clicking increased with age. None of the patients, however, developed locking. In a more recent study, the presence of degenerative joint disorders was found to be the discriminating factor in two different age subgroups: patients with a mean age range of 52 years presented a prevalence of crepitus, while patients with a mean age range of 38 years did not.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^116ZdoTD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Jaw claudication predicts the likelihood of developing permanent visual loss. The combination of headache and jaw pain should always raise suspicion of GCA. Reassuringly, the incidence of visual symptoms and complications in patients with GCA has reduced in the last 50 years, and this may be in part due to greater clinician awareness, improved diagnostic methods and recognition of the need for prompt treatment.

Classically, ESR is a diagnostic indicator for GCA and a normal ESR reduces the likelihood of biopsy positive GCA. However, as in this case, elevated inflammatory markers may not always be present. Other cases report similar findings, with one case of a 73 year old with GCA, in whom ESR was only mildly elevated at 27 mm/hour. Similarly, a 74 year old with right-sided temporal headaches and initially normal inflammatory markers (CRP < 5 mg/L), re-presented 6 months later with scalp tenderness, jaw claudication and biopsy proven GCA. Another elderly woman who presented with headaches, visual symptoms and jaw claudication was found to have normal ESR and CRP on repeated occasions. Despite this, US and biopsy assessment revealed GCA. Rana et al also reported a case of delayed diagnosis of GCA. An 81-year-old woman was presented with chronic headaches and an unremarkable CT head. Subsequently, she also presented to ophthalmology with a history of jaw claudication and irreversible visual symptoms.

### An underdiagnosed cause of headache, sinus pain, and… [^112xVP6m]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

to the editor: Headache, sinus pain, and ear pain are common chief complaints in the primary care setting. In 17 years of working in a community urgent care practice, I routinely encountered patients who reported a history of recurrent ear infections, sinus infections, or migraine headaches; yet, the history and physical examination did not correspond with the chronic recurrent diagnoses they reported. In many cases, examination of the jaw revealed they were most likely experiencing temporomandibular disorder. TMD affects as many as 10% to 15% of adults and presents with symptoms that include facial pain, ear discomfort, headache, and jaw pain. 1 Physical examination findings include tenderness over the temporomandibular joint, restricted jaw movement, and crepitus or clicking with opening the mandible. 1, 2 TMD is often comorbid with primary headache disorders and is found to be a contributing cause of "sinus headaches" in otolaryngology practice. 3, 4.

In my experience, most patients feel much better with short-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; symptoms typically resolve within about two weeks. Some patients also may need muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, or referral to an oral surgeon for an occlusive splint.

1. Of particular concern, many patients I saw over the years in community urgent care reported repeated treatment with antibiotics for presumptive ear and sinus infections. Some were skeptical of the new diagnosis and thought they did not need to take antibiotics. During the past year, I have worked in a university student health center where I have seen several undergraduate and graduate students with chronic recurrent headaches that, at least in part, could be attributed to TMD. Physicians should consider TMD in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with headache, sinus pain, or ear pain and no other diagnosis that readily explains the symptom.

Accurately diagnosing TMD can not only lead to more appropriate treatment to relieve the patient's pain but also reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

### Red ear syndrome: perspectives for the otolaryngologist [^117JdpDn]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Red ear syndrome (RES) is an unusual, often unrecognized condition that has rarely been reported in the otolaryngology literature despite the presence of symptoms and associated disorders of relevance to the otolaryngologist. When present, RES may have diagnostic value when uncertainties arise in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. Despite the appearance of a distinctive red ear, as well as symptoms and associated disorders relating to otolaryngology, discussion of RES is generally limited to neurology-based publications. A red ear is typically the one constant finding in RES while clinical presentation, rate of occurrence, duration, manner of onset, and response to treatment vary on a case-by-case basis. RES may have value as a diagnostic tool in cases of sinus headache and referred otalgia. In recognizing that RES is commonly associated with migraine and not sinus-related headaches, the presence of RES could help confirm a diagnosis of migraine and remove sinus headache from consideration. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder and cervical pathology are commonly encountered in both RES and referred otalgia. When identifying the cause of referred otalgia proves problematic, the presence of RES should prompt the clinician to concentrate on either TMJ or cervical pathology as the more likely diagnostic possibilities.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^113u5ztc]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Imaging

TN is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, and as such, neuroimaging and laboratory tests are not mandatory to make a diagnosis. Patients with a characteristic history and a normal neurologic examination other than pain may be treated without further workup. However, modern workup of patients with TN usually includes elective imaging for all patients to exclude secondary causes of TN, such as inflammatory or mass lesions. As computer tomography (CT) is limited in evaluating the brain parenchyma, skull base nerves, and CSF cisterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution sequences at the skull base is usually the modality of choice. According to a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, routine head imaging identifies nonvascular, structural causes of TN in up to 15% of TN patients.

### Temporal artery biopsy: concise guidelines for otolaryngologists [^112igmvv]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Temporal arteritis, also known more accurately as giant cell arteritis (GCA), is a multisystem vasculitis of elderly people that involves large and medium-sized blood vessels with a particular predilection to the craniofacial branches of the carotid arteries, especially the temporal artery. Symptoms include visual loss, headaches, fever, audiovestibular symptoms, and jaw claudication. Otolaryngologists are consulted to care for these patients to confirm the diagnosis, to rule out other causes of face pain and headaches, to care for patients with audiovestibular manifestations of GCA, and to perform temporal artery biopsies. Consequently, it is important for consultants to understand the signs and symptoms and natural history of GCA and the indications, technique, and complications of temporal artery biopsy. GCA can appear with protean head and neck manifestations. Otolaryngologists should be aware of these and understand the issues concerning maximizing the yield from temporal artery biopsies.

### New headaches with normal inflammatory markers: an early atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^114QVtSK]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

This case provides a warning on how easily common presentations may be dismissed, and serious diagnoses delayed if a broad list of differentials including additional systemic involvement is not considered.

This case illustrates how unexplained persistent headaches should raise the index of suspicion of atypical causes such as vasculitis. A judgement on the likelihood of vasculitis can be made at the time of clinical review with focused questions. This patient visited three different health professionals before a correct diagnosis was reached. Piecing together different symptoms and a patient timeline could have led to an earlier diagnosis. Asking 'red flag' questions is paramount in ensuring serious conditions are not missed. This is particularly important in systemic diseases, as patients are not necessarily aware of which symptoms are relevant. Thus, they may not volunteer the relevant clinical information unless prompted. This last point enabled the ophthalmologist to consider giant cell arteritis (GCA) as a diagnosis.

We demonstrate that although investigation results may be characteristic, they cannot always be relied on to exclude systemic diseases. In this case, inflammatory markers were not significantly raised, an unusual but well-documented occurrence. This is supported by a study that identified 167 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA over a 48-year period. Of these patients, nine had a reported erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of less than 40 mm/hour. Six of the nine patients had an ESR of < 30 mm/hour. All nine of these patients had a positive temporal artery biopsy. History taking and clinical judgement should therefore always take precedence in forming a diagnosis, and diagnoses not to be ruled out on the basis of normal tests; an important message in today's investigation-driven medical practice.

In the case of GCA, important screening questions to consider should include: scalp tenderness, temporal headaches, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, polymyalgia and constitutional symptoms.

Approximately 57 patients with red ear syndrome have been reported in the literature since it was initially described in 1994. The clinical phenotype therefore continues to be defined and no consistent treatment response has been described. We report three new cases of red ear syndrome and suggest that the disorder may exist as a primary trigeminal or cervical autonomic cephalalgia, coexist with other rare trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, or may be secondary. The pathogenesis in these different circumstances may be distinct, the triggers specific and, when secondary, the disorder may be more resistant to treatment.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^111vGwUD]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Perform a biopsychosocial assessment and address expectations

Where there is an identifiable cause of chronic pain (eg, diabetes, fibromyalgia), management should proceed as per the current available treatment guidelines with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. However, after appropriate investigations, in patients in whom the cause of chronic pain cannot be determined, repeated radiological and other special investigations are rarely helpful and should be avoided.

Management is guided by careful assessment for the presence of risk factors for chronic pain, psychosocial history, assessment of pain severity and the degree of functional impairment. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is recommended as a simple tool to measure pain intensity and physical and psychosocial components of pain.

Psychosocial and behavioral factors (Box 2) may complicate diagnosis, management and the course of chronic pain, and it is necessary to conduct a careful assessment for these using simple questions (Box 4) and/or self-rating scales (eg, Beck's Depression Inventory). Detailed assessment tools are time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It is important to point out that many of these psychosocial factors are normal psychological processes and/or responses to adversity. However, in some patients they can influence the subjective experience of pain and directly modulate pain pathways leading to maladaptive coping and persistent pain that is apparently non-responsive to treatment. Management in the primary care setting is often sufficient, but if necessary patients should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional.

It is important to explain to patients and their family/caregivers that chronic pain is multifactorial and does not necessarily indicate harm, and also to set realistic expectations in terms of goals of treatment. In chronic pain, complete pain relief is rarely achieved and aims of therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and return to work and physical activity. A clinically meaningful improvement is at least a 30% reduction in pain (or ≥ 2 points on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) and/or 30% improvement in function. Other important outcomes include improvement in sleep and mood, reduced analgesic consumption and reduced health care consultations.

Work absenteeism is associated with low self-esteem, depression, loss of skills, delayed recovery, and in some patients, personal re-identification as a "disabled person". Because the likelihood of returning to work diminishes with increasing duration of absence, it is important to encourage patients who are still working to continue to do so. Those who are off work should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.

### Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a clinical practice guideline from theAmerican College of Physicians [^116awTCz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) epidemiology and associated outcomes — prevalence and comorbidities — include that the exact prevalence is unknown, estimates range from 10% to 17% of the U.S. population, prevalence increases with age particularly in adults older than 60 years, and the growing rate of obesity contributes to increasing prevalence; OSA is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cognitive impairment and metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk for postoperative cardiac and respiratory complications.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111ECXUv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) definition and diagnostic approach specify that RARS is diagnosed when 4 or more episodes of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) occur in the past 12 months without signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis between episodes, and diagnosis of RARS is difficult given the intermittent nature of episodes and symptom overlap that can lead to misdiagnosis and over prescribing of antibiotics. Differential diagnoses of RARS include viral etiologies, dental pain, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, migraines, and facial pain disorders (trigeminal neuralgia, temporo mandibular joint disorder). RARS should be distinguished from isolated ABRS, and the proper diagnosis of RARS requires that each episode meets the criteria for ABRS and that there is at least one proven diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) confirmed with objective findings (nasal endoscopy and/ or CT scan) before a diagnosis of RARS is considered. Patients who meet the symptom criteria of RARS should be instructed to come into the clinic to be evaluated at the height of their symptoms to undergo a nasal endoscopy to evaluate for inflammation or mucopurulence, and sinus cultures are not necessary but could be helpful to culture-direct microbial therapy.

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0).

In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors.

Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) is recommended.
For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) is recommended.
For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) is recommended.
For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) is recommended.

Case 2

A 70-year-old immunocompetent man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with 6 months of recurrent erythematous targetoid, indurated plaques involving the trunk and extremities, but sparing the face (Fig 2). Individual lesions were only intermittently tender and would last for about 2 weeks before fading. He reported occasional tender nose inflammation and hip pain. Initial labwork showed elevated CRP and mean corpuscular volume; testing for ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro/La, and Lyme antibodies was negative. Skin biopsy showed interface dermatitis with superficial and deep inflammation, most suggestive of lupus or dermatomyositis, but with a broad differential diagnosis (Table II). He carried a diagnosis of tumid lupus for 1.3 years and was treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine without improvement (Table III). Additional testing revealed the UBA1 p. Met41Leu mutation diagnostic of VEXAS. BMB showed marrow hypercellularity and subset megakaryocytes with MDS-like features, which has not required treatment. Weekly tocilizumab was added to chloroquine with minimal improvement in cutaneous symptoms over 6 months. The patient will be starting ruxolitinib soon.

### Cardiovascular and somatic comorbidities and sleep measures using three hypopnea criteria in mild obstructive sleep-disordered breathing: sex, age, and body mass index differences in a retrospective sleep clinic cohort [^115ffyAJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

To describe sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) differences in comorbidities and polysomnography measures, categorized using 3 different apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) criteria in sleep clinic patients with mild obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of 305 (64% female) adult sleep clinic patients who underwent full-night in-laboratory polysomnography having been diagnosed with mild sleep-disordered breathing and prescribed positive airway pressure. Effects of sex, age, and BMI on comorbidities and polysomnography measures, including rates of AHI defined by ≥ 3% desaturations (AHI 3%), with arousals (AHI 3%A), by ≥ 4% desaturations (AHI 4%), and by respiratory disturbance index, were evaluated.

Results

Sixty-nine (23%), 116 (38%), 258 (85%), and 267 (88%) patients had AHI 4%, AHI 3%, AHI 3%A, and respiratory disturbance index ≥ 5 events/h, respectively. Ninety-day positive airway pressure adherence rates were 45.9% overall and higher in women > 50-years-old (51.2%, P = 0.013) and men (54.5%, P = 0.024) with no difference whether AHI 4% or AHI 3%A was < 5 or ≥ 5 events/h. Men and women had similar rates of daytime sleepiness (43.3%), anxiety (44.9%), and hypertension (44.9%). Women were more likely to have obesity, anemia, asthma, depression, diabetes, fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, migraine, and lower rates of coronary artery disease. More patients with AHI 4% < 5 events/h had depression, migraines, and anemia, and more patients with AHI 4% ≥ 5 events/h had congestive heart failure. Women were more likely to have higher sleep maintenance and efficiency, shorter average obstructive apnea and hypopnea durations, and less supine-dominant pattern. Average obstructive apnea and hypopnea duration decreased with increasing BMI, and average hypopnea duration increased with age. Obstructive apnea duration and obstructive hypopnea with arousal duration decreased with increasing BMI. More women had AHI 4% < 5 (81.5% vs 69.1%), AHI 3% < 5 (68.7% vs 49.1%), and AHI 3%A < 5 events/h (18.5% vs 10.0%). Greater age and higher BMI were associated with higher AHI.

Conclusions

Current AHI criteria do not predict comorbidities or adherence in mild sleep-disordered breathing patients. In this hypothesis-generating descriptive analysis, sex, BMI, and age may all be factors that should be accounted for in future research of mild sleep-disordered breathing patients. Different sleep study measures may weigh differently in calculations of risk for cardiovascular versus somatic comorbidities.

### Obstructive sleep apnea: a new preventive and therapeutic target for stroke: a new kid on the block [^114HGVWU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and a major cause of mental and physical impairment. Numerous studies have identified risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and smoking. However, even after considering these well-recognized risk factors, there is substantial variation in stroke rates and stroke-related outcomes. There is emerging evidence that obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of stroke independently of traditional risk factors. Obstructive sleep apnea is present in the majority of patients with stroke and contributes to persistent neurologic impairment. Early recognition and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during the post-stroke period lead to better neurologic outcome. Healthcare providers should be aware of the strong association of obstructive sleep apnea as a risk factor for stroke and its effect on neurologic recovery. The presence of hypertension and diabetes-the 2 most common comorbid conditions in obstructive sleep apnea-should prompt diagnostic workup for and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea as a way of primary and secondary prevention of stroke.

### Large-vessel GCA or a late presentation of Takayasu's arteritis? [^112CQ4Ei]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that involves medium- and large-sized vessels. Typically presenting with localised headache, temporal artery tenderness, jaw claudication and ophthalmological complications, it can also affect large vessels, leading to limb claudication. We describe a patient presenting with acute coronary syndrome but who was also noted to have absent upper limb pulses, leading to a speculative diagnosis of GCA. According to the American College of Rheumatology, the patient met the criteria for both giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. The gold standard investigation for diagnosing GCA is the temporal artery biopsy. Although contemplated, it was argued by the reviewing rheumatologist that this would not alter her management. She was thus commenced on prednisolone 60 mg daily, which led within 2 days to a rapid fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate to 66 mm/h, and by day 11 this had dropped further to 4 mm/h.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) — clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy are outlined as follows: GCA can present with both cranial and extracranial manifestations, with cranial manifestations including headaches, scalp tenderness, vision loss, and jaw claudication, and large vessel ("extracranial") involvement resulting in arterial stenosis and aneurysms causing absent pulses and limb claudication. GCA is more common in individuals of Northern European descent who are older than 50 years of age. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, pathologic abnormalities on temporal artery biopsy, and/or evidence of large vessel involvement on vascular imaging. Glucocorticoids remain the mainstay treatment for GCA, but tocilizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of GCA.

### Carbachol (Miostat) [^116aPnDe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of carbachol intraocular (also known as Miostat):
- **AF**: use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. To prevent AF in hyperthyroid patients, closely monitor cardiac function and thyroid status before using Carbachol. Discontinue the medication, manage the cardiac condition, and collaborate with a cardiologist for targeted intervention and treatment adjustments.
- **Airway obstruction**: use extreme caution in patients with bronchial asthma. Carefully assess patients for bronchial asthma history before use and consider alternative treatments if indicated. Discontinue the medication, administer bronchodilators, and seek immediate medical intervention to manage the complication in patients with bronchial asthma.
- **Exacerbation of bladder outflow obstruction**: use caution in patients with pre-existing urinary tract obstruction. To avert worsening of urinary tract obstruction, exercise caution with Carbachol use, assess urinary tract health, and consider alternative treatments for patients with obstruction risk. Discontinue the medication, relieve obstruction, and collaborate with a urologist for appropriate intervention.
- **Exacerbation of corneal abrasion**: use caution in patients with pre-existing corneal abrasion. Exercise caution when using Carbachol ophthalmic solution in patients with corneal abrasions, ensuring minimal drug penetration and considering alternative treatments if needed. If systemic toxicity occurs due to excessive Carbachol penetration in patients with corneal abrasions, discontinue its use, manage systemic symptoms, and consult a medical professional for appropriate intervention.
- **Exacerbation of Parkinson's disease**: use caution in patients with pre-existing Parkinson's disease. Use Carbachol cautiously, assess for Parkinson's history, and consider alternative treatments if indicated. Discontinue the medication, manage Parkinson's symptoms, and consult a neurologist for specialized guidance.
- **Exacerbation of peptic ulcer disease**: use caution in patients with active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal spasm. Screen patients for ulcer history, employ gastroprotective measures and consider alternative therapies if needed. Discontinue the medication, administer ulcer-healing treatments, and consult a gastroenterologist for specialized guidance.
- **Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of cardiac disease. Carefully assess patients for cardiac conditions, administer the lowest effective dose, and monitor cardiovascular function during treatment. Discontinue the medication, provide appropriate cardiac support, and consult a cardiologist for tailored management.

### Stroke as an atypical initial presentation of giant cell arteritis [^1126CXib]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an immune mediated inflammatory disease of medium and large arteries. Typically, GCA presents in patients over 50 years old with headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and sudden vision loss. GCA is commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, which presents with symptoms of aches and pains in the shoulders, neck and hips. Patients with GCA are at higher risk for developing subsequent strokes. There are some instances where GCA initially presents atypically as described in the case below.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112dPPGu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### An update on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of occipital neuralgia [^114VBsej]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This report intends to summarize the underlying pathophysiology, relevant symptoms, appropriate diagnostic workup, necessary imaging, and medical and surgical treatments of occipital neuralgia (ON). This was done through a comprehensive literature review of peer-reviewed literature throughout the most relevant databases. The current understanding of ON is that it causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the third occipital nerve or a combination of the 3. It is currently a subset of headaches although there is some debate if ON should be its own condition. Occipital neuralgia causes chronic, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears that can radiate to the front of the head. Diagnosis is typically clinical and patients present with intermittent, painful episodes associated with the occipital region and the nerves described above. Most cases are unilateral pain, however bilateral pain can be present and the pain can radiate to the frontal region and face. Physical examination is the first step in management of this disease and patients may demonstrate tenderness over the greater occipital and lesser occipital nerves. Anesthetics like 1% to 2% lidocaine or 0.25% to 0.5% bupivacaine can be used to block these nerves and antiinflammatory drugs like corticosteroids can be used in combination to prevent compressive symptoms. Other treatments like botulinum toxin and radiofrequency ablation have shown promise and require more research. Surgical decompression through resection of the obliquus capitis inferior is the definitive treatment however there are significant risks associated with this procedure.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^116PQ8NZ]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

The ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria outline the cardinal features of the TN phenotype. However, the clinician's appreciation of the detailed phenotype aids the diagnostic process particularly with regard to alerting to atypical features that warrant consideration of other diagnosis or further investigations.

Laterality and site of pain

The right side of the face (60%) is affected more than the left side. Bilateral simultaneous pain in TN is rare (1.7%–5%) and more often these patients experience side-alternating unilateral pain paroxysms. In view of its rarity, bilateral simultaneous or side-alternating trigeminal paroxysmal pains should raise concern about an underlying neurological disorder or a non-neurological disorder affecting the cranium. It therefore warrants careful exclusion of secondary pathology. If investigations are normal, then idiopathic cases of constant or long-lasting bilateral trigeminal pain include: temporomandibular joints dysfunction, persistent idiopathic facial pain and rarely migraine with facial pain. In cases with paroxysmal short-lasting pain episodes, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias such as short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNHA) should be considered if pain is associated with cranial autonomic symptoms or idiopathic stabbing headache if the pain is predominantly in the ophthalmic (V1) trigeminal distribution.

The pain of TN most frequently affects the distribution of the maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions of the trigeminal nerve, though approximately a quarter of the cases have ophthalmic (V1) division involvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111C8v8t]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 1 — differential diagnosis for acute otitis externa (AOE) specifies that clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal, with a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk; the action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality Grade C observational studies and Grade D reasoning from first principles, level of confidence in evidence high, benefit improved diagnostic accuracy, risks/harms/costs none in following the recommended action, benefits-harm assessment preponderance of benefit over harm, value judgments importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences none regarding the need for a proper diagnosis, and exceptions none. Supporting text notes symptoms including otalgia (70%), itching (60%), or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%) or ear canal pain on chewing; identifies a hallmark sign of diffuse AOE as tenderness of the tragus when pushed and the pinna when pulled, or both; and states that otoscopy will reveal diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, and material in the ear canal. It also warns that AOE can mimic the appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) and emphasizes that distinguishing AOE from AOM is important because the latter may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Orofacial pain for clinicians: a review of constant and attack-like facial pain syndromes [^111yi19j]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary headache syndromes such as migraine are among the most common neurological syndromes. Chronic facial pain syndromes of non-odontogenic cause are less well known to neurologists despite being highly disabling. Given the pain localization, these patients often consult dentists first who may conduct unnecessary dental interventions even if a dental cause is not identified. Once it becomes clear that dental modalities have no effect on the pain, patients may be referred to another dentist or orofacial pain specialist, and later to a neurologist. Unfortunately, neurologists are also often not familiar with chronic orofacial pain syndromes although they share the neural system, i.e., trigeminal nerve and central processing areas for headache disorders.

Conclusion

In essence, three broad groups of orofacial pain patients are important for clinicians: (i) Attack-like orofacial pain conditions, which encompass neuralgias of the cranial nerves and less well-known facial variants of primary headache syndromes; (ii) persistent orofacial pain disorders, including neuropathic pain and persistent idiopathic facial/dentoalveolar pain; and (iii) other differential diagnostically relevant orofacial pain conditions encountered by clinicians such as painful temporomandibular disorders, bruxism, sinus pain, dental pain, and others which may interfere (trigger) and overlap with headache. It is rewarding to know and recognize the clinical picture of these facial pain syndromes, given that, just like for headache, an internationally accepted classification system has been published and many of these syndromes can be treated with medications generally used by neurologists for other pain syndromes.

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^113gT4A2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck pain — Component 2 classification (impairment patterns and re-evaluation): Differential evaluation of musculoskeletal clinical findings is used to determine the most relevant physical impairments associated with the patient's reported activity limitations and medical diagnosis, and for neck pain are classified according to the key impairment(s) of body function, along with the characteristic and distribution of pain associated with that classification. For neck-related headaches, clinicians are encouraged to refer to the International Classification of Headache Disorders for a more inclusive list of headache types/classifications and to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for additional signs, symptoms, and conditions that should be considered in patients who present with a headache in addition to neck pain. Overall, classification is critical for matching the intervention strategy that is most likely to provide the optimal outcome for a patient's condition, but patients with neck pain often exhibit signs and symptoms that fit more than 1 classification, and the most relevant impairments of body function and the associated intervention strategies often change during the patient's episode of care; thus, continual re-evaluation of the patient's response to treatment and the patient's emerging clinical findings is important for providing the optimal interventions throughout the patient's episode of care.

### Advances in diagnosis, classification, pathophysiology, and management of trigeminal neuralgia [^113aNB2p]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful neurological condition with severe, stimulus-evoked, short-lasting stabbing pain attacks in the face. The past decade has offered new insights into trigeminal neuralgia symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment, leading to a change in the classification of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is crucial because neuroimaging interpretation and clinical management differ among the various forms of facial pain. MRI using specific sequences should be a part of the diagnostic workup to detect a possible neurovascular contact and exclude secondary causes. Demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm a diagnosis but rather to facilitate surgical decision making. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice for long-term treatment, whereas microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in medically refractory patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and animal models will provide further insight into the causes of trigeminal neuralgia and its pathophysiology. Development of more efficacious treatment options is highly warranted.

This study (n = 381) showed that the sensitivity for TAB was 39% with 100% specificity where clinical diagnosis was the reference standard. In comparison, temporal artery US had a sensitivity of 54% but a lower specificity of 81%. In addition, performing TAB on only those with negative temporal artery US would increase the sensitivity to 65% with 81% specificity. This would potentially reduce the need for TAB by 43%. Our case highlights the need for referral to secondary care for investigations as above, in order to elicit positive findings in those with atypical features.

In summary, we present an unusual, but important case of delayed GCA diagnosis. The normal inflammatory markers at initial presentation led to a lower index of suspicion that GCA was a possible differential diagnosis. We suggest not dismissing GCA as a differential based on normal inflammatory markers, but to explore atypical presentations and in particular seek the presence of key symptoms. Education regarding clinical presentations and advancements in imaging can help improve the recognition of atypical GCA presentations such as in this case.

Learning points

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) may lead to permanent visual loss.
Suspect underlying systemic diseases, for example, vasculitis in patients presenting with persistently unexplained symptoms or multiple presentations.
Confirm the presence (or absence) of red flags such as jaw claudication, visual disturbance and scalp tenderness in patients with headaches, to avoid missed opportunities in timely diagnosis.
Normal or low-normal inflammatory markers do not exclude GCA; specialist review is required if red flag symptoms are present.

### Vasculitis with granulomatosis: an atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis [^113U6F5H]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large- and medium-vessel granulomatous vasculitis that affects the aorta and its major branches, particularly the extracranial branches of the carotid artery.GCA occurs primarily in those over 50 years of age and classically manifests as fevers, malaise, headaches, a temporal artery abnormality, jaw claudication, and visual disturbance. The American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of GCA require at least 3 of the following: age > 50 years, new-onset headaches, temporal artery tenderness, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of ≥ 50 mm/hour, and an arterial biopsy demonstrating vasculitis with a mononuclear cell infiltrate or granulomatous inflammation. However, the American College of Rheumatology criteria have poor diagnostic sensitivity for vasculitides, which is likely because of the development of newer imaging techniques and antibody testing methods.

Cutaneous manifestations occur infrequently in patients with GCA; however, the skin over the affected artery may be tender, erythematous, edematous, or purpuric, with induration of the artery and a diminished pulse. Other cutaneous manifestations are categorized as ischemic due to arterial occlusion or nonischemic because of a variety of mechanisms that are poorly understood. We report a case of GCA presenting with atypical systemic and cutaneous manifestations.

### The radiology of referred otalgia [^111hdLN6]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Pain referred to the ear is a well-documented phenomenon, which can be due to a multitude of disease processes. With the recent and rapid progression of CT and MR imaging technology, radiologists have played an increasing role in solving this potentially difficult diagnostic dilemma. Essentially any pathology residing within the sensory net of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X and the upper cervical nerves C2 and C3 can potentially cause referred otalgia. This article will attempt to outline the various sensorineural pathways that dually innervate the ear and other sites within the head and neck, as well as discuss various disease processes that are known to result in referred otalgia.

### Stroke as an atypical initial presentation of giant cell arteritis [^115x5TA9]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion although there is a set of typical symptoms associated with giant cell arteritis, such as headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, atypical symptoms in patients older than 50-years should also be considered for GCA. These atypical symptoms may include chronic cough, fever of unknown origin, and stroke symptoms especially if the patient's ESR levels are elevated. Clinical decision-making should be driven by a high index of suspicion since no single test has perfect sensitivity. Whether a combination of ESR, CRP and temporal artery biopsy results can improve the diagnostic accuracy of GCA would need further study. As with all conditions, prompt diagnosis and the timely initiation of targeted treatment improves the chances of optimal outcomes.

### History of facial pain diagnosis [^116jKd4W]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Facial pain is pain localised to the face, and the diagnosis of facial pains has puzzled clinicians for centuries. Some of the confusion is related to the delimitation of the facial structure and how pain is classified. The face is here defined as the part of the head that is limited by the hairline, by the front attachment of the ear and by the lower jaw, both the rear edge and the lower horizontal part of the jaw. The face also includes the oral and nasal cavity, the sinuses, the orbital cavity and the temporomandibular joint. Pain in the facial region can be classified in multiple ways, for example according to underlying pathology (malignant vs. non-malignant), the temporal course (acute vs. chronic), underlying pathophysiology (neuropathic, inflammatory or idiopathic), localisation (superficial vs. deep), the specific structure involved (the sinus joint, skin etc), and underlying etiology (infection, tumour etc). In some instances, the diagnosis of facial pain focuses on the involved structure, for example temporomandibular joint disorder, in other cases it is the underlying pathology (sinusitis), and in others it is the specific character of the pain that will dictate the diagnosis (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia).

Facial pains, like other pains, are purely subjective and for some painful conditions there are no obvious objective signs, so the diagnosis very much relies on the descriptive characteristics of the pain. We will limit the discussion in this paper to four major types of facial pains: Trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical facial pain), and temporomandibular disorders and summarise a few historical aspects of diagnosing these conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^114pmFbF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — differential diagnosis and prevalence across settings are outlined with policy metadata: Exceptions: None; Policy level: Recommendation; Differences of opinion: None. Differential diagnosis spans otologic, neurologic, and other entities, including Ménière's disease, Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis; neurologic conditions such as Vestibular migraine, Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack and stroke, Demyelinating diseases, Central nervous system lesions, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Central positional vertigo; and other entities including Anxiety or panic disorder, Cervicogenic vertigo, Medication side effects, Postural hypotension, and Various medical conditions (eg, toxic, infectious, and metabolic conditions). Epidemiology varies by setting: In a German telephone survey of > 1000 patients with dizziness, BPPV accounted for 8% of cases; in a British general practice setting, BPPV accounted for 42% of cases, followed by vestibular neuritis (41%), Ménière's disease (10%), vascular cases (3%), and other causes (3%); and in subspecialty populations, BPPV accounts for 20% to 53% of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat specialty clinics for dizziness. Diagnostic considerations note that BPPV has been described as occurring in conjunction with, or as a consequence of, other vestibular disorders as well, so clinicians should consider the possibility of > 1 vestibular disorder being present and emphasize that taking a history that focuses on the timing and triggers of a patient's dizziness is more important than the specific descriptor that patients use.

Module A — evaluation and treatment of headache — begins at "Adults with headache" (Box 1), proceeds to "General history and physical exam (see Sidebar 1)" (Box 2), then asks "Does this patient need urgent/emergent evaluation/treatment or have red flags? (see Sidebar 1)" (Box 3); if "Yes", "Consider evaluation in urgent care or ED" (Box 4); if "No", ask "Is there a secondary headache (see Sidebar 2), complicated headache presentation, or multiple headache types requiring specialist referral?" (Box 5); if "Yes", "Refer to specialist for further diagnosis and evaluation" (Box 6); if "No", ask "Is there clinical concern for TTH? Including: Bilateral headache; Non-pulsatile pain; Mild to moderate pain; Not worsened by activity (see Sidebar 3)" (Box 7).

### Debunking myths in headache diagnosis for the pain practitioner [^1175w64y]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

With headache being one of the most common chief complaints, it is essential for pain practitioners to interpret and differentiate a variety of headache characteristics to accurately diagnose and treat specific headache disorders. Certain misconceptions often lead to misdiagnosis. This article presents and discusses six myths about several common headache disorders (migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, cervicogenic headache, sinus headache, and occipital neuralgia) often encountered in clinical practice. The discussion is based primarily on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition and the latest studies. Recognizing and understanding the intricacies behind key headache diagnoses will help providers devise appropriate plans to better care for their patients.
