## Question

Best drug class to lower hba1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which drug class is best to lower HbA1c in type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including baseline HbA1c and whether we are choosing initial therapy or an add-on to metformin. Then, I should verify the comparative glycemic potency of each class from high-quality trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will consider patient-specific modifiers such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, obesity, hypoglycemia risk, and cost. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and note exceptions where insulin or other strategies are preferred, anchoring on GRADE and ADA/EASD guidance for credibility.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. For most adults with type 2 diabetes, metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated, so the common decision point is which class to add when HbA1c remains above goal on metformin, typically in the 6.8–8.5% range in trials like GRADE, with intensification considered when HbA1c is about 1.5% above the individualized target or when levels are very high, where insulin may be indicated up front [^1166XBdv] [^113oR5vB] [^111o3WxT].

> Now, I need to check comparative glycemic potency head-to-head. The GRADE trial, a large randomized study adding therapy to metformin, showed that liraglutide (GLP-1 RA) and insulin glargine were modestly more effective than glimepiride and clearly more effective than sitagliptin at maintaining HbA1c below 7% over five years, with sitagliptin being the least effective option, which supports GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin as top-tier choices for potency when added to metformin [^113oR5vB] [^115BF2ib].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all GLP-1 RAs being equal. I should confirm class effects and within-class variability. Meta-analytic data indicate that GLP-1 RAs and basal insulins generally produce larger HbA1c reductions than DPP-4 inhibitors, with expected add-on A1C drops around 1.0–2.0% for GLP-1 RAs versus roughly 0.7–1.0% for DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones, and about 0.5–1.0% for SGLT2 inhibitors, acknowledging that absolute reductions depend on baseline HbA1c and study design [^1131T8QB] [^111Q9UN7].

> Wait, let me verify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in pure glycemic potency. I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors might match GLP-1 RAs for A1C lowering, but I should double-check that. Network meta-analyses suggest SGLT2 inhibitors typically lower A1C by about 0.5–1.0% as add-on therapy, placing them behind GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin for potency, even though their cardiorenal benefits are independent of A1C change, which is a different clinical axis than raw glycemic lowering [^1131T8QB] [^111Q9UN7] [^112VEpub].

> I will now examine patient-specific modifiers that can shift the "best" choice. In established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, guidelines prioritize GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit and/or SGLT2 inhibitors irrespective of baseline A1C, because these agents reduce cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations, and kidney outcomes. In heart failure or CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors are particularly favored, again independent of A1C targets [^116przRK] [^111tL899] [^112VEpub].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe hyperglycemia or is symptomatic. I need to ensure I address the insulin threshold. When A1C is ≥ 10% or glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL, or if there are catabolic features, initiating insulin is appropriate, and guidelines also note that if not already on a GLP-1 RA, starting a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA first can be considered, with insulin added if needed; fixed-ratio basal insulin/GLP-1 RA combinations can mitigate weight gain and hypoglycemia compared with insulin alone while preserving potency [^111o3WxT] [^112KqxYW] [^116Fw9dd].

> Let me consider obesity and hypoglycemia risk, since these often steer the choice. GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs promote weight loss and have low intrinsic hypoglycemia risk, making them attractive when weight reduction is a priority or hypoglycemia must be minimized, whereas sulfonylureas increase hypoglycemia and weight and are generally deprioritized unless cost or access constraints dictate otherwise [^116NuMDm] [^1158avd1].

> I should confirm durability and real-world effectiveness, not just trial efficacy. Observational emulations and pragmatic data reinforce that liraglutide tends to outperform sitagliptin and performs comparably or better than some other second-line options for maintaining A1C below 7%, while also highlighting that baseline A1C strongly predicts absolute A1C reduction across agents, which tempers expectations at very high baselines and supports timely intensification to avoid inertia [^115BF2ib] [^11353sVU].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and actionable. For most patients with inadequate control on metformin who need maximal glycemic potency, a GLP-1 RA is the best class choice, with basal insulin as an alternative when rapid, reliable lowering is required or when GLP-1 RAs are not tolerated or contraindicated. SGLT2 inhibitors remain excellent for cardiorenal risk reduction but are generally less potent for pure A1C lowering than GLP-1 RAs, and DPP-4 inhibitors are less effective and best reserved for patients prioritizing tolerability and hypoglycemia avoidance over potency [^113oR5vB] [^1131T8QB] [^116przRK].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed exceptions. In severe hyperglycemia, insulin initiation is appropriate, and in established ASCVD, HF, or CKD, prioritize GLP-1 RAs and/or SGLT2 inhibitors for outcome benefits irrespective of A1C, while individualizing based on access, cost, and patient preferences to sustain adherence and long-term control [^111o3WxT] [^116przRK] [^111tL899].

Insulin is the **most potent class** for lowering HbA1c, with basal insulin reducing HbA1c by 1.0–1.5% and basal–bolus regimens by 1.5–2.5% [^notfound]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are the **most effective non-insulin class**, lowering HbA1c by 1.0–1.5% and supporting weight loss with low hypoglycemia risk [^113oR5vB] [^112jD3xu]. SGLT2 inhibitors and sulfonylureas reduce HbA1c by 0.5–1.0%, while DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones lower HbA1c by 0.5–0.8%. Metformin remains first-line for most patients, but insulin or GLP-1 RAs are preferred when HbA1c is markedly elevated or when rapid, substantial lowering is needed [^111o3WxT] [^1166XBdv].

## Clinical scenarios influencing drug class selection

- **Severe hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL)**: Insulin is preferred for rapid, substantial lowering [^111o3WxT].
- **Obesity or weight management**: GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors are preferred due to weight loss benefits [^1158avd1] [^111UbfMQ].
- **Cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease**: SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefits are recommended [^114rkHe5] [^112VEpub].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors are preferred due to low hypoglycemia risk [^116NuMDm] [^112Bi5bN].

## Conclusion and recommendations

Insulin remains the **most potent class** for lowering HbA1c, especially in severe hyperglycemia [^113KYHxJ]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are the **most effective non-insulin option**, offering substantial HbA1c reduction with weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk [^1131T8QB]. Metformin is first-line for most patients, but insulin or GLP-1 RAs are preferred when HbA1c is markedly elevated or when rapid, substantial lowering is needed [^112KqxYW].

Type 2 diabetes — injectable therapy selection and reassessment: If injectable therapy is needed to reduce A1C, consider GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in most individuals prior to insulin, and to avoid therapeutic inertia, reassess and modify treatment regularly (e.g., every 3–6 months). Insulin can be used as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]).

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of medications for type 2 diabetes: an update including new drugs and 2-drug combinations [^116CBXDS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Given the increase in medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinicians and patients need information about their effectiveness and safety to make informed choices.

Purpose

To summarize the benefits and harms of metformin, second-generation sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, as monotherapy and in combination, to treat adults with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception through April 2010 for English-language observational studies and trials. The MEDLINE search was updated to December 2010 for long-term clinical outcomes.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened reports and identified 140 trials and 26 observational studies of head-to-head comparisons of monotherapy or combination therapy that reported intermediate or long-term clinical outcomes or harms.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers following standardized protocols serially extracted data, assessed applicability, and independently evaluated study quality.

Data Synthesis

Evidence on long-term clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy) was of low strength or insufficient. Most medications decreased the hemoglobin A(1c) level by about 1 percentage point and most 2-drug combinations produced similar reductions. Metformin was more efficacious than the DPP-4 inhibitors, and compared with thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas, the mean differences in body weight were about -2.5 kg. Metformin decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, and DPP-4 inhibitors. Sulfonylureas had a 4-fold higher risk for mild or moderate hypoglycemia than metformin alone and, in combination with metformin, had more than a 5-fold increased risk compared with metformin plus thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones increased risk for congestive heart failure compared with sulfonylureas and increased risk for bone fractures compared with metformin. Diarrhea occurred more often with metformin than with thiazolidinediones.

Limitations

Only English-language publications were reviewed. Some studies may have selectively reported outcomes. Many studies were small, were of short duration, and had limited ability to assess clinically important harms and benefits.

Conclusion

Evidence supports metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. Most 2-drug combinations similarly reduce hemoglobin A(1c) levels, but some increased risk for hypoglycemia and other adverse events.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1131T8QB]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — add‑on glycemic efficacy with noninsulin agents and combination limits: when added to metformin, each new class of oral noninsulin agents generally lowers A1C by approximately 0.7–1.0% (8–11 mmol/mol), and adding a glucagon‑like peptide‑1 receptor agonist (GLP‑1 RA) or the dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA to metformin usually results in 1.0 to 2% A1C reduction; however, adding a DPP‑4 inhibitor to a GLP‑1 RA is not expected to provide additional glucose‑lowering benefit beyond the GLP‑1 RA alone.

3.2.1 GLP‐1 RAs in combination with SGLT2i

Two prospective studies looked into the combination of GLP‐1 RAs with an SGLT2 inhibitor. In the DURATION‐8 study, combined therapy with the GLP‐1 RAs exenatide and the SGLT2i dapagliflozin was observed to reduce HbA1c by 2 percentage points and simultaneously produced a weight loss of 3.4 kg. Both targets were superior to those obtained with monotherapy with either agent. On the other hand, the AWARD‐10 study demonstrated an up to 1.34 percentage points HbA1c reduction and a weight loss of 3.1 kg when the GLP‐1 RAs dulaglutide 1.5 mg was added to the treatment with SGLT2i (with or without metformin). Moreover, both dual treatment regimens improved cardiovascular risk factors and were well tolerated. The most recent trial, SUSTAIN 9, investigated the combined treatment with the GLP‐1 RAs semaglutide 1.0 mg as an add‐on therapy to SGLT2i in patients with inadequately controlled T2D. Patients randomized to the combination treatment had a significant reduction in HbA1c (1.42 percentage points) and bodyweight (3.81 kg) and showed good tolerability. A meta‐analysisof four randomized controlled trials compared a therapy with SGLT2i to combination treatment of GLP‐1 RAs as add‐on to SGLT2i. The GLP‐1RA/SGLT2i combination was associated with greater reduction in HbA1c (0.74 percentage points) and body weight (1.61 kg), and similar incidence of hypoglycaemia compared to SGLT2i alone. These results suggest that the efficacy of combined GLP‐1 RAs/SGLT2i therapy is partially additive in lowering HbA1c level and body weight.

Etiology and Risk Factors By definition, the specific reasons for the development of the defects of insulin secretion and action that characterize type 2 diabetes are unknown. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age and lack of physical activity, and it occurs more often in persons with obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Type 2 diabetes also occurs more often in women with previous gestational diabetes and in certain ethnic groups. There is also evidence of a familial, probably genetic, predisposition. Prognosis Persons with type 2 diabetes have blood glucose levels that have been shown to rise progressively from the time of diagnosis. During the UKPDS, A1C levels rose in persons with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, irrespective of the type of treatment given.

In 2011, primary care physicians in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands succeeded in lowering A1C levels in patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes for more than five years after diagnosis. Blood glucose levels above the normal range have been shown to be associated not only with the presence of symptoms, but also with an increased risk of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. Early treatment of hyperglycemia in the UKPDS over nine years resulted in a significant decrease in microvascular complications and a continued reduction in microvascular risk and emergent risk reductions for myocardial infarction and death from any cause during 10 years of post-trial follow-up. However, in persons with long-standing type 2 diabetes, the effects of treating hyperglycemia are less positive or even absent. Data from the General Practice Research Database show that low and high mean A1C values are associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiac events.

Both intensive insulin treatment and the risk of hypoglycemia have been linked to an increased death rate. EDITOR'S NOTE: Glibenclamide is called glyburide in the United States. Gliclazide is not available in the United States.

Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease — background therapy and decision principles: Most patients with T2D and CV disease will continue metformin together with an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA with proven CV benefit, and decisions to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor (for CV or kidney risk reduction) or a GLP-1RA (for CV risk reduction) should not be contingent on HbA1c levels. If an SGLT2 or GLP-1RA is added to a well-controlled T2D regimen, dose adjustment of background medications may be required to avoid hypoglycemia in the context of insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, particularly in patients at or near glycemic goals. Efforts to achieve glycemic and blood pressure targets and to adhere to lipid, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, and smoking cessation guidelines should continue after addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

### Relationship of baseline HbA1c and efficacy of current glucose-lowering therapies: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^11353sVU]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) concentrations vary between clinical trials of glucose-lowering agents and this may affect interpretation of clinical efficacy. The objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between baseline HbA(1c) and reduction of HbA(1c) in clinical trials.

Methods

PubMed literature searches from 1991 to 2007. Randomized controlled studies with placebo-controlled or comparator arms [≥ 9 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population] ranging in duration from 23 to 52 weeks, in which baseline and change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were reported. The relationship between baseline HbA(1c) and change in HbA(1c) was analysed by a weighted least-squared regression model accounting for ITT population and variance of HbA(1c) change. Fourteen per cent of independently abstracted studies met the selection criteria.

Results

Meta-analysis from 59 clinical trials (8479 patients) produced weighted R² of 0.35 (P < 0.0001) for the association of baseline HbA(1c) and absolute change in HbA(1c). Subanalysis of eight metformin clinical trials demonstrated a stronger association [weighted R² of 0.67 (P = 0.0130)]. Exclusion of metformin clinical trials from the overall meta-analysis (n = 51) yielded a weighted R² of 0.31 (P < 0.0001). Subanalyses of clinical trials of glucose-lowering therapies predominantly targeting fasting (n = 37) or postprandial (n = 22) blood glucose produced weighted R² values of 0.27 (P < 0.001) and 0.42 (P < 0.005), respectively.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate a positive relationship between baseline HbA(1c) and the magnitude of HbA(1c) change across 10 categories of glucose-lowering therapies, irrespective of class or mode of action. These observations should be considered when assessing clinical efficacy of diabetes therapies derived from clinical trials.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111o3WxT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glycemic thresholds for intensification and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes: When A1C is ≥ 1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal, many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent agent; insulin should be considered as part of any combination plan when hyperglycemia is severe, and it is common practice to initiate insulin for blood glucose levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (≥ 16.7 mmol/L) or A1C ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), or if symptomatic hyperglycemia or catabolic signs are present; people with severe hyperglycemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for baseline A1C above 10–12%.

### Causal deep learning reveals the comparative effectiveness of antihyperglycemic treatments in poorly controlled diabetes [^116prp4T]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, antihyperglycemic treatment strategies for patients with an HbA1c ≥ 9% were examined over a five-year period in a nationwide cohort of US patients with T2DM. Over 80 different strategies of drug class combination were observed, ranging from monotherapy to combinations of five distinct drug classes. This enormous heterogeneity persisted even after accounting for age, a number of comorbidities, and status of insulin dependence. A network meta-analysis using deep causal models was performed on the cohort's observational data to rank treatment strategies for ten clinical cohorts based on effectiveness in lowering HbA1C in the high-risk population. The rankings differed between each of the cohorts and they generalized well to snapshots in the held-out test set. Top-three ranked treatments were clinically and statistically better at lowering HbA1c than other choices for most cohorts. There were considerable differences between which treatments were best for each of the clinical cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 14), though the specific class and combination were cohort dependent. Therapeutic classes known to provide secondary cardioprotective benefits, such as SGLT2's and GLP-1's, feature prominently in the top ten choices for each cohort. Although cardioprotection was not evaluated in this study, this finding may indicate that there is no need for a trade-off between glucose control and cardioprotection. Additionally, although no monotherapy was the top-ranked treatment for any cohort, the rankings clearly show that simply adding more drug classesto a patient's regimen is not uniformly best for HbA1c reduction, consistent with prior literature showing decreasing adherence and worse outcomes with the increasing complexity of medication regimens, as well as the lack of association between polypharmacy (> 4 drugs) and improved A1c control, in patients with diabetes. In our data, treatment switches, when they occurred, moved patients into lower-ranked strategies as often as they resulted in higher-ranked strategies. Interestingly, in the insulin non-user groups, insulin-containing regimens tend to rank poorly, suggesting poor real-world effectivenessof a medication known to have high efficacy in Randomized Controlled Trials.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1142jopc]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Glycemic management — HbA1c targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are described as uncertain regarding which patient characteristics would yield greater benefits than harms with lower target ranges, though there are valid reasons to speculate greater net benefit in younger, newly diagnosed patients with minimal or no T2DM complications, longer life expectancy, or low hypoglycemia risk medications. Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

### Patterns of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiating second-line therapy after metformin monotherapy: retrospective data for 10 256 individuals from the United Kingdom and Germany [^117Vn66j]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

4.3 Changes in 6‐monthwith second‐line diabetes treatments

After 6 months of second‐line treatment, HbA1c decreased in all treatment groups and there was a non‐linear relationship between baseline HbA1c and 6‐month HbA1c change. There were some small differences between treatment groups, with combination therapies associated with larger HbA1c reductions than monotherapies, and SUs associated with slightly greater HbA1c reductions than DPP‐4is. However, these findings should be considered carefully, given that this was a descriptive study and, therefore, not designed to test hypotheses or to formally compare the effectiveness of treatments. Therefore, it is our view that the choice of second‐line treatment had only a modest impact on 6‐month baseline‐adjusted HbA1c reductions, even after controlling for covariates in a multivariable analysis. Moreover, these findings were broadly consistent across all baseline HbA1c values. These real‐world findings were consistent with a recent meta‐analysis, in which all investigated drug classes lowered HbA1c to a similar extent when combined with MET, 26 as well as with findings from a primary care database study in Germany. 27 Given the similar efficacy of all second‐line treatments, their associated side effects (eg, risks of weight gain, hypoglycaemia) and additional benefits (eg, weight reduction, blood pressure reduction) 6, 9 may be the most important considerations when selecting second‐line treatment options for patients with T2DM.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^112XFKci]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When transitioning to iGlarLixi from basal insulin, the starting dose depends on the patient's current basal insulin regimen. It is recommended to start at 30 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on 30 units of basal insulin daily or more, and 15 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on < 30 units of basal insulin daily, with titration directed by FPG targets. In those transitioning to iDegLira from basal insulin, the starting dose is 16 units once daily, with titration based on FPG, up to a maximum daily dose of 50 units once daily. Short‐acting insulin should generally be discontinued once an FRC is initiated, unless continued for specific prandial needs that are not expected to be covered by the GLP‐1 RA component. The rationale for discontinuing short‐acting insulin once initiating an FRC is that the GLP‐1 RA is expected to provide sufficient prandial glucose control. In most patients, this is sufficient to address post‐prandial glycemic excursions without the need for additional insulin. However, for those with high carbohydrate intake, continued post‐prandial excursions or long‐standing diabetes with impaired beta‐cell function, prandial insulin may be warranted to achieve glycemic targets.

6.3 Changing from a‐1 receptor agonist to an

Switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC such as iGlarLixi or iDegLira is a strategy to consider when glycemic control is inadequate, particularly secondary to rising FPG levels not being adequately addressed by the GLP‐1 RA alone. Patient selection should take into account the degree to which HbA1c exceeds the target. Overall, intensifying therapy from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC provides an improvement in HbA1c of ~1%. In those on a GLP‐1 RA with more marked HbA1c elevations (i.e. HbA1c more than 2% above goal or more than 10%), FRC therapy may not be expected to achieve glycemic targets, necessitating the initiation of a separate basal insulin. Rates of hypoglycaemia are expected to increase with FRC use due to the inclusion of basal insulin, though the hypoglycaemia risk remains low overall. Weight gain should be expected when initiating an FRC compared to GLP‐1 RA monotherapy due to the insulin component, though it is usually modest and offset by the improvement in glycemic control.

presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects. Data Synthesis Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A1c levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one. SUs are most likely secondary to a reduction in glucotoxicity. When compared with placebo, SU therapy leads to a mean decrease in HbA1c of approximately 1% to 2%. 7, 29, 30 One study31 demonstrated a more impressive change, but the rise in HbA1c level experienced by the placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, metformin's ability to lower HbA1c is similar to that of SUs. 52–59 When compared with SUs in head-to-head trials, metformin's glucose-lowering effect is generally equivalent. 60–63. or insulin.

With a similar HbA1c reduction observed in the other intensively treated subjects, more impressive risk reduction was noted in the primary aggregate end points.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

Barriers to Clinical Management of DM Along the Lifespan

Individuals with type 1 DM have unique challenges to diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis can be confusing, as > 40% of patients are diagnosed after age 30 years. 8 Individualized treatment plans with specialists are paramount to avoid severe complications of hyper‐ and hypoglycemia. There is not much evidence on what role, if any, the newer drug classes may have on CVD outcomes, and there is a substantial cost to caring for a patient with type 1 DM.

Similarly, there are many barriers in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is confusion among healthcare professionals on which test is best to screen for and to diagnose T2DM (eg, hemoglobin A1c, oral glucose tolerance test, or fasting blood glucose). When does the relationship between impaired glucose metabolism and CVD risk begin? Weight loss is central to decreasing DM and prediabetes. However, it is very challenging for most patients. The treatment for T2DM is complex and changing quickly as additional clinical trials report on results. Clinical confusion exists on what should be first‐, second‐, and third‐line agents for these patients. Also, the cost of newer drugs makes choices more limited for many. There is a need for better guidance for providers on when to use these medications.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^114horTU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) also compared the effects of tight vs. standard glycemic control. In this study, the duration of diabetes at baseline was longer (11.5 years) vs. other trials, as was the difference in achieved HbA1c (6.9% vs. 8.4%). Yet, the only outcome that improved over a median follow‐up of 5.6 years with tight control was the progression of albuminuria. However, when follow‐up was extended to a median of 9.8 years, tight control reduced the risk of the composite outcome of first heart attack, stroke, new or worsening congestive heart failure, amputation for ischaemic gangrene or cardiovascular‐related death (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.34–0.85). Interestingly, hazard ratios for all components of the primary outcome favoured tight control, yet none were statistically significant.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial randomly assigned 10 251 subjects to tight glycemic control (HbA1c < 6%) or standard control (HbA1c of 7%–7.9%). On average, the study population had diabetes for 10 years at baseline and the tight control arm was stopped early after a median follow‐up of 3.5 years. The tight control arm received more frequent antihyperglycemic medication changes and more antihyperglycemic medications overall including key differences in rosiglitazone (91.2% vs. 58.3%) and any insulin (77.3% vs. 55.4%). Relatively few patients were on incretins at this time and the only incretin‐based therapies used were exenatide and sitagliptin. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors were not available at the time of this trial. The tight control group experienced more hypoglycaemia (3.1% vs. 1%), more weight gain (3.5 kg vs. 0.4 kg), more all‐cause death (5.0% vs. 4.0%; hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01–1.46) and more death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.76). Conversely, there was no increase in stroke risk, heart failure risk and tight control reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.92).

### Glycemia treatment strategies in the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes (ACCORD) trial [^115RCRd4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There is an independent progressive epidemiologic relation between glycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events; however, whether lowering glucose levels with currently available therapies can reduce CVD events remains unknown. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is designed to answer this question in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In ACCORD, 10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes and other CVD risk factors or CVD were randomly allocated to intensive glycemic control, targeting a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level < 6%, or standard glycemic control, targeting an HbA1c level of 7.0%-7.9%. All participants are provided with diabetes education, glucose-monitoring equipment, and antidiabetic medications. All participants in the intensive glycemic control group are started on ≥ 2 classes of agents. Doses are intensified or a new medication class is added every month if HbA1c levels are ≥ 6% or if > 50% of premeal or postmeal capillary glucose readings are > 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or > 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), respectively. All drug combinations are permitted, and drugs are reduced only because of side effects or contraindications. Annual training, menus of approaches for intensification, regular electronic messaging, audits of achieved glycemia, and central feedback to sites support glycemic intensification strategies in intensive participants. In participants in the standard glycemic control group, therapy is intensified whenever HbA1c is ≥ 8%, and antihyperglycemic drugs that promote hypoglycemia (ie, insulin or insulin secretagogues) are reduced if HbA1c persistently decreases to < 7% in the setting of hypoglycemia. ACCORD addresses the hypothesis that aggressive glucose lowering prevents CVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is focused on the levels of glycemia achieved using a variety of strategies, not on the specific therapies used. It will also provide information on how to safely approach near-normal levels of glucose control in clinical practice and evidence to support future clinical guidelines for diabetes management in older adults.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^112oeNwm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published several diabetes treatment algorithms, but none have been tested in real-life settings. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of achieving and/or maintaining HbA1c levels < 7.0% using current diabetes treatment guidelines and the resources available in the public health care system of Brazil.

Methods

A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care unit. Intervention consisted of intensification of lifestyle changes and sequential prescription of drugs based on ADA guidelines using the medications available through the publicly funded Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS).

Results

Ninety patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.4 years; diabetes duration: 8.2 ± 9.1 years) completed the trial. During the intervention period, increases were observed in number of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) classes per patient (1.50 ± 0.74 vs. 1.67 ± 0.7; p = 0.015), OAD pills per patient (2.64 ± 1.89 vs. 3.33 ± 2.23 pills/patient; p < 0.001), insulin dosage (0.20 ± 0.29 vs.0.50 ± 0.36 UI/kg/day; p = 0.008) and number of patients on insulin (19 [21%] vs. 31 [34%]; p < 0.01), but no improvement in HbA1c (7.2 ± 1.6% vs. 7.3 ± 1.5%; p = 0.453) or frequency of patients on target, defined as HbA1c < 7% (53.3% vs. 48.9%; p = 0.655). Patients with baseline HbA1c < 7% had a small increase in HbA1c during the trial (6.3 ± 0.4 vs. 6.7 ± 0.9%; p = 0.002). No such change was observed in those with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7%.

Conclusions

In this group of patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.2%, implementation of 2006/2009 ADA/EASD guidelines led to achievement of the therapeutic goal of HbA1c < 7% in a small proportion of patients.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116Fw9dd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PATIENT FACTORS IMPACTING GLYCEMIC GOALS AND THERAPY SELECTION

Most patients with T2D will require basal insulin. Patients with T2D requiring insulin therapy have, in most circumstances, a longer duration of diabetes, whether this time period is with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D. In the context of FRCs, while the GLP‐1 RA component may mitigate the weight gain associated with basal insulin, insulin therapy is still associated with a net increase in body weight and hypoglycaemia risk vs. not using insulin. Thus, patients being treated with FRCs are more similar to subjects in older trials of glycemic control (e.g. ACCORD, ADVANCE and VDAT) vs. newer trials of incretins and SGLT2 inhibitors where lower or even HbA1c levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes may be beneficial.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) prefers an HbA1c of < 6.5% as the primary glycemic goal for people with T2D. However, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) prefer a HbA1c goal of < 7% as the primary glycemic goal for most adults with T2D. While these goals seem to contrast, they begin to mirror each other when patient‐specific adjustments to these goals are brought into focus.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113eP4Uv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider achieving lower HbA1c levels than the goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) as an acceptable option, even beneficial if it can be achieved safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment, based on healthcare professional judgment and the preference of the patient with diabetes.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^112RSES8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Tools are also needed to help HCPs in selecting appropriate agents and intensifying therapy. The ADA/EASD position statement leaves treatment-goal decisions to clinicians and patients. However, some believe that because of the vast and expanding array of available drugs, there should be a systematic way to prioritize the selection of drugs in relation to their efficacy, safety, and cost. It is most important to emphasize that the percentage of patients who show sufficient clinical response to any of these drugs varies widely. Nonadherence to treatment regimens may be as high as 50% in patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, often because of the patients' lack of symptoms, negative emotions, and poor knowledge of their disease. Side effects are another cause of stopping or limiting treatment. Thus, patients must be adequately monitored, especially after changes to their treatment regimen, to evaluate whether they have reached targets and to ensure that there are no major side effects or adherence issues. This information is crucial to make informed decisions regarding whether to continue, change, or add to the therapy regimen.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c levels with use of sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin: analysis from the observational health data sciences and informatics initiative [^113HJdz5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Consensus around an efficient second-line treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains ambiguous. The availability of electronic medical records and insurance claims data, which capture routine medical practice, accessed via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network presents an opportunity to generate evidence for the effectiveness of second-line treatments.

Objective

To identify which drug classes among sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones are associated with reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and lower risk of myocardial infarction, kidney disorders, and eye disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Three retrospective, propensity-matched, new-user cohort studies with replication across 8 sites were performed from 1975 to 2017. Medical data of 246 558 805 patients from multiple countries from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative were included and medical data sets were transformed into a unified common data model, with analysis done using open-source analytical tools. Participants included patients with T2D receiving metformin with at least 1 prior HbA1c laboratory test who were then prescribed either sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones. Data analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2018.

Exposures

Treatment with sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones starting at least 90 days after the initial prescription of metformin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome is the first observation of the reduction of HbA1c level to 7% of total hemoglobin or less after prescription of a second-line drug. Secondary outcomes are myocardial infarction, kidney disorder, and eye disorder after prescription of a second-line drug.

Results

A total of 246 558 805 patients (126 977 785 women [51.5%]) were analyzed. Effectiveness of sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones prescribed after metformin to lower HbA1c level to 7% or less of total hemoglobin remained indistinguishable in patients with T2D. Patients treated with sulfonylureas compared with DPP-4 inhibitors had a small increased consensus hazard ratio of myocardial infarction (1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.24) and eye disorders (1.15; 95% CI, 1.11–1.19) in the meta-analysis. Hazard of observing kidney disorders after treatment with sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones was equally likely.

Conclusions and Relevance

The examined drug classes did not differ in lowering HbA1c and in hazards of kidney disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line therapy. Sulfonylureas had a small, higher observed hazard of myocardial infarction and eye disorders compared with DPP-4 inhibitors in the meta-analysis. The OHDSI collaborative network can be used to conduct a large international study examining the effectiveness of second-line treatment choices made in clinical management of T2D.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults-2024 update [^114yCGpj]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic medication due to its durable efficacy in lowering HbA1c, negligible risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side effect profile, long-term track record, and affordability.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112cY7d4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Applicability of recommendations — population scope and baseline glycemia indicates these recommendations apply to adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level around 8% (mean range in included primary RCTs, 7.2% to 9.5%) despite usual care, with metformin as the most common usual care medication; subgroup enrollment included Three RCTs requiring CKD, 4 requiring existing CVD or acute coronary syndrome, 3 requiring overweight or obesity, and 11 requiring participants to be "at risk for CVD"; evidence did not allow evaluation of differences between secondary and primary prevention populations; therefore, recommendations apply to patients with type 2 diabetes with and without established CVD or CKD.

### Statement by an American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology consensus panel on type 2 diabetes mellitus: an algorithm for glycemic control [^116Vz6kN]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

This report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. We provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of A1C, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. We consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. We prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. We recommend only combinations of medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. It is essential to monitor therapy with A1C and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. We provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. This algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology Diabetes Guidelines and the recent medical literature.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^117LXZE5]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Advancing to triple combination therapy.

Some studies have shown advantages of adding a third noninsulin agent to a two-drug combination that is not yet or no longer achieving the glycemic target. Not surprisingly, however, at this juncture, the most robust response will usually be with insulin. Indeed, since diabetes is associated with progressive β-cell loss, many patients, especially those with long-standing disease, will eventually need to be transitioned to insulin, which should be favored in circumstances where the degree of hyperglycemia (e.g. ≥ 8.5%) makes it unlikely that another drug will be of sufficient benefit. If triple combination therapy exclusive of insulin is tried, the patient should be monitored closely, with the approach promptly reconsidered if it proves to be unsuccessful. Many months of uncontrolled hyperglycemia should specifically be avoided.

In using triple combinations the essential consideration is obviously to use agents with complementary mechanisms of action (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). Increasing the number of drugs heightens the potential for side effects and drug–drug interactions, raises costs, and negatively impacts patient adherence. The rationale, benefits, and side effects of each new medication should be discussed with the patient. The clinical characteristics of patients more or less likely to respond to specific combinations are, unfortunately, not well defined.

### The elephant in the room: why cardiologists should stop ignoring type 2 diabetes [^111PsLTA]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health threat that is evolving into a global pandemic with debilitating, expensive and often lethal complications. Even when hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) levels are well controlled, and concomitant cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are effectively treated, two out of every three patients with T2D are destined to die from CV complications. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCT) indicate that two classes of glucose-lowering medications, oral sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) and injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), confer significant CV benefits, including reductions in: hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), progression of diabetic kidney disease, atherosclerotic CV events, and (with some agents) CV death. These CV benefits appear to be independent of the glucose-lowering effects of these agents. These compelling findings are triggering a fundamental paradigm shift in T2D management whereby the focus is no longer on HbA1c alone, but instead on implementing a comprehensive CV risk reduction strategy prioritizing the use of these evidence-based therapies (along with other evidence-based treatment strategies) with the objective of reducing the risk of morbid complications, and improving the quantity and quality of life of patients with T2D. Cardiologists are uniquely positioned to become more involved in the management of T2D and established CV disease, which at this time should include initiation (either by prescribing or by making recommendations) of agents proven to reduce CV risk. Specifically, SGLT2-is and/or GLP-1RA have now been shown to have a favorable risk-benefit balance, and are being increasingly emphasized by the practice guidelines as preferable treatment options in vulnerable patients with T2D. The cardiology community should collaborate with other care providers to ensure that when and where appropriate these new T2D therapies are used along with other evidence-based therapies to improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113N7YTz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and adverse events associated with glucose-lowering drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^116NuMDm]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Numerous glucose-lowering drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes.

Objective

To estimate the relative efficacy and safety associated with glucose-lowering drugs including insulin.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases through March 21, 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of 24 weeks' or longer duration.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects network meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarction, stroke, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) level, treatment failure (rescue treatment or lack of efficacy), hypoglycemia, and body weight.

Results

A total of 301 clinical trials (1,417,367 patient-months) were included; 177 trials (56,598 patients) of drugs given as monotherapy; 109 trials (53,030 patients) of drugs added to metformin (dual therapy); and 29 trials (10,598 patients) of drugs added to metformin and sulfonylurea (triple therapy). There were no significant differences in associations between any drug class as monotherapy, dual therapy, or triple therapy with odds of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Compared with metformin, sulfonylurea (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.18 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.34]), thiazolidinedione (SMD, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.31]), DPP-4 inhibitor (SMD, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.52]), and α-glucosidase inhibitor (SMD, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.58]) monotherapy were associated with higher HbA1C levels. Sulfonylurea (odds ratio [OR], 3.13 [95% CI, 2.39 to 4.12]; risk difference [RD], 10% [95% CI, 7% to 13%]) and basal insulin (OR, 17.9 [95% CI, 1.97 to 162]; RD, 10% [95% CI, 0.08% to 20%]) were associated with greatest odds of hypoglycemia. When added to metformin, drugs were associated with similar HbA1C levels, while SGLT-2 inhibitors offered the lowest odds of hypoglycemia (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.18]; RD, -22% [-27% to -18%]). When added to metformin and sulfonylurea, GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with the lowest odds of hypoglycemia (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.94]; RD, -10% [95% CI, -18% to -2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes, there were no significant differences in the associations between any of 9 available classes of glucose-lowering drugs (alone or in combination) and the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Metformin was associated with lower or no significant difference in HbA1C levels compared with any other drug classes. All drugs were estimated to be effective when added to metformin. These findings are consistent with American Diabetes Association recommendations for using metformin monotherapy as initial treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes and selection of additional therapies based on patient-specific considerations.

### Glycemia reduction in type 2 diabetes-glycemic outcomes [^113oR5vB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

The comparative effectiveness of glucose-lowering medications for use with metformin to maintain target glycated hemoglobin levels in persons with type 2 diabetes is uncertain.

Methods

In this trial involving participants with type 2 diabetes of less than 10 years' duration who were receiving metformin and had glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.8 to 8.5%, we compared the effectiveness of four commonly used glucose-lowering medications. We randomly assigned participants to receive insulin glargine U-100 (hereafter, glargine), the sulfonylurea glimepiride, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, or sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor. The primary metabolic outcome was a glycated hemoglobin level, measured quarterly, of 7.0% or higher that was subsequently confirmed, and the secondary metabolic outcome was a confirmed glycated hemoglobin level greater than 7.5%.

Results

A total of 5047 participants (19.8% Black and 18.6% Hispanic or Latinx) who had received metformin for type 2 diabetes were followed for a mean of 5.0 years. The cumulative incidence of a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% or higher (the primary metabolic outcome) differed significantly among the four groups (P < 0.001 for a global test of differences across groups); the rates with glargine (26.5 per 100 participant-years) and liraglutide (26.1) were similar and lower than those with glimepiride (30.4) and sitagliptin (38.1). The differences among the groups with respect to a glycated hemoglobin level greater than 7.5% (the secondary outcome) paralleled those of the primary outcome. There were no material differences with respect to the primary outcome across prespecified subgroups defined according to sex, age, or race or ethnic group; however, among participants with higher baseline glycated hemoglobin levels there appeared to be an even greater benefit with glargine, liraglutide, and glimepiride than with sitagliptin. Severe hypoglycemia was rare but significantly more frequent with glimepiride (in 2.2% of the participants) than with glargine (1.3%), liraglutide (1.0%), or sitagliptin (0.7%). Participants who received liraglutide reported more frequent gastrointestinal side effects and lost more weight than those in the other treatment groups.

Conclusions

All four medications, when added to metformin, decreased glycated hemoglobin levels. However, glargine and liraglutide were significantly, albeit modestly, more effective in achieving and maintaining target glycated hemoglobin levels.

### Enhanced glycemic control with combination therapy for type 2 diabetes in primary care [^115cQA44]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an increasingly common medical problem for primary care clinicians to address. Treatment of diabetes has evolved from simple replacement of insulin (directly or through insulin secretagogs) through capture of mechanisms such as insulin sensitizers, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and incretins. Only very recently has recognition of the critical role of the gastrointestinal system as a major culprit in glucose dysregulation been established. Since glycated hemoglobin A(1c) reductions provide meaningful risk reduction as well as improved quality of life, it is worthwhile to explore evolving paths for more efficient use of the currently available pharmacotherapies. Because diabetes is a progressive disease, even transiently successful treatment will likely require augmentation as the disorder progresses. Pharmacotherapies with complementary mechanisms of action will be necessary to achieve glycemic goals. Hence, clinicians need to be well informed about the various noninsulin alternatives that have been shown to be successful in glycemic goal attainment. This article reviews the benefits of glucose control, the current status of diabetes control, pertinent pathophysiology, available pharmacological classes for combination, limitations of current therapies, and suggestions for appropriate combination therapies, including specific suggestions for thresholds at which different strategies might be most effectively utilized by primary care clinicians.

### Early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycemic control to HbA1c ≤ 6.5% without increasing hypoglycemia: pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^11379iWN]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, many new glucose-lowering medications have been introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite this growing number of therapeutic options, however, glycemic management of T2D patients remains far from optimal. Although most major guidelines in the USA, Europe and Asia recommend setting a HbA1c target of < 7%, a substantial proportion of patients with T2D do not achieve this level of glycemic control.

Tight glycemic control can bring long-term microvascular and possible macrovascular benefits, but it also may increase hypoglycemia, especially when classical glucose-lowering medications with high risk for hypoglycemia (insulin, sulfonylureas) are used for intensive therapy. However, it is possible that the risk–benefit ratio of this strategy could be more favorable with the use of modern oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which improve glycemic control without substantially increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Indeed, current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) suggest setting a more stringent target for glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) for low-risk patients as long as this can be achieved without hypoglycemia or other iatrogenic adverse effects. Such patients include those who have had T2D for only a short period of time, those without comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, and/or those with long life expectancy. Notably, the latest consensus report from the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends that patients with indicators of high cardiovascular risk, established cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease receive second-line therapy (added to metformin) with a medication with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as an SGLT2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. For others, the ADA/EASD report suggests a DPP-4 inhibitor as an option to add to metformin, particularly where there is a compelling need to avoid hypoglycemia.

Evidence base 2.1 — Outpatient glucose targets for nongeriatric adults — It has been accepted that strategies aimed at lowering glucose concentrations can lead to lower rates of microvascular and perhaps macrovascular complications. The ADVANCE trial intensive therapy group targeted an A1C < 6.5%. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, mortality increased with increasing A1C among intensively treated persons, whereas mortality only affected persons whose A1C remained > 7%. Epidemiologic evidence shows a continuous relationship between A1C and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all‑cause mortality, yet no RCTs have yet established optimal glycemic targets in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Some newer therapies carry a lower risk of hypoglycemia, which may enable more persons to safely achieve individualized lower A1C levels; for persons with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple ASCVD risk factors, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), a GLP‑1 RA or an SGLT2i with demonstrated CVD benefit is recommended as part of a glucose‑lowering regimen independent of A1C.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to deintensify hypoglycemia-causing medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides) or switch to a medication class with lower hypoglycemia risk in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia, within individualized glycemic goals. Deintensify diabetes medications if the harms and/or burdens of treatment may be greater than the benefits, within individualized glycemic goals.

### Sequential intensification of metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes with liraglutide followed by randomized addition of basal insulin prompted by A1c targets [^11578dgi]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin is generally considered to be the most appropriate first-line pharmacotherapy for treating type 2 diabetes, but there is no general agreement on how to advance treatment when metformin becomes insufficient. With many drug classes available, translational studies are needed to identify the most effective, safe, and simplest antidiabetes treatment sequences. Practical treatment strategies that achieve and maintain glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels at < 7% while minimizing hypoglycemia and weight gain are especially desirable.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) reduce A1C by 0.8–1.5% and weight by 2–3 kg on average in combination with metformin (depending on study populations and other background therapy), and are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Although the durability of effectiveness of GLP-1RAs has not yet been established, most other type 2 diabetes drugs fail after several years, such that many patients eventually require insulin treatment to attain and sustain glycemic control. This is typically achieved by adding a basal insulin to previous medications because such insulins are associated with modest hypoglycemia risk and weight gain compared with premixed and prandial insulins. The side effects of insulin might be mitigated if used with a GLP-1RA; however, to date, there have been only trials adding GLP-1RAs to insulin and no well-controlled trials examining basal insulin added to existing GLP-1RA therapy. In this trial, for the first time, we evaluated a novel treatment intensification sequence: adding a GLP-1RA (liraglutide) to metformin followed by a randomized, open-label investigation of further intensification with systematically titrated basal insulin (insulin detemir) in participants with ≥ 7% A1C.

### Oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians [^114CkQtd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. This guideline serves as an update to the 2012 ACP guideline on the same topic. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials and observational studies published through December 2015 on the comparative effectiveness of oral medications for type 2 diabetes. Evaluated interventions included metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Study quality was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively on the basis of the totality of evidence identified by using several databases. Evaluated outcomes included intermediate outcomes of hemoglobin A1c, weight, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate; all-cause mortality; cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy; and harms. This guideline grades the recommendations by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with type 2 diabetes.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians prescribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabetes when pharmacologic therapy is needed to improve glycemic control. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians consider adding either a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, or a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin to improve glycemic control when a second oral therapy is considered. (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence.) ACP recommends that clinicians and patients select among medications after discussing benefits, adverse effects, and costs.

Type 2 diabetes — medication selection and combination therapy states that a person-centered shared decision-making approach should guide the choice of glucose-lowering medications for adults with type 2 diabetes, combination therapy can be considered at treatment initiation to shorten time to attainment of individualized treatment goals, and in adults with established or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease the treatment plan should include medications with demonstrated benefits to reduce cardiovascular events (e.g. GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT2 inhibitor) for glycemic management and comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction (irrespective of A1C).

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^113s5JvL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The ADA/EASD goal starts at an HbA1c of 7% or less, then suggests lower goals can be selected for patients in whom this can be achieved safely, without significant hypoglycaemia or other adverse effects. The recommendation aligns with the data presented herein, that use of medications which do not lead to hypoglycaemia is a hallmark of being able to achieve low HbA1c targets safely. Further, characteristics pointing toward achieving a benefit from tight control include younger age with long life expectancy and achieving that control without hypoglycaemia. Conversely, short life expectancy, frailty, advanced complications and poorly tolerating therapy point toward needing a more conservative patient‐specific HbA1c goal (e.g. < 8%). Advanced complications are important for two key reasons: patients such as these may have more difficulty safely managing medications and patients with extensive complications, including microvascular complications, have experienced the outcome tighter glycemic control would have attempted to prevent.

### Rationale and design of the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^113ptpN6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE) is a pragmatic clinical trial that will make head-to-head comparisons of major drug classes currently used to treat T2DM, with the overarching goal of providing better guidance to practitioners in the choice of medications. Specifically, GRADE will compare a sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and basal insulin in patients with recently diagnosed T2DM treated with metformin and will examine their effectiveness in maintaining the glycemic goal (A1C < 7% [53 mmol/mol]) over time. Other outcomes will include relative effects on selected microvascular complications and cardiovascular risk factors; patient-centered outcomes, such as adverse effects, acceptability, and tolerability; and cost-effectiveness. Finally, GRADE will study the phenotypic characteristics that underlie the success, failure, and adverse effects of the different combinations to guide individualized treatment.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^113QouE3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Glycemic control targets for older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — target goal for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in older adults generally should be 7.5% to 8%; HbA1c between 7% and 7.5% may be appropriate if it can be safely achieved in healthy older adults with few comorbidities and good functional status, and higher HbA1c targets (8–9%) are appropriate for older adults with multiple comorbidities, poor health, and limited life expectancy; there is potential harm in lowering HbA1c to less than 6.5% in older adults with type 2 DM, and there is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 DM is beneficial; for adults younger than 65, using medications to achieve HbA1c levels of less than 6.5% is associated with harms, including hypoglycemia and mortality, except for reductions in MI and mortality with metformin; given the long time frame needed to achieve a reduction in microvascular complications, glycemic goals should reflect patient goals, health status, and life expectancy.

The LixiLan‐G trial evaluated patients inadequately controlled on GLP‐1 RA therapy (with or without oral agents), demonstrating significantly greater HbA1c reductions after switching to iGlarLixi compared to those who continued their GLP‐1 RA regimen (−1.1% vs. −0.4%, respectively). As expected, those in the iGlarLixi group gained a modest amount of weight compared to those continuing the GLP‐1 RA therapy (+1.9 kg and −1.1 kg, respectively) and experienced more hypoglycaemia, findings which are consistent with existing literature.

In the DUAL III trial, people on liraglutide once daily or exenatide twice daily with metformin alone or with pioglitazone and/or sulfonylurea were randomised to iDegLira once daily. Those in the iDegLira group experienced a greater reduction in HbA1c compared to those continuing their GLP‐1 RA (−1.3% vs. −0.3%, respectively). As expected, the mean change in body weight was +2 kg with iDegLira and −0.8 kg in the unchanged GLP‐1 RA group. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low overall, though higher with iDegLira vs. unchanged GLP‐1 RA.

### What to do with diabetes therapies when HbA1c lowering is inadequate: add, switch, or continue? A MASTERMIND study [^116eKEiK]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear what to do when people with type 2 diabetes have had no or a limited glycemic response to a recently introduced medication. Intra-individual HbA1c variability can obscure true response. Some guidelines suggest stopping apparently ineffective therapy, but no studies have addressed this issue.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort analysis using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we assessed the outcome of 55,530 patients with type 2 diabetes starting their second or third non-insulin glucose-lowering medication, with a baseline HbA1c > 58mmol/mol (7.5%). For those with no HbA1c improvement or a limited response at 6months (HbA1c fall < 5.5mmol/mol [0.5%]), we compared HbA1c 12months later in those who continued their treatment unchanged, switched to new treatment, or added new treatment.

Results

An increase or a limited reduction in HbA1c was common, occurring in 21.9% (12,168/55,230), who had a mean HbA1c increase of 2.5mmol/mol (0.2%). After this limited response, continuing therapy was more frequent (n = 9308; 74%) than switching (n = 1177; 9%) or adding (n = 2163; 17%). Twelve months later, in those who switched medication, HbA1c fell (-6.8mmol/mol [-0.6%], 95%CI -7.7, -6.0) only slightly more than those who continued unchanged (-5.1mmol/mol [-0.5%], 95%CI -5.5, -4.8). Adding another new therapy was associated with a substantially better reduction (-12.4mmol/mol [-1.1%], 95%CI -13.1, -11.7). Propensity score-matched subgroups demonstrated similar results.

Conclusions

Where glucose-lowering therapy does not appear effective on initial HbA1c testing, changing agents does not improve glycemic control. The initial agent should be continued with another therapy added.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^112jD3xu]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Targets can determine therapy

The glucose-lowering effectiveness of agents varies, so the degree of HbA1c reduction sought will impact the decision as to which agent to use. Insulin aside, the efficacy is high for metformin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (expected HbA1c reduction approximately 1.0 to 1.5%) and, generally, lower for meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, acarbose, colesevelam and bromocriptine (approximately 0.5 to 1.0%) (Table 1). Historically, older drugs have typically been tested in clinical trial participants with higher baseline HbA1c, so, without direct comparisons, it is difficult to be certain that SUs, for example, really are more or less effective that DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists; but these latter are consistently found not to be inferior to SUs, with the added benefit of no weight gain, even weight loss, without hypoglycemia. Agents with more modest effects, but little or no side-effects, could be considered when treating individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, to limit progression to frank diabetes, for example, acarbose, though it is prone to cause flatulence.

### Rationale and design of the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^114x9mHS]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) threatens to become the major public health problem of this century. However, a comprehensive comparison of the long-term effects of medications to treat T2DM has not been conducted. GRADE, a pragmatic, unmasked clinical trial, aims to compare commonly used diabetes medications, when combined with metformin, on glycemia-lowering effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes.

Research Design and Methods

GRADE was designed with support from a U34 planning grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The consensus protocol was approved by NIDDK and the GRADE Research Group. Eligibility criteria for the 5,000 metformin-treated subjects include < 5 years' diabetes duration, ≥ 30 years of age at time of diagnosis, and baseline hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.8–8.5% (51–69 mmol/mol). Medications representing four classes (sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and insulin) will be randomly assigned and added to metformin (minimum-maximum 1,000–2,000 mg/day). The primary metabolic outcome is the time to primary failure defined as an A1C ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol), subsequently confirmed, over an anticipated mean observation period of 4.8 years (range 4–7 years). Other long-term metabolic outcomes include the need for the addition of basal insulin after a confirmed A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and, ultimately, the need to implement an intensive basal/bolus insulin regimen. The four drugs will also be compared with respect to selected microvascular complications, cardiovascular disease risk factors, adverse effects, tolerability, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

GRADE will compare the long-term effectiveness of major glycemia-lowering medications and provide guidance to clinicians about the most appropriate medications to treat T2DM. GRADE begins recruitment at 37 centers in the U.S. in 2013.

### Clinical effectiveness of liraglutide in type 2 diabetes treatment in the real-world setting: a systematic literature review [^1111qQ7X]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by increased blood glucose levels, i.e. hyperglycemia, which over time can cause microvascular and macrovascular complications. The main goal of T2DM treatment is to achieve and maintain patients' individual target blood glucose levels, thus reducing the occurrence of complications.

There are several guidelines for the management of T2DM including those developed by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE), and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) from the UK. The treatment recommendations are generally consistent but with some differences. For example, the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) suggest a treatment algorithm for patients with T2DM which suggests that patients with T2DM should initially be offered education in lifestyle changes, with advice to lose weight by changing dietary habits and increasing physical activity. If a patient's blood glucose level is not decreased to, and maintained at, the individualized target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, it is recommended that medical treatment with anti-diabetic drugs be initiated. Over the years, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have become integral as second- or third-line therapies in many treatment guidelines, such as the ADA/EASD, the AACE, and the IDF.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — achieved HbA1c levels in major trials and interpretation of intensive therapy indicate that "only ACCORD and ADVANCE reached and sustained HbA1c levels between 6–7% in the intensive therapy group through the end of the study (e.g., average HbA1c 6.5%; interquartile range 6.0–6.8%)". In contrast, "The UKPDS initially lowered HbA1c below 7%, but values steadily increased to approximately 7% after 6 years and subsequently remained between 7–8% through completion". Consequently, "the results from ADVANCE and ACCORD should be weighted more heavily when interpreting the relative benefits and risks of intensive glucose lowering, if defined as HbA1c < 7%".

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely.

Diabetes mellitus in older adults — individualized HbA1c goals are stratified by comorbidity and life expectancy: For healthy older adults with few comorbidities and life expectancy greater than 10 years with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, a reasonable HbA1c target would be 7.0% to 7.5%; for older adults with moderate comorbidities and life expectancy between 5 and 10 years, a reasonable HbA1c target would be 7.5% to 8.0%; and for older adults with multiple comorbidities, functional or cognitive impairments, and life expectancy less than 5 years, a reasonable HbA1c target would be 8.0% to 9.0%. Because the evidence for benefit is strongest for metformin, and the risk of hypoglycemia is lower with this medication, it should be the drug of choice for glycemic control unless contraindicated.

Regular monitoring is recommended, especially when combining with insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas.
Thiazolidinediones, when combined with insulin, may favor weight gain and fluid retention.
Pioglitazone or rosiglitazone helps reduce PPG levels.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) should be considered as the first-line treatment in patients with controlled basal glucose concentrations and marked postprandial hyperglycemia. Mean HbA1c at week 24 was significantly decreased (by 0.7% from baseline) in both acarbose and voglibose patient groups who were previously inadequately controlled with basal insulin.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may be considered as add-ons to metformin alongside other drugs such as sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, and basal insulin. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss and do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. They have potential benefits in terms of weight loss, reduction of blood pressure, improvements in glycemic control without weight gain, and hypoglycemic risks associated with insulin therapy.
DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral and not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. DPP-4 inhibitors lower PPG levels by decelerating gastric emptying. They best complement the action of basal insulin on fasting glucose control and help patients with T2DM achieve their target HbA1c.
In general, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should not be discontinued with the initiation of basal insulin. Basal insulin and GLP-1RAs address various defects seen in T2DM physiopathology. Basal insulin plus GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with less hypoglycemia and with weight loss instead of weight gain. However, they may be less tolerable and come at a greater cost. That said, a fixed ratio combination of GLP-1RA and basal insulin is a potentially helpful tool for the treatment of patients with T2DM as a result of its favorable safety and efficacy profile, especially in obese patients who are uncontrolled on OADs or basal insulin.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^116vrtAK]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first-line oral medication recommended for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We reviewed the literature to quantify the effect of metformin treatment on glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in all types of diabetes and examine the impact of differing doses on glycemic control.

Research Design and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1950 to June 2010 for trials of at least 12 weeks' duration in which diabetic patients were treated with either metformin monotherapy or as an add-on therapy. Data on change in HbA(1c) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Data from dose-comparison trials were separately pooled.

Results

A total of 35 trials were identified for the main analysis and 7 for the dose-comparison analysis. Metformin monotherapy lowered HbA(1c) by 1.12% (95% CI 0.92–1.32; I(2) = 80%) versus placebo, metformin added to oral therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.95% (0.77–1.13; I(2) = 77%) versus placebo added to oral therapy, and metformin added to insulin therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.60% (0.30–0.91; I(2) = 79.8%) versus insulin only. There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c) using higher doses of metformin compared with lower doses of metformin with no significant increase in side effects.

Conclusions

Evidence supports the effectiveness of metformin therapy in a clinically important lowering of HbA(1c) used as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents. There is potential for using higher doses of metformin to maximize glycemic control in diabetic patients without increasing gastrointestinal effects.

### Recommendations for oral agents in type 2 diabetes… [^117BNcre]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral agents have been developed to address each of the three metabolic disorders characteristic of type 2 diabetes: decreased pancreatic beta-cell function, elevated hepatic glucose output and insulin resistance. The choice of a particular oral agent may be suggested by specific conditions, such as obesity, or dictated by problems such as renal insufficiency. The characteristics of each class of drugs must be carefully weighed before initiating therapy. Feinglos and Bethel present a comprehensive summary of oral agents for patients with type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas. These drugs act by enhancing insulin release from beta cells and may decrease peripheral insulin resistance. On average, sulfonylureas reduce fasting glucose levels by 50 to 70 mg per dL and reduce HbA 1c levels by 0. 8 to

1. 7 percent. Biguanides. Metformin is currently the only drug in this class available in the United States.

The mechanism of action is a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Metformin has been shown to reduce the fasting glucose level by 50 to 70 mg per dL and the HbA 1c by 1. 4 to

1. 8 percent. Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors. Acarbose is the only drug in this class available in the United States. This drug works by inhibiting absorption of complex carbohydrate from the gut. The drug has no effect on glucose or lactose. Treatment typically reduces fasting glucose levels by 35 to 40 mg per dL and HbA 1c levels by 0. 4 to
0. 7 percent. Thiazolidinediones. Troglidazone is the only medication in this class available in the United States. This class of drug works by directly enhancing insulin sensitivity without having an effect on insulin secretion. Troglidazone is associated with a reduction of HbA 1c levels of 0. 5 to

1. 5 percent. In obese patients, metformin should be considered as the initial agent.

In patients for whom monotherapy fails, combination therapy should be considered. Those for whom combination therapy fails should start insulin therapy, either alone or together with an oral agent.

1c levels by 0. 8 to
2. 0 percent and fasting plasma glucose concentrations by 60 to 70 mg per dL, with the greatest reductions observed in patients with the highest FPG concentrations at the initiation of therapy. Glipizide and glimepiride are associated with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia. All sulfonylureas have been associated with weight gain and thus, may not be the optimal first choice for obese patients. Biguanides Although biguanides have been in use for many years outside the United States, their reintroduction in this country has been relatively recent. Metformin is currently the only agent in this antidiabetic class available in this country. Metformin works by reducing hepatic glucose output and, to a lesser extent, enhancing insulin sensitivity in hepatic and peripheral tissues. Metformin has been shown to reduce HbA. 1clevels by approximately 1. 5 to
2. 0 percent and FPG levels by 50 to 70 mg per dL. 4, 5, 13Other effects include a reduction in plasma triglyceride levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Monotherapy with these agents has been associated with a 0. 5 to

1. 5 percent reduction in HbA. 1clevels and 25 to 50 mg per dL reduction in FPG levels. 4, 5As a class, the thiazolidinediones have also been shown to alter lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes. Results from studies with troglitazone consistently show a decrease in triglyceride levels — in some cases by as much as 33 percent. 24, 25The effects on high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have been either favorable or neutral, while some studies report an increase in total and LDL cholesterol levels. 24, 25Newer data reveal that as monotherapy, rosiglitazone is associated with increases in total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels and either no change or increases in triglyceride levels.

Patients treated with pioglitazone have displayed mean decreases in triglyceride levels, mean increases in HDL cholesterol levels, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol levels. 20, 21.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

Type 2 diabetes epidemiology and glycemic control — among U.S. adults, the age-adjusted prevalence is higher in Black (19%) and Hispanic (21%) adults than in White adults (12%), and 16% of adults with type 2 diabetes have inadequate glycemic control with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 9% or higher; inadequate control is more prevalent among Black (24%) and Hispanic (29%) adults than among White adults (9%). In the United States, the excess risk for premature deaths attributed to type 2 diabetes decreased between 1997 and 2011 among Hispanic and White adults, but not among Black adults, and access to high-quality health care in people with type 2 diabetes differs by race and ethnicity even after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health factors.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

21. In patients who do not achieve target HbA1c levels on monotherapy, any antidiabetic drug is potentially effective as an add-on option to metformin for glycemic control. There is no evidence of significant differences between classes of antidiabetic agents when used as second therapy added to metformin. [I, A] Pharmacological therapy to lower blood glucose in the patient with type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of efficacy, mechanism of action, presence of comorbidities, risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, adverse effects, and costs. [I, C]

Summary of evidence

A meta-analysis including 27 RCTs with 11,198 type 2 diabetes patients showed a similar HbA1c reduction between different classes of antidiabetic agents compared to placebo. The mixed-treatment comparison showed the following reductions in HbA1c: sulfonylureas, 0.79%; glinides, 0.65%; thiazolidinediones, 0.85%; α-glucosidase inhibitors, 0.64%; DPP-4 inhibitors, 0.78%; and GLP-1 analogues, 0.97%. Thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and glinides were associated with mild weight gain, while GLP-1 analogues were associated with a significant decrease in body weight compared with placebo (−1.74 kg). There was no weight change associated with α-glucosidase inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors. Sulfonylureas and glinides were associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia compared with placebo. The choice of second antidiabetic agent should be based on efficacy, age, mechanism of action, risk of hypoglycemia, presence of comorbidities, life expectancy, weight gain or loss, adverse effects, and potential for cardiovascular protection.

22. There is also no difference in HbA1c reduction when different classes of drugs are used as a third option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This panel recommends that any antidiabetic drug could be an option as a third agent for glycemic control, provided that the mechanism of action is not similar to that of agents already in use. [I, C]

Summary of evidence

A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs (n-4535) evaluated the comparative efficacy of GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and α-glucosidase inhibitors in reducing HbA1c, body weight, and causing severe hypoglycemia when a third drug was added to a metformin plus sulfonylurea regimen. Despite limitations, as most of the studies were of short duration, with variable quality, and based on indirect comparisons, the meta-analysis showed that all antidiabetic classes were associated with significant reductions in HbA1c levels compared to placebo. The overall average reduction in Hba1c was −0.96% (thiazolidinediones, −1.15%; acarbose, −0.6%; GLP-1 agonists, −1.04%; DPP-4 inhibitors, −0.89%). There was no clear difference in efficacy between drug classes when adding a third agent to treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes who were already receiving metformin and a sulfonylurea.

23. Insulin therapy (with or without additional agents) should be considered any time in patients with type 2 diabetes who present persistently high blood glucose levels despite antidiabetic agent combinations, or in patients who are markedly symptomatic. [I, C]

Summary of evidence

After at least 3 months using metformin plus a second antidiabetic agent, if the glycemic target is not reached, a third drug should be chosen, taking into account the established therapeutic target, age, patient limitations, and the attributes and side effects of each drug. Consider initiating insulin therapy (with or without additional agents) in patients with type 2 diabetes who remain markedly symptomatic (weight loss, ketosis, polyuria, or polydipsia) and/or exhibit elevated blood glucose levels or HbA1c.

5 INDICATION AND USE OF BASAL INSULIN IN PEOPLE WITH

The human body requires insulin to function and no number of non‐insulin medications can address absolute insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes, or a relative insulin deficiency, as in some cases of T2D, when the magnitude of that deficiency exceeds endogenous insulin's ability to overcome concurrent insulin resistance.

The need for insulin therapy is an assessment that must be done throughout the course of T2D; indeed, most patients will eventually require insulin therapy. However, this is typically later in the course of therapy following progressive loss of beta‐cell function (Figure 1). In T2D, insulin therapy should be considered regardless of current antihyperglycemic therapy when glycemic markers are very high (i.e. HbA1c more than 10% or blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL) or with symptomatic hyperglycemia (e.g. catabolic symptoms including weight loss, ketonuria and ketosis). This early stabilisation of glycemia requires basal insulin with or without bolus insulin. Following stabilisation, non‐insulin antihyperglycemic medications (including GLP‐1 RAs) should be considered, particularly in cases of new‐onset T2D.

The more typical circumstance is the addition of basal insulin following loss of glycemic control with multiple non‐insulin agents. These non‐insulin medications should include a GLP‐1 RA first given the advantages to weight loss and low hypoglycaemia risk vs. starting injectable antihyperglycemic therapy with basal insulin. True once daily basal insulins are preferred over intermediate‐acting insulin, which requires twice‐daily administration and has a higher risk for hypoglycaemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Additionally, once insulin is started, sulfonylureas should be discontinued. As it pertains to dosing, three options exist for an initial basal insulin dose,: (1) a flat 10 units daily, 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, and for patients with a baseline HbA1c greater than 8%, 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day. In a 100 kg patient, these options differ by 10 units/day. A typical basal insulin titration schedule increases the dose by 2 units every 2–3 days in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) remains above target. Notably, this is extended to 3–5 days for insulin degludec given its longer half‐life. Overall though, dose adjustments become smaller and with greater intervals between adjustments as FPG is nearing the goal.

People with diabetes using basal insulin and/or oral agents and noninsulin injectables — blood glucose monitoring (BGM) associations with A1C include that in almost 27,000 youth with type 1 diabetes, increased daily frequency of BGM was significantly associated with lower A1C levels (−0.2% per additional check per day) and with fewer acute complications. A trial of once-daily BGM with enhanced feedback found no clinically or statistically significant change in A1C levels at 1 year. Meta-analyses have suggested that BGM can reduce A1C levels by 0.25–0.3% at 6 months, but the effect was attenuated at 12 months in one analysis. Reductions in A1C levels were greater (−0.3%) in trials where structured BGM data were used to adjust medications, and a structured BGM group reduced their A1C levels by 0.3% more than the control group; however, A1C levels were not changed significantly without such structured diabetes therapy adjustment. Performing BGM alone does not lower blood glucose levels, and the information must be integrated into clinical and self-management treatment plans.

### Oral antihyperglycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes: scientific review [^111FgvD6]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been revolutionized throughout the past several years-first, by the realization of the importance of tight glycemic control in forestalling complications, and second, by the availability of several unique classes of oral antidiabetic agents. Deciphering which agent to use in certain clinical situations is a new dilemma facing the primary care physician.

Objective

To systematically review available data from the literature regarding the efficacy of oral antidiabetic agents, both as monotherapy and in combination.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all English-language reports of unique, randomized controlled clinical trials involving recently available oral agents for type 2 diabetes. Bibliographies were also reviewed to find additional reports not otherwise identified.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies (63) were included in the analysis if they had a study period of at least 3 months; if each group contained at least 10 subjects at the study's conclusion; and if hemoglobin A(1c) was reported. When multiple dosages of a drug were tested, the results of the highest approved dosage were used. In placebo-controlled trials, hemoglobin A(1c) data are presented as the difference between the change in treated vs placebo subjects.

Data Synthesis

Five distinct oral drug classes are now available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo treatment, most of these agents lower hemoglobin A(1c) levels approximately 1% to 2%. Equivalent efficacy is usually demonstrated when different agents are compared with one another in the same study population. When they are used in combination, there are additional glycemic benefits. Long-term vascular risk reduction has been demonstrated only with sulfonylureas and metformin.

Conclusions

With few exceptions, the available oral antidiabetic agents are equally effective at lowering glucose concentrations. Their mechanisms of action are different, however, and as a result they appear to have distinct metabolic effects. These are reflected in their adverse effect profiles and their effect on cardiovascular risk, which may influence drug choice.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^112JDMsi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular therapies — benefits, risks, and cautions for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs include efficacy and adverse-effect profiles along with practical considerations. SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE, incident HF, HF hospitalization, and CV death but increase the risk of genital mycotic infections, polyuria, and potential volume depletion; GLP-1RAs with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE and progression of macroalbuminuria but are associated with transient nausea and vomiting. Both classes have nonglycemic benefits in systolic blood pressure and weight and have a low risk of hypoglycemia on their own or with metformin and other oral glucose-lowering medications (except insulin secretagogues). Notably, dapagliflozin was used safely even in patients without diabetes in the DAPA-HF trial; injectable GLP-1RAs use a small needle and pen device, and the first oral GLP-1RA, semaglutide, has been approved by the FDA for improving glycemic control in patients with T2D. Caution is suggested when starting an SGLT2 inhibitor in those with peripheral artery disease, severe peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity diabetic ulcers, or soft tissue infections; for active proliferative retinopathy when a significant rapid HbA1c reduction is expected, consider a GLP-1RA alternative to semaglutide SQ; and caution is suggested with GLP-1RA use in patients with active gallbladder disease or a history of pancreatitis.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^114rnkvX]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

ARE ADEQUATE THERAPEUTIC TOOLS AVAILABLE NOW FOR PERSONALIZED DIABETES CARE?

Multiple glucose-lowering medication classes: freedom or confusion?

We now have numerous classes of antihyperglycemic therapies (Table 2) and more are expected to be licensed. Does this extensive arsenal provide us with more flexibility in designing personalized diabetes regimens, or does it make the task more difficult by multiplying the options? For specialists, the answer is no doubt the former. But for many primary care providers who must simultaneously stay abreast of developments in numerous fields of medicine, the expanding array of choices may, at times, seem intimidating.

Table 2
Classes of antihyperglycemic agents

Recent meta-analyses have shown that there is not much difference among available therapies in glycemic control (e.g. A1C reduction and likelihood of achieving targets when adding an agent to metformin). However, when one considers other benefits, such as the risk of hypoglycemia and effects on body weight, there appears to be separation among the agents. In addition to these agents' relative glycemic efficacy and effects on body weight and hypoglycemia, HCPs immersed in diabetes care must balance the potential benefits of each agent against concerns that have been raised regarding possible associations between various agents and the risk of developing other diseases.

Difficulties in making benefit-risk judgments are further amplified by the fact that marketing may seek to create demand for drugs that is out of proportion to their efficacy. In addition, there remains a general lack of adequate comparative and exploratory controlled trials between the medications available, not to mention a lack of research into phenotype- and pathophysiology-based regimens.

Developing a straightforward algorithm that narrows the field of viable options will clearly require more evidence than is currently available. Without such evidence, we can offer only opinion, albeit opinion based on an understanding of pathophysiology, epidemiology, pharmacodynamics, toxicology, and costs. Unfortunately, the studies needed to make evidence-based treatment decisions — those that involve comparisons among multiple agents and are adequately powered for important, long-term clinical outcomes — have, for the most part, not been performed.

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

We assessed the efficacy of eight classes of diabetes medications used in current clinical practice [metformin, sulphonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues and insulin analogues] to reach the HbA1c target < 7% in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception through April 2011 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving antidiabetic drugs. RCTs had to report the effect of any diabetes medication on the HbA1c levels, to include at least 30 subjects in every arm of the study, and to report the effect of therapy after a minimum of 12 weeks. Data were summarized across studies using random-effects meta-regression.

Results

A total of 218 RCTs (339 arms and 77 950 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of patients who achieved the HbA1c goal ranged from 25.9% (95% CI 18.5–34.9) with α-glucosidase inhibitors to 63.2% (54.1–71.5) with the long-acting GLP-1 analogue. There was a progressive decrease of the proportion of patients at target for each 0.5% increase in baseline HbA1c, ranging from 57.8% for HbA1c ≤ 7.5% to 20.8% for HbA1c ≥ 10% (p for trend < 0.0001), with some difference between insulin and non-insulin drugs: for insulin, the proportion of patients at goal reached a plateau for basal HbA1c value > 9.0% with no further decrease, whereas for non-insulin drugs the relationship was continuous without any evidence of plateau.

Conclusions

There is a considerable variability with regard to attainment of HbA1c goal of < 7% among the different classes of diabetes medications; baseline HbA1c is an important determinant of observed efficacy.

Figure 2
Antihyperglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetes: general recommendations. Moving from the top to the bottom of the figure, potential sequences of antihyperglycemic therapy. In most patients, begin with lifestyle changes; metformin monotherapy is added at, or soon after, diagnosis (unless there are explicit contraindications). If the HbA 1c target is not achieved after ∼3 months, consider one of the five treatment options combined with metformin: a sulfonylurea, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin. (The order in the chart is determined by historical introduction and route of administration and is not meant to denote any specific preference.) Choice is based on patient and drug characteristics, with the over-riding goal of improving glycemic control while minimizing side effects. Shared decision making with the patient may help in the selection of therapeutic options. The figure displays drugs commonly used both in the U.S. and/or Europe. Rapid-acting secretagogues (meglitinides) may be used in place of sulfonylureas. Other drugs not shown (α-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, dopamine agonists, pramlintide) may be used where available in selected patients but have modest efficacy and/or limiting side effects. In patients intolerant of, or with contraindications for, metformin, select initial drug from other classes depicted and proceed accordingly. In this circumstance, while published trials are generally lacking, it is reasonable to consider three-drug combinations other than metformin. Insulin is likely to be more effective than most other agents as a third-line therapy, especially when HbA 1c is very high (e.g. ≥ 9.0%). The therapeutic regimen should include some basal insulin before moving to more complex insulin strategies (Fig. 3). Dashed arrow line on the left-hand side of the figure denotes the option of a more rapid progression from a two-drug combination directly to multiple daily insulin doses, in those patients with severe hyperglycemia (e.g. HbA 1c ≥ 10.0–12.0%). DPP-4-i, DPP-4 inhibitor; Fx's, bone fractures; GI, gastrointestinal; GLP-1-RA, GLP-1 receptor agonist; HF, heart failure; SU, sulfonylurea. a Consider beginning at this stage in patients with very high HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9%). b Consider rapid-acting, nonsulfonylurea secretagogues (meglitinides) in patients with irregular meal schedules or who develop late postprandial hypoglycemia on sulfonylureas. c See Table 1 for additional potential adverse effects and risks, under "Disadvantages". d Usually a basal insulin (NPH, glargine, detemir) in combination with noninsulin agents. e Certain noninsulin agents may be continued with insulin (see text). Refer to Fig. 3 for details on regimens. Consider beginning at this stage if patient presents with severe hyperglycemia (≥ 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [≥ 300–350 mg/dL]; HbA 1c ≥ 10.0–12.0%) with or without catabolic features (weight loss, ketosis, etc.).

### Treatment patterns and glycated haemoglobin levels over 36 months in individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line glucose-lowering therapy: the global DISCOVER study [^115mzgHx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

For individuals receiving glucose‐lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), changing from first‐ to second‐line therapy may include the addition of a new glucose‐lowering drug or switching treatment class, and is recommended when first‐line therapy fails to control glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Although most guidelines recommend a target HbA1c level of 48 to 53 mmol/mol (6.5‐7.0%) in otherwise healthy adults with T2D, they also suggest tailoring glycaemic targets to individual patients. Glucose‐lowering treatment should be intensified if an individual does not achieve their target HbA1c level with first‐line treatment. Despite this recommendation, observational studies show that a substantial proportion of patients have poor glycaemic control for several years before treatment is intensified, a delay referred to as treatment inertia.

Many glucose‐lowering agents are available for second‐line therapy, including sulphonylureas (SUs), dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, or sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and insulin. Global guidelines, including those from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes/American Diabetes Association, Diabetes Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), suggest selecting second‐line glucose‐lowering treatments based on patient characteristics such as age, duration of diabetes, and presence of comorbidities, as well as risk of adverse events including hypoglycaemia and weight gain. However, longitudinal data on glucose‐lowering regimens and clinical outcomes after second‐line treatment are lacking.

### Baseline characteristics of randomized participants in the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: a comparative effectiveness study (GRADE) [^112SU4cv]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is a 36-center unmasked, parallel treatment group, randomized controlled trial evaluating four diabetes medications added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We report baseline characteristics and compare GRADE participants to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort.

Research Design and Methods

Participants were age ≥ 30 years at the time of diagnosis, with duration of T2DM < 10 years, HbA 1c 6.8–8.5% (51–69 mmol/mol), prescribed metformin monotherapy, and randomized to glimepiride, sitagliptin, liraglutide, or insulin glargine.

Results

At baseline, GRADE's 5,047 randomized participants were 57.2 ± 10.0 years of age, 63.6% male, with racial/ethnic breakdown of 65.7% white, 19.8% African American, 3.6% Asian, 2.7% Native American, 7.6% other or unknown, and 18.4% Hispanic/Latino. Duration of diabetes was 4.2 ± 2.8 years, with mean HbA 1c of 7.5 ± 0.5% (58 ± 5.3 mmol/mol), BMI of 34.3 ± 6.8 kg/m², and metformin dose of 1,944 ± 204 mg/day. Among the cohort, 67% reported a history of hypertension, 72% a history of hyperlipidemia, and 6.5% a history of heart attack or stroke. Applying GRADE inclusion criteria to NHANES indicates enrollment of a representative cohort with T2DM on metformin monotherapy (NHANES cohort average age, 57.9 years; mean HbA 1c, 7.4% [57 mmol/mol]; BMI, 33.2 kg/m²; duration, 4.2 ± 2.5 years; and 7.2% with a history of cardiovascular disease).

Conclusions

The GRADE cohort represents patients with T2DM treated with metformin requiring a second diabetes medication. GRADE will inform decisions about the clinical effectiveness of the addition of four classes of diabetes medications to metformin.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Therapeutic inertia in type 2 diabetes: prevalence, causes, consequences and methods to overcome inertia [^114mYgY3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite good-quality evidence, glycaemic control is shown to be inadequate globally. Guidelines suggest an ideal individualized target HbA1c level for most people with T2DM to be < 7% (53 mmol/mol), using metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment at diagnosis along with lifestyle changes. The recommended HbA1c target for people with T2DM without comorbidities is 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), and if levels remain above this value, additional oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents may be added. If, however, after additional medications, the HbA1c levels are still > 7.5% (59 mmol/mol), further advances in therapy are recommended, including insulin. In addition to this, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care contain an algorithm of which medications to use as add-on therapy once metformin has been started, along with guidelines advising HbA1c review after 3–6 months post commencement of a new medication. Glycaemic control should then be monitored 3–6 monthly subsequently. Furthermore, the new European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)–ADA guidelines released in 2018 have shown an overall approach to glucose-lowering medications for patients with type 2 diabetes and the need to reassess treatment regularly to avoid therapeutic inertia.

Despite the evidence and recommendations, the guidelines are not translated into practice. A study showed that a third of patients with T2DM in the UK fail to achieve HbA1c levels ≤ 7.5% (59 mmol/mol). One of the key reasons for this is therapeutic inertia, previously known as clinical inertia, which is the failure to advance or intensify therapy by a healthcare professional. This review explains the prevalence, causes, consequences and methods to overcome therapeutic inertia in T2DM.

### Treatment choice, medication adherence and glycemic efficacy in people with type 2 diabetes: a UK clinical practice database study [^113TKCpz]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimal glycemic management is essential to avoid the downstream health and economic consequences of type 2 diabetes, both at a patient and population level. In addition to dietary and lifestyle factors, choice of medication for type 2 diabetes represents a key determinant of the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control.

The evolution of type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevations in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels over time and an ongoing requirement to adjust medication with respect to glucose-lowering efficacy, patient preferences and side effect profiles. In patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, metformin (MET) or sulfonylurea (SU) are common first-line therapeutic strategies. These therapies often elicit a good, initial glucose-lowering response; however, in patients who experience intolerable side effects (including gastrointestinal symptoms and/or hypoglycemia) or do not achieve sufficient glycemic control with these therapies (initially or over time as the disease progresses), there is a requirement to escalate to alternative monotherapy or combination regimens. These may include other oral antihyperglycemic agents (OHA) such as thiazolidinedione (TZD), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) or injectable regimens including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin-based therapies. These alternative classes of medication are each associated with unique efficacy and side effect profiles which, on their own or in combination, may determine patient adherence and levels of glycemic control.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefits in patients with T2DM and ASCVD to reduce cardiovascular events, independent of baseline or target HbA1c and concomitant glucose-lowering medication.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS/RESEARCH NEEDS

For antihyperglycemic management of type 2 diabetes, the comparative evidence basis to date is relatively lean, especially beyond metformin monotherapy. There is a significant need for high-quality comparative-effectiveness research, not only regarding glycemic control, but also costs and those outcomes that matter most to patients — quality of life and the avoidance of morbid and life-limiting complications, especially CVD. Another issue about which more data are needed is the concept of durability of effectiveness (often ascribed to β-cell preservation), which would serve to stabilize metabolic control and decrease the future treatment burden for patients. Pharmacogenetics may very well inform treatment decisions in the future, guiding the clinician to recommend a therapy for an individual patient based on predictors of response and susceptibility to adverse effects. We need more clinical data on how phenotype and other patient/disease characteristics should drive drug choices. As new medications are introduced to the type 2 diabetes pharmacopeia, their benefit and safety should be demonstrated in studies versus best current treatment, substantial enough both in size and duration to provide meaningful data on meaningful outcomes. It is appreciated, however, that head-to-head comparisons of all combinations and permutations would be impossibly large. Informed judgment and the expertise of experienced clinicians will therefore always be necessary.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111WDk7V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes guideline evidence review — key questions and GRADE categories are summarized as follows: The CGC identified key questions and asked CGC members and CGC Public Panel members a priori to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes, and all critical and important outcomes were considered in developing recommendations. The ACP Center for Evidence Reviews at Wisconsin conducted the supporting systematic review, and the evidence review team and CGC used GRADE tables to summarize findings and to rate the certainty of evidence for clinical outcomes using categories of high, moderate, low, or insufficient. Key question 1 addresses the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or long-acting insulins as monotherapy or in combination, and whether benefits and harms vary by demographic characteristics, diabetes severity and control, HbA1c levels, duration of diabetes, and comorbidities including baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Key question 2 focuses on patients' values and preferences regarding diabetes medications, including how patients weigh benefits and harms and what patient factors are associated with treatment preferences. Key question 3 addresses the costs and cost-effectiveness of diabetes medications alone or in combination for adults with type 2 diabetes, noting that the CGC's value thresholds for economic evidence were used by the CER in its ACP-funded systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses.

Advancing to dual combination therapy.

Figure 2 (and Supplementary Figs.) also depicts potential sequences of escalating glucose-lowering therapy beyond metformin. If monotherapy alone does not achieve/maintain an HbA 1c target over ∼3 months, the next step would be to add a second oral agent, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, or basal insulin. Notably, the higher the HbA 1c, the more likely insulin will be required. On average, any second agent is typically associated with an approximate further reduction in HbA 1c of ∼1%. If no clinically meaningful glycemic reduction (i.e. "nonresponder") is demonstrated, then, adherence having been investigated, that agent should be discontinued, and another with a different mechanism of action substituted. With a distinct paucity of long-term comparative-effectiveness trials available, uniform recommendations on the best agent to be combined with metformin cannot be made. Thus, advantages and disadvantages of specific drugs for each patient should be considered (Table 1).

Some antihyperglycemic medications lead to weight gain. This may be associated with worsening markers of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. One exception may be TZDs; weight gain associated with this class occurs in association with decreased insulin resistance. Although there is no uniform evidence that increases in weight in the range observed with certain therapies translate into a substantially increased cardiovascular risk, it remains important to avoid unnecessary weight gain by optimal medication selection and dose titration.

For all medications, consideration should also be given to overall tolerability. Even occasional hypoglycemia may be devastating, if severe, or merely irritating, if mild. Gastrointestinal side effects may be tolerated by some, but not others. Fluid retention may pose a clinical or merely an aesthetic problem. The risk of bone fractures may be a specific concern in postmenopausal women.

It must be acknowledged that costs are a critical issue driving the selection of glucose-lowering agents in many environments. For resource-limited settings, less expensive agents should be chosen. However, due consideration should be also given to side effects and any necessary monitoring, with their own cost implications. Moreover, prevention of morbid long-term complications will likely reduce long-term expenses attributed to the disease.

### Apparent subadditivity of the efficacy of initial combination treatments for type 2 diabetes is largely explained by the impact of baseline HbA1c on efficacy [^1153q4uZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinicians typically recommend that patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes initiate lifestyle changes, such as changes to diet and exercise, as the first step to improving glycaemic control; however, many patients eventually require pharmacological intervention 1. Metformin is commonly the first‐line treatment and, as the disease progresses, additional therapies are added to maintain glucose control 1. Initial combination therapy with metformin and another antihyperglycaemic agent is increasingly being used to lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, especially in patients who would benefit from earlier and more aggressive glycaemic control 1. Several fixed‐dose combinations are available, including combinations of metformin and other agents [e.g. dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and thiazolidinediones], as well as combinations of DPP‐4 inhibitors with SGLT2 inhibitors or thiazolidinediones. Notably, the HbA1c lowering that is observed with fixed‐dose combination therapies in type 2 diabetes is typically less than the sum of changes in the individual treatment arms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. While the subadditive efficacy commonly seen with combination treatments may be attributable, at least in part, to specific pharmacodynamic interactions between different treatment classes, the consistent subadditivity seen with multiple different combinations suggests that there may be additional explanations besides direct, detrimental pharmacodynamic interactions between different treatment classes.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — general principles state that individualized pharmacotherapy for persons with T2D should be prescribed based on evidence for benefit that includes glucose lowering, avoidance of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and reduction of cardio-renal risk; persons with T2D and their health care professionals should use patient-centered shared decision-making to agree on therapy targets and treatments as well as a regimen for glucose monitoring; glycemic targets include A1C, BGM, and, for those using CGM, achievement of CGM targets such as time in range (TIR), percentage in low and very low range, time above range, and glycemic variability, while nonglycemic targets include avoidance of hypoglycemia, control of BP, lipids, other CVD risk factors, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight; independent of glycemic control, targets, or treatment, if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a GLP-1 RA or an SGLT2i with proven efficacy; DM therapy should be individualized based on level of glycemia and the presence of comorbidities, complications, and access, with metformin often the preferential initial therapy and other agents appropriate as first-line or in addition to metformin to reduce BG and/or address specific comorbidities; clinicians should discuss with persons with T2D the likelihood that most persons with T2D ultimately require a combination of multiple complementary agents to attain and maintain optimal glycemic control, and the DM care team should assess medication adherence and safety and glycemic control in persons with T2D quarterly or more frequently as needed.

### Cardiometabolic effects of a new class of antidiabetic agents [^1145zNSy]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Within the past decade, many new classes of drugs have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, including glucagon-like peptide-1agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Many trials have been performed, and several more are currently ongoing to evaluate these drugs. This review addresses the broad therapeutic and pleiotropic effects of these drugs. The review also discusses the role of these drugs in the treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes and identifies patients who would be suitable candidates for treatment with these drugs.

Methods

In this comprehensive evidence-based review, the following databases were searched from 1990 to the present: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal, and the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes abstract databases. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were only included for the main therapeutic and cardiovascular (CV) effects of these drug classes. For pleiotropic effects, RCTs were included unless no RCTs exist, in which case other studies as specified in the detailed Methods section were included.

Findings

All 3 drug classes are effective in lowering hemoglobin A1c between 0.4% and 1.4%, depending on the drug class and population selected. These drug classes have beneficial effects on CV risk factors, such as weight, lipids, and blood pressure, in addition to lowering blood glucose levels. The CV tolerability of some drugs has been evaluated and found to be neutral; however, most trials are currently ongoing to assess CV tolerability. There are no concrete guidelines to determine where these drugs fit in the diabetes management paradigm, and there are ongoing trials to determine the best combination drug with metformin.

Implications

These 3 drug classes will potentially increase the armamentarium against hyperglycemia. However, the specific combinations with other antidiabetic drugs and populations that will best benefit from these drugs are still being tested. Future research is also being conducted on the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes — sequencing for greater glucose‑lowering potency: when even greater potency of glucose lowering is desired to reduce blood glucose to target and A1C goals, a basal insulin, either human NPH or a long‑acting insulin analog, should be initiated; however, if not already receiving GLP‑1 RA or dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA, an agent from these classes should be started first, and high‑potency GLP‑1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA are the preferred options for individuals requiring more intensive glucose management.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^113paztV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Approach to the patient with type 2 diabetes requiring add-on medication [^115p3jJX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)-lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c level from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. The goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.

### Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and HbA1c target of… [^112Bi5bN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

We assessed the efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin to reach the haemoglobin HbA1c target of < 7% in people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted an electronic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DPP-4 inhibitors through September 2010. RCTs were included if they lasted at least 12 weeks, included 30 patients or more and reported the proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c target of < 7%.

Results

A total of 43 RCTs reporting 52 comparisons met the selection criteria, which included 19 101 study participants evaluated for the primary endpoint, 10 467 treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor and 8634 treated with placebo or a comparator drug. DPP-4 inhibitors showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo and approximately 40% of participants achieved the HbA1c goal of < 7%: this was associated with weight neutrality and no greater hypoglycaemia. The reduction of the HbA1c level and the rate of HbA1c goal attainment was not different from comparator drugs, with similar hypoglycaemia, and different effect on weight owing to the nature of comparator (metformin, sulfonylurea or glitazones). Baseline HbA1c was the best predictor for achievement of A1C target (overall weighted r² value = 0.410, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A greater proportion of type 2 diabetic patients can achieve the HbA1c goal < 7% with DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo, with no weight gain, and no hypoglycaemic risk when used alone; DPP-4 inhibitors were not different from comparator drugs.

### Comparative effectiveness of second line glucose lowering drug treatments using real world data: emulation of a target trial [^1175pLLZ]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a common and serious chronic health condition. Timely control of hyperglycaemia, most often measured as serum levels of haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), is necessary to prevent complications of diabetes and reduce the risk of death. Most clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting HbA 1c levels to < 7% for most non-pregnant adults. Metformin is recommended as the first line glucose lowering drug because of its efficacy, tolerability, and low cost. Less certainty exists for the optimal second line glucose lowering treatment, however, when metformin is no longer sufficient, is contraindicated, or cannot be tolerated. This uncertainty is partly because of the scarcity of evidence directly comparing currently available second line drug treatments. Clinical practice guidelines advise that the choice of second line treatment should be informed by clinical and situational considerations specific to each person. Robust evidence exists indicating the preferential use of specific drug classes in the presence of cardiovascular and kidney comorbidities; however, how these drugs compare with each other in their ability to lower HbA 1c levels is less known.

GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is a recently completed pragmatic, randomised, parallel arm clinical trial that compared, head to head, four second line glucose lowering drugs for their ability to achieve and maintain glycaemic control in adults with moderately uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving metformin monotherapy.GRADE found that liraglutide (a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist) and insulin glargine (a basal analogue of insulin) were significantly more effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control than glimepiride (a sulphonylurea) and sitagliptin (a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor), which were least effective.

The design of the GRADE trial had important limitations, however, that reduced its relevance to contemporary clinical practice. GRADE did not include sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, agents increasingly used in clinical practiceand the preferred treatment for patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Also, the eligibility requirements in the GRADE trial of low baseline levels of HbA 1c and the start of second line treatment in the context of baseline metformin monotherapy, resulted in participants representing only 9.1% of adults with diabetes living in the US. Both of these factors highlight the need for more timely and generalisable data that are pertinent to the contemporary management of adults with type 2 diabetes.
