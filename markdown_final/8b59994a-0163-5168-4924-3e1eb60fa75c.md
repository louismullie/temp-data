## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statistical term best describes the three low test scores (47, 55, 62) that are far from the main cluster of scores (82–94) in a class of 25 students. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition of an outlier and whether these values fit. Then, I should verify why the other options (mode, skewness, variance) do not match the description. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note the statistical implication of outliers on measures like the mean and variance.

> Let me first confirm the definition of an outlier. An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a dataset, typically falling far from the bulk of the data; these three scores are substantially lower than the rest of the class, which clusters between 82 and 94, so they fit the definition of potential outliers [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the other options before concluding. Mode refers to the most frequently occurring value(s), and there is no indication these three low scores are the most frequent, so A is incorrect. "Skewers" is not a standard statistical term; the intended concept is skewness, which describes asymmetry of a distribution, not individual extreme values, so B is incorrect. Variance is a measure of spread for the entire dataset, not a label for individual extreme observations, so D is incorrect [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should confirm the implication of calling these outliers. Outliers can disproportionately influence measures like the mean and variance, pulling the mean downward and inflating the variance; that is why analysts often examine robust measures or consider whether outliers reflect measurement error versus real variability, but the correct term for these extreme individual observations remains outliers [^notfound].

> I will now examine the answer choices again to ensure no ambiguity. Given the definitions, the only option that accurately labels individual data points that are far from the main cluster is outliers, making C the correct choice [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. outliers**. The scores of 47, 55, and 62 are **far below the main cluster** of 82–94, making them outliers — extreme values that deviate markedly from the rest of the data. Modes are the most frequent values, skewness describes asymmetry of the distribution, and variance measures spread; none of these terms describe individual extreme values like these.

---

## Definitions and explanations

### Outliers

Outliers are data points that lie **significantly outside the overall pattern** of a dataset. They are typically far from the median or mean and can indicate variability, measurement errors, or unique phenomena. In this case, the scores of 47, 55, and 62 are substantially lower than the majority of scores (82–94), making them clear outliers.

---

### Mode

The mode is the value that **appears most frequently** in a dataset. There is no indication that 47, 55, or 62 are the most frequent scores; therefore, they are not modes.

---

### Skewness

Skewness is a measure of the **asymmetry** of a distribution. While outliers can contribute to skewness, skewness itself is a property of the distribution rather than a label for individual extreme values. Thus, "skewers" is not an appropriate term to describe these scores.

---

### Variance

Variance is a measure of how spread out the data points are in a dataset. It is a **summary statistic** of the entire dataset, not a label for individual extreme values. Therefore, these scores are not variances.

---

## Statistical implications of outliers

Outliers can **significantly affect statistical analyses**, including:

- **Mean**: Outliers can pull the mean toward them, making it less representative of the typical value.
- **Standard deviation**: Outliers can inflate the standard deviation, indicating greater variability than actually exists.
- **Correlation**: Outliers can distort correlation coefficients, leading to misleading interpretations.

---

## Conclusion

The scores of 47, 55, and 62 are **best described as outliers** because they lie far outside the main cluster of scores. This classification aligns with statistical definitions and helps accurately interpret the data distribution.

### Understanding variability: the role of meta-analysis of variance [^a5ed2088]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses traditionally compare the difference in means between groups for one or more outcomes of interest. However, they do not compare the spread of data (variability), which could mean that important effects and/or subgroups are missed. To address this, methods to compare variability meta-analytically have recently been developed, making it timely to review them and consider their strengths, weaknesses, and implementation. Using published data from trials in major depression, we demonstrate how the spread of data can impact both overall effect size and the frequency of extreme observations within studies, with potentially important implications for conclusions of meta-analyses, such as the clinical significance of findings. We then describe two methods for assessing group differences in variability meta-analytically: the variance ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). We consider the reporting and interpretation of these measures and how they differ from the assessment of heterogeneity between studies. We propose general benchmarks as a guideline for interpreting VR and CVR effects as small, medium, or large. Finally, we discuss some important limitations and practical considerations of VR and CVR and consider the value of integrating variability measures into meta-analyses.

Comparative efficacy of anti-obesity medications — key points emphasize variability and shared decision-making. Statements note that "Anti-obesity medications vary in their weight reduction efficacy and safety" and "Anti-obesity medications vary in their efficacy in improving metabolic diseases", with "Individual variances exist in body weight responses to anti-obesity medications" and "Individual variances exist in metabolic disease responses to anti-obesity medications". The document adds, "Shared decisions regarding the most appropriate anti-obesity medications include weight reduction efficacy, metabolic disease efficacy, safety, tolerability, indications, contraindications, limitations of use, warnings and precautions, dosing, route of administration, cost, and availability", and that "Anti-obesity pharmacotherapies often have therapeutic properties that improve metabolic diseases beyond weight reduction (i.e., weight-dependent and weight-independent effects)".

### Clinical pathways – can they be used in trauma care. An analysis of their ability to fit the patient [^3393602e]. Injury (2001). Low credibility.

This study prospectively evaluated the appropriateness and ability of clinical pathways to fit trauma patients in five key conditions, severe head injury, fractured ribs, fractured pelvis, fractured femur and blunt abdominal trauma, who were admitted to a single Level 1 Trauma Centre, between February and July 1999. Each pathway consisted of 14 elements of care divided into observable outcomes. Failure to achieve an outcome resulted in a variance or deviation from the pathway, which was assessed by the number of non-applicable variances. Appropriateness of clinical pathways was assessed by the applicability index (the number of non-applicable variances divided by the potential variances). Critical mismatches occurred when non-applicable variances exceeded 50% of potential variances. 146 patients, with the mean age 41.9 years (S.D. 20.7), mean ISS 11.1 (S.D. 10.7) were enrolled; 18 with severe head injury, 59 with fractured ribs, 13 with fractured pelvis, 20 with fractured femur and 36 with blunt abdominal trauma. Critical mismatch occurred in seven patients. Applicability indexes were 87 for head, 93 for ribs, 92 for blunt abdominal trauma, 91 for femur and 92 for the pelvic pathway. Patient assessment, pain management, skin integrity and patient education were the most appropriate key elements of care, discharge planning, patient satisfaction, treatment and activity were least applicable. This study identified, for the first time, that clinical pathways are clinically appropriate for major trauma conditions.

Summary — Because the effects of variances in pre-analytical and analytical measures can be amplified as samples are processed, it is important to clearly define acceptable parameters to maintain accuracy; therefore, it is recommended that laboratories not only fully assess and establish standards for these parameters but also include the assessment of these variables in their publications to aid in the development of community-wide best practice guidelines.

### Mean difference, standardized mean difference (SMD), and their use in meta-analysis: as simple as It gets [^265f2068]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), endpoint scores, or change scores representing the difference between endpoint and baseline, are values of interest. These values are compared between experimental and control groups, yielding a mean difference between the experimental and control groups for each outcome that is compared. When the mean difference values for a specified outcome, obtained from different RCTs, are all in the same unit (such as when they were all obtained using the same rating instrument), they can be pooled in meta-analysis to yield a summary estimate that is also known as a mean difference (MD). Because pooling of the mean difference from individual RCTs is done after weighting the values for precision, this pooled MD is also known as the weighted mean difference (WMD). Sometimes, different studies use different rating instruments to measure the same outcome; that is, the units of measurement for the outcome of interest are different across studies. In such cases, the mean differences from the different RCTs cannot be pooled. However, these mean differences can be divided by their respective standard deviations (SDs) to yield a statistic known as the standardized mean difference (SMD). The SD that is used as the divisor is usually either the pooled SD or the SD of the control group; in the former instance, the SMD is known as Cohen's d, and in the latter instance, as Glass' delta. SMDs of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered small, medium, and large, respectively. SMDs can be pooled in meta-analysis because the unit is uniform across studies. This article presents and explains the different terms and concepts with the help of simple examples.

### A simple guide to effect size measures [^1a20b8b8]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Effect size quantifies the magnitude of the difference or the strength of the association between variables. In clinical research it is important to calculate and report the effect size and the confidence interval (CI) because it is needed for sample size calculation, meaningful interpretation of results, and meta-analyses.

Observations

There are many different effect size measures that can be organized into 2 families or groups-d family and r family. The d family includes measures that quantify the differences between groups. The r family includes measures that quantify the strength of the association. Effect sizes that are presented in the same units as the characteristic being measured and compared are known as nonstandardized or simple effect sizes. The nonstandardized effect sizes have the advantage of being more informative, easier to interpret, and easier to evaluate in the light of clinical significance or practical relevance. Standardized effect sizes are unit-less and are helpful for combining and comparing effects of different outcome measures or across different studies (ie, meta-analysis).

Conclusions and Relevance

The choice of the correct effect size measure depends on the research question, study design, targeted audience, and the statistical assumptions being made. For a complete and meaningful interpretation of results from a clinical research study, the investigator should make clear the type of effect size being reported, its magnitude and direction, degree of uncertainty of the effect size estimate as presented by the CIs, and whether the results are compatible with a clinically meaningful effect.

### Experimental design modulates variance in BOLD activation: the variance design general linear model [^e2ef0eca]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Typical fMRI studies have focused on either the mean trend in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) time course or functional connectivity (FC). However, other statistics of the neuroimaging data may contain important information. Despite studies showing links between the variance in the BOLD time series (BV) and age and cognitive performance, a formal framework for testing these effects has not yet been developed. We introduce the variance design general linear model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to (a) simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while controlling for the other and (b) test for variance effects that could be associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a working memory task is associated with whole-brain decreases in BOLD variance.

### Prediction of additive genetic variances of descendants for complex families based on mendelian sampling variances [^bb1b95d4]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

presented an analytical approach to calculate the variance of DH lines derived from the cross of 4 fully inbred founder lines. The cross in question is shown in Fig. 1. Assuming the 4 fully inbred lines are unrelated, one can view a 2-way F1 parent as shown in Fig. 1 as a non-inbred animal. Thus, the variance of DH lines derived from a 4-way cross can be decomposed into the gametic MSV of 4-way F1 parents and the variance of BVs of these 4-way F1 parents. Under the infinitesimal model, the gametic MSV of individuals (andin Equation (1)) may be predicted based on the individual's inbreeding level as, withas the genetic variance in the random mating non-inbred base population. Thus, we derive that the expected variance of BVs of 4-way F1 individuals is(Equation (5)).

This variance, when combined with the gametic MSV of the 4-way F1 parents and considering that the variance of DH lines produced by a single individual is always 4 times larger than its gametic MSV, allows us to derive that the variance of BVs among DH lines produced from a 4-way cross of unrelated founders is expected to be 1.5 times as large as the additive genetic variance in the base population (Equation (6)).

Thus, the variance of 4-way F1 parents, who are identical to full-sib offspring in an animal breeding setting, together with the variance of DH lines produced by the 4 inbred founders can be used to derive the average gametic MSV of a random 4-way F1 parent as shown byas (Equation (7)):

### Heterogeneity of treatment outcomes across therapists and sites in a randomized multicentre psychotherapy trial [^cedcacbd]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Again, similar to the variance partitioning model, the 95% credible intervals indicate a large amount of uncertainty in the variance estimates. Still, when comparing the relative size of the variances, the percentage of posterior draws in which the variance of the differential treatment effects between sites is the largest variance (ignoring the residual) decreases from 82.3% and 80.5% to 64.4%, 62.8%, and 64.0% in models without and with therapist characteristics included as covariates, respectively. Standardized regression coefficients for the individual patient and therapist characteristics included in each model were generally small, ranging from 0.01 to 0.16, and are reported in the Supporting Information.

2.4 Secondary Outcome: Number of Therapy Sessions

Investigating the number of attended therapy sessions as an alternative outcome measure led to similar results. In the variance partitioning model, the relative variance of the outcome between therapists and sites were small, with 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The relative variance of the difference between the two treatment groups was larger, with 11.5% of the total variance. The small relative variances between therapists and sites were not reduced further when adding any of the predictor blocks. The relative variance of the difference between the two treatment groups reduced most strongly in the therapist characteristics model, where it accounted for 9.6% of the total variance. Detailed results for the models with the number of therapy sessions as outcome are presented in the Supporting Information.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^c942b654]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Mean-independent heterogeneity measures

To create a truly mean-independent measure of heterogeneity the exact relationship between the mean and any measure of heterogeneity must be identified and removed. We derived the variance's mean-dependence relationship for lower-bounded, double-bounded, upper bounded, and unbounded variables that are approximately beta, gamma or normally distributed, where the lower and upper bounds can be any two real numbers (L and U, respectively). The nonlinear relationship between the standard deviation and the mean's distances from the boundaries (μ − L for the lower boundary, and U − μ for the upper boundary) can be made linear by squaring the standard deviation to give greater weight to the tails of the distribution, and retrieve the variance (Fig. 2 e, m). Thus, normalising the variance (σ 2) by the mean's distances from the boundaries yields a mean-independent measure of dispersion (δ). In its generalised formulation, the calculation of δ for any (bounded or unbounded) continuous variable approximated by the beta, gamma or normal distributions is given bywhereis an indicator function withbeing the set of all real numbers, m is the lower (L) or upper (U) bound of the variable, andif, otherwise. Note that any number raised to the zeroth power is equal to one, such that if the lower or upper bound does not exist or is not a real number (e.g.) the boundary has no influence on the dispersion nor δ. Thus, specific cases arise from this generalised formula as combinations of existing or non-existing bounds. For double-bounded variables, the variance's mean-dependence is influenced simultaneously by the mean's distance from the lower and upper bounds, [μ − L] [U − μ], yieldingFor lower-bounded variables, the variance's relationship with the mean is linear with the distance from the lower bound, μ − L (Fig. 2 e), and thusFor upper-bounded variables, the variance's relationship with the mean is linear with the distance from the upper bound, U − μ, givingAll of which arise as mean-independent measures of heterogeneity, as it can be demonstrated from the approximation of single-bounded and double-bounded variables respectively as gamma- and beta-distributed variables (Fig. 2 h, p). Also implicitly included in the generalised formulation (Equation (1)) is the variance as a mean-independent measure of dispersion for unbounded continuous variables, as demonstrated with the normal distributionHence, δ is valid for bounded and unbounded continuous variables, where the bounds can be determined conceptually or experimentally. Bounds should not be determined as the observed minimum or maximum from a small sample without conceptual or experimental support. Examples of potential boundaries include the proportion of land covered by forest (L = 0 and U = 1), animal mass (L = 0 g), beetle size limited by oxygen (L = 0 cm and U = 16 cm), and biochemical fish depth limits (L = 0 m and U = 8200 m) (see Supplementary Note 1 for more details) –. Also note that δ is not scale invariant for single-bounded and unbounded variables. Therefore, variables must have common units for comparison (e.g. the same currency, or the same unit of distance).

### Obesity history, physical exam, laboratory, body composition, and energy expenditure: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^e764715f]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Body weight homeostasis — variance in resting metabolic rate (RMR) is described as dependent upon genetic influences on body mass-dependent energy expenditure, with individuals of male sex, increased height, increased muscle, younger age, and with obesity typically having higher RMRs. An increase in fat free mass may not only increase RMR, but may also increase hunger, which influences the nutritional aspect of energy balance. Beyond RMR, contributors to variances in energy expenditure include non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), physical exercise activity, and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). RMR can be affected by climate, with hotter environments increasing RMR to cool the body and colder environments increasing RMR through non-shivering thermogenesis to warm the body.

### Dominance can increase genetic variance after a population bottleneck: a synthesis of the theoretical and empirical evidence [^f34c79f2]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

Drastic reductions in population size, or population bottlenecks, can lead to a reduction in additive genetic variance and adaptive potential. Genetic variance for some quantitative genetic traits, however, can increase after a population reduction. Empirical evaluations of quantitative traits following experimental bottlenecks indicate that non-additive genetic effects, including both allelic dominance at a given locus and epistatic interactions among loci, may impact the additive variance contributed by alleles that ultimately influences phenotypic expression and fitness. The dramatic effects of bottlenecks on overall genetic diversity have been well studied, but relatively little is known about how dominance and demographic events like bottlenecks can impact additive genetic variance. Herein, we critically examine how the degree of dominance among alleles affects additive genetic variance after a bottleneck. We first review and synthesize studies that document the impact of empirical bottlenecks on dominance variance. We then extend earlier work by elaborating on 2 theoretical models that illustrate the relationship between dominance and the potential increase in additive genetic variance immediately following a bottleneck. Furthermore, we investigate the parameters that influence the maximum level of genetic variation (associated with adaptive potential) after a bottleneck, including the number of founding individuals. Finally, we validated our methods using forward-time population genetic simulations of loci with varying dominance and selection levels. The fate of non-additive genetic variation following bottlenecks could have important implications for conservation and management efforts in a wide variety of taxa, and our work should help contextualize future studies (e.g., epistatic variance) in population genomics.

### Well-founded practice or personal preference: a comparison of established techniques for measuring ulnar variance in healthy children and adolescents [^5e3a7fec]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulnar variance is a clinical measure that can be applied on hand radiographs to determine the relative difference in length between the radius and ulna. When the ulna's relative length differs from that of the radius by less than 1 mm, this is termed neutral ulnar variance or "ulna zero". A deviation from this neutral position with the ulna exceeding the radius is termed positive ulnar variance, or "ulna plus". Consequently, a deviation in the opposite direction is termed negative ulnar variance, or "ulna minus". However, exact values of ulnar variance and their interpretation depend highly on the method used to measure the ulnar variance. Population averages of ulnar variance vary around neutral and increase with grip. Ulnar variance can be used to determine injury prognosis of distal forearm fractures and in diagnosis of conditions like ulnar impaction syndrome and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) degeneration. In young gymnasts with possible stress injury of the distal radius, ulnar variance is suggested to be on average more positive.

Ulnar variance measurement methods include the "line technique", the "concentric circle technique", and the "method of perpendiculars". In the line technique, a line is drawn from the ulnar side of the articular surface of the radius to the ulna, and ulnar variance is defined as the distance between this line and the carpal surface of the ulna. The concentric circle technique uses a template of concentric circles placed with the center on the distal sclerotic line of the radius, and ulnar variance is measured by the distance between the line approximating the distal radius and the ulnar cortical rim. The perpendicular method measures the difference between two lines touching the distal ulnar aspect of the radius and the distal cortical rim of the ulna, both drawn perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius. The latter was found to have the highest interrater and intrarater reliability of the three and is most often used in adults (Fig. 1a). However, in children, this method can be difficult to apply, because the distal radial and ulnar surfaces may not be (clearly) visible when the epiphysis is not fully ossified. To overcome this problem, a measurement method specifically for skeletally immature patients was developed by Hafner et al (Fig. 1b). This technique and the population data provided by this initial study have since been used in studies reporting ulnar variance in adolescent populations such as young gymnasts.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^c02f5e90]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The variance can be calculated for a beta distributed variable withHowever, it is clear that as p and q diverge from each other while keeping their sum fixed the numerator in Equation (12) will shrink, while the denominator will remain constant. Therefore, because we know μ changes as p and q diverge from each other, we know that the variance will simultaneously decrease as μ increases or decreases from 0.5 (Fig. 2 m). This dependence between the variance and the mean is most apparent at the variance's maximum limit when p, q → 0, and the variance is equal to μ (1 − μ) (see Supplementary Note 2).

The solution to derive a mean-independent measure of dispersion for approximately beta distributed variables is to simply retrieve the distribution's dispersion parameter, δ 2. Recall that the variance was dependent on the mean due to the numerator in Equation (12). However, the numerator can be cancelled out with the reciprocal of μ (1 − μ) = p q /(p + q) 2. As such the dispersion parameter of the beta distribution can be retrieved withproving the mean independence of δ 2 for beta distributed variables, where σ 2 and μ can be estimated from a sample.

Other commonly used heterogeneity measures for the beta distribution

The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated for a beta distributed random variable, X, using Equations (7), and (12). Resulting inIt is, however, clear from this Equation that the CV is dependent on the mean for approximately beta distributed variables. If the dispersion of the distribution, δ 2, remains fixed, the components of Equation (14) that change and depend on the mean can be isolated:Like the variance, if p and q diverge the numerator in Equation (15) and (14) would shrink. However, unlike the variance the denominator would also change. If the divergence of p and q occurs due to a decreased p and increased q (a decrease in μ) then the denominator decreases and the CV increases. Conversely, if the divergence of p and q occurs due to an increased p and decreased q (an increase in μ) then the denominator increases and the CV decreases. This results in a negative nonlinear function with respect to the mean.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^f050c80c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Defining the general beta and gamma distribution

One limitation of the method so far is that the beta and gamma distributions are constrained to a given fixed range of values. The gamma distribution is constrained to the positive real numbers, with a zero lower bound. Meanwhile, the beta distribution is constrained to the real numbers within the interval [0, 1]. These constraints limit the variety of variables that can be modelled by the gamma and beta distributions. For this reason, here we define general variants of both distributions such that variables with any lower or upper bound can be modelled and δ can be retrieved. Rather than modifying the pdfs and cdfs directly to allow for any lower or upper bound, we defined methods for indexing the functions and for calculating the variance and mean for the distributions from observations of a variable (V) with any lower (L) or upper (U) bound.

### Reverse translated and gold standard continuous performance tests predict global cognitive performance in schizophrenia [^f7f96c95]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Regression analyses

To assess the shared and unique contributions of each CPT to cognition, MCCB composite scores were regressed onto 5C-CPT and CPT-IP d′ scores. A model including both CPTs accounted for 53.9% of the variance in MCCB composite score (F (2,32) = 18.7, p < 0.001). Comparisons of model parameter estimates (standardized regression slopes) indicated that 27.6% of the variance in global MCCB performance was shared attentional variance between the 5C-CPT and CPT-IP. The 5C-CPT further accounted for a unique but non-significant 2.0% of the variance in cognition (b = 0.956, β = 0.175, p = 0.251), while the CPT-IP uniquely accounted for an additional 24.3% of the variance (b = 5.62, β = 0.616, p < 0.001) in MCCB composite scores. A Venn diagram visualizing the relationships among the three variables is shown in Fig. 2.

### Procedural standards for deceased donor organ recovery [^6b2c90c1]. ASTS (2022). High credibility.

Deceased donor organ recovery — communication and photo documentation specify that any variance from above expectations, or abnormalities discovered subsequent to initial communication, should be reported by the recovering surgeon to the recipient surgeon in real time communication before the organ leaves the recovery OR. Communication items cited include need for further testing (delays) by other teams, potential video of the lungs inflating, video of bronchoscopy, and unusual finding, injury or trauma. For photo documentation, if a recovery surgeon, not from the transplant center is procuring, images and/or video of the bronchoscopy or lung should be provided to the potential recipient surgeon in real-time, upon request, in addition to permanent copies for the DonorNet chart, including any unusual finding, injury or trauma, video of the bronchoscopy, and anatomical variances. Non-vascular structures may include need for extra trachea.

### The neuro / psyGRID calibration experiment: identifying sources of variance and bias in multicenter MRI studies [^32e27aa4]. Human Brain Mapping (2012). Low credibility.

Calibration experiments precede multicenter trials to identify potential sources of variance and bias. In support of future imaging studies of mental health disorders and their treatment, the Neuro/PsyGRID consortium commissioned a calibration experiment to acquire functional and structural MRI from twelve healthy volunteers attending five centers on two occasions. Measures were derived of task activation from a working memory paradigm, fractal scaling (Hurst exponent) from resting fMRI, and grey matter distributions from T(1) -weighted sequences. At each intracerebral voxel a fixed-effects analysis of variance estimated components of variance corresponding to factors of center, subject, occasion, and within-occasion order, and interactions of center-by-occasion, subject-by-occasion, and center-by-subject, the latter (since there is no intervention) a surrogate of the expected variance of the treatment effect standard error across centers. A rank order test of between-center differences was indicative of crossover or noncrossover subject-by-center interactions. In general, factors of center, subject and error variance constituted > 90% of the total variance, whereas occasion, order, and all interactions were generally < 5%. Subject was the primary source of variance (70%-80%) for grey-matter, with error variance the dominant component for fMRI-derived measures. Spatially, variance was broadly homogenous with the exception of fractal scaling measures which delineated white matter, related to the flip angle of the EPI sequence. Maps of P values for the associated F-tests were also derived. Rank tests were highly significant indicating the order of measures across centers was preserved. In summary, center effects should be modeled at the voxel-level using existing and long-standing statistical recommendations.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^73c951cd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

In these methods, our objective was to demonstrate that δ is a mean-independent measure of statistical dispersion for bounded continuous variables, that other commonly used measures of heterogeneity (of which statistical dispersion is a subset) are dependent on and, thus, inherently biased by the mean, and that this bias has, in past work, resulted in spurious observed heterogeneity relationships with other variables.

Mean-heterogeneity relationships for the standard beta and gamma distribution

Here we introduce the gamma and beta distributions for modelling lower- and double-bounded variables, respectively. For both distributions, the most frequently used heterogeneity measures have analytical derivations based solely on the parameters of the distribution, which we can use to observe mean-heterogeneity relationships without being subject to feature relationships or chance. Additionally, both distributions can be evaluated in terms of a scale/dispersion parameter that influences the spread of observations in the distribution. A parameter is interpreted as a scale/dispersion parameter when, for a constant mean, increases in the parameter always correspond to increases in the variance. We can, therefore, fix the dispersion parameter, modify the mean, and observe the mean-heterogeneity relationships. We, then, derive a method of retrieving the dispersion parameter of the gamma and beta distribution, which we denote δ L and δ 2, respectively (with the subscript referring to the type of bounds, see Equations (2) and (3)).

### Quantitative genetics of genomic imprinting: a comparison of simple variance derivations, the effects of inbreeding, and response to selection [^4bd11bda]. G3 (2011). Low credibility.

For a highly selfing species, the degree of imprinting may have a large effect on the total population variance. For example, consider a population withand. Setting k 1 = − k 2 (imprinting, no dominance), the total variance is 0.20 forand 0.25 for. Interestingly, the effect of imprinting becomes less pronounced as inbreeding levels increase; for, the total variance increases from 0.18 forto 0.25 for, while forthe variance increases from 0.23 forto 0.25 for.

The female and male additive variances areandwhereandare the female and male additive variances calculated from Approaches 1 and 2b (Table 3). The female and male dominance variances areandwhereis the dominance variance (Approaches 1 and 2b, Table 3). Interestingly, and unlike the pure imprinting case, the dominance variance is different for males and females. The female and male covariances between additive and dominance terms areandwhereandare the female and male covariances between additive and dominance effects (Approaches 1 and 2b, Table 3). When there is no imprinting, the female and male covariances reduce to the same value:

Considering thatwe can see thatand hence the covariance is strictly negative under inbreeding alone. Recall that under imprinting aloneand(Table 3). Now we may rearrangeto give, so thatand hence, so the average of male and female covariances under inbreeding is also strictly negative. However, if k 1 and k 2 are of opposite sign, then one oformay be positive. Thus, although both imprinting and inbreeding introduce a covariance between additive and dominance effects, it is only the presence of imprinting that allows the covariance in one sex to be positive. Imprinting can therefore have a significant effect on the total genetic variance and on the sex-specific components of variance of an inbred population.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^f4bdcdc4]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Derivation of δ L from the standard gamma distribution

Due to its flexibility, the standard gamma distribution has been used as a model for many zero-bounded variables in a variety of fields. The gamma distribution is commonly defined with parameters for shape (k) and dispersion (δ L) where the pdf, indexed by x, iswith x, k, δ L > 0. The product of two exponential functions, describes all distribution shapes modelled by the pdf, whilenormalises the area below the pdf to be equal to one.

The mean and variance of the gamma distribution are, respectively, andwhere μ > 0 and σ 2 > 0. It is clear from this formulation alone that the variance changes linearly with the mean while δ L is fixed and that the rate of this change is scaled by the dispersion of the distribution (Equation (22); see Fig. 2 e). It is also clear that the standard deviation (σ) has a square root relationship with the mean when the dispersion is fixed.

The solution to derive a mean-independent measure of dispersion for approximately gamma distributed variables is to simply retrieve the distribution's dispersion parameter, δ L. Recall that the variance had linear dependence on the mean (Equation (22)), which can be removed with the reciprocal of μ. As such, the mean-independent measure of dispersion, δ L, can be derived from the mean and variance withproving the mean independence of δ L for gamma distributed variables, where σ 2 and μ can be estimated from a sample.

### Dopamine-independent effect of rewards on choices through hidden-state inference [^e5bb2ec9]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

The linear regression was fit separately for each subject to obtain the coefficient time courses β p (t). The penalty used for the Lasso regularization was found for each individual regression through cross-validation. When regularization was used, predictors were standardized by centering the mean at 0 and scaling to a variance of 1. For each predictor, we plotted the mean and s.e. across subjects. The statistical significance of each predictor at each timepoint was assessed using a t -test comparing the distribution of coefficients across subjects with zero, with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for comparison of multiple timepoints. Effect sizes were computed using Cohen's d at each timepoint as:

The linear regressions in Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 4 used the following predictors:
Reward: +0.5 if current trial is rewarded, and −0.5 otherwise.
Previous reward: +0.5 if previous trial is rewarded, and −0.5 otherwise.
Good second step: +0.5/−0.5 if the second step reached on the current trial has high/low reward probability, and 0 if neutral block.
Previous good second step: +0.5/−0.5 if the second step reached on the previous trial has high/low reward probability, and 0 if neutral block.
Correct choice: +0.5/−0.5 if subject current trial choice commonly leads to the high/low reward probability second-step port, and 0 if neutral block.
Repeat choice: +0.5 if same choice as previous choice, and −0.5 if different choice to previous trial.
Direct reinforcement action value update: +0.5/−0.5 if current choice is the same as the previous choice and the previous trial was rewarded/not rewarded, and 0 if different choice from previous trial.
Inferred action value update: +0.5/−0.5 if current choice commonly leads to the previous second step when it was rewarded/not rewarded, and −0.5/+0.5 if current choice rarely leads to the previous second step when it was rewarded/not rewarded.
Previous reward, same second step: +0.5/−0.5 if current second step is the same as in the previous trial and previous trial was rewarded/unrewarded, and 0 if current second step is different from the second step on the previous trial.
Previous reward, different second step: +0.5/−0.5 if current second step is different from the previous second step and previous trial was rewarded/unrewarded, and 0 if current second step is the same as the second step on the previous trial.
Common transition: +0.5 if a common transition occurs on the current trial, and −0.5 if a rare transition occurs.
Forced choice: +0.5 if a forced-choice trial occurs on the current trial, and −0.5 if a free-choice trial occurs.
Reward rate: exponential moving average of the recent reward rate (tau = 10 trials).
Contralateral choice: +0.5 if the current choice is in the contralateral side from the recording site, and −0.5 if the current choice is in the ipsilateral side.
Up second step: +0.5 if the current second step is up, and −0.5 if current second step is down.

### Genetically predicted serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in related to type 2 diabetes mellitus: a mendelian randomization study [^482e336d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We conducted analyses to assess heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and sensitivity. After excluding the outliers identified through the MR‐PRESSO analysis, we derived estimates that aligned with our initial findings, thereby confirming the robustness of our results following adjustments for pleiotropic effects. Moreover, our examination utilising steiger test indicated the absence of a reverse causal relationship among the identified SNPs, and the F ‐statistic reinforced the reliability of the inferred causal direction. We evaluated the potential influence of pleiotropy through the MR‐Egger intercept and the MR‐PRESSO Global test (Tables 3 and 5). The heterogeneity test (Cochran's Q test) is shown in Tables 2 and 4. The leave‐one‐out analysis conducted by sequentially excluding individual SNPs demonstrated no substantial alteration in effect estimation (Figures S1 and S2). Figure 3 presents the scatter plot of 25(OH) D and T2DM (GCST90013942), while Figure 4 illustrates the scatter plot of 25(OH)Dand T2DM (GCST90029024). The scatter plot primarily assesses the validity of the IVs. The negative slopes of several linear regression lines suggested a negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and T2DM (Figures 3 and 4).

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^f14dcb0c]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Donors with HIV infection — Heart transplantation is gaining acceptance as an advanced therapy for heart failure patients with HIV infection, and accumulating evidence from retrospective series and registry-based analyses indicate outcomes that are comparable to the general heart transplant population. With the adoption of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act (42 U.S.C. § 274f-5(b)), select U.S. and European centers have joined South Africa in utilizing HIV positive donor organs for abdominal organ transplantation of HIV+ recipients in a research setting, with promising preliminary results. In the United States, it is expected that the HOPE Act variance (Policy 15.7: Open Variance for the Recovery and Transplantation of Organs from HIV Positive Donors) will be expanded to include other HIV+ organs, including heart. The benefits of HIV+ donor organ utilization, including expansion of the donor pool for HIV+ persons and reduction in discarded organs, must be balanced against the potential risks of HIV superinfection (including strains with antiretroviral-resistant strains or CXCR4 tropism), and unintended transmission of opportunistic pathogens, and longer term outcomes of such an approach are unknown.

### Genetic variants influencing phenotypic variance heterogeneity [^ad10184b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Most genetic studies identify genetic variants associated with disease risk or with the mean value of a quantitative trait. More rarely, genetic variants associated with variance heterogeneity are considered. In this study, we have identified such variance single-nucleotide polymorphisms (vSNPs) and examined if these represent biological gene × gene or gene × environment interactions or statistical artifacts caused by multiple linked genetic variants influencing the same phenotype. We have performed a genome-wide study, to identify vSNPs associated with variance heterogeneity in DNA methylation levels. Genotype data from over 10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA methylation levels at over 430 000 CpG sites, were analyzed in 729 individuals. We identified vSNPs for 7195 CpG sites (P < 9.4 × 10–11). This is a relatively low number compared to 52 335 CpG sites for which SNPs were associated with mean DNA methylation levels. We further showed that variance heterogeneity between genotypes mainly represents additional, often rare, SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the respective vSNP and for some vSNPs, multiple low frequency variants co-segregating with one of the vSNP alleles. Therefore, our results suggest that variance heterogeneity of DNA methylation mainly represents phenotypic effects by multiple SNPs, rather than biological interactions. Such effects may also be important for interpreting variance heterogeneity of more complex clinical phenotypes.

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^eed221ea]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In table 3, we use numerical examples to show that if p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 ≠0, all combinations of 1–9 and 13 in table 2 may occur.

Table 3
Numerical examples of Δ 0, Δ 1 and Δ when p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 ≠0

The following theorem gives a more general sufficient condition of consistency than the first three cases discussed above.

Theorem: given Δ 0 and Δ 1, for any p 1 and p 2 between 0 and 1, there always exists a p between 0 and 1 such that Δ = Δ 0 p +Δ 1 (1− p) if and only if p 1 = p 2 or d 1 d 2 ≤ 0.

The proof of this theorem is available on request. Note that d 1 d 2 = 0 implies d 1 d 2 ≤ 0.

Unfortunately, if we are only given the information that p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 > 0, we cannot determine whether the inconsistency will happen. For example, combinations 1 and 3 satisfy the condition of p 1 ≠ p 2 and d 1 d 2 > 0. In combination 1, the overall difference is consistent with the subgroup differences, while it is not in combination 3.

### Bayesian prediction intervals for assessing P-value variability in prospective replication studies [^2df81d71]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Further, we show that P -intervals can be viewed as a special case of the intervals that we develop: they correspond to the assumption that the product of the sample size N and the variance of the prior distributionon the standardized effect size (δ) is a "large" number, in the sense that if we consider a normal random variable whose variance is, we could think of its distribution as approximately flat, rather than bell-shaped, in the range that a standardized effect size could be taking (the standardized effect size is defined in units of the standard deviation, e.g. δ = μ / σ). Flat priors are sometimes described as "noninformative", reflecting lack of researcher's knowledge or preference about a possible effect size. Yet, far from being uninformative, the flat prior places equal weighting on tiny as well as on large deviations from the null hypothesis. For example, correlation (being the standardized covariance) cannot be outside -1 to 1 interval, so simply acknowledging this range in a prior is already an improvement over an unrestricted prior. If part of the replicability problem lies with the preponderance of tiny effects in reality, the a priori assumption of a flat distribution for the effect size implicit in P -intervals would tend to result in intervals with the left endpoint that is unrealistically close to zero and thus promote false findings.

Derivation of the generalised δ formulation

Lastly, we introduced a generalised formulation of δ that is adaptive to the number of boundaries present for the variable being measured (Equation (1)). When the upper and lower bound are real numbers, δ (Equation (1)) becomes δ 2 (Equation (33)), and when the variable has only a real number lower bound, δ (Equation (1)) becomes δ L (Equation (37)), each with their associated proofs in previous sections. Here we provide proofs of δ for upper bounded variables and unbounded variables.

For upper bounded variables there exists no commonly used model distribution. The solution, however, was simply to use a conceptually flipped gamma distribution, where the lower bound of zero was instead used as an upper bound. This was done using same approach of rescaling the variable as was done for lower bounded variables. The target is, thus, to rescale a given observation (v) of a variable (V) with any real number upper bound (U) to retrieve x for indexing the gamma pdf and cdf (Equation (20); Equation (28)). This can be done withEssentially, v is rescaled such that its maximum is equal to zero. Similarly, the expected value or mean of the variable (E(V)) can be scaled such that its maximum is zero:where E(X) is equivalent to μ for the gamma distribution (defined in Equation (21)). Much like the use of the general gamma distribution for lower bounded variables, the variance of the upper bounded variable (Var(V)) remains unchanged when converted to the variance of a gamma distributed variable. As a result, the mean-independent measure of dispersion for upper bounded (U) variables, δ U, can be retrieved withThus, upper bounded variables can also be modelled using the generalised δ. In the main text Var(V) is denoted σ 2 and E(V) is denoted μ.

For unbounded variables the Gaussian/normal distribution is the most obvious model. The Gaussian distribution is defined by a parameter for central tenancy (μ) and dispersion/scale (σ 2). Where both parameters are estimated independently for an unbounded variable with the mean (E(V)) and variance Var(V). Thus, the distribution's dispersion is the variance itself (δ 0 = Var(V) = σ 2).

### The bias / variance trade-off when estimating the MR signal magnitude from the complex average of repeated measurements [^e67e7127]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The signal-dependent bias of MR images has been considered a hindrance to visual interpretation almost since the beginning of clinical MRI. Over time, a variety of procedures have been suggested to produce less-biased images from the complex average of repeated measurements. In this work, we re-evaluate these approaches using first a survey of previous estimators in the MRI literature, then a survey of the methods statisticians employ for our specific problem. Our conclusions are substantially different from much of the previous work: first, removing bias completely is impossible if we demand the estimator have bounded variance; second, reducing bias may not be beneficial to image quality.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^77c5d325]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Through simply dividing the standard deviation by the mean, the CV arose as an attempted solution to the mean-dependence of measures of dispersion and heterogeneity. For this reason, it is widely suggested and used without any assessment of dependence on the mean. The crucial assumption inherent to the calculation of the CV is that there is a linear dependence between the standard deviation and the mean. However, this assumption can be easily rejected when considering a variable with an upper and lower bound (double-bounded hereafter). In the case of a double-bounded variable, the standard deviation is maximised when the distribution's mean is centred between the lower and upper boundaries, because as the mean increases beyond this centre the distribution must become increasingly concentrated at the upper boundary (Fig. 2 i, n). As a result, dividing the standard deviation by the mean exacerbates the measure's decrease as the mean increases beyond the centre and towards the upper boundary (Fig. 2 o). The problem is furthered still when one realises the rate of change in standard deviation increases as the mean approaches the lower boundary, which influences both lower-bounded and double-bounded variables (Fig. 2 f, n). Intuitively this is expected because when the mean is far from the boundaries the increased clustering of the tails of the distribution have a smaller effect on the standard deviation compared to when the mean is close to a boundary (Fig. 2 a, i; see methods for rigorous definitions for gamma- and beta-distributed variables). As a result, dividing the standard deviation by the mean creates a nonlinear negative dependence between the CV and the mean for all bounded variables (Fig. 2 g, o). See methods and Supplementary Fig. S1 for demonstration of the CV as a measure of skewness rather than dispersion, explaining earlier empirical results showing linear dependence between the CV and skewness.

### Is negative ulnar variance a risk factor for Kienböck's disease? A meta-analysis [^2a3fdf09]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Current treatment for Kienbock's disease using joint-leveling procedures is based on the hypothesis that the disease is caused by negative ulnar variance. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate this hypothesis, and assessed the quality of available published studies. They searched MEDLINE to collect literature that evaluated this association. Only 3 of 18 collected studies had sufficient data or study design to meet their inclusion criteria. A summary odds ratio (OR) calculated using a conservative random-effect method showed that the odds of Kienböck's disease was 3.10 times more likely for those with negative ulnar variance than those with positive or neutral ulnar variance, but this was not significant (95% confidence interval, 0.95–10.05; p = 0.06). The combined OR was unstable because of marked heterogeneity across the studies. This meta-analysis reveals that there is insufficient data to support a significant (p < 0.05) association between negative ulnar variance and Kienbock's disease.

Biological variability of TSH and thyroid hormone concentrations — within- versus between-subject patterns: The log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship illustrates both within- and between-subject biological variability in healthy individuals and increases with illness, with studies in twins and repeated sampling showing markedly lower within-subject variability than between-subject variations. Such studies reveal that heritability accounts for 30% to 65% of the variance in TSH, fT4, fT3, and the fT4 × TSH product, and population-based reference intervals are much broader than within-subject variance and consequently are less useful for monitoring an individual patient.

### Genomic prediction including SNP-specific variance predictors [^7412c0ae]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Generation 2 was used as validation set where true genomic breeding values (TBVs) were computed as:whereis the QTL genotype for QTL j and individual i for this generation.

Genomic evaluation

To estimate the SNP effects, the marker panel of 1,000 SNPs per chromosome mentioned above was used and the following model was assumed:whereis the phenotype of individual i, μ is a fixed effect, p is the total number of SNPs, is the genotype of the SNP j for individual i coded as 0, 1 or 2, is the residual effect, andis the j th SNP effect normally distributed with mean 0 and variancewhereis a linear predictor for the SNP-specific variance the components of which are explained in the following section.

Evaluation models

The linear predictor for variance allows to incorporate any type of external information about the SNP variance, making it possible to assign the same variance for all SNPs, a subgroup of SNPs or assign a unique variance for each SNP. We used this linear predictor for variance to introduce external information on the SNPs into the models and the predictive performance of different prior assumptions was tested. The log link ensures a positive variance and due to its computational robustness is a common choice of link function in variance modeling. By using a Gamma generalized linear model with a log link, the score function for this model is equivalent to the score function of the REML likelihood in a linear mixed model (, page 91) and therefore produces REML estimates of the variance components. Furthermore, especially for variances close to zero the likelihood will be more symmetric on a logarithmic scale than on an untransformed scale, and thereby gives better standard errors for the fitted variance components.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^1fedaba1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We found an agreement between the theoretical expectation for prediction accuracy and the simulated results across all values of κ (Fig. 2 a), as well as across different effect-size distributions (Fig. S1 a–b). As expected, predictions on pairs with higher κ values showed higher prediction accuracy. For example, for pairs of individuals with κ > 0.62, prediction accuracy was P > 0.95. High values of κ are more common when the fractions of known effects are larger (Fig. 2 b), but we showed analytically (Supporting information) and with simulations (Fig. S1 c, d) that the underlying effect-size distribution does not affect the κ distributions (Fig. S1 c, d). As expected, adding a threshold c for the phenotypic difference in our prediction reduces prediction accuracy (Fig. 2 c). However, the reduction in prediction accuracy compared to the no-threshold prediction becomes substantial only when the threshold c is very large. For example, for a threshold c = 0.1 (0.1 standard deviations of the phenotypic values), the reduction in prediction accuracy is 1.5–5.8% for the (large) range of Δ values we simulated, whereas this reduction is 21–53% for the threshold c = 1 (a full standard deviation).

Patients receiving autologous cultured chondrocytes for treatment of an articular cartilage defect should receive the following information and instructions.

Physical activity should be resumed according to the rehabilitation plan recommended by the physician. Generally, protected weight bearing is recommended for the first 6 to 8 weeks following implantation. The patient should receive specific instructions on crutch use, ambulation and weight bearing advancement on the treated limb.
If pain starts to develop as the next level of activity is increased, decrease activity to the former level until the pain resolves.
If exercise causes pain and/or swelling, reduce the amount of physical activity.
Swelling should be controlled using ice packs.
Patient adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation program is important and activity at variance from the rehabilitation program may compromise clinical benefit from Carticel.
At anytime during the rehabilitation process or after, if sharp pain with locking or swelling is experienced, contact the physician for medical advice.

Quantifying individual variation in resilience to temperature change

In all models the thermal stress index and type of stress (cold versus heat) was allowed to interact with ostrich ID to model the individual variance (id). This was modelled as 3 × 3 unstructured variance–covariance matrix composed of the intercept (id int), slope during cold stress (id sl-cold) and slope during heat stress (id sl-heat). Individual repeatability (R) of trait values at the optimum temperature (T stress = 0, 20 °C for females and 26 °C for males) was then estimated as the proportion of intercept variance that is explained by the individual variance in intercepts:

Individual variation in the cold and heat stress slopes was used as an estimate of variation in resilience to increasing and decreasing temperatures, i.e. phenotypic plasticity. However, to estimate the repeatability of slopes for individuals (consistency of individual by environment interaction; I × E), we constructed a second set of models. In these models a second 3 × 3 unstructured variance–covariance matrix of individual by year (id-yr) combinations was added, allowing the repeatability of thermal plasticity within individuals across different breeding years to be calculated. Variance in individual slopes is on a different scale to that of intercepts, and also dependent on the scaling of the temperature index. For these reasons we followed a recently introduced practice, and estimated the repeatability of thermal slopes as the proportion of slope variance attributable to between individual variance:

To quantify how much variation in each trait was explained by responses to temperature we transformed the between individual and within individual slope variance to the same scale as the intercept variances using, where var(x) is the variance of the environmental variable, the temperature index. We then expressed this variation as a ratio of the total variance, including between individual and within individual intercept variance as well as year, enclosure and residual variance:

It has recently been debated if the fixed effect variance should be included in the denominator when estimating R. There are arguments for including fixed effect variance if it captures natural variation and excluding it if it represents experimental variance. For full transparency we chose to report estimates ofexcluding variance from the thermal index as this parameter has already been accounted for by the interaction with the random terms. We estimated fixed effect variance of all terms and of thermal stress separately following de Villemereuil et al. such that.

### An analytical, mathematical annuloplasty ring curvature model for planning of valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement [^1c0f71c4]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

By calculating curvature variance, we compared the curvature between rings and conditions (Figure 5, Table 1). Regarding initial ring geometry, curvature variance is reduced with larger sizes, indicating that larger rings are initially more circular than smaller sizes. Specifically, Physio II M24 rings had a curvature variance of 1.92E-3 ± 4.70E-4 and M26 rings had a lower variance of 9.92E-4 ± 6.84E-5, representing a 48.43% variance reduction (P < .001), whereas Physio M24 rings had a variance of 2.07E-3 ± 6.11E-4 and M30 rings had a variance of 1.21E-3 ± 4.17E-4, representing a 41.67% variance reduction (P < .001). We found that every ring in every size, except for the flexible Annuloflex ring, showed no significant differences between the paired initial, final, and relaxed states, indicating that dilation with our given balloon and under these conditions does not significantly influence curvature (Table 1). The Annuloflex ring was the only ring to show a significant difference between initial, final, and relaxed states, which depicted an initial state variance of 2.02E-3 ± 3.18E-4, followed by a variance reduction after dilation for the final state (1.36E-3 ± 3.62E-4, or 32.83%; P < .001), followed by an increase in variance after relaxation that was still reduced relative to the initial state (1.62E-03 ± 4.12E-4, or 19.62%; P < .001).

### Striatal prediction errors support dynamic control of declarative memory decisions [^35372055]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In each of these models the parametric regressor captures all variance associated with that regressor above and beyond the variance captured by the primary condition regressor. For example, the MS-PE regressor in the MS GLM would include only variance above and beyond the main effect of feedback presentation, and would include variance shared with the ERO-PE values as well as any variance unique to MS-PE. Likewise, the ERO-PE regressor in the ERO GLM would include variance shared with the MS-PE values and its unique variance.

The issue of correlation and shared variance between regressors is common to virtually all studies using event-related fMRI designs. To mitigate this concern, the present experiment included 280 total trials and we jittered the inter-trial-interval and the delay period between the response and feedback phase of each trial to optimize design efficiency. However, because this correlation reduces the statistical power for analyses of the unique variance of MS and ERO signals, we explicitly report these correlations here. The average correlation between the MS-PE and ERO-PE predictors after convolution with the canonical HRF was R 2 = 0.52 (the correlation was first determined within each participant, transformed with Fisher's Z -transformation, averaged across all participants, and transformed back to a correlation coefficient.) The average correlation between the convolved MS-EV and ERO-EV predictors was R 2 = 0.19. Thus, we conclude that there is sufficient unique variance within each individual participant to reliably distinguish these signals in the present data.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^c143da29]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU) — clinical research future directions emphasize that several validated OAB-symptom and OAB-symptom bother tools have been developed, but objective measures of urgency remain poorly assessed, with urgency defined as "urgency is the complaint of a sudden compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer". Investigators have tested urgency questionnaires for validity and reliability, yet no single measure is used consistently across trials, limiting comparability. The guideline notes that "Clinical studies should use validated standardized measures to report subjective outcomes", and specifies that objective outcomes "should include frequency, nocturia, urgency, incontinence episode frequency and reporting of the variance for each of these measures", with meta-analytic efforts hampered by inconsistent variance reporting. It identifies populations needing study: "The effect of treatment of OAB on the elderly, the very frail and those with pre-existing cognitive deficiencies needs further research", including "measures of cognitive side effects from anti-muscarinic treatments".

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^ade8746b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Derivation of δ 2 from the general beta distribution

Given an observation (v) of a random variable (V) with any real number upper (U) and lower (L) bound, x can be retrieved for indexing the beta pdf and cdf (Equation (6); Equation (18)) withEssentially, v is rescaled to a value between 0 and 1 based on its possible minimum and maximum, such that it can be used to index the beta pdf in Equation (6). Likewise, the expected value or mean of the variable, E(V), can also be scaled to a value between 0 and 1 in the same way:where E(X) is equivalent to μ for the beta distribution (defined in Equation (7)). Similarly, 1 − E(X), can be retrieved for V withThe variance of the variable, Var(V), scales based on the squared range between the L and U :where Var(X) is equivalent to σ 2 for the beta distribution (defined in Equation (12)). As a result, the mean-independent measure of dispersion, δ 2, can be retrieved for a double-bounded variable withThus, Equation (33) is a general version of Equation (13) that can be calculated for variables with any real number lower and upper bound. In the main text Var(V) is denoted σ 2 and E(V) is denoted μ for simplicity.

The general beta pdf can be expressed using the standard beta pdf (f (x); Equation (6)) as, where the denominator normalises the pdf to adjust for the modified scale when modelling V, x for indexing the pdf is found for V with Equation (29), and the parameters p and q can be found for V with Equations (30), (33), (10), and (11).

Given an observation (v) of a variable (V) with any real number lower bound (L), x can be retrieved for indexing the gamma pdf and cdf (Equation (20); Equation (28)) withEssentially v is scaled such that its minimum is zero. Likewise, the expected value or mean of the variable, E(V), can be scaled such that its minimum is zero:where E(X) is equivalent to μ for the gamma distribution (defined in Equation (21)). Conversely, the variance of the variable, Var(V), remains unchanged when converted to the variance of a gamma distributed variable:where Var(X) is equivalent to σ 2 for the gamma distribution (defined in Equation (22)). As a result, the mean-independent measure of dispersion, δ L, can be retrieved withThus, Equation (37) is a general version of Equation (23) that can be calculated for variables with any real number lower bound.

### Estimation of additive, dominance, and imprinting genetic variance using genomic data [^820a49c0]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Proportion of additive, dominance, and imprinting variance explained per individual chromosome against physical length of the chromosome. (A) Number of teats in the Large White population; (B) backfat in the Landrace population; (C) lifetime daily gain in the Pietrain population.

The proportion of additive variance explained by chromosome 7 for number of teats in the Large White population is relatively high (Figure 1A). This chromosome explained 21% more additive variance than chromosome 13, which is 62% longer than chromosome 7. This large proportion of explained variance is in agreement with the presence of a QTL for number of teats on this chromosome. In a previous study on a subset of the current Large White population, it was shown that on chromosome 7 a QTL is located in the region of the VRTN gene, explaining 2.5% of genetic variance. In the current study, we showed that chromosome 7 accounted for 7.75% of the additive variance (5.64% of the total genetic variance using MADI).

Dominance effects account for a large proportion of the total genetic variance (up to 44%) for number of teats, backfat and lifetime daily gain in the pig populations evaluated. Although the contribution of imprinting effects to the total phenotypic variance of the evaluated traits was relatively small (1–3%), the SNP regression method allowed estimation of the additive, dominance and imprinting effects and resulting variances. Our results indicate a strong relationship between additive variance explained per chromosome and chromosome length, which has been previously described for other traits in other species. In addition, we also show that a similar linear relationship exists for dominance and imprinting variance. These novel results improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of the evaluated traits. The model can now be applied to other traits and species. Our results also open new perspectives for the inclusion of dominance and imprinting effects in prediction of phenotypes, especially regarding mate allocation techniques in animal and plant breeding, and for assessment of the risk of disease in humans.

### Common SNPs explain some of the variation in the personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion [^d2c6f662]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of variance for personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion explained by all the SNPs in a linear model analysis. Common SNPs explain 6% (s.e. 3%) and 12% (s.e. 3%) of the phenotypic variance for neuroticism and extraversion, respectively.

Estimates of variance explained by all the SNPs for neuroticism and extraversion are similar to estimates reported for the Cloninger Temperament subscales Harm Avoidance and Novelty Seeking in a Finnish sample. The significant estimates from the present study contrast considerably with results from candidate gene studies and large scale GWAS. Hitherto, only very little variance (< ∼2%) could be attributed to markers that have been reported in candidate gene studies, and no variance could be explained by SNPs detected in large-scale GWAS. Those GWAS were powered to detect genetic variants that explain 1–2% of the phenotypic variance.

Our results suggest a polygenic model in which a large number of variants individually explain a small proportion of the variance. Moreover, we observed a linear relationship between the length of a chromosome and the proportion of the variance explained by that chromosome for extraversion, which also supports a model in which many variants affect the variance of the trait. As none of the chromosomes significantly differed from the regression line, no major gene effects are supported in our analyses. The linear relationship between chromosome length and variance explained was substantially smaller for neuroticism, which was expected given the smaller genetic variance that can be attributed to common SNPs.

In our approach, we tried to eliminate possible causes of sample structure (for example, hidden relatedness, population stratification) that may lead to spurious association. Consequently, phenotypic correlations between individuals are due to genetic similarities so that the estimated genetic variance component entirely reflects LD between the genotyped SNPs and the unknown causal variants. Our estimates are unbiased estimates of the variance in neuroticism and extraversion explained by common SNPs, so that the estimates are not expected to change (within bounds implied by the s.e. and assuming the same genomic coverage by SNPs) as sample sizes increase. These results imply that with larger sample sizes, common associated variants could be detected in single SNP analysis, depending on effect sizes of single variants.

### Gender variance in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood: a prospective study [^02181bf3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several retrospective and prospective studies have reported on the association between childhood gender variance and sexual orientation and gender discomfort in adulthood. In most of the retrospective studies, samples were drawn from the general population. The samples in the prospective studies consisted of clinically referred children. In understanding the extent to which the association applies for the general population, prospective studies using random samples are needed.

Aim

This prospective study examined the association between childhood gender variance, and sexual orientation and gender discomfort in adulthood in the general population.

Methods

In 1983, we measured childhood gender variance, in 406 boys and 473 girls. In 2007, sexual orientation and gender discomfort were assessed.

Main Outcome Measures

Childhood gender variance was measured with two items from the Child Behavior Checklist/4–18. Sexual orientation was measured for four parameters of sexual orientation (attraction, fantasy, behavior, and identity). Gender discomfort was assessed by four questions (unhappiness and/or uncertainty about one's gender, wish or desire to be of the other gender, and consideration of living in the role of the other gender).

Results

For both men and women, the presence of childhood gender variance was associated with homosexuality for all four parameters of sexual orientation, but not with bisexuality. The report of adulthood homosexuality was 8 to 15 times higher for participants with a history of gender variance (10.2% to 12.2%), compared to participants without a history of gender variance (1.2% to 1.7%). The presence of childhood gender variance was not significantly associated with gender discomfort in adulthood.

Conclusions

This study clearly showed a significant association between childhood gender variance and a homosexual sexual orientation in adulthood in the general population. In contrast to the findings in clinically referred gender-variant children, the presence of a homosexual sexual orientation in adulthood was substantially lower.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Interindividual variation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level reduction with evolocumab: an analysis of FOURIER trial data [^56fd924c]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Little is known about the heterogeneity in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C) lowering with proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor medications.

Objective

To evaluate the interindividual variability in LDL-C reduction with the PCSK9 inhibitor drug evolocumab.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We examined the percentage change in LDL-C levels from baseline in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who were taking statin medications. Patients in either treatment arm who had high baseline LDL-C variability during screening and either did not receive the study drug, altered their background lipid-lowering therapy regimen, or had no LDL-C level sample in week 4 were excluded from the primary analysis. Analyses in the patients were stratified by treatment arm. Data was collected from 2013 to 2016, and data were analyzed from January 2018 to November 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Interindividual variation in percent reduction in LDL-C with evolocumab.

Results

There were 27 564 individuals in the cohort; after exclusions for baseline variability (n = 3524) or alterations in background lipid therapy and other causes (n = 2272), 21 768 patients remained. At week 4, the median percent reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline was 66% (interquartile range, 54%-76%; median [interquartile range] baseline value, 90 [79–105] mg/dL; postchange value, 31 [21–44] mg/dL) with evolocumab. During the first year, a total of 10 325 of 10902 patients in the evolocumab group (94.7%) had a reduction 50% or greater in LDL-C levels, 10 669 of 10 902 (97.9%) had a reduction 30% or more, and 10 849 of 10 902 (99.5%) had any reduction in LDL-C levels. Fifty-three patients (0.5%) had no apparent reduction in LDL-C levels. In the placebo arm, the median LDL-C reduction was 4% (interquartile range, 6% increase to 13% reduction; baseline median [IQR] value, 90 [79–106] mg/dL; postchange value, 87 [74–103] mg/dL) at 4 weeks. Waterfall plots showed notable variability in the top and bottom 5% of patients for both evolocumab and placebo groups, with large changes in LDL-C levels in the placebo group (increases of ≥ 25%, 531 patients [4.9%]; decreases of ≥ 25%, 985 patients [9.1%]). At 4 weeks, the placebo-adjusted reductions in LDL-C levels with evolocumab were 50% or greater in 9839 of 10 866 patients (90.5%) and 30% or greater in 10 846 of 10 866 patients (99.8%). Results were consistent across clinically relevant subgroups.

Conclusions and Relevance

There appears to be a highly consistent robust reduction in LDL-C levels with evolocumab use.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^d027f21a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the effect of heterogeneity is fundamental to numerous fields. In community ecology, classical theory postulates that habitat heterogeneity determines niche dimensionality and drives biodiversity. However, disparate heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been empirically observed, generating increasingly complex theoretical developments. Here we show that spurious heterogeneity-diversity relationships and subsequent theories arise as artifacts of heterogeneity measures that are mean-biased for bounded continuous variables. To solve this, we derive an alternative mean-independent measure of heterogeneity for beta and gamma distributed variables that disentangles statistical dispersion from mean. Using the mean-independent measure of heterogeneity, true monotonic positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships, consistent with classical theory, are revealed in data previously presented as evidence for both hump-shaped heterogeneity-diversity relationships and theories of an area-heterogeneity trade-off for biodiversity. This work sheds light on the source of conflicting results that have hindered understanding of heterogeneity relationships in broader ecology and numerous other fields. The mean-independent measure of heterogeneity is provided as a solution, essential for understanding true mean-independent heterogeneity relationships in wider research.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9b5741e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### An evaluation of medication errors-the pediatric surgical service experience [^aaea535d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Medication errors in pediatric patients are well recognized. The need for weight-adjusted dosing and changes in pharmacokinetic parameters make this patient population susceptible. Surgical literature discussing this topic is limited. The purpose of this study was to review the medication errors (variances) on surgical services at a major children's teaching hospital.

Methods

Medication variances occurring from January 2004 to June 2006 were reviewed. Data included service, physician, medication, type of variance, severity, explanation of variance, and time of occurrence.

Results

There were 757 patients affected hospital-wide by a medication variance (n = 1340) for which 180 patients were on a surgical service (n = 308 variances). Residents accounted for 82% of all variances. Medication variances occurred most frequently on the general (36%) and neurosurgery services (20.5%). Seventy-one percent of the variances were classified as potential to cause harm but were corrected before reaching the patient. Five percent of variances reached the patient and caused temporary harm. Incorrect dose accounted for 72% of variances, followed by incorrect dosage form or omission in 5%, and missed allergies in 4%. Antibiotics were implicated in 31% of variances. Most errors occurred during daytime work hours.

Conclusion

Our data show that most of prescribing medication variances never reached the patient and were recognized by pharmacy or nursing. There is a continued need to enhance local education (resident) using a service-specific clinical pharmacist to focus on appropriate dosing especially in regard to antibiotics. Computerized physician order entry when implemented will help to minimize some of these errors. However, in the interim, a service-specific medication dosing card is being implemented. Quarterly service-specific data will be incorporated into the resident/fellow clinical conferences to minimize future variance occurrences.

### Racial categorization predicts implicit racial bias in preschool children [^8b4c7b1d]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Explicit Racial Bias

Choice scores were calculated as the proportion of trials in which each participant chose Indian over Chinese as their potential interaction partners. A one‐sample t test using the test value of 0.5 indicated that the children did not favor Indian over Chinese on a significantly greater proportion of trials (M = 0.55, SD = 0.28) than chance, t (70) = 1.41, p = .16, Cohen's d = .17. This finding suggests that Indian preschoolers as a group did not exhibit a pro‐Indian explicit racial bias.

To further examine choice patterns on each scenario, binomial tests were conducted on choice responses in each scenario. Children were equally likely to choose Chinese (other race) or Indian (own race) in all scenarios, therefore exhibiting no explicit preference for own race, binomial p s > .05, except in Scenario 2 (in their choice of a dance teacher) where they were more likely to favor Indian (own race) over Chinese (other race), binomial p = .001.

Hierarchical Multiple Regression for Racial Categorization

Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted with racial categorization scores entered as the dependent variable. The data met the assumptions of independent, normally distributed errors, homogeneity of variance, and linearity, and contained no outliers or multicollinearity between predictors. In the first step of the regression model, gender was entered as a predictor. It accounted for a nonsignificant proportion of variance, Δ R 2 = .00, F (1, 66) = 0.001, p = .98. Entering age in the second step explained an additional 17.4% of the variance in racial categorization scores, and this increase in explained variance was significant, F (1, 65) = 13.67, p < .001. Age contributed significantly to the prediction of racial categorization scores, β = .42, p < .001, part correlation = .42.

### Covariate adjustment in cluster randomised trials: a practical guide [^3d76bfa3]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gaps in methodological literature on guidance

Much methodological work is still needed to verify if the recommendations made here hold in all settings and to identify situations where there may be exceptions. For example, the need to adjust for covariates used in the randomisation to improve statistical precision has been demonstrated in the context of individually randomised trials; for continuous and binary outcomes in CRTs when estimating the odds ratio using generalised linear mixed models; and when using a two stage approach. Whether these recommendations hold under more general models, for example, with survival or count outcomes, remain to be established.

Other questions include whether to consider the original cluster level version of covariates used in a restricted randomisation, or consider a more relevant version at the individual level. For example, in a school based CRT, the proportion of students having free school meals (cluster level covariate) might have been used in the restricted randomisation. At the analysis stage, however, information might be available on that covariate at the individual level. Some researchers have recommended that if a covariate has been used in the randomisation as a cluster level mean but is available in the individual level form for the analysis, then it should be entered into the analysis model in its individual level form. Given the breadth of different approaches, there are also many specific and nuanced questions around the analysis approach (eg, whether, when using a cluster level analysis, a multiple imputation model should be used on the individual level data followed by aggregation).

How to estimate standard errors

We did not consider standard error and degree of freedom specification in the presence of covariate adjustment. In practice, many of the analysis approaches for cluster data have to be combined with small sample standard error corrections or used with degree of freedom corrections in settings with fewer than about 40 clusters. Furthermore, which standard error correction or degree of freedom to use depends on context. The approach to small sample correction can differ with and without covariate adjustment. For example, on adjustment for cluster level covariates, one candidate degree of freedom is the number of clusters minus the number of cluster level covariates; whereas the number of degrees of freedom do not reduce on individual level adjustment. The use of robust variance, which is relatively common when using generalised estimating equations, is another potential approach for standard error correction and has also been recently recommended within the context of mixed models, and is recommended by some researchers for use with covariate adjustment more generally.

### Repeat sample intraocular pressure variance in induced and naturally ocular hypertensive monkeys [^df28d686]. Journal of Glaucoma (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare repeat-sample means variance of laser induced ocular hypertension (OH) in rhesus monkeys with the repeat-sample mean variance of natural OH in age-range matched monkeys of similar and dissimilar pedigrees.

Materials & Methods

Multiple monocular, retrospective, intraocular pressure (IOP) measures were recorded repeatedly during a short sampling interval (SSI, 1–5 months) and a long sampling interval (LSI, 6–36 months). There were 5–13 eyes in each SSI and LSI subgroup. Each interval contained subgroups from the Florida with natural hypertension (NHT), induced hypertension (IHT1) Florida monkeys, unrelated (Strasbourg, France) induced hypertensives (IHT2), and Florida age-range matched controls (C). Repeat-sample individual variance means and related IOPs were analyzed by a parametric analysis of variance (ANOV) and results compared to non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOV.

Results

As designed, all group intraocular pressure distributions were significantly different (P ≤ 0.009) except for the two (Florida/Strasbourg) induced OH groups. A parametric 2 x 4 design ANOV for mean variance showed large significant effects due to treatment group and sampling interval. Similar results were produced by the nonparametric ANOV. Induced OH sample variance (LSI) was 43x the natural OH sample variance-mean. The same relationship for the SSI was 12x.

Conclusion

Laser induced ocular hypertension in rhesus monkeys produces large IOP repeat-sample variance mean results compared to controls and natural OH.

### Medication administration variances before and after implementation of computerized physician order entry in a neonatal intensive care unit [^0d285d11]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine whether implementation of a computerized physician order entry system was associated with a decrease in medication administration variances in a NICU.

Methods

A prospective observational study was conducted. Research nurses recorded details of medication administrations for patients in a NICU during standardized observation periods. Details of each administration were compared with the medication order; a variance was defined as a discrepancy between the order and the medication administration. Rates of variances before and after implementation of computerized physician order entry in the NICU were compared. Specific types of and reasons for variances were also compared.

Results

Data on 526 medication administrations, including 254 during the pre-computerized physician order entry period and 272 after implementation of computerized physician order entry, were collected. Medication variances were detected for 19.8% of administrations during the pre-computerized physician order entry period, compared with 11.6% with computerized physician order entry (rate ratio: 0.53). Overall, administration mistakes, prescribing problems, and pharmacy problems accounted for 74% of medication variances; there were no statistically significant differences in rates for any of these specific reasons before versus after introduction of computerized physician order entry. Administration of a medication at the wrong time accounted for 53.1% of all variances. Variance rates related to giving a drug at the wrong time were significantly lower in the computerized physician order entry period than in the pre-computerized physician order entry period (rates: 6.7% and 9.9%, respectively; rate ratio: 0.53).

Conclusions

Implementation of computerized physician order entry in a NICU was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of medication administration variances. However, even with the use of computerized physician order entry, variances were noted for > 11% of all medication administrations, which suggests that additional methods may be needed to improve neonatal patient safety.

### Heteroscedastic ridge regression approaches for genome-wide prediction with a focus on computational efficiency and accurate effect estimation [^764f3655]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Shrinkage by single-marker variance component estimates

A moment estimator of the variance component for each marker can be obtained from a random single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) as follows:MQM l and MQE l are the mean squares due to the marker and the error in the ANOVA for the l -th marker, N is the total number of individuals, and n i (i = 1,2,3) are the numbers of individuals in the three marker classes.

Theare not independent and, therefore, they do not sum up to the genetic variance, which means that they cannot be used directly to determine the shrinkage factor. However, they can be used to partition the total genetic variance to the individual markers:Here, the proportion of the genetic variance that is assigned to a marker l is proportional to the contribution of the single-marker ANOVA variance component of marker l to the sum of the single marker variance components of all markers. This results in shrinkage factorsThe approach used to determine the shrinkage factors in Equation 5 is abbreviated as RMLA (i.e. estimation of the error and genetic variance components with restricted maximum likelihood and partitioning according to ANOVA variance components).

The estimation of the genetic and error variance components from the data set under consideration can be replaced by using preliminary estimates of the heritabilityas suggested by. This results in shrinkage factorsWe abbreviate this procedure RRWA (i.e. ridge regression with weighing factors according to ANOVA variance components).

### Daily steps and all-cause mortality: a meta-analysis of 15 international cohorts [^f043ba51]. The Lancet: Public Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Although 10000 steps per day is widely promoted to have health benefits, there is little evidence to support this recommendation. We aimed to determine the association between number of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we identified studies investigating the effect of daily step count on all-cause mortality in adults (aged ≥ 18 years), via a previously published systematic review and expert knowledge of the field. We asked participating study investigators to process their participant-level data following a standardised protocol. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality collected from death certificates and country registries. We analysed the dose-response association of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality. We did Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using study-specific quartiles of steps per day and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with inverse-variance weighted random effects models.

Findings

We identified 15 studies, of which seven were published and eight were unpublished, with study start dates between 1999 and 2018. The total sample included 47471 adults, among whom there were 3013 deaths (10·1 per 1000 participant-years) over a median follow-up of 7·1 years ([IQR 4·3–9·9]; total sum of follow-up across studies was 297837 person-years). Quartile median steps per day were 3553 for quartile 1, 5801 for quartile 2, 7842 for quartile 3, and 10901 for quartile 4. Compared with the lowest quartile, the adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 0·60 (95% CI 0·51–0·71) for quartile 2, 0·55 (0·49–0·62) for quartile 3, and 0·47 (0·39–0·57) for quartile 4. Restricted cubic splines showed progressively decreasing risk of mortality among adults aged 60 years and older with increasing number of steps per day until 6000–8000 steps per day and among adults younger than 60 years until 8000–10000 steps per day. Adjusting for number of steps per day, comparing quartile 1 with quartile 4, the association between higher stepping rates and mortality was attenuated but remained significant for a peak of 30 min (HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·56–0·83]) and a peak of 60 min (0·67 [0·50–0·90]), but not significant for time (min per day) spent walking at 40 steps per min or faster (1·12 [0·96–1·32]) and 100 steps per min or faster (0·86 [0·58–1·28]).

Interpretation

Taking more steps per day was associated with a progressively lower risk of all-cause mortality, up to a level that varied by age. The findings from this meta-analysis can be used to inform step guidelines for public health promotion of physical activity.

### An evaluation of the predictive performance and mapping power of the bayesR model for genomic prediction [^d4c91c4b]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on this criterion, SNP i is thus included in the model if. In this way, all SNPs preferentially assigned to the null class take on a value of, while those assigned to any nonnull class (small, medium, or large) take on a value of.

The BayesR model definition explicitly allows for some SNPs to have larger estimated variances than methods such as GBLUP, which tends to shrink the variance of causal markers due to the assumption of a common variance. As such, BayesR has the potential for more closely approximating the true variance of QTLs. The posterior variance of SNP i corresponds towhererepresents thecolumn of the centered and scaled genotype design matrix. As the SNP effects are computed on the scaled and centered genotype design matrix X, the per-SNP posterior variance can be estimated usingwherecorresponds to the posterior mean of, where n is the number of iterations andthe value ofat iteration. We indirectly estimated this parameter as the sum of the posterior variance and squared posterior mean of each per-SNP effect. We can then estimate a posteriori the proportion of genetic variance of a SNP i as.

### Defining ulnar variance in the adolescent wrist: measurement technique and interobserver reliability [^ad031991]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The measurement technique for ulnar variance in the adolescent population has not been well established. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of a standard ulnar variance assessment in the adolescent population.

Methods

Four orthopedic surgeons measured 138 adolescent wrist radiographs for ulnar variance using a standard technique. There were 62 male and 76 female radiographs obtained in a standardized fashion for subjects aged 12 to 18 years. Skeletal age was used for analysis. We determined mean variance and assessed for differences related to age and gender. We also determined the interrater reliability.

Results

The mean variance was -0.7 mm for boys and -0.4 mm for girls; there was no significant difference between the 2 groups overall. When subdivided by age and gender, the younger group (≤ 15 y of age) was significantly less negative for girls (boys, -0.8 mm and girls, -0.3 mm, p < .05). There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the older group. The greatest difference between any 2 raters was 1 mm; exact agreement was obtained in 72 subjects. Correlations between raters were high (r(p) 0.87–0.97 in boys and 0.82–0.96 for girls). Interrater reliability was excellent (Cronbach's alpha, 0.97–0.98).

Conclusions

Standard assessment techniques for ulnar variance are reliable in the adolescent population. Open growth plates did not interfere with this assessment. Young adolescent boys demonstrated a greater degree of negative ulnar variance compared with young adolescent girls.

### Gender differences in individual variation in academic grades fail to fit expected patterns for STEM [^ff619333]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

We performed our main analyses on lnCVR and lnRR, and their associated error terms, using the rma.mv function in the R (v.3.4.2) package metafor v.2.0–0. One-third of effect sizes were not independent, because they came from the same study and/or the same cohort of students. We therefore included cohort ID and comparison ID as random effects in each model (the levels of study ID overlapped too much with cohort ID to model both levels simultaneously; e.g. in the school data, 120 studies and 141 cohorts, respectively). We also modelled covariance between effect sizes, assuming that effect sizes from the same cohort had 0.5 correlations between grades in different subjects (recommended in ref.) because sampling error variances among these effect sizes based on the same cohort are likely to be correlated. We added this covariance matrix as our sampling error variance matrix (V argument in the rma.mv function). In addition, to account for the two main types of non-independence in our data (hierarchical/nested and correlation/covariance structures), we used the robust function within the metafor package to generate fixed effects estimates and confidence intervals, based on robust variance estimation, from each rma.mv model. To test for the overall effect of gender on mean and variance in school grades, we constructed meta-analytical models with no fixed effects (i.e. meta-analytic model or intercept-only model). We tested whether the results were significantly different between school and university by including the 'school or university' categorical moderator in a meta-regression model on the whole dataset. We then ran separate meta-analytical models on the school and university data subsets to quantify respective heterogeneities (Supplementary Methods). To test whether the gender gap in school grades varied between subjects, we included subject type (STEM, non-STEM, Global, Other/NR) as a fixed effect in meta-regression analyses. To test whether the gender difference in school grades has changed over historical time, or with student age, we included either study year or average student age as a fixed effect. To test whether the variance of either males or females has changed over historical time, or with student age, we used lnCV as the response variable, and the fixed effects of sex and study year, or sex and age, and their interactions. Point estimates from all statistical models were considered statistically significant when their CI did not span zero.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^25d2e508]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Likewise, assuming no relationship with the mean, we could define a null model that is simply the mean empirically observed s, s 2 and C V :where, andare the mean of the respective heterogeneity measure across all samples, and ϵ is the residual error. The mean squared errors of the two model approaches could then be compared for each mean-biased heterogeneity measure using a two-sided paired-sample t -test (relying on the central limit theorem for normality due to a large sample size). The hypothesis was that the mean ϵ 2 would be lower when accounting for the mean-bias of s, s 2 and C V, i.e.would be lower for Equations (41–46), compared to Equations (47–49).

Regarding δ, the hypothesis was that it has a negligible relationship with the mean. For this hypothesis, equivalence testing is the appropriate statistical test with previous applications in ecology. The test required selecting bounds for which a coefficient would be deemed negligible, and a typical two-tailed one-sample t -test can be carried out to assess confidence that the coefficient falls between the negligible bounds. We selected the negligible bounds as a absolute coefficient magnitude less than half that of all other model forms demonstrated for other measures of heterogeneity. To carry out the test, we rescaled all heterogeneity measures to values between 0 and 1 based on their observed minimum and maximum (equivalent to Equation (29)). A predictor of the heterogeneity measure was calculated based on the model forms introduced for s, s 2, and C V (Equations (41–46) without the δ term). Linear models were then fit with these predictors to estimate coefficients and standard errors for both the rescaled δ and rescaled other heterogeneity measures. The t-tests were finally carried out with the coefficient estimate for δ and its standard error and compared with the null (half the absolute coefficient estimate of the associated heterogeneity measure).

HBVr prevention — data extraction and meta-analysis methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preventive antiviral prophylaxis with monitoring followed by antiviral therapy when HBVr occurred were used to compute pooled relative risk (RR), with RRs calculated using the inverse-variance method and a random-effects model, and heterogeneity assessed using the I 2 statistic. Baseline risks were obtained from RCT control arms by meta-analysis of proportions; when RCTs were unavailable, observational cohorts had to include consecutive individuals not on antiviral prophylaxis, provide appropriate baseline serology status, define HBV and/or hepatitis flares within acceptable definitions, and describe follow-up duration. For pooled baseline risks, the inverse-variance method with a fixed-effects model and the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation were used, analyses were conducted in STATA and R, and a class effect was assumed when assigning drug risk categories.

Prediabetes — high-risk adults: Meta-analyses reported increased regression to normal glucose regulation with vitamin D versus placebo (RR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.14–1.92] and RR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16–1.46]). Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults with high risk for diabetes by American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria. Dosing varied across trials, 4 studies used vitamin D2, and due to this variability the panel could not recommend a specific dosage of vitamin D. Over 3 years, absolute diabetes risk reductions were 24 fewer per 1000 (systematic review) or 33 fewer per 1000 (IPD-MA), compared with 70 fewer per 1000 with metformin, noting vitamin D in trials was applied in addition to recommended lifestyle changes.

### Estimation of additive, dominance, and imprinting genetic variance using genomic data [^0f129254]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

Individual loci that show the effect of imprinting have been identified for pigs, such as IGF 2 (insulin-like growth factor 2 gene;). The contribution of imprinting to the total genetic variance is, however, still unknown. No reports were found in literature that attempt to quantify total imprinting variance using genomic data. In this study, the trait with the greatest proportion of phenotypic variance explained by imprinting effects was backfat (0.017 in the Landrace, 0.029 in the Large White, and 0.020 in the Pietrain population), although the estimates were still quite low, in comparison with the amount of narrow-sense heritability and the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by dominance effects. In mice, a gene expression QTL mapping study for body composition traits showed that imprinting QTL accounted for only a limited amount of the phenotypic variance (< 2.50%) for most traits. In a pedigree-based study in pigs, it was shown that 5–7% of the phenotypic variance of backfat and 1–4% of growth rate was explained by paternal imprinting. That study also showed maternal imprinting to account for 2–5% and 3–4% of the phenotypic variance of backfat and growth rate, respectively. Although our genomic estimates are lower than the pedigree-based estimates described by, the two results agree that imprinting effects are more important for backfat than for growth traits. The amount of phenotypic variance of number of teats due to imprinting effects has not yet been described in the literature. However, two imprinted QTL have been reported on chromosomes 2 and 12. These two QTL explained 1.3 and 2.2% of the phenotypic variance of number of teats, while in our study the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by imprinting effects of number of teats in both populations was ≤ 1.5%. The larger imprinting variances found bymay in part be explained by the design, an experimental F2 population, analyzed in their QTL study.

### Disagreements in meta-analyses using outcomes measured on continuous or rating scales: observer agreement study [^a9f58db8]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Agreement at trial level

In table 2the different levels of agreement are shown. Across trials, the agreement was 53% for the 2025 pairs (61% for the 450 pairs of methodologists, 46% for the 450 pairs of PhD students, and 52% for the 1125 mixed pairs). The agreement rates for the individual trials ranged from 4% to 100%. Agreement between all observers was found for four of the 45 trials.

Table 2
Levels of overall agreement between observer pairs in the calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs)* from 10 meta-analyses (which comprised a total of 45 trials)

*Agreement defined as SMDs that differed less than 0.1 in their point estimates and in their 95% confidence intervals.

Table 3presents the reasons for disagreement, which fell into three broad categories: different choices, exclusion of a trial, and data extraction errors. The different choices mainly concerned cases with multiple groups to choose from when selecting the experimental or the control groups (15 trials), which time point to select (nine trials), which scale to use (six trials), and different ways of calculating or imputing missing numbers (six trials). The most common reasons for deciding to exclude a trial was that the trial did not meet the inclusion criteria described in the protocol for the review (14 trials) and that the reporting was so unclear that data extraction was not possible (14 trials). Data extraction errors were less common but involved misinterpretation of the direction of the effect in four trials.

Table 3
Reasons for disagreement among the 41 trials on which the observer pairs disagreed in the calculated standardised mean differences

*There may be more than one reason for disagreement per trial.

The importance of which standard deviation to use was underpinned in a trial that did not report standard deviations. The only reported data on variability were F test values and P values from a repeated measure, analysis of variance, performed on changes from baseline. The five PhD students excluded the trial because of the missing data, whereas the five experienced methodologists imputed five different standard deviations. One used a standard deviation from the report originally describing the scale, another used the average standard deviation reported in the other trials in the meta-analysis, and the other three observers calculated standard deviations based on the reported data, using three different methods. In addition, one observer selected a different time point from the others. The different standard deviations resulted in different trial SMDs ranging from −1.82 to 0.34 in their point estimates.

### Accurate modeling of temporal correlations in rapidly sampled fMRI time series [^0a755a5d]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

2.1 The GLM parameters estimation and t ‐score computation

Detection of neuronal activity via the BOLD signal in fMRI is most often based on describing the acquired data, Y, by a GLM (Worsley & Friston, 1995):

Each row of the design matrix, X, corresponds to a single observation (i.e. acquisition volume). Each column represents an explanatory variable, for whichconstitutes the regression coefficients.is an error term, assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with zero mean, and covariance, whereis the standard deviation and V is an autocorrelation matrix.

The most common approach for making inferences about neuronal activation in response to a task is based on classical statistics. Classical inference relies on calculating a t ‐score to evaluate the significance of an effect of interest,:

Here, is a contrast vector of weights andare maximum likelihood estimates with " − " denoting the pseudoinverse.

However, if temporal autocorrelations are present in the time series (i.e. in the case of nonsphericity), such that V is not equal to the identity matrix, the denominator of Equation 2 will no longer be the square‐root of a χ 2 distribution. In this case, Equation 2 no longer follows a t ‐distribution, which prohibits inference based on comparing it to a Student t null distribution (Kiebel & Holmes, 2003).

One solution is to adjust the degrees of freedom of the Student t null distribution compared against, using the Satterthwaite approximation based on moment matching (Worsley & Friston, 1995). A second solution, which is used here, rests on whitening the data before fitting the GLM. The whitening matrix W is defined by. Equation 1 becomeswhere I is the identity matrix. Both solutions require an accurate model of the temporal correlation within the time series to correctly estimate V. Once V is estimated and the data are whitened, the maximum likelihood regression coefficientsare estimated viaand the standard deviation of the error termis estimated from the residuals of the GLM fit. The t ‐score now follows a Student t ‐distribution and can then be calculated as follows:

The parameteris introduced to illustrate the impact of the prewhitening step.

In this framework, the variance is estimated as proposed by Worsley and Friston (1995) according to Equation 5:whereare the residuals and R is the residual forming matrix.is the autocorrelation matrix after prewhitening the data and therefore taken to be the identity matrix in this framework.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^abf6fd5b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Heterogeneity measures were calculated for the mean-balanced samples of land elevation (101,490 samples) and crop cover (39,690 samples), where each sample had 400 pixels. We calculated the sample variance (s 2), sample standard deviation (s), and coefficient of variation (C V). Using Equations (37) and (33), we calculated δ L and δ 2 for land elevation and crop cover, respectively. To calculate δ, we used s 2 and the sample mean in place of Var(V) and E(V), respectively.

We assessed the fit of the models derived analytically to heterogeneity measures of empirical data, and compared the fit with a null model assuming no relationship with the mean. By calculating the mean or median observed δ L and δ 2 for all observed sample means, we could calculate the expected value of s, s 2 and C V for each possible mean. For the land elevation above sea level data, with a lower bound of zero, heterogeneity measures were predicted for each sample mean value withwhereis the mean δ L observed across all samples, is the median δ L observed across all samples, and ϵ is the residual error. For the crop cover percentage data, with a lower bound of zero and upper bound of 100, heterogeneity measures were predicted for each sample mean value withwhereis the mean δ 2 observed across all samples, is the median δ 2 observed across all samples, and ϵ is the residual error. The median was deemed a better average for δ when predicting the C V due to the C V rapidly increasing to ∞ at low mean values.

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^50ad8f76]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Notations

We used the example in table 1 to develop our notation. However, our results apply to both continuous and categorical outcomes. Let Y i denote the score of a randomly selected student from school i, and p i denote the proportion of girls in school i, i = 1, 2. We define the following quantities: a 10 = average score of girls in school 1, a 11 = average score of boys in school 1, a 20 = average score of girls in school 2, a 21 = average score of boys in school 2.

Then the overall average scores of these two schools are a 1 = p 1 a 10 +(1−p 1) a 11, and a 2 = p 2 a 20 +(1−p 2) a 21, respectively. They are the weighted averages of the subgroup averages.

We also define some differences in the score:

(1) The differences between girls and boys within each school: d 1 = a 10 −a 11, d 2 = a 20 – a 21.

(2) The difference in girls (boys) between the two schools (subgroup differences):

Δ 0 = a 10 –a 20,

Δ 1 = a 11 –a 21.

(3) The overall difference between the two schools:

Δ = a 1 – a 2.

It is easy to prove that

Δ 0 –Δ 1 = d 1 – d 2.

### Gender differences in the genetic factors responsible for variation in bone density and ultrasound [^552a65a2]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

Although genetic factors are thought to explain a large proportion of the variation in bone density in women, few studies have been conducted in men. Therefore, it is unclear whether the individual differences in bone strength between men and women are a reflection of gender differences in the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on bone density variance. The aim of this study was to determine if there were gender differences in the genetic components of variance for bone density and ultrasound. In addition, the study aimed to explore the hypothesis that there are unique gender-specific genetic determinants of these traits. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip, distal forearm, and lumbar spine were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as well as quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the calcaneus in healthy female twin pairs (286 identical [MZ] and 265 nonidentical [DZ]), male twin pairs (72 MZ and 65 DZ), and 82 opposite-sex (OS) pairs aged between 18 and 80 years. For hip BMD, distal forearm, and QUS measurements, the differences between MZ correlations and like-sex DZ correlations were similar for both sexes, suggesting little difference in the component of total variance explained by genetic factors between male and female twin pairs. However, correlations between OS twin pairs were lower than that of like-sex twin pairs, suggesting the possibility of unique gender-specific genetic effects. At the forearm, model fitting suggested a small gender difference in the magnitude of genetic variance as well as the presence of a unique gender-specific genetic variance component. Hip, lumbar spine, and QUS measurements were better explained by models that assumed no gender differences in genetic variance between the sexes, but the study had insufficient power to detect small differences in the genetic components of variance. The results of this study suggest that the proportion of bone strength variance explained by genetic factors is similar for men and women. However, at some regions there is evidence to suggest a gender-specific genetic component to the overall genetic variance.

### Assessing whether genetic scores explain extra variation in birthweight, when added to clinical and anthropometric measures [^ad982789]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Human birthweight is a complex, multifactorial trait. Maternal characteristics contribute to birthweight variation by influencing the intrauterine environment. Variation explained by genetic effects is also important, but their contributions have not been assessed alongside other key determinants. We aimed to investigate variance in birthweight explained by genetic scores in addition to easily-measurable clinical and anthropometric variables.

Methods

We analysed 549 European-ancestry parent-offspring trios from a UK community-based birth cohort. We investigated variance explained in birthweight (adjusted for sex and gestational age) in multivariable linear regression models including genetic scores, routinely-measured maternal characteristics, and parental anthropometric variables. We used R-Squared (R 2) to estimate variance explained, adjusted R-squared (Adj-R 2) to assess improvement in model fit from added predictors, and F-tests to compare nested models.

Results

Maternal and fetal genetic scores together explained 6.0% variance in birthweight. A model containing maternal age, weight, smoking, parity and 28-week fasting glucose explained 21.7% variance. Maternal genetic score explained additional variance when added to maternal characteristics (Adj-R 2 = 0.233 vs Adj-R 2 = 0.210, p < 0.001). Fetal genetic score improved variance explained (Adj-R 2 = 0.264 vs 0.248, p < 0.001) when added to maternal characteristics and parental heights.

Conclusions

Genetic scores account for variance explained in birthweight in addition to easily measurable clinical variables. Parental heights partially capture fetal genotype and its contribution to birthweight, but genetic scores explain additional variance. While the genetic contribution is modest, it is comparable to that of individual clinical characteristics such as parity, which suggests that genetics could be included in tools aiming to predict risk of high or low birthweights.

Results

Generation and selection of spectral coherence variables

Subsequent to SVD-based PCA, distribution of variation among coherence factors demonstrated a satisfactory condensation of variance into a small number of factors: 829 factors described over 99%, 366 described 90.02%, 38 described 49.98%, 7 described 24.97% and 1 factor described 8.10% of the total variance before rotation. The first 40 factors accounted for 50.87% of the total variance. Variance and percent variance after Varimax rotation are shown in Table 2. Factors were named in the order selected by their Eigenvalues before rotation. In Table 2, the percent variance values are not in descending order, which is an expected result of the variance re-distribution from the Varimax rotation. These 40 factors were used as variables to represent all subjects in the subsequent analyses.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more).

### Random-effects meta-analysis of inconsistent effects: a time for change [^5a9ee825]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A primary goal of meta-analysis is to improve the estimation of treatment effects by pooling results of similar studies. This article explains how the most widely used method for pooling heterogeneous studies — the Der Simonian-Laird (DL) estimator — can produce biased estimates with falsely high precision. A classic example is presented to show that use of the DL estimator can lead to erroneous conclusions. Particular problems with the DL estimator are discussed, and several alternative methods for summarizing heterogeneous evidence are presented. The authors support replacing universal use of the DL estimator with analyses based on a critical synthesis that recognizes the uncertainty in the evidence, focuses on describing and explaining the probable sources of variation in the evidence, and uses random-effects estimates that provide more accurate confidence limits than the DL estimator.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^89f3ba23]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — pregnancy vitamin D trial characteristics: The systematic review identified 10 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria (29). Of the 2979 participants, almost half (n = 1298) came from the trial by Roth et al (217) in Bangladesh. The included trials varied greatly in terms of dose frequency (one-time bolus vs intermittent dosing) and dose ranges (600 to 20 000 IU [15 to 500 μg]). The median gestational age at which the intervention (vitamin D vs placebo) was initiated was about 20 weeks. Of the 7 trials that reported baseline 25(OH)D concentrations, mean values were below 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) in 4.

### Can early gut microbiota screening reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment? A mendelian randomization study [^f43a27da]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Gastrointestinal symptoms are now detected early in the clinical course of many dementia patients, and studies of the microbiome-gut-brain axis have confirmed bidirectional interactions between the gut and the brain. However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cognitive impairment has not been fully established. Therefore, this study conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study to elucidate the potential causal relationship of gut microbiota to cognitive impairment. Objective: Using Mendelian randomization to identify gut flora with a genetic causal effect on the development of cognitive impairment. Methods: This study utilized publicly available genome-wide association study summary data to perform MR analysis, with gut microbiota as the exposure and various cognitive function indicators as well as scores for Alzheimer's disease as outcomes. This study selected single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables based on p-values, F-statistics, and r 2. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization was conducted using methods such as inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode to assess the causal relationship. Concurrently, this study carried out Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis to identify potential heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Results: This study identified a total of 31 gut microbes that have a causal relationship with cognitive impairment, which include 1 phylum, 4 classes, 3 orders, 2 families, and 21 genera. Conclusions: This study unveiled specific gut microbiota associated with cognitive impairment, offering new insights and approaches for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment through gut microbiota such as Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus gnavus group.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Unsupervised meta-clustering identifies risk clusters in acute myeloid leukemia based on clinical and genetic profiles [^58c28173]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inherently to unsupervised learning, different methods of clustering, i.e. different algorithms, will result in different outputs. Hence, no single 'best' algorithm exists for any given task, but rather the algorithm has to be evaluated within the context of a specific data set. What further complicates this issue, is that there are no labels in unsupervised learning. A supervised learning task is trivial to evaluate with regard to differential model performance: A given set of robust ground truth labels are provided and model performance is simply evaluated on how well each single model predicts the previously unseen labels. Then, the best model is the one with the highest hit-rate between predicted and ground truth labels. Since there are no labels (and often no real ground truth) in unsupervised learning, a selection of the 'best' algorithm is rather subjective. In our set-up of 605 different possible combinations, one could conduct statistical analysis for each combination, but would still be left with the issue of what output would be considered the 'winner'. As this fundamentally ends in a subjective and therefore potentially biased manual decision, we used meta-clustering not to select the 'best' clustering output, but rather to average all valid (after the sanity check) outputs. Still, to make individual algorithmic combinations numerically comparable, we used the silhouette coefficient, the Calinski-Harabasz-Index, and the Davies-Bouldin-Score. Silhouette analysismeasures how close a point in a cluster is to points in neighboring clusters. On a scale from −1 to +1, samples that are far away from neighboring clusters will receive a value close to +1 while a value close to 0 means that a sample is close to the decision boundary between two clusters whereas a value close to −1 indicates an error in cluster assignment. The Calinski-Harabasz-Index (also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion)is the ratio between the sum of inter-cluster dispersion and the sum of intra-cluster dispersion. It ranges from 0 to (theoretically) infinity with higher values indicating higher clustering quality. Lastly, the Davies-Bouldin-Scoreis an average similarity index that compares each cluster to its most similar cluster. A ratio is formed of intra-cluster distances to inter-cluster distances. The score ranges from 0 to (theoretically) infinity where values close to 0 indicate a higher distance between clusters and thus, better overall cluster quality.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^7ecb7502]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

### Gender differences in individual variation in academic grades fail to fit expected patterns for STEM [^dca73d94]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Robustness of results

There is a possibility of a bias in our results due to over-reporting of positive findings in published studies, so we tested our data for publication bias using multilevel-model versions of funnel plots and Egger's regression. We also performed alternative analyses of key components of our study to test whether our conclusions are robust. Overlaps of grade distributions were inferred using simulation methods. Details and results of these analyses are presented in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 15–18, 20–23.

### Circulating vitamin C concentration and risk of cancers: a mendelian randomization study [^39cc23f6]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Reverse MR analysis on associations of genetically predicted cancer risk with circulating vitamin C concentration. The β represents the change (in SD unit) in plasma vitamin C concentration per 1-unit increase in genetically predicted cancer risk (logOR). The random-effects inverse-variance-weighted method was used as the primary approach, while other methods including MR-Egger, weighted median-based, MR-PRESSO, mode-based, MR-Robust, and MR-RAPS were used as sensitivity analyses. The MR-PRESSO global test and MR-Egger regression were used to detect the pleiotropic effects. Using the MR-Egger regression method, the effect of genetic instruments on the exposure is plotted against its effect on the outcome, and an intercept distinct from the origin provides evidence for pleiotropic effects (MR-Egger regression test: p < 0.01). We highlight the outlier-corrected MR estimates using MR-PRESSO and MR-Robust if the horizontal pleiotropy was present (MR-PRESSO global test: p < 0.01). The q values derived from the Cochran's Q statistics were used to reflect heterogeneity between the SNP-specific estimates, and the weighted median-based results should be highlighted if significant heterogeneity was observed. *Indicates p < 0.05, indicates p < 0.01.

Sensitivity analyses of MR

In the MR analysis of associations of genetically predicted circulating vitamin C with site-specific cancers, the MR-PRESSO global test suggested horizontal pleiotropy for the associations of the vitamin C-related genetic variants with breast cancer, while the MR-Egger regression did not indicate any horizontal pleiotropy. In the reverse MR analysis, potential horizontal pleiotropy was only suggested by MR-PRESSO global test for breast cancer- and smoking initiation-related genetic variants. Nevertheless, the significance of the MR estimates remained unchanged after adjustment for the pleiotropy using MR-PRESSO approach. Moreover, compared to the primary IVW method, sensitivity analysis using different MR methods did not substantially change the MR results (Figs. 2, 3, and 4), except that there were several MR approaches yielding significant associations of lung cancer with vitamin C concentration (Fig. 4).
