## Question

Orthostatic hypotension management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about orthostatic hypotension management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the subtype. Then, I should identify reversible contributors and nonpharmacologic first-line strategies. Next, I will consider pharmacologic options, including midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, and pyridostigmine, and how to handle supine hypertension. After that, I need to integrate hypertension management when OH coexists, including what to do with antihypertensives. Finally, I will outline monitoring, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the subtype, because management hinges on getting this right. I should double-check that orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, and I should distinguish classic, initial, delayed, and neurogenic forms, since neurogenic OH often coexists with supine hypertension and altered baroreflex function [^93fdd9dc] [^df2f9663] [^00cf139e].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement protocol, because misclassification is common if I get this wrong. I need to ensure supine blood pressure is measured after 5 minutes, then standing blood pressure at 1 and 3 minutes, and consider continuous beat-to-beat monitoring when initial OH or delayed OH is suspected, since delayed OH can emerge after 3 minutes and initial OH within 15 seconds, and both are associated with adverse outcomes in older adults [^93fdd9dc] [^2a414ef3] [^53934c43].

> Next, I should review reversible contributors before committing to long-term therapy. Hold on, I should verify medication culprits such as diuretics, vasodilators, alpha-blockers, tricyclics, and dopaminergic agents, and I should also assess volume status, anemia, and endocrine causes, because correcting these can obviate the need for pressors or volume expanders [^93fdd9dc] [^c05db5aa].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic first-line strategies, since these are foundational and often sufficient. Let me think about education on slow positional changes, liberalizing salt to about 8–10 g/day if not contraindicated, ensuring generous fluid intake around 2–2.5 L/day, and using physical counter-maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, and lower-body compression, which are guideline-endorsed and can meaningfully improve symptoms and upright blood pressure [^6da6a20a] [^f1d2a24a] [^e7b43e1f] [^7cfec44e].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of acute water ingestion, because it can be a practical rescue. Drinking about 500 mL of water rapidly can acutely raise standing blood pressure by roughly 30 mmHg for about an hour, which is useful for predictable orthostatic stressors, though I need to ensure this is balanced against volume overload risk in heart failure or renal disease [^c05db5aa] [^957a3f11].

> Now, for pharmacologic therapy, I need to ensure I sequence options by evidence and safety. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, is FDA-approved for symptomatic OH and improves upright blood pressure and symptoms; I should start low and titrate, and remember to avoid dosing within 4 hours of bedtime to mitigate supine hypertension, with typical dosing of 2.5–10 mg three times daily [^702d4d53] [^5165574f].

> Let me consider droxidopa next, especially for neurogenic OH. Droxidopa is a norepinephrine prodrug with orphan indication for nOH and randomized data showing symptom improvement; I should titrate slowly and monitor for supine hypertension and headache, recognizing that long-term durability data are still evolving [^8f62e0dc].

> I should double-check fludrocortisone, because evidence quality is limited. Cochrane suggests very low-certainty evidence for benefit on blood pressure or symptoms, though it remains a reasonable second-line option when midodrine is contraindicated or ineffective; if used, I need to monitor for edema, hypokalemia, and supine hypertension, and pair it with adequate salt and fluid intake to realize volume expansion benefits [^188eeb0a] [^2a7f42fa].

> But wait, what if supine hypertension is a major barrier? Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor that enhances ganglionic neurotransmission, can improve standing blood pressure without worsening supine hypertension in appropriately selected patients with residual baroreflex function; I should confirm that benefits are modest and may be augmented when combined with midodrine in refractory cases [^9285a78d] [^6102624d].

> I need to ensure I address supine hypertension explicitly, because it is common in neurogenic OH and complicates therapy. Nonpharmacologic measures such as head-of-bed elevation by about 10 degrees, avoiding daytime supine rest, and nocturnal short-acting antihypertensives like hydralazine, nifedipine, or nitroglycerin paste can be used selectively, while avoiding fludrocortisone at night and timing midodrine away from bedtime; I should individualize the threshold to treat supine hypertension, often considering intervention when systolic exceeds 160–180 mmHg, balancing fall risk against cardiovascular risk [^372d095d] [^d4d39431] [^bb2f5065].

> Next, I should review how to integrate hypertension management when OH coexists, because this is a frequent clinical dilemma. Initially, I thought intensive blood pressure lowering might worsen OH, but wait, let me verify the data; an individual participant meta-analysis of 29,235 participants showed that more intensive BP treatment reduced cardiovascular events similarly in those with and without baseline OH, and a separate meta-analysis found intensive BP lowering actually reduced the odds of OH, so I should not reflexively de-intensify antihypertensives solely due to OH [^fc6c34a6] [^686e6d70].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical approach to antihypertensives in OH. Guidelines suggest switching agents that worsen OH to alternatives rather than simply de-intensifying, and in patients with asymptomatic OH, targeting SBP less than 130 mmHg remains reasonable given cardiovascular benefit; in symptomatic OH, I should titrate slowly, consider once-daily or bedtime dosing, and prioritize agents less likely to exacerbate orthostasis, such as calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors, while avoiding alpha-blockers and high-dose diuretics when possible [^df9c3efd] [^785d9ae9] [^27741c94].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities to keep patients safe. Home supine and standing blood pressures, periodic 24-hour ambulatory monitoring to detect nocturnal hypertension or nondipping, electrolytes with fludrocortisone, and renal function with volume-expanding strategies are essential; I also need to screen for hypotensive unawareness, especially in Parkinson disease, because silent OH drives falls and may require proactive management even without reported dizziness [^d4d39431] [^7a404a7b].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies, neurogenic OH is common and often severe; I should prioritize OH symptom control over supine hypertension given immediate fall and cognitive risks, using midodrine or droxidopa and reserving short-acting nocturnal antihypertensives for marked supine hypertension. In spinal cord injury, midodrine has the best available evidence and functional electrical stimulation may help. In older adults with frailty, I should emphasize nonpharmacologic measures and start low and go slow with any drugs. And in patients with concomitant heart failure or renal disease, I must balance volume expansion cautiously and monitor closely for edema or electrolyte disturbances [^bb2f5065] [^c5e67018] [^df4ea59c] [^188eeb0a].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should double-check that each step aligns with evidence. Start with education, salt and fluid optimization, and counter-maneuvers; reassess in 2–4 weeks. If symptoms persist, add midodrine or droxidopa depending on etiology and access. If inadequate, consider fludrocortisone or pyridostigmine, or combination therapy. Throughout, manage supine hypertension with nocturnal strategies and avoid bedtime pressors. And if antihypertensives worsen orthostasis, switch classes rather than abandoning BP control, documenting orthostatic vitals at each visit to guide titration [^93fdd9dc] [^c05db5aa] [^df9c3efd].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and tailor to goals of care. Evidence quality varies across agents, with midodrine and droxidopa having the most robust symptomatic data, fludrocortisone evidence limited and low-certainty, and pyridostigmine promising but modest in effect; shared decision-making is crucial, especially when balancing immediate fall risk against longer-term cardiovascular risk from supine hypertension, and I should revisit the plan regularly as comorbidities and function evolve [^188eeb0a] [^9285a78d] [^63f2dd8c].

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) management centers on **nonpharmacologic measures first** [^93fdd9dc] (increased salt and fluid intake, compression garments, slow positional changes, head-of-bed elevation) and **pharmacologic therapy second** (midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine) if symptoms persist [^c0f8722f]. In patients with coexisting hypertension, **continue antihypertensives** unless they worsen OH; if needed, switch to agents less likely to exacerbate OH (e.g. calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) and titrate slowly [^df9c3efd] [^27741c94]. Intensive BP lowering does not increase OH risk and may reduce it, so maintain evidence-based BP targets unless symptomatic [^686e6d70] [^fc6c34a6]. Always address supine hypertension with evening dosing, head-of-bed elevation, and short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime [^372d095d] [^d4d39431].

---

## Nonpharmacologic management

Nonpharmacologic measures are **first-line** and effective for many patients [^93fdd9dc]:

- **Salt and fluid intake**: Increase dietary salt to 8–10 g/day and fluids to 2–2.5 L/day if not contraindicated [^6da6a20a] [^957a3f11].

- **Compression garments**: Abdominal binders or thigh-high stockings reduce venous pooling and improve standing BP [^f1d2a24a] [^e6c4c239].

- **Positional maneuvers**: Rise slowly from supine to seated to standing; use leg crossing, squatting, or bending forward when symptomatic [^f1d2a24a] [^7cfec44e].

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: Elevate the head of bed 10–20° to mitigate nocturnal diuresis and morning OH [^957a3f11].

- **Meal adjustments**: Avoid large carbohydrate-rich meals; consider smaller, frequent meals to reduce postprandial hypotension [^73811396].

---

## Pharmacologic management

Reserve pharmacotherapy for patients with **persistent symptoms despite nonpharmacologic measures**:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Midodrine | Alpha-1 agonist | 2.5–10 mg TID | - Last dose ≥ 4 h before bedtime <br/> - Monitor for supine hypertension [^5165574f] |
| Droxidopa | Norepinephrine precursor | 100–600 mg TID | - Titrate to effect <br/> - Monitor for supine hypertension [^notfound] |
| Fludrocortisone | Mineralocorticoid | 0.1–0.3 mg daily | - Monitor for edema, hypokalemia, supine hypertension [^notfound] |
| Pyridostigmine | Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor | 30–60 mg BID-TID | Useful when supine hypertension is a concern [^9285a78d] |

## Management of orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive patients

Coexisting hypertension complicates management; **balance OH control with BP targets**:

- **Continue antihypertensives**: Do not stop BP meds solely for OH; adjust only if they worsen symptoms [^27741c94] [^df9c3efd].

- **Agent selection**: Prefer calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs; avoid diuretics, alpha-blockers, and high-dose vasodilators when possible [^notfound].

- **Dosing strategy**: Use low doses, titrate slowly, and consider evening dosing to limit daytime OH [^df4ea59c].

- **Intensive BP lowering**: Does not increase OH risk and may reduce it; maintain evidence-based targets unless symptomatic [^686e6d70] [^fc6c34a6].

---

## Management of supine hypertension

Supine hypertension is common in neurogenic OH; **balance risks and benefits**:

- **Evening dosing**: Give antihypertensives at bedtime to reduce nocturnal hypertension [^bb2f5065].

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: Elevate 10–20° to reduce nocturnal BP [^957a3f11].

- **Short-acting agents**: Consider hydralazine, nitroglycerin paste, or nifedipine at bedtime if needed [^bb2f5065].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to **titrate therapy and detect complications**. Monitor home supine and standing BP, watch for supine hypertension, and check electrolytes and renal function with fludrocortisone. Assess falls, syncope, and cognitive symptoms at each visit [^d4d39431].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Higher prevalence of OH; prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and start low, go slow with meds [^6dd4b78e].

- **Neurogenic OH**: Often coexists with supine hypertension; tailor therapy to balance risks [^63f2dd8c].

- **Polypharmacy**: Review and deprescribe offending agents when possible [^c05db5aa].

---

Effective OH management requires a **stepwise approach**, starting with nonpharmacologic measures and adding pharmacotherapy as needed, while carefully balancing coexisting hypertension and supine hypertension. Regular monitoring and individualized care are key to improving symptoms and reducing complications.

Introduction

Hypertension is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Current guidelines, e.g. European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guideline, recommend blood pressure management with a target systolic blood pressure range of 130–139 mm Hg in older adults (≥65 years). The decision to initiate antihypertensive therapy in older adults, and the choice of blood pressure target in this cohort, requires a trade-off between efficacy and safety (e.g. adverse events such as falls). A particularly challenging cohort of hypertensive patients to manage are those with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension affects approximately 20% of adults, with prevalence increasing with age, and is an independent risk factor for injurious falls, as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Given the prevalence of both conditions and the ageing population, the overlap of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is likely to become an increasingly common dilemma for clinicians.

In some randomised controlled trials, individuals with orthostatic hypotension were excluded, either based on clinical history or objective measurement of orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Generalising findings from clinical trials to patients in routine clinical practice requires an understanding of whether such exclusion criteria alter treatment estimates of safety, especially among potentially vulnerable patients.

We sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy with adverse events, such as falls, fracture or syncope differed by exclusion of participants with orthostatic hypotension in randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy.

### Orthostatic hypotension: management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^c0f8722f]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked, disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. We propose a novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH; review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH; discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage; provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision making and patient care; identify current gaps in knowledge and try to define future research directions. Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented highlighting various presentations of OH to provide a practical guide to evaluate and manage patients who have OH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^93fdd9dc]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^573eb384]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope), differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets on falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude patients with orthostatic hypotension, and tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

Results

46 trials were included, of which 18 trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P<0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P=0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P=0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89-1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88-1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction=0.90).

Conclusions

The exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension does not appear to affect the relative risk estimates for falls and syncope in antihypertensive trials.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^6e5b7d6e]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well informed about diagnosis and management of nOH as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial: i.e. patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis, and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards ‘best practice’. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is “…a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table”. In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system that is characterized by failure to provide adequate autonomic postural responses, most prominently systemic vasoconstriction and a compensatory increase in heart rate sufficient to maintain blood pressure. This deficit is, in large part, attributed to insufficient norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. In addition, many patients with nOH also suffer from supine hypertension, which further confounds therapy because pharmacologic treatments to normalize standing blood pressure may worsen supine hypertension. Differences in study designs and endpoints, as well as a paucity of data, preclude achieving definitive evidence-based treatment regimens through a systematic review of trials. To move forward in an effective and safe manner, consensus is required on the basics of screening, diagnosing, and treating patients with nOH. Thus, an expert opinion statement to these basic approaches is needed.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^c7338502]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension from antihypertensive trials did not alter relative effects of treatment, with respect to falls or syncope. However, clinicians should be cognisant when counselling individuals with orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, regarding the potential side-effects of antihypertensive therapy, that trials which excluded those with orthostatic hypotension may under-estimate the absolute risk of adverse effects such as symptomatic hypotension and possibly falls/syncope, as event rates were lower in trials that excluded this population.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^61808494]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^b4ff45ac]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients’ quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, NOH is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope), differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets on falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude patients with orthostatic hypotension, and tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

Results

46 trials were included, of which 18 trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction = 0.90).

Conclusions

The exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension does not appear to affect the relative risk estimates for falls and syncope in antihypertensive trials.

### Morbidity and mortality of orthostatic hypotension: implications for management of cardiovascular disease [^a62823ee]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is the failure of cardiovascular reflexes to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine or sitting position. Although OH may cause symptoms of dizziness or syncope, asymptomatic OH (AOH) is far more common and is an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence of AOH increases with age, the presence of hypertension or diabetes and the use of antihypertensive or other medications. The implications of AOH for the treatment of CVD and hypertension are not well defined. This review provides an overview of the current information on this topic and recommends the more frequent assessment of OH in clinical practice and in future clinical trials.

### The efficacy of nonpharmacologic intervention for orthostatic hypotension associated with aging [^6dd4b78e]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling condition, resulting from a sustained reduction in blood pressure (BP; ≥20 mm Hg systolic or ≥10 mm Hg diastolic) within 3 minutes of standing.Aging is one of the most common causes of neurogenic OH, affecting 7% to 30% of community-dwelling older people.Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacologic therapy as first-line treatment in OH, but older people are typically excluded from research, creating a great deal of clinical uncertainty.Because the older population is expanding rapidly, we can expect a growing demand for evidence in this area.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^df4ea59c]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular interventions

Strong recommendation. Management of orthostatic hypotension should be included as a component of a multidomain intervention (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: 1A.

Strong recommendation. Interventions for cardiovascular disorders identified during assessment for risk of falls should be the same as that for similar conditions when associated with syncope, in addition to other interventions based on the multifactorial falls risk assessment. GRADE 1B.

Recommendation details and justification

Whereas many multidomain fall prevention programmes have included strategies to treat orthostatic hypotension, including modification of possible culprit medications, rehydration, compression garments and medications (e.g. fludrocortisone and midodrine), there are no single intervention studies for orthostatic hypotension in falls prevention. In older adults with hypertension, symptoms may be ameliorated by the judicious use of antihypertensive medications titrated very slowly and with careful monitoring after changing the dose.
For the management of syncope, we advise following local syncope guidelines (e.g. European Cardiac Society Task force on Syncope). Many multifactorial fall prevention programmes that have shown benefit for fall prevention have included strategies to modify orthostatic blood pressure.
The presence of more than one cardiovascular risk factor for falls is not uncommon. Clear causality for a single risk factor may be difficult to establish; therefore, all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be treated.
Interventions for bradycardic disorders (sinus node disease, atrioventricular conduction disorders, vasovagal syndrome and carotid sinus syndrome) and tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia) include modification of culprit medications, specific anti-arrhythmic medication and, in some cases, implantable devices (such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) and are as per local syncope guidelines.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to switch BP-lowering medications worsening orthostatic hypotension to an alternative BP-lowering therapy and do not simply de-intensify therapy for the management of orthostatic hypotension in patients with supine HTN.

### Orthostatic hypotension: epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^a5723d75]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed on the basis of an orthostatic challenge and implies a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age dependent, ranging from 5% in patients <50 years of age to 30% in those >70 years of age. OH may complicate treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries; and substantially reduce quality of life. Despite being largely asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate current challenges and future perspectives.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^f3eceea6]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To date, little published literature is available on a “standardized approach” to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition. The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used, but not approved, for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### Risk of incident fractures in individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^4708515c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Individuals hospitalised due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension have a markedly increased risk of subsequent fractures. This population-based study is the first to provide effect sizes of unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension in terms of incident fracture risk in the population. Our findings suggest that such individuals should be clinically assessed for their syncope aetiology, and preventative measures aimed at fall and fracture risk assessment, and management.

### Orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^27741c94]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Although orthostatic hypotension (OH) has long been recognized as a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, a growing body of literature has identified OH as a common comorbidity of hypertension. This connection is complex, related to pathophysiology in blood pressure regulation and the manner by which OH is derived as the difference between 2 blood pressure measurements. While traditional therapeutic approaches to OH among patients with neurodegenerative disorders focus on increasing upright blood pressure to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, the management of OH among patients with hypertension is more nuanced; resting hypertension is itself associated with adverse outcomes among these patients. Although there is substantial evidence that intensive blood pressure treatment does not cause OH in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, some classes of antihypertensive agents may unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic impairment. Practical steps to manage OH among adults with hypertension start with (1) a thorough characterization of its patterns, triggers, and cause; (2) review and removal of aggravating factors (often pharmacological agents not related to hypertension treatment); (3) optimization of an antihypertensive regimen; and (4) adoption of a tailored treatment strategy that avoids exacerbating hypertension. These strategies include countermaneuvers and short-acting vasoactive agents (midodrine, droxidopa). Ultimately, further research is needed on the epidemiology of OH, the impact of hypertension treatment on OH, approaches to the screening and diagnosis of OH, and OH treatment among adults with hypertension to improve the care of these patients and their complex blood pressure pathophysiology.

### Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension treatment, and cardiovascular disease: an individual participant meta-analysis [^fc6c34a6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are ongoing concerns about the benefits of intensive vs standard blood pressure (BP) treatment among adults with orthostatic hypotension or standing hypotension.

Objective

To determine the effect of a lower BP treatment goal or active therapy vs a standard BP treatment goal or placebo on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality in strata of baseline orthostatic hypotension or baseline standing hypotension.

Data Sources

Individual participant data meta-analysis based on a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases through May 13, 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) with orthostatic hypotension assessments.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual participant data meta-analysis extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Effects were determined using Cox proportional hazard models using a single-stage approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were CVD or all-cause mortality. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg after changing position from sitting to standing. Standing hypotension was defined as a standing systolic BP of 110 mm Hg or less or standing diastolic BP of 60 mm Hg or less.

Results

The 9 trials included 29 235 participants followed up for a median of 4 years (mean age, 69.0 [SD, 10.9] years; 48% women). There were 9% with orthostatic hypotension and 5% with standing hypotension at baseline. More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline orthostatic hypotension (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76-0.86) similarly to those with baseline orthostatic hypotension (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-1.00; P=.68 for interaction of treatment with baseline orthostatic hypotension). More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.85), and nonsignificantly among those with baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75-1.18). Effects did not differ by baseline standing hypotension (P=.16 for interaction of treatment with baseline standing hypotension).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population of hypertension trial participants, intensive therapy reduced risk of CVD or all-cause mortality regardless of orthostatic hypotension without evidence for different effects among those with standing hypotension.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^b8ebd0ec]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive treatment and orthostatic hypotension

Eight trials (n = 59,603) reported orthostatic hypotension, and there were 2,071 orthostatic hypotension events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of orthostatic hypotension in the control group was 3.9% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared to 3.5% in trials which did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value = 0.91) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and orthostatic hypotension was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73–1.18) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90–1.37) (P -interaction = 0.26) (eFigure S4).

Antihypertensive treatment and hypotension

37 trials (n = 202,080) reported hypotension, and there were 12,363 hypotension events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of hypotension in the control group was 1.3% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared to 6.2% in trials which did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value = <0.01) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and hypotension was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.58–2.31) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.42–2.11) (P -interaction = 0.47) (eFigure S5).

### Management of supine hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: scientific statement of the American autonomic society, European federation of autonomic societies, and the European Society of Hypertension [^372d095d]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

: Supine hypertension commonly occurs in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure. Supine hypertension promotes nocturnal sodium excretion and orthostatic hypotension, thus, interfering with quality of life. Perusal of the literature on essential hypertension and smaller scale investigations in autonomic failure patients also suggest that supine hypertension may predispose to cardiovascular and renal disease. These reasons provide a rationale for treating supine hypertension. Yet, treatment of supine hypertension, be it through nonpharmacological or pharmacological approaches, may exacerbate orthostatic hypotension when patients get up during the night. Fall-related complications may occur. More research is needed to define the magnitude of the deleterious effects of supine hypertension on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal morbidity and mortality. Integration of more precise cardiovascular risk assessment, efficacy, and safety data, and the prognosis of the underlying condition causing autonomic failure is required for individualized management recommendations.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^ee1f48ac]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and peripheral neuropathies including amyloid or diabetic neuropathy. Due to the frequency of nOH in the aging population, clinicians need to be well informed about its diagnosis and management. To date, studies of nOH have used different outcome measures and various methods of diagnosis, thereby preventing the generation of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards ‘best practices’ when treating patients with nOH and associated supine hypertension. To address these issues, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation initiated a project to develop a statement of recommendations beginning with a consensus panel meeting in Boston on November 7, 2015, with continued communications and contributions to the recommendations through October of 2016. This paper summarizes the panel members’ discussions held during the initial meeting along with continued deliberations among the panel members and provides essential recommendations based upon best available evidence as well as expert opinion for the (1) screening, (2) diagnosis, (3) treatment of nOH, and (4) diagnosis and treatment of associated supine hypertension.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^a4d9ef98]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a distinctive and treatable sign of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. It is caused by failure of noradrenergic neurotransmission that is associated with a range of primary or secondary autonomic disorders, including pure autonomic failure, Parkinson’s disease with autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy as well as diabetic and nondiabetic autonomic neuropathies. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is commonly accompanied by autonomic dysregulation involving other organ systems such as the bowel and the bladder. In the present review, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, epidemiology, evaluation and management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension focusing on neurodegenerative disorders.

### Orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive adults: harry goldblatt award for early career investigators 2021 [^de879272]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension affects roughly 10% of individuals with hypertension and is associated with several adverse health outcomes, including dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death. Among adults with hypertension, orthostatic hypotension has also been shown to predict patterns of blood pressure dysregulation that may not be appreciated in the office setting, including nocturnal nondipping. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension are at particular risk of orthostatic hypotension and may meet diagnostic criteria for the condition with a smaller relative reduction in blood pressure compared with normotensive individuals. Antihypertensive medications are commonly de-prescribed to address orthostatic hypotension; however, this approach may worsen supine or seated hypertension, which may be an important driver of adverse events in this population. There is significant variability between guidelines for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension with regards to timing and position of blood pressure measurements. Clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension may be missed when standing measurements are delayed or when taken after a seated rather than supine position. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension in patients with hypertension poses a significant management challenge for clinicians; however, recent evidence suggests that intensive blood pressure control may reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension. A detailed characterization of blood pressure variability is essential to tailoring a treatment plan and can be accomplished using both in-office and out-of-office monitoring.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^686e6d70]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

Purpose

To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

5 trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH ( P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

Limitations

Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available.

Conclusion

Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

### New horizons in orthostatic hypotension [^62be593a]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Much of the evidence available is derived from younger populations with chronic neurological disease leading to uncertainty for the diagnosis and management of older people.

Objective

to provide an overview of recent and emerging evidence for the diagnosis, management and prognosis of OH in older persons.

Methods

a narrative review of recent studies, emerging therapies and relevant regulatory updates.

Findings

revisions to the diagnostic criteria for OH include the duration of the blood pressure drop, specific criteria for initial and delayed OH and OH with hypertension. Non-drug therapies remain the first-line treatment option and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment appears to result in lower rates of OH. Recent evidence concerning withdrawal of causative medication is inconsistent. Midodrine has recently become the only licenced medication for OH in the UK. Other emerging treatments include atomoxetine and droxidopa but these require further evaluation. Many other agents may be used but are not supported by high-quality evidence. The increase in mortality associated with OH is less apparent in older people.

Summary

OH remains common in older people, the new diagnostic criteria address some of the previous uncertainty but evidence concerning withdrawal of antihypertensives is conflicting. Midodrine is now the only licenced medication for OH in the UK, but non-drug therapies remain first line and fludrocortisone may be considered before midodrine. We may see other agents such as droxidopa becoming increasingly used over the coming years.

### Management approaches to hypertension in autonomic failure [^eef93c18]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Supine hypertension is a common finding in autonomic failure that can worsen orthostatic hypotension and predispose to end-organ damage. This review focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to manage hypertension in these patients in the face of disabling orthostatic hypotension.

Recent Findings

The hypertension of autonomic failure can be driven by sympathetic-dependent or independent mechanisms, contingent on the site of autonomic lesions. Management of supine hypertension should include simple nonpharmacologic approaches including avoiding the supine position during the daytime and sleeping in a head-up tilt position at night. Most patients, however, require pharmacologic treatment. Several antihypertensive therapies lower nighttime pressure in autonomic failure, but none improve nocturnal volume depletion or morning orthostatic tolerance. Regardless, treatment may still be beneficial in some patients but must be decided on an individual basis. Blood pressure monitoring is helpful in this regard, as well as titration of doses, as these patients are hypersensitive to depressor agents due to loss of baroreceptor reflexes.

Summary

Autonomic failure provides a unique opportunity to study blood pressure regulation independent of autonomic influences. Understanding mechanisms driving supine hypertension will have important implications for the treatment of autonomic failure and will improve our knowledge of cardiovascular regulation in other populations, including essential hypertension and elderly hypertensive individuals with comorbid orthostatic hypotension.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^62c7ea4a]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet under diagnosed disorder. It may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign, and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change. Evidence based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and the therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright position are necessary. OH is defined as fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 min in upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH, or in patients with motor impairment. The management initially consists of education, advice and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions—orthostatic tachycardia is “A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age).” Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is “A drop in systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture.” Initial (immediate) OH is “A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope.” Classic OH is “A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture.” Delayed OH is “A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg that takes ≥3 min of upright posture to develop,” and “The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.” Neurogenic OH is “A subtype of OH that is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and not solely due to environmental triggers (such as dehydration or drugs).”

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: a hidden danger [^7b1e641f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogenous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^f7092669]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can both present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. While not directly responsible for increased mortality, both of these conditions can have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily lives of patients. This negative impact can take the form of both physical symptoms and injury, but also a psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode. Despite these similarities, these are different disorders with fixed damage to the autonomic nerves in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as opposed to a transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" vasovagal syncope. The treatment approaches for both disorders are parallel. The first step is to educate the patient about the pathophysiology and prognosis of their disorder. Next, offending medications should be withdrawn when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be used, both in an effort to prevent the symptoms and to prevent syncope at the onset of presyncope. This is all that is required in many patients with vasovagal syncope. If needed, pharmacological options are also available for both vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, many of which are focused on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or pressor agents to increase vascular tone. There is a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data to support the use of these pharmacological agents. We aim to review the literature on these different therapy choices and to give recommendations on tailored approaches to the treatment of these conditions.

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-PD patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^89c0b04a]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive treatment and all-cause mortality

40 trials (n = 206,463) reported mortality, and there were 21,771 all-cause mortality events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of mortality events in the control group was 11.0% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared to 11.6% in trials which did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value = 0.85) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and hypotension was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83–0.97) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.98) (P -interaction = 0.57) (eFigure S6).

Antihypertensive treatment and original primary outcomes reported in trial

Among 40 trials (n = 229,585), which reported a dichotomous primary outcome, there were 33,882 events during the follow-up. Definitions of primary outcomes varied between trials (eTable S1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and the primary outcome was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77–0.89) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80–0.91) (P -interaction = 0.55) (eFigure S7).

Risk of bias

The risk of bias was assessed for 46 trials (eFigure S8). It was deemed to be ‘low’ in 38 trials, ‘some concerns’ in 7 trials and ‘high risk’ in 1 trial. The randomisation lead to concerns for three trials, missing outcome data, which lead to concerns, for one trial and selection of the reported result for four trials. Publication bias was assessed using contour enhanced funnel plots, which were symmetrical (eFigure S9 a and b).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was fall events. The secondary outcome measures were syncope, fracture, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, all-cause mortality and original primary outcomes of individual trials. The definition of original primary outcomes differed between the individual trials and are outlined in eTable S1.

Data synthesis and analysis

A descriptive analysis of trials and baseline characteristics of participants are reported in Table 1. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome of interest from individual studies. Weighted pooled treatment effects were calculated overall and individually for trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension/symptomatic hypotension, and trials that did not exclude this population, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation to fit a random effects meta-analysis model. Our objective was to determine if there was a difference in risk of adverse events by inclusion/exclusion of this population group. We statistically tested for a difference in treatment effect by testing a P for interaction between trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension/symptomatic hypotension, and those which did not. P for interaction <0.1 was considered evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension (either using an objective blood pressure criterion or a known diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension) and trials that excluded patients with symptomatic hypotension were combined as the rate of orthostatic hypotension in the control group of the latter trials was low (eFigure S1) and, therefore, these criteria likely lead to the exclusion of the majority of participants with orthostatic hypotension, this group are referred to as ‘Excluded OH’ in the results. Risk of bias assessments were performed independently by two reviewers (CR and EL) using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool for randomised controlled trials. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot. Statistical analysis was performed using the Metafor package on R Statistical Software (Version 3.6.1).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^bf8236a8]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia—definitions and haemodynamic patterns—are detailed as follows: Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥20 mmHg and in diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; initial OH is a BP decrease immediately on standing of >40 mmHg with rapid recovery such that the period of hypotension is short (<30 s), and tracings show the nadir at 7–10 s followed by recovery; in autonomic failure (ANF), BP may fall immediately after standing to very low levels after 1 min upright with little heart rate (HR) increase; delayed (progressive) OH is not uncommon in elderly persons, is attributed to age-related impairment of compensatory reflexes and stiffer hearts, is characterized by a slow progressive decrease in systolic BP on assuming erect posture, is differentiated by the absence of a bradycardic reflex but may be followed by reflex bradycardia with a less steep fall in BP in the elderly than in the young; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurs in some patients, mostly young women, with severe orthostatic intolerance but not syncope and very marked HR increases [>30 beats per minute (b.p.m.) or to >120 b.p.m.], is frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, and its underlying pathophysiology remains to be determined.

### A systematic review of the management of orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury [^c5e67018]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review systematically the evidence for the management of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs).

Data Sources

A key word literature search was conducted of original and review articles as well as practice guidelines using Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo, and manual searches of retrieved articles from 1950 to July 2008, to identify literature evaluating the effectiveness of currently used treatments for OH.

Study Selection

Included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, case-control studies, pre-post studies, and case reports that assessed pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for the management of OH in patients with SCI.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers evaluated the quality of each study, using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database score for RCTs and the Downs and Black scale for all other studies. Study results were tabulated and levels of evidence assigned.

Data Synthesis

A total of 8 pharmacologic and 21 nonpharmacologic studies were identified that met the criteria. Of these 26 studies (some include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions), only 1 pharmacologic RCT was identified (low-quality RCT producing level 2 evidence), in which midodrine was found to be effective in the management of OH after SCI. Functional electrical stimulation was one of the only nonpharmacologic interventions with some evidence (level 2) to support its utility.

Conclusions

Although a wide array of physical and pharmacologic measures are recommended for the management of OH in the general population, very few have been evaluated for use in SCI. Further research needs to quantify the efficacy of treatment for OH in subjects with SCI, especially of the many other pharmacologic interventions that have been shown to be effective in non-SCI conditions.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^088a4da6]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance—pathophysiology and symptoms—are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^6f643bea]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure regulation is an automatic, moment-by-moment buffering of the blood pressure in response to physiological changes such as orthostasis, exercise and haemorrhage. This finely orchestrated reflex is called the baroreflex. It is a regulated arc of afferent, central and efferent arms. Multiple physiological changes occur with ageing that can disrupt this reflex, making blood pressure regulation less effective. In addition, multiple changes can occur with ageing-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, atherosclerosis, deconditioning and polypharmacy. These changes commonly result in orthostatic hypotension, hypertension or both, and are consistently associated with multiple adverse outcomes. In this article, we discuss the healthy baroreflex, and physiological and pathophysiological reasons for impaired baroreflex function in older people. We discuss why the common clinical manifestations of orthostatic hypotension and concomitant supine hypertension occur, and strategies for balancing these conflicting priorities. Finally, we discuss strategies for treating them, outlining our practice alongside consensus and expert guidance.

Supine hypertension

Defining supine hypertension in patients with nOH

According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) hypertension guidelines, essential hypertension is a blood pressure consistently ≥140/90 mmHg. Supine hypertension in nOH patients is arbitrarily defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg while in the supine position. General treatment guidelines recommend intervention for hypertension, but supine hypertension associated with nOH requires additional considerations. In patients with autonomic failure causing nOH, supine hypertension is common and part of the underlying disease process since these patients lack the normal blood pressure buffering mechanisms that offset hypertension. In addition, frequent periods of OH may lead to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

A supine systolic blood pressure of up to 160 mmHg should be monitored but does not generally warrant treatment, especially if the symptoms of nOH have improved. The long-term risks associated with supine hypertension need to be balanced with the short-term risks of OH. Expert recommendations for the management of supine hypertension in the setting of nOH suggest that supine hypertension requires intervention if systolic blood pressure exceeds the range of 160–180 mmHg. However, it should be noted that individuals with the largest drops in blood pressure upon standing (>80 mmHg drop) will require significantly higher supine blood pressures in order to achieve a standing position, and therefore permissive supine hypertension may need to be tolerated.

Measuring supine hypertension in patients with nOH

The first step in evaluating supine hypertension in the patient with nOH is obtaining a series of blood pressure measurements. Home supine and standing blood pressures should be obtained. The supine assessment should be in the morning (before arising) and at bedtime with the patient in their normal sleeping position and with the head of the bed raised. If necessary, 24-h blood pressure monitoring may be warranted in some patients. Blood pressure should be monitored for a week or more to establish a pattern of typical blood pressure. Once a baseline has been established and treatment initiated for nOH, regular blood pressure monitoring for a period of 2 weeks following treatment initiation is crucial to gauge the impact of treatment on supine hypertension.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9285a78d]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current pharmacological approaches for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension (OH) may detrimentally affect supine blood pressure (BP). This side effect is often unacceptable and limits the utility of medical management. Pyridostigmine has been proposed as a potential treatment alternative which may improve OH without worsening supine hypertension. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the currently available data regarding the use of pyridostigmine in the treatment of all-cause OH.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and SCOPUS were searched for publications until 4 June 2024. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.

Results

The search returned 715 results, of which 6 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Several studies reported a statistically significant improvement in orthostatic BP following pyridostigmine administration. Two studies found that pyridostigmine had no effect on standing BP among patients with severe autonomic failure. One study suggested that combination therapy with atomoxetine may elicit a synergistic effect. In most studies, pyridostigmine had no significant effect on supine BP. Adverse effects were minimal across the included studies. The pooled results from the meta-analysis showed that while pyridostigmine alone resulted in lower systolic and diastolic orthostatic drop, neither result was statistically significant. However, when pyridostigmine is combined with midodrine, this demonstrated a significant improvement in systolic orthostatic drop.

Conclusions

Pyridostigmine may be useful in the management of OH, particularly in patients with supine hypertension. The standing BP response to pyridostigmine may be greater in patients who have a relatively preserved baroreflex function and sympathetic reserve.

### Fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension [^188eeb0a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) while standing and is the result of a decrease in cardiac output or defective or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that increases blood volume and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is considered the first- or second-line pharmacological therapy for orthostatic hypotension alongside mechanical and positional measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake and venous compression methods. However, there has been no Cochrane Review of the benefits and harms of this drug for this condition.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 11 November 2019: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We also searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies evaluating the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone compared to placebo, another drug for orthostatic hypotension, or studies without comparators, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies. We included studies in people with orthostatic hypotension due to a chronic peripheral neuropathy, a central autonomic neuropathy, or autonomic failure from other causes, but not medication-induced orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension from acute volume depletion or blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methodological procedures for most of the review. We developed and used a tool to prioritize observational studies that offered the best available evidence where there are gaps in the evidence from RCTs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 13 studies of 513 participants, including three cross-over RCTs and 10 observational studies (three cohort studies, six case series and one case-control study). The included RCTs were small (total of 28 participants in RCTs), short term (two to three weeks), only examined fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension in people with two conditions (diabetes and Parkinson disease), and had variable risk of bias (two had unclear risk of bias and one had low risk of bias). Heterogeneity in participant populations, comparators and outcome assessment methods prevented meta-analyses of the RCTs. We found very low-certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone versus placebo on drop in BP in people with diabetes (-26 mmHg versus -39 mmHg systolic; -7 mmHg versus -11 mmHg diastolic; 1 cross-over study, 6 participants). For people with Parkinson disease, we found very-low certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone on drop in BP compared to pyridostigmine (-14 mmHg versus -22.1 mmHg diastolic; P = 0.036; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) and domperidone (no change after treatment in either group; 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). For orthostatic symptoms, we found very low-certainty evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo in people with diabetes (4 out of 5 analyzed participants had improvements in orthostatic symptoms, 1 cross-over study, 6 participants), for fludrocortisone versus pyridostigmine in people with Parkinson disease (orthostatic symptoms unchanged; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) or fludrocortisone versus domperidone (improvement to 6 for both interventions on the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale-Orthostatic Domain (COMPASS-OD); 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). Evidence on adverse events was also very low-certainty in both populations, but indicated side effects were minimal. Observational studies filled some gaps in evidence by examining the effects in larger groups of participants, with more diverse conditions, over longer periods of time. One cohort study (341 people studied retrospectively) found fludrocortisone may not be harmful in the long term for familial dysautonomia. However, it is unclear if this translates to long-term improvements in BP drop or a meaningful improvement in orthostatic symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of fludrocortisone on blood pressure, orthostatic symptoms or adverse events in people with orthostatic hypotension and diabetes or Parkinson disease. There is a lack of information on long-term treatment and treatment of orthostatic hypotension in other disease states. There is a need for standardized reporting of outcomes and for standardization of measurements of blood pressure in orthostatic hypotension.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^627afaa8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies: prioritisation of treatment targets [^63f2dd8c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension are common manifestations of cardiovascular dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Because these disorders are haemodynamic opposites, improvement in one might be achieved at the expense of worsening of the other. Thus, management decisions necessitate assessment of the individual risks for patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. Whereas neurogenic orthostatic hypotension poses risks for falls and can be associated with cognitive impairment in the short term, chronic supine hypertension can be associated with stroke and myocardial infarction in the long term. Because few clinical trial data exist for outcomes in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, clinicians need to balance, on the basis of comorbidities and disease staging, the potential immediate benefits of treatment for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and the long-term risks of supine hypertension treatment in each patient. Future research needs to focus on ascertaining a safe degree of supine hypertension when treating neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; the effectiveness of nocturnal antihypertensive therapy in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension; and the prevalence, scope, and therapeutic requirements for managing neurogenic orthostatic hypotension that manifests with falls or cognitive impairment, but without postural lightheadedness or near syncope.

Abstract

Background

Current pharmacological approaches for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension (OH) may detrimentally affect supine blood pressure (BP). This side effect is often unacceptable and limits the utility of medical management. Pyridostigmine has been proposed as a potential treatment alternative which may improve OH without worsening supine hypertension. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the currently available data regarding the use of pyridostigmine in the treatment of all-cause OH.

Conclusions

Pyridostigmine may be useful in the management of OH, particularly in patients with supine hypertension. The standing BP response to pyridostigmine may be greater in patients who have a relatively preserved baroreflex function and sympathetic reserve.

Orthostatic syndromes—diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥20 mm Hg (or ≥30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥10 mm Hg that takes ≥3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7420d6a]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The collective evidence from six studies suggests that pyridostigmine can be an effective and safe option for certain patients with OH, particularly in patients with neurogenic OH. In most cases, pyridostigmine improved standing BP without significantly increasing supine BP. While methodological limitations in some studies call for further research, the overall findings support the consideration of pyridostigmine in appropriately selected patients. Future studies should focus on larger, well-designed trials to further validate these findings and explore the long-term benefits (>3 months) and safety of pyridostigmine, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.

### Orthostatic hypotension, cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events: results from SPRINT [^b09bd692]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is frequently observed with hypertension treatment, but its contribution to adverse outcomes is unknown. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized trial of adults, age ≥50 years at high risk for cardiovascular disease with a seated systolic blood pressure (BP) of 130 to 180 mm Hg and a standing systolic BP ≥110 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to a systolic BP treatment goal of either <120 or <140 mm Hg. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥20 or diastolic BP ≥10 mm Hg 1 minute after standing from a seated position. We used Cox models to examine the association of OH with cardiovascular disease or adverse study events by randomized BP goal. During the follow-up period (median 3years), there were 1170 (5.7%) instances of OH among those assigned a standard BP goal and 1057 (5.0%) among those assigned the intensive BP goal. OH was not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome: hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78-1.44]). Moreover, OH was not associated with syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, or acute renal failure. OH was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits (hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.11-2.82]) and bradycardia (hazard ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19-3.15]), but these associations did not differ by BP treatment goal. OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and BP treatment goal had no effect on OH's association with hypotension and bradycardia. Symptomless OH during hypertension treatment should not be viewed as a reason to down-titrate therapy even in the setting of a lower BP goal.

Active standing—recommendations and diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension state that manual intermittent determination with sphygmomanometer of blood pressure (BP) supine and during active standing for 3 min is indicated as initial evaluation when orthostatic hypotension (OH) is suspected (I B), while continuous beat‑to‑beat non‑invasive pressure measurement may be helpful in cases of doubt (IIb C); the test is diagnostic when there is a symptomatic fall in systolic BP from a baseline value ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg, or a decrease in systolic BP to <90 mmHg (I C), and the test should be considered diagnostic when there is an asymptomatic fall in systolic BP from baseline value ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg, or a decrease in systolic BP to <90 mmHg (IIa C).

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0d4fa08]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The systematic search of articles published between 14 April 2020 and 26 May 2022 identified 2,042 records. Following title and abstract screening, 14 were considered potentially relevant. After the application of eligibility criteria to full text review of studies included in the prior meta-analysis by Albrasi et al. and potentially relevant studies identified in the updated search, 46 trials (n = 233,357) were included (eFigure S2). The 46 trials had a mean follow-up duration of 34.9 months, and included 18 trials (n = 97,976) that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials (n = 135,381) that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension. Characteristics of trials and participants by OH exclusion categories are outlined in Table 1. There was no difference in the mean age of participants by OH exclusion categories. The baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were similar in both groups. Characteristics of individual trials are outlined in Table 2.

Antihypertensive treatment and falls events

13 trials (n = 94,222) reported falls, and there were 3,002 falls events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of falls in the control group was 4.8% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared with 8.8% in trials which did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value = 0.40) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and falls was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89–1.13) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88–1.18) (P -interaction = 0.90) (Figure 2).

### Management of hypertension in the setting of autonomic failure: a pathophysiological approach [^b524ea47]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We discuss 2 cases presenting clinically with disabling orthostatic hypotension and severe supine hypertension. This is a common presentation of autonomic failure, and one that challenges conventional treatment. Clinical findings of isolated autonomic failure were the most prominent manifestation in case 1, whereas a movement disorder was the key finding in case 2. The differential diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension is discussed from a pathophysiological approach. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disorders of the autonomic nervous system is fundamental for an effective management of these patients and provides insight into more common disorders such as essential hypertension.

### Hypotensive unawareness in Parkinson's disease-related autonomic dysfunction [^7a404a7b]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

This case demonstrates how orthostatic hypotension in the absence of typical symptoms of light-headedness/dizziness when changing posture, can contribute to the burden of falls in Parkinson's disease. At least one-third of people with severe orthostatic hypotension do not report typical symptoms, and this figure appears to be higher in patients with Parkinson's disease. This is important clinically as it can increase the difficulty in ascribing falls to orthostatic hypotension, especially given the other competing reasons in Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension symptoms can act as a prompt for the patient to act to prevent falls-related injuries. There is a clinical requirement, therefore, to screen for and manage orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease to prevent falls, even in those who do not report typical symptoms.

### The treatment of primary orthostatic hypotension [^73811396]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies used to treat primary orthostatic hypotension (OH).

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching hypotension, non-pharmacological therapy, midodrine, droxidopa, pyridostigmine, fludrocortisone, atomoxetine, pseudoephedrine, and octreotide was performed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case series, or case reports written in English between January 1970 and November 2016 that assessed primary OH treatment in adult patients were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Based on the chosen criteria, it was found that OH patients make up approximately 15% of all syncope patients, predominantly as a result of cardiovascular or neurological insults, or offending medication. Nonpharmacological strategies are the primary treatment, such as discontinuing offending medications, switching medication administration to bedtime, avoiding large carbohydrate-rich meals, limiting alcohol, maintaining adequate hydration, adding salt to diet, and so on. If these fail, pharmacotherapy can help ameliorate symptoms, including midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, atomoxetine, sympathomimetic agents, and octreotide.

Conclusions

Midodrine and droxidopa possess the most evidence with respect to increasing blood pressure and alleviating symptoms. Pyridostigmine and fludrocortisone can be used in patients who fail to respond to these agents. Emerging evidence with low-dose atomoxetine is promising, especially in those with central autonomic failure, and may prove to be a viable alternative treatment option. Data surrounding other therapies such as sympathomimetic agents or octreotide are minimal. Medication management of primary OH should be guided by patient-specific factors, such as tolerability, adverse effects, and drug-drug and drug-disease interactions.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^8f62e0dc]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations for initiating nOH treatment

There have been no head-to-head comparison studies to guide the initial choice of nOH treatments. An individualized treatment regimen should consider severity, co-morbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals. Midodrine has an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of symptomatic OH; FDA approval was based on studies showing an improvement in upright blood pressure as a surrogate for symptom relief. In contrast, the FDA-approved droxidopa with an orphan designation for the treatment of nOH based on studies showing improvement in symptoms of nOH. Patients receiving droxidopa reported a decrease in dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling as if they might black out compared with those receiving placebo. There have been no long-term studies on the durability of the treatment effect for either midodrine or droxidopa. However, a long-term study is underway to study durability of effectiveness with droxidopa (NCT02586623) in patients with nOH for up to 36 weeks of treatment.

Recommendations for changing nOH treatment

Once initial therapy has begun, symptomatic benefit, including impact on activities of daily living, and changes in blood pressure need to be assessed frequently. If symptoms do not improve after reaching maximum labeled dose, it is recommended that the treatment be changed and symptomatic benefit be assessed once more. This process is iterative until either symptomatic benefit is achieved or maximum tolerable dose of the therapy is reached.

Treating nOH—step 4: combination pharmacotherapy

Little data exists to determine efficacy and safety of different combinations of therapy compared to monotherapy for nOH. Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to appropriately titrate to maximum tolerable dose of a single agent and then, if symptomatic benefit is not obtained, consider switching to a different therapy or adding a second agent and titrate from its lowest starting dose.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^bb2f5065]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

In most patients with nOH, there are strong reasons for prioritizing the treatment of nOH over supine hypertension. Symptomatic nOH carries a variety of debilitating symptoms including postural related dizziness, syncope, fatigue, weakness, and vision impairment. All of these symptoms can contribute to an increase in the occurrence of falls, which is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission for PD patients. Falls due to nOH can lead to numerous complications that can result in death. However, there is no agreement among clinicians, when, or how vigorously supine hypertension should be treated with nOH and there is no clinical study evidence to base guidelines. At the very minimum, all patients with nOH and supine hypertension should be advised to avoid supine posture during the day and elevate the head of the bed as tolerated during the night. Clinicians should manage patients with significant supine hypertension with short-acting antihypertensive agents given at bedtime and avoid fludrocortisone. Since patients with MSA have a short life expectancy and experience rapid deterioration of motor abilities, enhancement of quality of life should take precedent and nOH should be aggressively treated to allow for improved mobility in these patients. However, once an MSA patient becomes wheelchair bound there may be less urgency to treating nOH. In patients with PD and PAF the decision to prioritize the treatment of nOH over supine hypertension should be individualized. If supine hypertension can be treated without worsening nOH, the clinician should consider using short-acting agents at night. Lastly, those few patients who have episodes of seated hypertension during the day should be referred to specialized centers.

### Midodrine for orthostatic hypotension and recurrent reflex syncope: a systematic review [^14147553]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (SOH) and recurrent reflex syncope (RRS) can be disabling. Midodrine has been proposed in the management of patients with these conditions but its impact on patient important outcomes remains uncertain. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midodrine in patients with SOH and RRS.

Methods

We searched multiple electronic databases without language restriction from their inception to June 2013. We included randomized controlled trials of patients with SOH or RRS that compared treatment with midodrine against a control and reported data on patient important outcomes. We graded the quality of evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Results

Eleven trials involving 593 patients were included in this review. Three studies addressed health-related quality of life in patients with RRS, showing improvement with midodrine: risk difference 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.5 to 31.6), very low confidence. Seven studies addressed symptom improvement and provided poolable data showing improvement with midodrine in patients with SOH: risk difference 32.8% (95% CI 13.5-48), low confidence; and RRS: risk difference 63.3% (95% CI 47.6-68.2), very low confidence. Five studies reported syncope recurrence in patients with RRS showing improvement with midodrine: risk difference 37% (95% CI 20.8%-47.4%), moderate confidence. The most frequent side effects in the midodrine arm were pilomotor reactions (33.6%, risk ratio 4.58 [95% CI 2.03-10.37]).

Conclusions

Evidence warranting low/moderate confidence suggests that midodrine improves clinical important outcomes in patients with SOH and RRS.

Orthostatic hypotension—pathophysiology and presentation are summarized as excessive venous pooling with impaired compensatory responses and characteristic upright-position syncope. OH involves excessive pooling of blood volume in the splanchnic and leg circulations, causing decreased venous return and cardiac output on standing. In neurogenic OH, vasoconstrictor mechanisms may be inadequate due to neurodegenerative disorders or autonomic peripheral neuropathies. Neurogenic OH may present clinically as classic or delayed OH, and most commonly OH is due to dehydration or medications such as diuretics and vasodilators, with syncope from OH occurring in the upright position.

### Orthostatic hypotension in pancreatic cancer [^b6261129]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a relatively common medical diagnosis and can be debilitating for the patients it affects. There is a range of treatment options, though only one medication is licensed in the UK for treatment of orthostatic hypotension.We review the case of a man in his 70s with pancreatic cancer who developed orthostatic hypotension towards the latter stage of his disease that caused severe dizziness, impacting his quality of life. Multiple factors contributed to his orthostatic hypotension and various treatments, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological, were trialled, with varying degrees of success, to alleviate his symptoms and improve his quality of life. On reviewing his case, we identify that the medication options have different optimal scenarios in which they are effective.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc66769c]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a disabling chronic condition and can be defined as a reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mm Hg or a reduction in diastolic BP (DBP) of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing. OH can result from both neurogenic aetiologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases and peripheral neuropathy, and non-neurogenic causes, such as cardiovascular disease, medication use and volume depletion.Patients with OH are more likely to develop syncopal episodes and falls, leading to functional impairment, frequent hospitalisations and diminished quality of life.Elderly patients with OH are also at a higher risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia and are at a greater risk of death by vascular causes.

However, treating OH can be challenging. Aggressive pharmacological treatment methods may worsen supine hypertension.Therapeutic goals of treatment focus on improving functional status and postural symptoms, rather than prioritising upright normotension.Treatment strategies are centred on behavioural adaptations, increasing BP by raising plasma volume or administering vasoactive agents. While midodrine and fludrocortisone are currently used in the treatment of OH, these medications come at the price of worsening supine hypertension.

Therefore, there is a clinical need to determine alternative treatment options which improve OH without increasing supine BP. Even patients with progressive neurodegenerative disorders may have residual sympathetic tone, which can be harnessed using pharmacological therapies.While pyridostigmine has been approved for the treatment of myasthenia gravis and underactive bladder, it has also been used off-label for treating OH. Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor which improves ganglionic neurotransmission in the sympathetic baroreflex pathway.As this pathway is mainly activated under orthostatic stress, pyridostigmine may be able to raise standing BP without impacting supine BP.

In this report, we aimed to evaluate the currently available data regarding the use of pyridostigmine in the treatment of all-cause OH. In doing so, we aimed to provide clinicians with synthesised evidence for the use of pyridostigmine in the management of OH.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) epidemiology and treatment intensity—OH affects an estimated 7% to 10% of community-dwelling adults with hypertension, and institutionalized older adults (age ≥65 years) have a much higher prevalence; despite concerns about intensive BP treatment, evidence from randomized clinical trials demonstrates no association between OH and intensive BP treatment using first-line antihypertensive medication classes; because antihypertensive agents may sometimes unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic or other impairment, thoughtful assessment is warranted.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance syndromes—education, volume expansion, and physical measures: Education regarding the nature of the condition with lifestyle advice can improve symptoms even when the rise in blood pressure is relatively small (10–15 mmHg). In the absence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to take sufficient salt and water intake, targeting 2–3 L of fluids per day and 10 g of NaCl. Sleeping with the head elevated (10°) prevents nocturnal polyuria, maintains a more favourable distribution of body fluids, and ameliorates nocturnal hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings may be helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns and may also help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension. Rapid cold water ingestion is reported to be effective in combating orthostatic intolerance and post-prandial hypotension. Gravitational venous pooling in older patients can be treated with abdominal binders or compression stockings, and PCMs such as leg crossing and squatting should be encouraged in patients with warning symptoms able to perform them.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH and a more complete evaluation including orthostatic vital signs needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10 “Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 min of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?” Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.
