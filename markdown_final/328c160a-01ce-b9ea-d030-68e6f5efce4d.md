## Question

A 52-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of epigastric pain and intermittent nausea. He has no significant past medical history and is not taking any medications. He denies weight loss or gastrointestinal bleeding. An upper endoscopy is performed, revealing a single 1.5 cm ulcer with clean margins in the gastric antrum and a 0.5 cm ulcer in the first part of the duodenum. Both ulcers appear benign on endoscopic inspection. The endoscopist is considering whether to take biopsies from these lesions.

Based on current ASGE guidelines, what is the most appropriate approach regarding biopsy of the gastric and duodenal ulcers found in this patient? Justify your answer according to the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to biopsy a benign-appearing gastric antral ulcer and a benign-appearing duodenal bulb ulcer in a 52-year-old man with dyspepsia, and how to justify that decision according to current ASGE guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the malignancy risk of gastric ulcers and the ASGE stance on biopsy. Then, I should verify the malignancy risk of duodenal ulcers and whether routine biopsy is recommended. Next, I will consider patient-specific risk modifiers such as age, NSAID use, and ulcer size. After that, I need to check the appropriate biopsy technique if biopsy is pursued. Finally, I will integrate H. pylori testing and surveillance considerations to synthesize a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the core principle for gastric ulcers: ASGE advises that most gastric ulcers should be biopsied because malignant gastric ulcers can appear endoscopically benign, and missing cancer is a key risk we want to mitigate, even when the visual impression is reassuring [^c2c76035] [^5755ec27].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance before jumping to conclusions: ASGE also allows individualized decisions in very low-risk scenarios, such as young patients with multiple benign-appearing ulcers in the setting of NSAID use, but that exception does not fit this case given the patient's age of 52 and a solitary gastric ulcer, so I should not rely on that exception here [^c2c76035] [^8eaf63ab].

> I should confirm the malignancy risk context: gastric cancer risk rises with age and is nontrivial in the sixth decade, and endoscopic features alone cannot reliably exclude malignancy, which reinforces the default to biopsy for gastric ulcers in this age group rather than relying on appearance alone [^c2c76035] [^5755ec27].

> Next, I will examine duodenal ulcers: ASGE explicitly recommends against routine biopsy of duodenal ulcers because they are extremely unlikely to be malignant, so I should not biopsy the duodenal ulcer in this scenario unless there are atypical features or refractory disease suggesting an alternative diagnosis [^591b7ab4] [^8eaf63ab].

> Hold on, I should verify the H. pylori testing plan because it influences biopsy strategy: even if I biopsy the gastric ulcer for histology, I still need to test for H. pylori, and the most efficient approach is to obtain gastric biopsies for a rapid urease test and/or histology from nonulcer sites (antrum and body) using a standardized protocol, while also sending ulcer biopsies for histology to exclude malignancy and to assess for H. pylori if present [^14699c5c] [^12dc3f6c] [^5755ec27].

> Let me think about technique and specimen handling: if I biopsy the gastric ulcer, I should obtain multiple samples from the base and edges to maximize yield for malignancy and H. pylori, and I should document the number and location of biopsies clearly in the report to support quality and follow-up planning [^5755ec27] [^843f6a49].

> I should double-check surveillance implications: if the gastric ulcer is not biopsied at index endoscopy, ASGE supports considering surveillance endoscopy, but given the malignancy risk here, it is preferable to biopsy now rather than defer and rely on surveillance, which aligns with best practice advice to individualize but default to biopsy in moderate-risk patients [^5ec308b6] [^8eaf63ab].

> But wait, what if the ulcers are refractory or atypical? Persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy would prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis and endoscopic reassessment, and in that context, targeted biopsies could be reconsidered, but that is not the current situation here [^e881adda] [^a7f1b04a].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to biopsy the gastric antral ulcer with multiple samples from base and edge and to obtain separate gastric biopsies for H. pylori testing from antrum and body, while avoiding routine biopsy of the duodenal ulcer given its benign appearance and the very low malignancy risk of duodenal ulcers, and I should clearly document the biopsy sites and rationale in the procedure report [^c2c76035] [^5755ec27] [^14699c5c] [^591b7ab4] [^843f6a49].

Biopsy the **gastric ulcer** because even benign-appearing gastric ulcers can harbor malignancy [^c2c76035], and ASGE recommends biopsy for most gastric ulcers [^8eaf63ab]. Do not biopsy the **duodenal ulcer** [^591b7ab4] because duodenal ulcers are rarely malignant [^8eaf63ab] and routine biopsy is not indicated unless the appearance is atypical or the ulcer is refractory [^e881adda]. This approach balances cancer detection for the stomach with avoidance of unnecessary procedures for the duodenum [^8eaf63ab].

---

## Indications for biopsy in gastric ulcers

- **Malignancy risk**: Gastric ulcers can be malignant even when they appear benign endoscopically [^c2c76035]; ASGE recommends biopsy for most gastric ulcers to exclude cancer [^8eaf63ab].

- **Age and risk factors**: In patients ≥ 50 years, the risk of gastric cancer is higher; biopsy is prudent even without alarm features [^notfound].

- **Biopsy technique**: If biopsied, obtain multiple samples from the base and edges [^5755ec27] to maximize diagnostic yield [^8eaf63ab].

---

## Indications for biopsy in duodenal ulcers

- **Low malignancy risk**: Duodenal ulcers are rarely malignant; ASGE advises against routine biopsy of duodenal ulcers [^591b7ab4] [^8eaf63ab].

- **Exceptions**: Biopsy is considered if the ulcer is atypical, refractory, or suspicious for alternative diagnoses (e.g. Crohn's, malignancy) [^e881adda] [^59d449c4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Ulcer location** | **Biopsy recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastric ulcer (antrum, 1.5 cm) | Yes | - Malignancy risk <br/> - ASGE recommends biopsy [^c2c76035] [^8eaf63ab] |
| Duodenal ulcer (first part, 0.5 cm) | No | - Rarely malignant <br/> - Routine biopsy not indicated [^591b7ab4] [^8eaf63ab] |

---

## Clinical implications and follow-up

- **Gastric ulcer**: Biopsy results guide management; if malignant, oncologic evaluation is indicated; if benign, treat and consider repeat endoscopy to confirm healing [^5ec308b6].

- **Duodenal ulcer**: Manage medically without biopsy; ensure H. pylori testing and eradication if positive [^e3ca851f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Biopsy the **gastric ulcer** to exclude malignancy [^c2c76035] [^8eaf63ab], and do not biopsy the **duodenal ulcer** unless atypical or refractory [^591b7ab4] [^e881adda]. This aligns with ASGE guidance and balances diagnostic yield with procedural risk.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^fbe300a6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

An immediate or delayed biopsy is recommended (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)

A refractory bleeding peptic ulcer is defined as an ulcer still bleeding after repeated endoscopy/angioembolization. Open surgery is recommended when endoscopic treatments have failed and there is evidence of ongoing bleeding, plus or minus hemodynamic instability. The choice of the appropriate surgical procedure for bleeding peptic ulcer should be made on the basis of the location and extension of the ulcer and the characteristics of the bleeding vessel. Surgical approach involves ulcer oversew or resection. Bleeding gastric ulcers should be resected or at least biopsied for the possibility of neoplasms. Conversely, most duodenal ulcers requiring surgery for persistent bleeding are usually large and posterior lesions, and the bleeding is often from the gastro-duodenal artery. A recent prospective cohort study conducted in Denmark compared the outcomes of duodenal and gastric bleeding peptic ulcers and found a significantly higher 90-day mortality and reoperation rate for the duodenal location, confirming the greater complexity of surgical management of this ulcer. Via duodenotomy, the bleeding vessel can be seen on the floor of the ulcer and can be rapidly oversewn. It is critical to perform triple-loop suturing of bleeding of the GDA due to the collateral blood supply to the transverse pancreatic arteries. The surgeon may not know preoperatively where the bleeding originates and intraoperative endoscopic guidance may be helpful. For patients with intractable ulcer bleeding, Schroeder et al. from the analysis of a large database (ACS-NSQIP) have found that the surgical procedure of vagotomy/drainage is associated with significantly lower mortality than simply simple local ulcer oversew. They further suggest that vagotomy/drainage is preferred to local procedures alone for the surgical management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease requiring emergency operation for intractable bleeding ulcers.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the role of damage control surgery?

We suggest considering damage control surgery for patients with hemorrhagic shock and signs of severe physiological derangement, in order to quickly resolve the bleeding and allow a prompt ICU admission (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Indications for damage control surgery in bleeding peptic ulcer are similar to those for perforated peptic ulcer and are reported in the WSES guidelines on Open Abdomen management in non-trauma patients.

AGA upper gastrointestinal biopsy for dyspepsia — scope and definitions — presents recommendations on the role of biopsy to evaluate dyspepsia in the absence of mucosal lesions, focusing on adult patients (ie, older than 18 years of age) undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for dyspepsia as the sole indication, with dyspepsia defined by Rome III as 1 or more of bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning, and assuming no prior treatment for Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. For normal-appearing mucosa, it notes that currently there are no clinical standards or guidelines for performing such biopsies, and that endoscopic biopsy was assumed to be associated with a negligible rate of complications. The guideline uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and was developed based primarily on Western populations, acknowledging that certain non-Western populations might warrant a risk-tailored management approach.

Practice points — post-treatment assessment in pediatric Helicobacter pylori: The relief of symptoms is not an indicator for successful treatment; therefore, all children treated for H pylori should be assessed for treatment success with a reliable test. Endoscopy and biopsy-based tests to confirm eradication are rarely needed in pediatric patients with uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease, and gastric and duodenal peptic ulcers have a low risk for relapse with clearance of the infection.

During endoscopy, additional biopsies for diagnosis of H. pylori infection should only be taken if treatment is likely to be offered if infection is confirmed.

### Patient information: peptic ulcer disease… [^e3ca851f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Voelker R. Peptic Ulcer Disease. JAMA. 2025; 333:

917. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.27195 A peptic ulcer is a break in the lining of the lower esophagus, stomach, or upper small intestine. The 2 most common types of peptic ulcers are gastric ulcers, which occur in the stomach, and duodenal ulcers, which occur in the upper part of the small intestine. About 1% of the US population has peptic ulcer disease, and an estimated 10 000 people in the US die of peptic ulcer disease each year.

1. Infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori causes about 42% of peptic ulcers, although only 10% of people with H pylori develop a peptic ulcer. About 36% of peptic ulcers are associated with use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin or ketorolac.

In addition, cigarette smoking, psychological stress, family history of peptic ulcer disease, and adverse childhood circumstances such as crowded living conditions and poor water quality can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Some people with peptic ulcer disease have no symptoms, but about 81% of people with peptic ulcers have upper abdominal pain or discomfort, called dyspepsia. With duodenal ulcers, the abdominal pain may improve immediately after eating but typically worsens 2 to 3 hours later. Heartburn or acid regurgitation occurs in about 46% of people with peptic ulcers, and 29% have bleeding ulcers. Complications of peptic ulcer disease include gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to vomiting blood; obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the stomach and causes abdominal pain, bloating, and recurrent vomiting; and ulcer perforation, which causes sudden, severe pain and can lead to shock and death if not treated with emergency surgery.

Peptic ulcer disease is diagnosed through a procedure called endoscopy, which involves insertion of a long, thin instrument with a light and a camera through a patient's mouth into the stomach and upper small intestine. This procedure allows clinicians to see the ulcer, apply topical treatments if the ulcer is bleeding, and take tissue samples to test for H pylori infection. All patients with peptic ulcer disease should receive H pylori testing with either a stool antigen test or a urea breath test. The primary treatment for peptic ulcer disease is use of a proton pump inhibitor drug such as omeprazole or lansoprazole to decrease stomach acid and allow the lining of the stomach or duodenum to heal. Most ulcers heal within 4 weeks, but those larger than 2 cm may take 8 weeks to resolve. Antacids are appropriate only for temporary symptom relief.

Patients with H pylori infection should receive a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, and up to 3 antibiotics, which are selected based on patterns of H pylori resistance in the local area. For patients who develop a peptic ulcer due to use of an NSAID, stopping that medication leads to healing of ulcers in 95% of cases. For individuals with peptic ulcer disease who need to continue taking an NSAID, options to reduce their ulcer risk include switching from an oral to a topical NSAID, using a different type of NSAID, or adding a proton pump inhibitor.

Practice points add that H pylori, when detected in erosions/ulcers, "is a chronic active condition" and "Eradication of infection prevents ulcer recurrence", that during endoscopy "biopsies… should be taken to identify the presence of H pylori infection", that "Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) monotherapy may be continued after eradication therapy for another 2 to 4 weeks in patients with PUD", and that "monitoring the success of therapy is mandatory… 4 to 6 weeks after stopping antibiotics and at least 2 weeks after stopping PPI therapy", with "rescue therapy as outlined in Table 5" if eradication fails.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of benign and malignant gastroduodenal obstruction [^bc873a98]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) — definition, presentation, causes, and epidemiology — occurs as a result of a narrowing in the gastroduodenum leading to failed or delayed passage of gastric contents and typically presents with early satiety, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The most common malignant causes are pancreatic, gastric, and duodenal cancer, and the worldwide incidence and mortality of gastric cancer is higher than pancreatic cancer. In the United States, pancreatic and gastric cancers are the 11th and 16th most common newly presenting cancers, and pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death. GOO occurs in approximately 20% of cases of advanced pancreatic cancer, with more than 11,000 pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed with GOO in 2019. The most common benign etiology is peptic ulcer disease from either nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or H pylori infection.

### Coeliac disease: to biopsy or not? [^3015877e]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Coeliac disease is increasingly recognized as a global problem in both children and adults. Traditionally, the findings of characteristic changes of villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis identified in duodenal biopsy samples taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy have been required for diagnosis. Although biopsies remain advised as necessary for the diagnosis of coeliac disease in adults, European guidelines for children provide a biopsy-sparing diagnostic pathway. This approach has been enabled by the high specificity and sensitivity of serological testing. However, these guidelines are not universally accepted. In this Perspective, we discuss the pros and cons of a biopsy-avoiding pathway for the diagnosis of coeliac disease, especially in this current era of the call for more biopsies, even from the duodenal bulb, in the diagnosis of coeliac disease. In addition, a contrast between paediatric and adult guidelines is presented.

### Quality standards in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: a position statement of the British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and association of upper gastrointestinal surgeons of great britain and Ireland (AUGIS) [^26471b5f]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Where iron deficiency anaemia is being investigated, separate biopsies from the gastric antrum and body should be taken, as well as duodenal biopsies if coeliac serology is positive or has not been previously measured.

Level of agreement: 80%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: weak

Iron deficiency anaemia has been found to be associated with gastric atrophy. We suggest biopsies are taken from the gastric antrum and body to confirm this diagnosis and avoid further unnecessary investigations. Biopsies from the duodenum should also be taken if coeliac serology is positive or has not been measured before an OGD performed for iron deficiency anaemia.

Where gastric or duodenal ulcers are identified, H. pylori should be tested and eradicated if positive.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: moderate

Strength of recommendation: strong

Where gastric or duodenal ulcers are observed, H. pylori should be excluded by a rapid urease test or gastric biopsies. Medication history should be reviewed to exclude contributory pharmacological agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There is no role for the surveillance of duodenal ulcers, with repeat OGD having a low diagnostic yield.

The presence of gastric polyps should be recorded, with the number, size, location and morphology described, and representative biopsies taken.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: moderate

Strength of recommendation: strong

The presence, number and size of any detected gastric polyps should be documented. It is recommended that the actual number of polyps is recorded where there are five or less; however, it is acceptable where there are more than five to use the description of multiple polyps. All atypical polyps should be described. The majority of gastric polyps are accounted for by fundic gland and hyperplastic polyps. Although fundic gland polyps can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on endoscopic appearances, biopsies are recommended to confirm the histological diagnosis and exclude dysplasia. A single biopsy of a polyp is usually sufficient, with this approach having been found to be as accurate as polypectomy in 97.3% of cases. Repeat biopsies of a previously diagnosed benign gastric polyps are not indicated. Where there are multiple polyps, representative biopsies should be taken, as it is known that coexisting polyps are usually of the same histological type. Premalignant polyps should undergo surveillance in accordance with existing guidelines, while some dysplastic polyps should be considered for removal.

### AGA clinical practice update on high-quality upper endoscopy: expert review [^843f6a49]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Standardized terminology and biopsy protocols — Best Practice Advice 7 states that standardized terminology and classification systems should be used when documenting endoscopic findings, with examples including the Los Angeles classification for erosive esophagitis, Prague classification for Barrett's esophagus, Forrest classification for bleeding peptic ulcers, Paris classification for superficial neoplastic lesions, Hill grade classification for gastroesophageal flap valve, and the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score; the endoscopist should clearly document the number of biopsy specimens and the location of the biopsy specimens in the procedure report. For iron-deficiency anemia, the recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline suggested that the initial evaluation for celiac disease in patients with iron-deficiency anemia should be via serologic testing, with duodenal biopsy specimens reserved only for those who have positive serologies; nevertheless, if endoscopy shows findings suggestive of celiac disease, biopsy specimens should be taken. Gastric biopsy specimens for H pylori and atrophic gastritis in patients with iron-deficiency anemia are no longer routinely recommended in the absence of endoscopic findings; however, in the appropriate clinical scenario, such as a family history of gastric cancer, gastric biopsy specimens still may have a role, and the American Gastroenterological Association suggests noninvasive nonendoscopic H pylori testing (eg, stool antigen) because there are no noninvasive tests with acceptable test performance for the diagnosis of gastric preneoplasia or neoplasia that are routinely available in the United States for clinical use.

### Evaluation of epigastric discomfort and management… [^36ba95df]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The procedure of choice for the evaluation of dyspepsia is endoscopy. If a radiologist with special training in gastrointestinal radiology is available, multiphase barium upper gastrointestinal studies are an acceptable alternative. When a patient presents with dyspepsia, the physician should be alert for "alarm features" that may signal the presence of an underlying disease that requires urgent endoscopic evaluation and treatment. The ICSI suggests performance of endoscopy within one day if a patient with dyspepsia has melena, hematemesis, or acute-onset dysphagia, and within seven to 10 days if the patient has anemia, persistent vomiting, or involuntary loss of more than 5 percent of body weight. The ICSI notes that referral to a gastroenterologist is appropriate when a patient has a documented history of ulcer.

When a patient presents with dyspepsia and a documented history of ulcer but has no alarm features or reflux symptoms, case management begins with serologic testing for. Helicobacter pylori. The ICSI comments that urea breath testing for H. pylori is as sensitive as and more specific than serologic testing. Thus, if an H. pylori breath test is available and has a similar cost, it is preferable to a serologic test. If H. pylori testing is positive, the ICSI recommends eradicative therapy. If H. pylori testing is negative, the patient should be given full-dose histamine-H 2 receptor agonist therapy; in addition, consideration should be given to stopping smoking, if indicated, and, if possible, discontinuing the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

If the patient with dyspepsia has no documented ulcer, the likelihood of GERD is extremely high when the primary symptom is heartburn or acid regurgitation. An algorithm for the management of GERD is presented in Figure 2. If a patient with dyspepsia but no GERD or documented ulcer is 50 years or older, the ICSI notes that it is appropriate to perform nonurgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out gastric cancer. Patients younger than 50 years should be tested for. H. pylori. If the serologic test is positive, eradicative therapy should be given. If the test is negative, the ICSI recommends empiric in H 2RA therapy; addition, smoking cessation and stopping NSAID use should be considered. If NSAID use cannot be discontinued, a 12-week duration of therapy is recommended. With treatment, symptoms of gastric and duodenal ulcers generally improve after four weeks.

Data suggest that antiulcer treatment should be continued for eight weeks. In most patients, H 2RA therapy is most effective. H 2RA therapy should be continued for a total of 12 weeks in the patient who needs NSAID therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcers, especially gastric ulcers. If the patient does not relapse within 12 months, the dyspepsia has resolved. If relapse occurs, endoscopy should be performed. If symptoms do not improve after four weeks despite treatment, the ICSI recommends endoscopy. If the endoscopic examination reveals an ulcer, biopsy for. H. pylori or a urea breath test should be performed. If the test is positive, case management includes eradicative therapy. If the patient was previously treated for H. pylori infection, a different drug should be used, and treatment should be continued for 14 days. If H. pylori testing is negative, smoking status and NSAID use should be reviewed.

### AGA technical review on gastric intestinal metaplasia-natural history and clinical outcomes [^3f4d4995]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US-based guidelines do not recommend endoscopic screening for NCGA nor do they recommend universal surveillance of gastric precancerous lesions for the purpose of early NCGA detection.GIM is usually encountered incidentally in patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy for nonspecific symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia). Limited awareness of risk factors for NCGA, uncertainty regarding the risk factors for neoplastic progression of GIM, and unadjudicated risk versus benefit of GIM surveillance, have resulted in wide clinical practice variability in the evaluation and management of patients with GIM. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) have position statements on the management of gastric precancerous lesions, with the European guidelines based on a comprehensive review of the literature at the time (through November 2010) and expert consensus vote. By contrast, the ASGE position statement is limited in its recommendations on GIM management without a formal systematic review of the available literature. There is an unmet need for updated comprehensive guidelines for GIM management that are practical and relevant for the US population, particularly given the diversity of the population and potentially variable risk profiles for NCGA. Our aim is to provide a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of the literature to inform the AGA guideline panel in formulating evidence-based recommendations on the management of GIM in the absence of concurrent neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer), with a focus on the potential role of H. pylori eradication and endoscopic surveillance.

This is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of GI endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this text. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations.

### Quality standards in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: a position statement of the British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and association of upper gastrointestinal surgeons of great britain and Ireland (AUGIS) [^d0488771]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Gastric ulcers should be biopsied and re-evaluated after appropriate treatment, including H. pylori eradication where indicated, within 6–8 weeks.

Level of agreement: 90%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: strong

Where a gastric ulcer is seen during an OGD, this should be fully assessed, including a description of the size and location. Helicobacter pylori status should be assessed by a rapid urease test or gastric biopsies, and if appropriate, eradication therapy should be prescribed. A repeat OGD to ensure that the ulcer has healed should be performed 6–8 weeks after the index OGD.

Where there are endoscopic features of gastric atrophy or intestinal metaplasia separate biopsies from the gastric antrum and body should be taken.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: weak

Perhaps owing to a relatively low incidence of gastric cancer in the UK, surveillance of premalignant gastric change is not established. Gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are thought to give rise to gastric cancer through the inflammation–metaplasia–dysplasia–carcinoma pathway. Where endoscopic features suggest potential gastric atrophy or metaplasia, representative biopsies should be taken to confirm this diagnosis and to exclude dysplasia. Histological change may be patchy and so the Sydney protocol advocates the acquisition of two non-targeted biopsies from the antrum and body and one from the incisura as separate samples, in addition to targeted biopsies of any visible lesions. Careful examination of the stomach with white light endoscopy should be performed as a minimum, with evaluation with chromoendoscopy considered. Where H. pylori is present, this should be eradicated, with evidence suggesting that this may cause a degree of regression of atrophy and delay the progression of intestinal metaplasia. The surveillance of intestinal metaplasia remains controversial, current ESGE guidelines suggest that 3-yearly surveillance should offered to patients, especially those with a family history or risk factors.

The first and most important action on encountering a patient with unexplained gastric or duodenal ulceration is to double check that they are truly H. pylori negative and also not taking any ulcerogenic medicines. Once the patient is confirmed to be H. pylori negative and NSAID negative, ensure that biopsies of the ulcer-whether gastric or duodenal-and of the surrounding gastric and duodenal mucosa are obtained to exclude underlying malignancy/lymphoma, Crohn's disease, and unusual infectious agents. If the etiology of the ulceration remains unexplained, an underlying gastrinoma should be considered and excluded. Patients with idiopathic ulcers should be maintained on proton pump inhibitor therapy, and higher doses may be required to control acid secretion and prevent ulcer relapse in these H. pylori-uninfected subjects.

### The debate in the diagnosis of coeliac disease-time to go' no-biopsy'? [^3197676a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Duodenal biopsies have been central to making a diagnosis of coeliac disease for the last 70years. Recent paediatric guidelines have reduced the emphasis on duodenal biopsies with the incorporation of a 'no-biopsy' arm to the diagnostic pathway. This review discusses the no-biopsy approach in adults and highlights advances in alternative (non-biopsy) diagnostic modalities in coeliac disease.

Recent Findings

Evidence suggests that a no-biopsy approach for the diagnosis of adult coeliac disease is accurate. However, a number of factors still favour duodenal biopsy sampling in specific patient groups. Moreover, several factors need to be considered if this pathway is implemented into local gastroenterology services.

Summary

Duodenal biopsies remain an important step in the diagnosis of adult coeliac disease. However, an alternative approach that removes the necessity for biopsies may be an option in selected adults. If further guidelines incorporate this pathway, then efforts should focus on supporting a dialogue between primary and secondary care to facilitate the appropriate implementation of this approach.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^8b28a6ae]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Scope, evidence review, and grading — focus on ulcer-related UGIB and use GRADE for recommendations. Ulcers are the most common cause of hospitalization for UGIB, and this guideline addresses the management of patients with overt UGIB due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, where "overt" indicates hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia. The document covers initial assessment and risk stratification, pre-endoscopic use of medications and gastric lavage, timing of endoscopy, endoscopic and medical management, post-endoscopic medical therapy and disposition, and prevention of recurrent bleeding. Evidence review included a MEDLINE search using the MeSH term "gastrointestinal hemorrhage" limited to "all clinical trials" and "meta-analysis" for years 1966–2010 without language restriction. The GRADE system was used; the quality of evidence ranges from "high" to "very low" with stated definitions, and the strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects and conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs; additional factors include variability in patient values and preferences and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.

Introduction

Peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) is the most frequent cause of acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, – and has a reported mortality of between 11% and 13.1%. Helicobacter pylori infection (HPI) remains one of the common causes of peptic ulcer disease. In the case of underlying HPI, untoward outcomes of the PUB episode such as rebleeding, need for repeat endoscopy and transfusion are better if the bacteria are eradicated. Gisbert et al. found that eradication of HPI can reduce rebleeding episodes from 23.7% to 4.5%.

An optimal testing strategy would be desirable; however, the international guidelines on PUB do not provide clear guidance for clinicians concerning HPI testing in the acute setting. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines recommend biopsy-based testing, whereas the European Society of Gastroenterological Endoscopy (ESGE), does not specify a diagnostic method. The American Society of Gastroenterological Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends the eradication of HPI, but it does not determine the method of testing.

There is a lack of guidance in the Maastricht/Florence V guideline on the ideal timing of eradication therapy after an acute episode of PUB, and there are multiple logistical factors that hamper early testing and eradication.

Multiple previous studies and reviews proved a decreased diagnostic performance of HPI tests in PUB. The reasons include recent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, which can change the number and load of detectable organisms. Intragastric blood contains albumin and human plasma with killing factors, which can interfere with bacteria. – A meta-regression reported that testing on the index admission underestimates the true prevalence of HPI in PUB, likely due to the decreased diagnostic performance. Therefore, an optimal strategy or preference for the available tests is needed.

The meta-analysis of Gisbert et al. in 2006 on the diagnostic accuracy of H. pylori testing in the setting of acute PUB drew many conclusions on the diagnostic performance of single tests compared with 'gold standards'. They found that biopsy-based tests had low sensitivity and high specificity in PUB. The urea breath test remained highly accurate, but the stool antigen test was less reliable. They did not recommend serology as the first test. Since then, multiple studies have been completed, the genre of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis improved significantly, with detailed recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for DTA reviews. Also, the method of network meta-analysis for DTA studies was developed.

We suggest a tailored approach based upon the location of the ulcer for the treatment of perforated peptic ulcer larger than 2 cm. In case of large gastric ulcers that raise the suspicion of malignancy, we suggest resection with contextual operative frozen pathologic examination whenever possible. In case of large duodenal ulcers, we suggest considering the need of resections or repair plus/minus pyloric exclusion/external bile drainage. We recommend duodenostomy only in extreme circumstances (weak recommendations based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Notes on the use of the guidelines: aims, targets, and limitations

The Guidelines are aimed to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for an optimal management of complicated peptic ulcer. These guidelines are thus intended to improve the knowledge and the awareness of physicians around the world on the specific topic of complicated peptic ulcer, providing an up-to-date tool that can help during the decision-making process. For this reason, the Guidelines are evidence-based and the grade of recommendation is provided to summarize the evidences present in literature. The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### Chinese consensus report on family-basedInfection control and management (2021 edition) [^945b8e71]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

For North America and Europe, the joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of H. pylori in children and adolescents (Update 2016) recommended against a test-and-treat strategy for H. pylori infection in children but recommended testing and treating H. pylori in children with gastric or duodenal ulcer diseases. As these recommendations are primarily based on and for the settings of North America and Europe, where H. pylori infection rates are low and decreasing, along with the related disease burden, the guideline may therefore not apply to other areas of the world where the infection rate and related disease burden are high, such as Asia, Latin America and many developing countries.

In 2020, the Japanese Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition published a revised guideline managing H. pylori infection in children. The guideline recommends that H. pylori must be eradicated in children with gastric or duodenal ulcers, histological gastric mucosal atrophy, gastric MALT lymphoma, protein-losing gastroenteropathy, iron-deficiency anaemia and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The report also recommends using at least two H. pylori tests, such as two non-invasive tests (eg, breath test and stool antigen test) or a biopsy-based and a non-invasive test (eg, breath test) for more accurate diagnosis of active infection.

This guidelinealso recommends that for children aged 5 years or older with active infections, H. pylori eradication therapy can be offered when reinfection possibility is considered. Consideration of H. pylori eradication therapy is recommended for children who have active gastritis, undergo gastroscopy due to abdominal symptoms, have a family history of GC in first-degree or second-degree relatives, and in whom active H. pylori infection has been found. However, H. pylori eradication therapy is not recommended for chronic primary urticaria. A test-and-treat approach is not recommended for asymptomatic children for preventing GC or preventing reinfection in adults in families where H. pylori infection has been eradicated. Compared with its previous versions, the updated recommendations have further clarified the indications for H. pylori detection and eradication in children.

### Update on the pathologic approach to the diagnosis of gastritis, gastric atrophy, and Helicobacter pylori and its sequelae [^b5adefb1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Biopsy sampling of the gastric mucosa at diagnostic endoscopy provides information that cannot be obtained otherwise. The most common indication for gastric biopsy is the need to know whether the patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori or not and whether the stomach is gastritic or not. Microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimens gives, in addition to H. pylori status, information about the grade, extent, and topography of gastritis- and atrophy-related alterations in the gastric mucosa. This information provides further possibilities for the assessment of risk and likelihood of various gastric disorders. The presence of atrophy (loss of mucosal glands) results in failures in secretory functions of the corresponding mucosa and leads to errors in the homeostasis of normal gastric physiology. The grade of atrophy of the corpus mucosa linearly correlates with peak and maximal output of acid. The presence of advanced (moderate or severe) corpus atrophy indicates an extremely hypochlorhydric or achlorhydric stomach in which, for example, ordinary peptic ulcer is unlikely or impossible in spite of a possible H. pylori infection. Some well characterized and common topographic phenotypes of H. pylori gastritis and atrophic gastritis can be delineated as follows: Predominance or restriction of the H. pylori-related inflammation in antrum, in association with a nonatrophic corpus mucosa — of which phenotype is the most common — and with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease, duodenal ulcer in particular ("duodenal ulcer phenotype" of gastritis); the presence of atrophic gastritis in corpus of the stomach ("corpus predominant gastritis"), which indicates a low risk of peptic ulcer and a reduction in the capacity of the patient to secrete acid; the occurrence of advanced atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia multifocally in the stomach (advanced "multifocal atrophic gastritis"), which are features of a gastritis type and which also indicate a low acid secretion capacity and an increased risk of gastric neoplasias ("gastric cancer phenotype of gastritis"), suggesting a need for a careful exclusion of concomitant presence of small focal neoplastic or dysplastic lesions; and the presence of normal and healthy gastric mucosa, which indicates an extremely low risk of both peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer and, therefore, is a finding of high clinical relevance. The presence of duodenal or gastric ulcer in conjunction with normal, healthy gastric mucosa suggests either aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to be the most likely cause of the ulcer.

### Gastric endoscopy in the 21st century: appropriate use of an invasive procedure in the era of non-invasive testing [^c86e1b9c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The acceptance of the premise that Helicobacter pylori infection is aetiologically related to gastric cancer and peptic ulcer and that the risk of gastric cancer among Helicobacter pylori infected individuals is related to the extent, severity and duration of atrophic gastritis has led to major changes in medical and endoscopic practices. The development of non-invasive methods to detect Helicobacter pylori and to estimate the extent and severity of gastritis has reduced the need for diagnostic endoscopy in asymptomatic individuals.

Methods and Results

Here we provide recommendations regarding deciding whether non-invasive and endoscopic assessment of the gastric mucosa is preferred. We also include specific recommendations and caveats regarding the preferred biopsy number and sites as well as the identification of specimens, to allow the pathologist to reliable stage the severity and extent of gastritis, and thus provide prognostic information needed for patient managements (e.g., whether endoscopic surveillance is recommended).

Conclusion

In summary, while there is clearly a role for gastric endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy in the Helicobacter pylori era, obtaining useful diagnostic and prognostic information is critically dependent upon attention to detail with regard to biopsy site and identification as to the location from where the specimen was taken.

Methodology

Overview

This document was prepared by the SOP Committee of the ASGE and is a continuation of our society's effort to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as previously described. In summary, GRADE is a standardized and transparent process for assessing and presenting summaries of evidence with the goal of informing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations. The recommendations in this guideline document were based on up-to-date meta-analyses of the available literature for each clinical question. The quality or certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were based on the GRADE approach and followed the evidence-to-decision framework.

Evidence profiles were created with the help of GRADE methodologists (M.D. B.Q.), and a guideline development panel was held on March 10, 2023, in which the evidence was reviewed and recommendations were generated. In developing our recommendations, we took into consideration the certainty of the evidence, beneﬁts and risk of harm of different management options, patient values and preferences, resource use including direct costs, cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

The ﬁnal wording of the recommendations including direction and strength were approved by all members of the panel and the ASGE Governing Board. Strong recommendations are typically stated as "we recommend… " whereas conditional or more closely balanced recommendations are indicated by the phrase "we suggest… " The meanings and interpretations of various qualities of evidence and the implications of corresponding recommendations are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of recommendations

Formulation of clinical questions

Six clinical questions were conceptualized by the authors of the documents and members of the ASGE SOP committee. These were then approved by the ASGE Governing Board. The questions followed the PICO format: P, population in question; I, intervention; C, comparator; and O, outcomes of interest. For all clinical questions, potentially relevant patient-important outcomes were identiﬁed a priori and rated from "critical" to "important" through a consensus process. A detailed list of the PICO questions and outcomes is provided in Table 2.

### Joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori in children and adolescents (update 2016) [^b5596730]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — investigation goals and indications for testing are as follows: We recommend that the primary goal of clinical investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms should be to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and not solely the presence of H pylori infection. We recommend that during endoscopy additional biopsies for RUT and culture should only be taken if treatment is likely to be offered if infection is confirmed. We suggest that if H pylori infection is an incidental finding at endoscopy, treatment may be considered after careful discussion of the risks and benefits of H pylori treatment with the patient/parents. We recommend against a "test and treat" strategy for H pylori infection in children. We recommend that testing for H pylori be performed in children with gastric or duodenal ulcers and if H pylori infection is identified then treatment should be advised and eradication be confirmed. We recommend against diagnostic testing for H pylori infection in children with functional abdominal pain. We recommend against diagnostic testing for H pylori infection as part of the initial investigation in children with iron deficiency anemia and we suggest that in children with refractory IDA in which other causes have been ruled out, testing for H pylori during upper endoscopy may be considered. We suggest that noninvasive diagnostic testing for H pylori infection may be considered when investigating causes of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). We recommend against diagnostic testing for H pylori infection when investigating causes of short stature.

### The indications for biopsy in routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^8fd86e13]. Histopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review describes the indications and contraindications for endoscopic biopsy, in routine practice, of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We accept that this review provides grounds for controversy, as our stance in certain situations is counter to some national guidelines. Nevertheless, we provide evidence to support our viewpoints, especially on efficiency and economic grounds. We describe the particular controversies concerning the biopsy assessment of Barrett's oesophagus, chronic gastritis and the duodenum in the investigation of coeliac disease. We accept that there are indications for more extensive upper GI biopsy protocols in children than in adults; the latter constitute our main focus in this article. We would encourage detailed discussion between pathologists and their endoscopy colleagues about the indications, or lack of them, for routine upper GI endoscopic biopsy, as studies have shown that adherence to agreed guidelines has resulted in a very considerable diminution in the biopsy workload without compromising patient management. Furthermore, where biopsy is indicated, we emphasise the importance of accompanying clinical information provided to the pathologist, in particular regarding biopsy site(s), and regular feedback to endoscopists to improve and maintain the quality of such information. Finally, local dialogue is also advised, when necessary, to indicate to endoscopists the need to appropriately segregate biopsies into separate, individually labelled specimens, to maximise the information that can be derived by pathological evaluation and thereby improve the quality of the final pathology report.

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: the OBA guidelines [^ecfff220]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Statement 7.22

After LRYGB, a perforated remnant stomach may be managed by primary suture and omental patch or stapled resection, If there is concern for significant postoperative ileus due to peritonitis, a gastrostomy tube could be placed in the gastric remnant proximal to the site of the perforation to decompress the stomach and allow a postoperative endoscopic access (QoE: low).

Statement 7.23

If diffuse peritonitis is due to a perforated excluded gastrointestinal segment (stomach or duodenum), it is recommended to explore the jejuno-jejunostomy (stenosis) or the gastric remnant (gastro-gastric fistula) (QoE: low).

Statement 7.24

Surgical treatment of a duodenal perforation depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient, size of the perforation and extent of native tissue loss (QoE: very low).

Recommendations/7-PERITONITIS

We recommend performing immediate surgical exploration in unstable patients presenting with peritonitis without delay (Strong recommendation based on low level of evidence 1C).

We recommend assessing all anastomoses after LRYGB, the remnant stomach and the excluded duodenum (Strong recommendation based on low level of evidence 1C).

In the presence of a perforated ulcer, we recommend performing biopsies of the perforated ulceration to exclude malignancy (Strong recommendation based on low level of evidence 1C).

We recommend performing primary suture with omental patch in laparoscopic approach in stable patients presenting with a perforated marginal ulcer or gastric remnant or duodenal perforation of less than1cm, whenever technically possible (Strong recommendation based on low level of evidence 1C).

We suggest considering damage control surgery and open abdomen in hemodynamically unstable patients (Weak recommendation based on low level evidence 2C).

Summary of evidence

Common causes of peritonitis in the general population may also occur after bariatric surgical procedures. We restricted our review to assess proper causes of peritonitis after SG and RYGB.

A perforated gastric or marginal ulcer should be managed according to the WSES guidelines. Perforation could complicate a marginal ulcer after RYGBP with an incidence of 1% and a median time to perforation of 18 months (range 3–70 months) in large series. Predisposing factors for perforated ulcer are smoking, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSADs) and steroids.

A perforated gastric ulcer or marginal ulcer should be treated with laparoscopic suture repair followed by reinforcement using an omental patch. This is a safe and effective therapeutic option even in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.

Literature searches, evidence synthesis and grading of evidence

A literature search was undertaken by each subgroup with predefined search terms, electronic databases used (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Medline) and the time period covered. Where appropriate, conference abstracts were used to help formulate recommendations, provided that these were of sufficient scientific rigour.

The PICOs were used to guide the search for evidence and the highest quality studies were prioritised. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected initially. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses or critically appraised articles were unavailable, lower levels of evidence were selected. Where reviews use poor-quality studies such as that by Spence et al, for example, where the review was based on small, often single-centre cohort studies resulting in high levels of heterogenicity, this is discussed in the evidence review and highlighted in the evidence tables. In this instance, more weight is given to larger studies using large databases, which are likely to be more accurate. This hierarchy of searching was performed in a pyramidal sequence from top (high quality) to bottom (low quality), cascading from recently published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, to RCTs, and subsequently to observational studies providing that no evidence is available from the higher quality categories. The selected evidence was tabulated in an evidence table categorising each study into the study design, intervention/clinical question, participants/population, reference standard, results and conclusions/comments.

Although randomised controlled studies are deemed the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, other types of studies were included to assess types of effectiveness, such as ways of delivering service or outcomes from registries in clinical practice. If evidence from studies was weak or contradictory, searches for alternative sources were undertaken to see if the evidence concurred or contradicted (triangulation of searches). All available negative studies were included in the searches. The subgroups discussed the external validity of the studies and whether the study outcomes are applicable to the target population for the guidelines. Literature searches were transparent and reproducible to reduce 'dissemination biases'.

All evidence tables and references were downloaded to a shared reference manager (F1000Workspace), to which all GDG members had access. Shortly before the statements were finalised, a further literature search was undertaken. The quality of the evidence was assessed following the GRADE terminology using table 2. Evidence is graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality (table 2).

### ASGE guidelines for the appropriate use of upper endoscopy: association with endoscopic findings [^24fe9831]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This prospective study examined the appropriate use of EGD in an open-access system with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines and determined whether the ASGE guidelines were associated with relevant endoscopic findings.

Methods

In a cohort of 1777 consecutive patients referred for open-access EGD, the proportion of patients who underwent EGD for appropriate indications was prospectively assessed. The relationship between appropriateness and the presence of clinically relevant endoscopic diagnoses was assessed by calculating (1) the likelihood ratio, positive and negative, of the indications; and (2) the change in the probability of relevant endoscopic diagnoses in the presence of the ASGE criteria.

Results

The rate for EGDs "generally not indicated" was 15.6%. Relevant endoscopic diagnoses were present in 47.4% of cases with ASGE indications versus 28.8% of patients without appropriate indications as defined by the ASGE criteria (OR: 2.23; 99% CI [1.55, 3.22]; p < 0.01). A similar difference was observed for erosive gastritis (OR: 1.86; 99% CI [1.17, 2.95]; p < 0.01), erosive esophagitis (OR: 1.48; 99% CI [0.87, 2.52]; p < 0.05), and Barrett's esophagus (OR: 9.76; 99% CI [0.72, 132]; p < 0.05). The pretest probability of finding a relevant endoscopic diagnosis was modified slightly when an ASGE indication(s) was present and decreased markedly when ASGE criteria were absent.

Conclusions

The use of the ASGE guideline for appropriate indications for EGD can improve patient selection for the procedure. However, to avoid missed diagnoses of serious disease, use of the guidelines must be tailored to the specific clinical setting.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^40feee7d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — surveillance approach for gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) emphasizes shared decision-making and provides an interval option. There are insufficient data to guide recommendations on the optimal surveillance interval, and the AGA recommends shared decision-making regarding use of endoscopic surveillance over routine use of surveillance. When surveillance is chosen, repeat upper endoscopy every 3–5 years with careful mucosal visualization and gastric biopsies of the antrum, body, and any concerning lesions could be considered in patients with incidental GIM, if shared decision-making favors surveillance. Evidence remains limited after H pylori eradication; there was no direct evidence to inform recommendations for or against endoscopic surveillance after H pylori eradication, and the TR found no randomized controlled trial, cohort study, or case–control study comparing endoscopic surveillance vs no surveillance on gastric cancer risk among patients with GIM.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^f9891b3f]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — scope and target audience for gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) management state that the guideline focuses on recommendations for management of patients with GIM detected as part of routine upper endoscopy and is intended to aid decision-making for patients who are undergoing upper endoscopy in North America. Screening for gastric cancer (either population-wide or in select populations) and management of patients with dysplasia of the gastric mucosa, gastric adenocarcinoma, and/or autoimmune gastritis are beyond the scope of the current guideline. The document notes that GIM may represent the histologic step just before development of dysplasia and that an evidence-based guideline supported by a comprehensive literature review for management of patients with GIM has not been previously published in the United States. The page also lists on-page abbreviations, including American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and relative risk (RR).

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^382c9aba]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline document was prepared by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) using the best available scientific evidence and considering a multitude of variables including, but not limited to, adverse events, patients' values, and cost implications. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the best practice recommendations that may help standardize patient care, improve patient outcomes, and reduce variability in practice.

We recognize that clinical decision making is complex. Guidelines, therefore, are not a substitute for a clinician's judgment. Such judgments may, at times, seem contradictory to our guidance because of many factors that are impossible to fully consider by guideline developers. Any clinical decisions should be based on the clinician's experience, local expertise, resource availability, and patient values and preferences.

This document is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care, or as encouraging, advocating for, mandating, or discouraging any particular treatment. Our guidelines should not be used in support of medical complaints, legal proceedings, and/or litigation because they were not designed for this purpose.
