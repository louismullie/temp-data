## Question

What are the indications for corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome? What are the potential side effects of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS? How do corticosteroids affect the inflammatory response in ARDS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the potential side effects of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS, and how corticosteroids affect the inflammatory response in ARDS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathophysiology of ARDS. Then, I should review the historical evolution of steroid strategies and why earlier approaches failed. Next, I will appraise contemporary randomized trials and meta-analyses to quantify benefits and harms. After that, I need to examine guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Then, I should define practical indications, timing, and dosing with safety monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and etiologies, and close with a balanced, conditional recommendation and research gaps, ensuring each claim is anchored to appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, neutrophil-driven inflammation, increased permeability edema, and a fibroproliferative phase that can become unresolving, which provides a mechanistic rationale for anti-inflammatory therapy, but also explains why timing and phenotype likely matter for steroid responsiveness [^111CNZvz] [^114ArYJa].

> Hold on, I should verify the historical trajectory before inferring current practice: early high-dose, short-course steroids for prevention or early treatment failed to improve outcomes and in some contexts worsened outcomes, whereas later work shifted toward prolonged low-to-moderate dose regimens, particularly targeting the fibroproliferative phase, though even that signal has been mixed and methodologically limited [^1149jwqP] [^112wkX3F] [^1113XDYb].

> Next, I will examine the highest-quality contemporary trial signal. The DEXA-ARDS multicenter RCT in moderate-to-severe ARDS showed dexamethasone 20 mg daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days increased ventilator-free days by about 4.8 days and reduced 60-day mortality from 36% to 21%, with no significant excess of infections, which materially shifts the balance toward benefit when instituted early in established ARDS [^112Xcgd7].

> Wait, let me verify the meta-analytic picture to ensure this isn't an isolated result: pooled analyses of 17–19 RCTs including DEXA-ARDS consistently show a modest but significant mortality reduction with steroids, approximately a 16% relative risk reduction, alongside reductions in ventilator days and hospital length of stay, though with heterogeneity and low-to-moderate certainty depending on the outcome and analysis [^114wJ7CP] [^114Gnwzn] [^1123UdvM].

> I need to check safety signals carefully. Steroids probably increase serious hyperglycemia, may increase GI bleeding, and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness across trials, while observational data suggest potential harm in influenza-related ARDS, reinforcing the need for vigilant metabolic monitoring and etiologic caution rather than blanket use [^114wJ7CP] [^notfound] [^117UEQHu].

> Let me consider guideline convergence so I don't overstate any single position: the 2024 ATS guideline issues a conditional recommendation for steroids in ARDS based on moderate-certainty evidence of mortality benefit, while the 2024 SCCM focused update similarly suggests corticosteroids for adult ARDS, acknowledging uncertainty about molecule, dose, and duration and explicitly moving away from the 2017 PaO2/FiO2 threshold framing [^114wJ7CP] [^114Gnwzn] [^113i2dNB].

> But wait, what about timing and duration? I should double-check that before recommending specifics: most benefits accrue with early initiation, typically within the first week, and prolonged courses beyond 7 days may be favored over very short courses in subgroup analyses, yet starting after 14 days may be harmful, and abrupt cessation risks relapse, so a gradual taper after clinical improvement is prudent, especially following longer courses [^1152wgtS] [^112wkX3F] [^111ay39c].

> I will now examine practical dosing choices, keeping in mind the evidence heterogeneity: dexamethasone 20 mg IV daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days is the regimen with the clearest mortality signal to date, while methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with a taper is historically supported and reasonable when dexamethasone is unavailable or contraindicated, with total durations commonly 7–14 days and tapering to mitigate rebound inflammation [^112Xcgd7] [^113i2dNB] [^115PB789].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and etiologies where harm may outweigh benefit: influenza-related ARDS shows increased mortality with steroids in observational cohorts, so they should generally be avoided. COVID-19 ARDS is an exception where steroids reduce mortality and are recommended. For immunocompromised patients or those in TB/parasite-endemic settings, I need to ensure enhanced infection surveillance and individualized risk–benefit discussions [^113CPT6v] [^1153b4ZV] [^111q5Y1S].

> Let me synthesize a conditional recommendation and make sure it aligns with the strength of evidence: for adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS, I suggest initiating systemic corticosteroids early, preferably within 7 days of onset, using dexamethasone 20 mg daily for 5 days then 10 mg daily for 5 days or methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day with a taper over 7–14 days, while monitoring glucose closely, screening for infections, and avoiding late initiation beyond 14 days. This is a conditional recommendation due to heterogeneity and the need for more definitive regimen data [^114wJ7CP] [^112Xcgd7] [^112wkX3F] [^115PB789].

> I should confirm key uncertainties and research directions so we don't overgeneralize: optimal molecule, dose, and duration remain unsettled, long-term functional and neurocognitive outcomes are underreported, and phenotype-guided enrichment strategies may identify hyperinflammatory subtypes that benefit most. Ongoing large RCTs like GuARDS and CORT-E2 are expected to clarify these questions and should inform future guideline updates [^112FpHoD] [^115Pu1L8] [^114wJ7CP].

> In summary, after reviewing pathophysiology, historical failures, contemporary trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines, corticosteroids are no longer categorically contraindicated in ARDS. When used early and appropriately, they likely confer a modest mortality benefit and shorten ventilator dependence, but they demand careful patient selection, vigilance for hyperglycemia and infections, avoidance in influenza-related ARDS, and attention to tapering strategy to preserve gains and minimize rebound, which is why the recommendation remains conditional rather than strong [^112Xcgd7] [^114wJ7CP] [^113CPT6v] [^111ay39c].

Corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** for moderate-to-severe ARDS [^115aGs4o] [^113kj1vd] because they reduce mortality and shorten mechanical ventilation [^112Xcgd7] [^114wJ7CP], with the clearest benefit when started within 14 days of onset [^113crMig] [^113kj1vd]. They are **not recommended for mild ARDS** or for prevention, and may be harmful in influenza-related ARDS [^1149jwqP] [^113CPT6v] [^117UEQHu]. The main adverse effects are hyperglycemia, infections, and neuromuscular weakness; risk is minimized by using low-to-moderate doses with a taper and close monitoring [^114wJ7CP] [^113crMig]. Corticosteroids suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce alveolar-capillary permeability, improving oxygenation and lung compliance [^114ArYJa] [^112wkX3F].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid use in ARDS

Current guidelines provide **conditional recommendations** for corticosteroid use in ARDS, emphasizing careful patient selection and timing:

- **Moderate-to-severe ARDS**: The American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2024 guidelines suggest corticosteroids for patients with ARDS, particularly moderate-to-severe cases (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 200 mmHg) [^1175gJRH] [^114wJ7CP].

- **Early initiation**: Corticosteroids are recommended within 14 days of ARDS onset, as delayed initiation (> 14 days) may increase mortality and adverse effects [^113i2dNB] [^112wkX3F].

- **Conditional recommendation**: The recommendation is conditional, balancing moderate-certainty evidence of mortality benefit against potential harms [^114wJ7CP] [^114Gnwzn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting corticosteroid use in ARDS

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate **beneficial effects** of corticosteroids in ARDS:

| **Study** | **Design** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| DEXA-ARDS trial | RCT | - Increased ventilator-free days <br/> - Reduced 60-day mortality with dexamethasone [^112Xcgd7] |
| Meta-analysis (2021) | Meta-analysis | - Reduced mortality <br/> - Shorter mechanical ventilation duration <br/> - Improved oxygenation [^117U8fy6] |
| Meta-analysis (2021) | Meta-analysis | - Reduced mortality <br/> - More ventilator-free days <br/> - Improved oxygenation [^1154hUPA] |

---

These studies collectively indicate that corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone and methylprednisolone, confer **mortality and ventilation benefits** in ARDS [^114wJ7CP].

---

## Potential side effects and risks of corticosteroids in ARDS

While corticosteroids offer clinical benefits, they also carry **potential risks and adverse effects**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased risk of serious hyperglycemia, requiring close monitoring and insulin management [^114wJ7CP] [^1152wgtS].

- **Infections**: Higher risk of secondary infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, necessitating vigilant infection surveillance [^113crMig] [^116MPyXh].

- **Neuromuscular weakness**: Increased risk of ICU-acquired weakness, particularly with prolonged high-dose therapy [^112wkX3F] [^111CNZvz].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Possible increase in gastrointestinal bleeding risk, though evidence is less consistent [^114wJ7CP] [^1152wgtS].

---

## Impact of corticosteroids on the inflammatory response in ARDS

Corticosteroids exert **anti-inflammatory effects** that modulate ARDS pathophysiology:

- **Cytokine suppression**: Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) reduces systemic and pulmonary inflammation [^114ArYJa] [^116w6byw].

- **Alveolar-capillary permeability**: Reduction in permeability decreases pulmonary edema and improves oxygenation [^113QXsWE] [^1154hUPA].

- **Fibroproliferation**: Attenuation of fibroproliferative responses may prevent progression to chronic lung injury [^1123UdvM] [^111CNZvz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **support conditional corticosteroid use** in ARDS:

- **ATS 2024 guidelines**: Suggest corticosteroids for ARDS, emphasizing individualized patient assessment and monitoring [^114wJ7CP] [^113crMig].

- **SCCM 2024 guidelines**: Recommend corticosteroids for early moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 200 within 14 days) [^115aGs4o].

- **Conditional recommendation**: Reflects moderate certainty of evidence, balancing benefits and potential harms [^114wJ7CP] [^113crMig].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from corticosteroids

Certain patient populations may derive **greater benefit** from corticosteroid therapy:

- **Moderate-to-severe ARDS**: Patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 200) benefit from reduced mortality and shorter ventilation duration [^115aGs4o] [^112Xcgd7].

- **Early ARDS**: Initiation within 14 days of onset yields better outcomes [^111q5Y1S] [^113kj1vd].

- **Non-COVID-19 ARDS**: Benefits are more pronounced in non-COVID-19 ARDS compared to COVID-19-related ARDS [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk of adverse effects

Certain populations require **cautious corticosteroid use** due to higher risks:

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of infections and delayed viral clearance [^112FpHoD] [^115VayFK].

- **Diabetic patients**: Higher risk of hyperglycemia and metabolic complications [^114wJ7CP] [^112FpHoD].

- **Patients with influenza-related ARDS**: Corticosteroids may increase mortality and secondary infections [^117Q9gKF] [^117UEQHu].

---

## Optimal dosing and duration of corticosteroid therapy

The optimal dosing and duration remain uncertain; typical regimens include **dexamethasone** 20 mg/day for 5 days, then 10 mg/day for 5 days, and **methylprednisolone** 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with a gradual taper. Prolonged courses (> 7 days) may improve survival, but abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound inflammation and relapse [^113i2dNB] [^111ay39c].

---

## Monitoring and management of corticosteroid-related complications

Effective management of corticosteroid-related complications requires **close monitoring**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Regular glucose monitoring and insulin therapy as needed [^notfound].

- **Infections**: Vigilant surveillance for secondary infections and prompt antimicrobial therapy [^115PB789].

- **Neuromuscular weakness**: Early mobilization, physical therapy, and cautious use of neuromuscular blockers [^111CNZvz].

---

Corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** for moderate-to-severe ARDS, providing mortality and ventilation benefits when started early [^1175gJRH] [^112Xcgd7]. They carry risks of hyperglycemia, infections, and neuromuscular weakness, necessitating careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring [^116w6byw] [^1171WwqA] [^111q5Y1S].

Recommendations for Specific Treatment Questions

Question 1: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Systemic Corticosteroids?

Recommendation

We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

Background

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators present in ARDS. They are widely administered to patients with ARDS for the management of ARDS specifically and for concurrent conditions such as septic shock or pneumonia. More recently, corticosteroids have been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19–related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, several multicenter RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with ARDS have been published, prompting a recommendation for this intervention.

Evidence summary

Corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 9 studies; mean difference (MD), 4 d less; 95% CI, −5.5 to −2.5; low certainty) and the length of hospital stay (n = 4 studies; MD, 8 d shorter; 95% CI, −13 to −3; low certainty), although the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain (n = 4 studies; MD, 0.8 d shorter; 95% CI, −4.1 to +5.7; very low certainty). With regard to safety outcomes, corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

Materials and Methods

Search strategy

This systematic review was conducted using an a priori published protocol submitted to the PROSPERO website (Registration No.: CRD42012002583) and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. No institutional review board (IRB) approval or consents were needed for this systematic review because it evaluated published studies. We searched MEDLINE via the NCBI Entrez system, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science (WOS) up to December 2013. We also screened the bibliographies of retrieved studies and recent review articles to identify additional trials.

Keyword search was performed in MEDLINE, CENTRAL and WOS using the following terms: 'corticosteroids' AND ('ALI' OR 'acute lung injury' OR 'ARDS' OR 'acute respiratory distress syndrome'). The search was then limited to human studies. We also used MeSH term search in MEDLINE with the following terms: ('respiratory distress syndrome, adult' OR 'acute lung injury') AND ('hydroxycorticosteroids' OR 'glucocorticoids'). No language restrictions were applied.

The inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort study designs that reported mortality outcomes and had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison.

Quality assessment and data extraction

Two investigators (SYR and CTH) independently extracted data from the included studies into standardized data recording forms. Quality assessment of these studies was done using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies.

Outcome measurement

The primary study endpoint was all-cause mortality. Different mortality measures were reported in the studies, including ICU mortality, hospital mortality and 60-day mortality. According to the duration of mean ICU and hospital stay reported in the included studies, we classified ICU mortality as short-term outcome, hospital mortality as a mid-term outcome, and 60-day mortality as a longer-term outcome. Additionally, two studies reported 14-day and 45-day mortality, and these two outcome measures were classified as ICU mortality and 60-day mortality, respectively. The secondary study endpoint was nosocomial infections related to corticosteroid therapy.

Community-acquired pneumonia (adult inpatients) — Evidence summary indicates Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to no corticosteroids in adult hospitalized patients with suspected or probable bacterial CAP, including severe and less severe disease. Severe CAP was classified as severe if 50% or more of participants had severe pneumonia or if most patients were admitted to the ICU at the time of randomization or required IV continuous vasopressor therapy; overall, 10 trials were classified as severe disease and 8 trials as less-severe disease. In severe CAP, corticosteroids probably reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.85; moderate certainty), an effect not seen in less severe CAP (RR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.83–1.42; low certainty) (subgroup interaction based on severity: p = 0.01), and there was also a subgroup effect on mortality by corticosteroid molecule (p < 0.001).

Septic shock effects and safety signals: Analyses "showed no interaction for short-term mortality (p value for subgroup interaction = 0.08)", and corticosteroids "may reduce ICU (mean difference [MD] 0.60 d fewer; 95% CI, 1.48 d fewer to 0.27 d more, low certainty) and hospital (MD 0.74 d fewer; 95% CI, 2.06 d fewer to 0.57 d more, low certainty) length of stay"; harms include "may increase neuromuscular weakness (RR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01–1.45, low certainty), probably increase hypernatremia (RR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.32–2.03, moderate certainty) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08–1.18, moderate certainty) and may reduce neuropsychiatric effects (RR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03, low certainty)", while benefits include "higher rates of shock reversal (RR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11–1.38, high certainty) and reduced organ dysfunction (MD 1.41 points lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; 95% CI, 0.96 points lower to 1.87 points lower, high certainty) at 7 days".

Evidence to recommendation for CAP — there was general agreement among the panel for a credible subgroup effect demonstrating a large desirable treatment effect of corticosteroid use for patients with severe CAP with less magnitude of benefit in less severe CAP, and given this subgroup effect the panel decided to make separate recommendations for severe and nonsevere CAP. Overall, the panel felt that the balance of beneficial and undesirable effects favors giving corticosteroids to patients with more severe CAP but was uncertain in patients with less severe CAP; this judgment was driven in part by the CAPE COD randomized controlled trial (RCT), which represented approximately 35% of the severe CAP subgroup patients and showed a strong mortality benefit with the use of corticosteroids. Evidence informing cost-effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in CAP is lacking, though one study suggests cost savings with a more pronounced benefit in those with severe CAP; definitions for severe CAP and use of risk stratification scores are variable across RCTs. Although the panel considered a conditional recommendation against corticosteroids in less severe diseases, consensus was not achieved and further RCTs evaluating corticosteroids in less severe CAP are urgently needed. Of note, 2 of the 18 RCTs included in the analysis were done in low- to middle-income countries.

### Corticosteroids in the management of pregnant patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [^117NCBh2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence supports the use of an early, short course of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation or oxygen support. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continues to increase, the number of pregnant women with the disease is very likely to increase as well. Because pregnant women are at increased risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation support, obstetricians will be facing the dilemma of initiating maternal corticosteroid therapy while weighing its potential adverse effects on the fetus (or neonate if the patient is postpartum and breastfeeding). Our objective is to summarize the current evidence supporting steroid therapy in the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19 and to elaborate on key modifications for the pregnant patient.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — corticosteroid use in hospitalized adults: We suggest use of corticosteroids in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO₂/FiO₂ of < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Rationale notes a high mortality rate (35%–45%) in ARDS and reports from glucocorticoid trials of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation by approximately 7 days.

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT data [^111PMJZH]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute and critical disease among children and adults, and previous studies have shown that the administration of corticosteroids remains controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids.

Methods

The RCTs investigating the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS were searched from electronic databases (Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test and I² with the inspection level of 0.1 and 50%, respectively.

Results

Fourteen RCTs (n = 1607) were included for analysis. Corticosteroids were found to reduce the risk of death in patients with ARDS (relative risk (RR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70–0.87; P < 0.01). Moreover, no significant adverse events were observed, compared to placebo or standard support therapy. Further subgroup analysis showed that variables, such as adults (RR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70–0.88; P < 0.01), non-COVID-19 (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.62–0.83; P < 0.01), methylprednisolone (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56–0.88; P < 0.01), and hydrocortisone (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.98; P = 0.03) were associated with 28-day mortality among patients who used corticosteroids. However, no association was found, regarding children (RR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.01–4.10; P = 0.30).

Conclusion

The use of corticosteroids is an effective approach to reduce the risk of death in ARDS patients. However, this effect is associated with age, non-COVID-19 diseases, and methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone use. Therefore, evidence suggests patients with age ≥ 18 years and non-COVID-19 should be encouraged during the corticosteroid treatment. However, due to substantial differences in the use of corticosteroids among these studies, questions still remain regarding the dosage, optimal corticosteroid agent, and treatment duration in patients with ARDS.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117G9YC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ARDS is a heterogeneous disease with various etiologies and clinical courses. The effects of corticosteroids on ARDS were inconsistent in previous studies due to different outcome measures and study populations. This study shows that corticosteroids do not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups of ARDS, such as influenza-related ARDS. Based on current available data, we do not suggest routine use of corticosteroids for ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to improve the overall quality of evidence and to specify the unfavorable and favorable subgroups of ARDS for corticosteroid therapy. Future studies should evaluate short-term as well as longer-term outcomes for comprehensive evaluation of the treatment efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^117U8fy6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid treatment might reduce overall mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149THEP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 1,771 citations from the search of electronic databases. Using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1), seven RCTs, one post-hoc analysis of RCT, and 10 cohort studies were included for evaluation. The post-hoc analysis was classified as RCT for the analysis. Of the eight RCTs, three trials studied preventive rather than therapeutic use of corticosteroids in ARDS. A total of 1,474 subjects were analyzed, including 725 from RCTs and 749 from cohort studies. The details of the included studies are summarized in Additional file 1: e-Table S1. Quality assessment of the included studies suggested a low risk of bias in most RCTs (Additional file 1: e-Table S2) but the comparability and representativeness of the study patients were concerns in cohort studies (Additional file 1: e-Table S3, e-Table S4).

GRADE classification of recommendation strength — strong versus conditional — is outlined with explicit implications for patients, clinicians, and policymakers as follows: Strong Recommendation "We recommend… " indicates that most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, and the recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators. Conditional Recommendation "We suggest… " indicates the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances; and policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders with policies more likely to vary between regions and performance indicators focusing on adequate deliberation about management options.

Sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and trauma — corticosteroid treatment recommendations are: For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO₂/FiO₂, < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

Studies evaluating the effect of corticosteroids in CAP

The main studies on corticosteroids in pneumonia are summarized in Table 1. Several studies have evaluated the effects of corticosteroids in CAP. The first studies and meta-analyses included a heterogeneous population evaluating different outcomes, resulting in controversial data.

Table 1
Studies on corticosteroids in CAP

ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, CAP community acquired pneumonia, CI confidence interval, OR odds ratio, RCT randomized controlled trial, RR relative risk

A Cochrane meta-analysis selected six randomized controlled trails (RCTs) of corticosteroids in pneumonia including a total of 437 participants. The use of corticosteroids accelerated the resolution of symptoms and time to clinical stability (defined as improvement in chest X-ray and normalization of temperature, respiratory rate, and inflammatory markers). Corticosteroids provided no benefit in terms of mortality and the authors concluded that it was not possible to make any definitive recommendations because the studies analyzed in the meta-analysis did not provide strong evidence. Another meta-analysis including nine RCTs with a total of 1001 patients showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with significantly lower mortality considering all the patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37–1.04; p = 0.07). However, a survival benefit was detected in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11–0.64; p = 0.003) and among patients receiving more prolonged corticosteroid treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.97; p = 0.04). Prolonged corticosteroid treatment was defined as more than 5 days of corticosteroid treatment and a maximum of 9 days. In terms of adverse effects, corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.68–4.15; p < 0.001) but did not increase the risk of superinfection (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.65–2.84; p = 0.41) or gastroduodenal bleeding (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.41–6.80; p = 0.47).

Corticosteroids in sepsis and septic shock — evidence summary reports that a total of 46 randomized controlled trials compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in sepsis or septic shock, with populations spanning sepsis (seven trials), CAP and sepsis (five), ARDS and sepsis (four), and the remainder septic shock; six trials examined pediatric patients, one included both adults and children, and the remainder included only adults. Corticosteroid use may reduce hospital/long-term mortality (from 60 d to 1 yr) (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00, low certainty) and probably reduces ICU/short-term mortality (14–30 d) (RR 0.93; 95% Cl, 0.88–0.98, moderate certainty) in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and subgroup analysis based on corticosteroid type, duration, or dosage did not demonstrate any credible subgroup effects.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QXsWE]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that the mortality outcomes of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures. Corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on short-term mortality in RCTs but did not decrease longer-term mortality in either RCTs or cohort studies (Table 1). Within-study observation in studies reporting two mortality endpoints also suggested that the benefit of corticosteroid therapy decreased when follow-up was prolonged. This raises a concern that corticosteroid therapy in ARDS may bring initial benefits by suppressing the inflammatory process and reducing alveolocapillary permeability, but the beneficial effects are soon counteracted by the delayed onset of adverse effects, such as immunosuppression and altered tissue repair. We also found that the effect of corticosteroid therapy differed among different populations of ARDS patients. Corticosteroids may cause harm in certain ARDS subgroups, such as influenza-related ARDS. Taken together, current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. Given the heterogeneous nature of ARDS and the pleiotropic effects of corticosteroids, more clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy. For more comprehensive assessment of the effects of corticosteroid therapy, future studies should evaluate a mortality endpoint of adequate duration and the 60-day mortality used by the ARDSnet appears to be a reasonable study endpoint.

Corticosteroids

Given their effective anti-inflammatory properties, there has been extensive interest in the potential role of corticosteroids in both the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Different regimens have been investigated, varying from short courses of high-dose steroids to prolonged courses of lower doses.

High dose corticosteroids do not prevent ARDS in at risk subjects. Therapeutically, both high-dose and moderate-dose steroids have so far failed to demonstrate efficacy in ARDS. An ARDSnet randomized, double-blind trial in 180 patients with ARDS for more than seven days, showed no effect of prolonged treatment with moderate-dose methylprednisolone compared to placebo (Table 1). Although patients were liberated from mechanical ventilation earlier, patients receiving methylprednisolone were more likely to resume assisted ventilation, which was thought to be secondary to neuromuscular effects. In addition, initiation of treatment after 14 days of ARDS was associated with a harmful effect, with increased mortality at 60 and 180 days.

However, the role of low-dose corticosteroids in established ARDS remains uncertain, with one study of 91 patients demonstrating prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone therapy reduces severity of lung injury by Day 7 of treatment (Table 1).

Despite a systematic review and meta-analysis, the role of steroids in ARDS remains unclear, and in light of ongoing uncertainty, further trials are both planned (NCT01731795) and on-going (NCT01284452) (Table 2). It is also worth highlighting that the studies included used what are now considered injurious ventilation strategies. It remains uncertain if steroids provide benefit when combined with lung protective (and, therefore, less inflammatory) ventilator strategies.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

### Safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT data [^111TddKL]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are an effective approach to reduce the risk of death in ARDS patients. However, this effect is associated with age, non-COVID-19 diseases, and methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone use. Therefore, evidence suggests patients with age ≥ 18 years and non-COVID-19 should be encouraged during the corticosteroid treatment. However, due to substantial differences in the use of corticosteroids among these studies, questions still remain regarding the dosage, optimal corticosteroid agent, and treatment duration in patients with ARDS. Therefore, further investigation is required.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1175gJRH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Methods: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations. Results: We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Conclusions: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

Dosing of corticosteroids for severe CAP — the 2017 SCCM/ESICM guideline recommended corticosteroids for 5–7 days at a daily dose < 400 mg IV hydrocortisone or equivalent, and the updated recommendation recognizes that multiple dosing strategies are acceptable for severe CAP and likely related to clinician discretion. Typical doses range from 40 to 80 mg/d IV methylprednisolone equivalent for a duration of 5–7 days, with one study including a prolonged taper over 20 days, and one guided by clinical criteria for 8 or 14 days; current evidence did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid duration and showed a possible subgroup interaction on mortality based on corticosteroid molecule.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome-2019 update [^1129Diws]. Neonatology (2019). Medium credibility.

As management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) advances, clinicians must continually revise their current practice. We report the fourth update of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2018. Optimising outcome for babies with RDS includes prediction of risk of preterm delivery, need for appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre and timely use of antenatal steroids. Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection including initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of management of RDS, and newer protocols for its use recommend early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed and may cause less distress and reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimising general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

PICO question

In adults with ARDS, does the use of corticosteroids, compared with standard care, affect survival and selected outcomes?

Study identification

The search strategy was predefined as per the online appendix C. The role of corticosteroids in ARDS has been studied in RCT both in populations at risk of developing ARDS and in the established syndrome. These prevention and treatment trials have been separately analysed in most SR with MA; the results of the former have been excluded from this analysis. Eight, high quality SRs with MA, performed between 2008 and 2014, were identified (see PRISMA chart in online appendix A. A total of eight RCTs performed between 1985 and 2007 were included in these reviews. The largest single study enrolled only 180 patients.

A GRADE Summary of Findings table is shown below based on critical and important outcomes (table 1). A full GRADE evidence table can be found as part of the online appendix B.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Xt9yG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advances in critical care medicine over the past decades, the mortality rate for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains high. Because dysregulated inflammation is the cardinal feature of ARDS, systemic corticosteroids have been considered a potentially beneficial therapy. However, previous randomized trials have failed to provide convincing evidence to prove the efficacy of corticosteroids in decreasing the mortality of ARDS. Only secondary outcomes, such as oxygenation improvement and reduction of the duration of mechanical ventilation, have shown consistent findings in favor of corticosteroid therapy.

Published meta-analyses about corticosteroid therapy for ARDS reported inconsistent conclusions. Different study selections and heterogeneity on mortality endpoints and etiologies of ARDS may account for the inconsistent study results in previous meta-analyses. Measuring the treatment effects at short-term or longer-term follow-up may influence study results, because therapeutic effects of corticosteroids develop early but some adverse effects, such as infection, develop late. Using short-term outcome as the study endpoint may underestimate the risk of corticosteroid therapy and overestimate the overall benefit. In addition, the mechanisms of lung injury and fibroproliferative response to injury vary in pulmonary and extrapulmonary ARDS. Therefore, the treatment response to corticosteroids in ARDS may be different in ARDS of different etiologies. However, the influence of the etiologies of ARDS on outcomes of corticosteroid therapy has not been evaluated in previous studies.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS with the aim of updating the best available evidence and exploring the source of observed heterogeneity.

Glucocorticoids

The administration of empiric steroids for severe ARDS has remained controversial and clinical trial results have varied significantly. One trial conducted found moderate-dose methylprednisolone significantly reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality. However, a larger study in 2006 by the ARDS Network showed no clinical benefit in patients treated with steroids within 7 days of ARDS onset, and increased mortality in patients treated 14 days after ARDS onset. More recently, the DEXA-ARDS trial studied patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and found that patients who received dexamethasone experienced more ventilator-free days and lower mortality. Dexamethasone has also been shown to improve overall mortality in patients with hypoxemia due to moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Different ARDS subphenotypes display differing responses to corticosteroid treatment. A latent class analysis of the ARMA and ALVEOLI trials revealed the existence of two distinct phenotypes: (1) hyperinflammatory and (2) hypoinflammatory. The hyperinflammatory phenotype exhibits a higher overall mortality, and in a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 ARDS, had improved mortality with steroids, while the hypoinflammatory group had worse mortality with steroids. While the empiric use of glucocorticoids remains controversial in all patients with severe ARDS, there are likely select ARDS subgroups that derive benefit.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^113R7BZM]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

New evidence is available examining the use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline on critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency.

Objectives

To develop evidence-based recommendations for use of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults and children with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

Panel Design

The 22-member panel included diverse representation from medicine, including adult and pediatric intensivists, pulmonologists, endocrinologists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinician-methodologists with expertise in developing evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines. We followed Society of Critical Care Medicine conflict of interest policies in all phases of the guideline development, including task force selection and voting.

Methods

After development of five focused Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) questions, we conducted systematic reviews to identify the best available evidence addressing each question. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and formulated recommendations using the evidence-to-decision framework.

Results

In response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing the use of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, ARDS, and CAP. These included a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock. In response to the final PICO regarding type of corticosteroid molecule in ARDS, the panel was unable to provide specific recommendations addressing corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy, based on currently available evidence.

Conclusions

The panel provided updated recommendations based on current evidence to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders on the use of corticosteroids for sepsis, ARDS, and CAP.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — in all hospitalized patients with CAP (severe and less severe), corticosteroids probably reduce need for invasive mechanical ventilation (moderate certainty) and may decrease duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay (both low certainty); for outcomes other than mortality, there was no subgroup effect based on severity or corticosteroid molecule. In all patients hospitalized with CAP, corticosteroids probably increase the risk of hyperglycemia (moderate certainty), may increase secondary infections (low certainty), but have uncertain effects on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (low certainty).

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids for persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112wkX3F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by excessive fibroproliferation, ongoing inflammation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and a substantial risk of death. Because previous reports suggested that corticosteroids may improve survival, we performed a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in patients with persistent ARDS.

Methods

We randomly assigned 180 patients with ARDS of at least seven days' duration to receive either methylprednisolone or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure-free days, biochemical markers of inflammation and fibroproliferation, and infectious complications.

At 60 days, the hospital mortality rate was 28.6 percent in the placebo group (95 percent confidence interval, 20.3 to 38.6 percent) and 29.2 percent in the methylprednisolone group (95 percent confidence interval, 20.8 to 39.4 percent; P = 1.0); at 180 days, the rates were 31.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.2 to 42.0 percent) and 31.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 22.8 to 41.7 percent; P = 1.0), respectively. Methylprednisolone was associated with significantly increased 60- and 180-day mortality rates among patients enrolled at least 14 days after the onset of ARDS. Methylprednisolone increased the number of ventilator-free and shock-free days during the first 28 days in association with an improvement in oxygenation, respiratory-system compliance, and blood pressure with fewer days of vasopressor therapy. As compared with placebo, methylprednisolone did not increase the rate of infectious complications but was associated with a higher rate of neuromuscular weakness.

Conclusions

These results do not support the routine use of methylprednisolone for persistent ARDS despite the improvement in cardiopulmonary physiology. In addition, starting methylprednisolone therapy more than two weeks after the onset of ARDS may increase the risk of death. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00295269.).

Question development and evidence synthesis note that the panel identified five actionable Patients, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the use of corticosteroids in critical illness, which were largely derived and slightly modified from the 2017 guidelines; the panel generated a list of outcomes prioritized based on perceived patient importance but, due to limited data reported in the included studies, was unable to include all outcomes, and working with a medical librarian conducted systematic reviews to identify studies relevant to each of the five PICO questions.

### Role of corticosteroids in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115k7cBG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence exploring the use of corticosteroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has targeted various stages of disease progression, from preventing ARDS in high-risk patients to halting disease evolution once ARDS has developed.

Objective

The aim of this review was to evaluate randomized, controlled trials describing the role of corticosteroids in preventing and treating ARDS.

Methods

English-language randomized, controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE searches (key terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and corticosteroids; years: 1968-January 2008).

Results

A total of 10 trials were found and included in this analysis. Trials describing the role of high-dose corticosteroids compared with controls in preventing ARDS found no benefit, with the range of occurrence of ARDS in at-risk populations from 14% to 64% and absolute increases in mortality from 4% to 31%. Conflicting evidence was found for treating late-phase ARDS with corticosteroids, with 13% hospital mortality among patients receiving corticosteroids versus 63% with controls (P = 0.03) in one small study, but no significant difference was found when evaluating 60-day mortality (corticosteroid group, 29.2% vs control, 28.6%) in another investigation. The use of high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of early phase ARDS was not associated with significant differences in 45-day mortality (methylprednisolone, 60% vs control, 63%). However, one trial found that methylprednisolone taper for early ARDS was associated with significant improvement in lung function or extubation (69.8% vs 35.7%; P = 0.002), fewer days on mechanical ventilation (median, 5.0 vs 9.5; P = 0.002), higher intensive care unit survival (79.4% vs 57.4%; P = 0.03), but similar rates of hospital survival (methylprednisolone, 76.2% vs control, 57.1%; P = NS).

Conclusions

Data from clinical trials did not support the use of short-course, high-dose corticosteroids for preventing ARDS or for the treatment of early ARDS. Longer-course corticosteroids have not conclusively been associated with improved survival in the treatment of late-phase ARDS but have provided some benefits in other markers of disease severity in this setting and in early phase ARDS. Published trials support the administration of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of early (< 7 days) and late-phase (days 7\2–14) ARDS, but this evidence is controversial.

### Corticosteroids in treatment of aspiration-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: results of a retrospective cohort study [^114mEhSb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Low-dose, short-term corticosteroid therapy may be expected to be effective in reduce hospital mortality in cases of aspiration-related ARDS, without notable side effects. The presence of a GGO pattern in chest CT images obtained in cases of suspected aspiration-related ARDS could translate into an increased possibility of positive response to corticosteroid therapy. However, we are unable to reach an accurate conclusion in terms of defining the optimal dose, timing, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. Definitive treatment recommendations will depend on further larger-scale, randomized, controlled prospective trials.

Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) corticosteroid guidance — in response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing corticosteroid use, including a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock, and for ARDS was unable to provide specific recommendations regarding corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy based on currently available evidence. New evidence was "warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline", and a 22-member panel developed evidence-based recommendations for hospitalized adults and children.

### Effects of different doses of methylprednisolone therapy on acute respiratory distress syndrome: results from animal and clinical studies [^114ArYJa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common acute respiratory failure. It is reported that ARDS accounts for 10.4% of patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and 23.4% of patients with mechanical ventilation. Although great progress has been made in the understanding and management of ARDS in recent decades, its mortality is still as high as 34.9–46.1% which seriously threatens the lives of patients and affects their quality of life. The early pathophysiology of ARDS is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by increased permeability of alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium. This change is closely related to the involvement of multiple inflammatory mechanisms in the lung, including the infiltration of a variety of inflammatory cells dominated by neutrophils and the release of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8. It can be seen that the progression of ARDS may be caused by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction in the lung. Therefore, anti-inflammatory therapy should be an important part of the management strategy of ARDS.

For a long time, many studies have tried to use glucocorticoids to control the systemic or pulmonary inflammatory responses to achieve the purpose of treating ARDS, but the results are inconsistent. Recently, a published meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials demonstrated the role of glucocorticoids in reducing the mortality of ARDS caused by various diseases. However, the specific use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of ARDS is not clear and needs to be further optimized. It is not difficult to find that the dose of glucocorticoids used in previous studies focusing on this topic is variable, which may contribute to the inconsistency of research results. We believe that the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of ARDS may be closely related to the dose of glucocorticoids, which is worthy of further exploration. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs mainly depends on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). After hormone binding, GRα can activate anti-inflammatory gene transcriptions by interacting with specific DNA binding domains known as glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs), and inhibit pro-inflammatory gene transcriptions by interacting with negative GREs. On the contrary, evidence suggests that GRβ may act as a dominant-negative to repress the transcriptional activity of GRα. It is unclear whether different doses of glucocorticoids in the ARDS treatment will regulate the expression of related receptors and thus affect the clinical effects of glucocorticoids.

Table 1 — Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes questions — corticosteroid use in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is framed by five PICO questions: "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with sepsis?", "If patients with sepsis are administered corticosteroids, should high dose/short duration or low dose/long duration be used?", "Should corticosteroids compared with no corticosteroids be used in patients with ARDS?", "Should methylprednisolone be used over other corticosteroids in patients with ARDS?", and "Should corticosteroids be administered to hospitalized patients with CAP?". Populations are specified as "All adult and pediatric patients with sepsis", "All adult and pediatric patients with ARDS", and "All adult and pediatric patients with CAP", with interventions and comparators including "Corticosteroids", "Placebo or no corticosteroids", and for methylprednisolone the comparators "Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone", with outcomes referenced in supplemental material.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^114rMMHE]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

A single course of prenatal corticosteroids given to mothers with anticipated preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation improves survival; reduces RDS, NEC, and IVH; and is not associated with any significant maternal or short-term foetal adverse effects. These favourable results were shown in the 1970s but also in clinical trials performed after 1990, indicating that even with modern neonatal care, prenatal steroids are beneficial. Prenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended in all pregnancies with threatened preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation where active care of the newborn is anticipated. Although there are limited RCT data in babies < 25 weeks of gestation, observational studies suggest that antenatal corticosteroids, together with other active management practices, reduce mortality even down to 22 weeks, and current guidelines have incorporated these data in their recommendations. In pregnancies between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation, prenatal steroids will also reduce risk of short-term respiratory morbidity, but not mortality, and there is increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia; benefits reduce with increasing gestation, whereas the incidence of hypoglycaemia increases. In women in spontaneous preterm labour after 34 weeks, steroid treatment is controversial and not advisable, as exposure is associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse neurocognitive and psychological outcomes. Optimal treatment to delivery interval is more than 24 hours and less than 7 days. Beyond 7–14 days, benefits are diminished. In a cohort study, the beneficial effect of the first dose of antenatal steroids on very preterm infants starts within a day, so advanced dilatation is not a contraindication. There is still debate about whether steroids should be repeated 1 or 2 weeks after the first course for women with threatened preterm labour. A repeat course reduces the risk of needing respiratory support but does not affect mortality or other serious health outcomes and reduces birth weight and head circumference. The WHO recommends that a single repeat course of steroids be considered if preterm birth does not occur within 7 days after the initial course and there is a high risk of preterm birth in the next 7 days. None of the clinical trials showed any improved outcomes when the repeat course had been given after 32 weeks; a single repeat course should therefore be restricted to gestational age < 32 weeks. Most studies showing benefit include mixed populations of singleton and multiple pregnancies, but there are few studies on effects of antenatal corticosteroids focussing exclusively on multiple gestations. Steroids are potent drugs with many unwanted effects. When given appropriately, they improve outcome. If not, then side effects, such as dose-dependent impaired foetal length and head circumference, impaired placental growth, brain apoptosis, and increased infection risk, may prevail. Long-term follow-up of children from trials conducted in the 1970s has been reassuring; however, steroids given after 34 weeks are associated with impaired outcome. Recent data from Finland raise concerns that any prenatal steroid has a negative effect on neurological, cognitive, and behavioural disorders, especially for infants who are born at term. Although these data were obtained from within sib-pair comparisons and logistic regression, they may be biased by the occurrence of preterm contractions, which, in itself, may be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental deficits.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PFfW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

- ARDS is a heterogeneous disease with various etiologies and clinical courses. The effects of corticosteroids on ARDS were inconsistent in previous studies due to different outcome measures and study populations.

- This meta-analysis evaluated short-term and longer-term effects of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality. Pooled data showed that corticosteroid therapy did not decrease longer-term mortality.

- The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy differed in different etiologies of ARDS. Corticosteroids might cause harm in certain subgroups of ARDS patients, such as influenza-related ARDS.

- Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids for ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to improve the overall quality of evidence and to specify the unfavorable and favorable subgroups of ARDS patients for corticosteroid therapy.

Uncertainties and research priorities

Several questions about corticosteroids remain unanswered. The optimal corticosteroid regimen remains unknown; further research is needed to determine the appropriate formulation, dose, timing, and course of therapy to better guide clinical care. Additional longitudinal data are also needed to better understand the adverse consequences of corticosteroids. Finally, there is a possibility that corticosteroids have variable effects on different subpopulations of patients based on ARDS etiology, severity, patient characteristics, or other factors. Understanding the impact of corticosteroids on potentially vulnerable patients, such as those at increased risk for superimposed infections (e.g. immunocompromised patients) and metabolic complications (e.g. those with diabetes mellitus), is of particular importance. Two large, multicenter RCTs assessing the impact of corticosteroids on ARDS outcomes will soon be underway – Glucocorticoids in Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (GuARDS) and Corticosteroid Early and Extended (CORT-E2). These trials may help answer questions about differential treatment effects in ARDS subgroups and strengthen the certainty of evidence surrounding corticosteroid use in ARDS overall.

Question 2: Should Patients with ARDS Receive VV-ECMO?

Recommendation

We suggest the use of VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

### Corticosteroids influence the mortality and morbidity of acute critical illness [^115nEswK]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Administration of corticosteroids in a variety of settings in acute critical illness has become widespread. Corticosteroids are used therapeutically for relative adrenal insufficiency as well as for the attenuation of the inflammatory and immune response in the critically ill. Early use of corticosteroids has been recommended in sepsis, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory vasodilatory shock. The Corticosteroid Randomization after Significant Head Injury study, a large, international, randomized placebo-controlled trial, was terminated after enrolment of 10,000 patients because of an unexpected rise in the death rate after early administration of corticosteroids. That study report raised concerns with regard to the safety of corticosteroids since, up to that time, they had been liberally administered in a variety of life-threatening illnesses with the intent to improve survival. These concerns were substantiated when we observed, in a previous study, that administration of corticosteroids increased the mortality in vasopressor-dependent critical illness. A similar observation of an unexpected increase in mortality from corticosteroids use was also reported from a randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in late acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The morbidity related to metabolic, immune and musculoskeletal side-effects of corticosteroids in noncritical illness has been recognized and has created great interest in developing alternative treatments to avoid these complications. In transplantation practice, the therapeutic use of corticosteroids for immunosuppression has decreased because of the introduction of other therapies targeted against specific cytokines including tumour necrosis factor and interleukins or selective lymphocytes calcineurin inhibition. New immunosuppression regimes produced superior allograft survival and yet had fewer side effects than traditional high-dose corticosteroids. For autoimmune inflammatory disorders and rheumatologic diseases, the use of corticosteroids has also declined because of better treatment options targeting inflammatory cytokines known to influence the progression of these conditions.

The use of corticosteroids in noncritical illness has gradually diminished, yet their use in acute critical illness appears to be expanding in relative adrenal insufficiency, sepsis and systemic inflammatory organ injury. This study was designed to address the following questions: What are the frequency and patient characteristics associated with corticosteroid use in acute critical illness? Does the exposure to corticosteroids influence death or disability? What were the mechanisms for the observed effects of corticosteroids in acute critical illness? This study was a retrospective case–control analysis of all admissions to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) with exposure to corticosteroids defining the case group.

Analysis of outcomes

Mortality

A MA of hospital mortality alone was presented in two SRs, while combined data on both hospital and 60-day mortality were presented in another SR. The quality of evidence supporting the relative risk (RR) of 0.51 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.09) in hospital mortality with steroids was very low(see GRADE evidence profile table 1). There was a serious risk of bias with only 75% of the Cochrane risk of bias recommendations followed. Inconsistency was also serious with point estimates varying widely, confidence intervals overlapping, a lack of consistent direction of effect and significant heterogeneity (I² 52%). Imprecision was also serious. A posthoc power calculation suggests that the pooled studies only had an approximately 65% power and a sample size calculation based on the reported effect size suggested that sample size was inadequate (predicted sample size of 474; actual pooled sample size of 341 for hospital mortality). This is likely to be an underestimate of the sample size required, as the effect size is likely to be smaller than the pooled data suggest due to heterogeneity of the studies.

A further issue is the fact that the majority of these studies were performed in the prelung protection strategy era. The largest ARDS Network steroid study, LASARUS, changed its ventilation protocol during the study to reflect the results of the ARDS Network ARMA low tidal volume study.

The other hospital mortality analysis also reported low-quality data with an estimated RR of 0.62 (0.23–1.26). Combining hospital and 60-day mortality gave a RR estimate of 0.91 (0.71–1.18) with serious inconsistency and indirectness issues including the fact that this was a pooled estimate of both preventative and treatment studies.

Length of stay

A MA of hospital length of stay was presented in one SR and MA. A mean reduction of 4.8 days with steroid treatment was reported but the overall quality of the studies was very low.

Quality of life

This was not reported in the Included MA.

Economic data

No economic data were published in the trials included.

Treatment harms

Potential harms of treatment with steroids included excess hospital acquired infections, ICU acquired weakness and delirium. The only available MA reported a composite analysis of infection, ICU acquired weakness, diabetes, gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications. The RR reported was 0.82 (0.5–1.36) but the quality of the trials was low.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^1154hUPA]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The possible benefits associated with corticosteroid treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients are not fully known. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios), and adverse events.

Results

Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–0.93; P < 0.01; I² = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64–4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32–6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70–1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99–1.23; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

The use of glucocorticoids might result in reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148MJAm]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) were used as measurements of association. Outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model because of anticipated heterogeneity among included studies. We treated risk ratio and hazard ratio as RR when pooling across studies. We estimated the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the summary effect estimate (RR or RD). RCTs and cohort studies were analyzed separately. When one arm of a study contained no events, 0.5 was added to all cells of the two-by-two table. Heterogeneity was explored using the Q statistic and I 2. Heterogeneity was considered low, moderate, and high by I² values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. We hypothesized that the treatment response to corticosteroids in ARDS patients may vary by different mortality endpoints, by different etiologies of ARDS, and by different timing for starting treatment. We, therefore, conducted subgroup analyses to explore whether the treatment response varied by these variables of interest. All tests were two-sided and P values of < 0.05 were deemed significant. The data were analyzed using Stata software, V.11 (StataCorp).

### An exploratory reanalysis of the randomized trial on efficacy of corticosteroids as rescue therapy for the late phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111ay39c]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network randomized controlled trial, methylprednisolone treatment was associated with increased return to mechanical ventilation with partial loss of early improvements. We hypothesize a causal relationship between protocol-driven rapid discontinuation of methylprednisolone post extubation and return to mechanical ventilation. To explore this possibility, we investigated the timing that events occurred in each treatment arm during active treatment intervention (efficacy) and after stopping therapy.

Design and Settings

Retrospective intention-to-treat analysis of multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Patients and Interventions

Patients were randomized to methylprednisolone (2mg/kg/d) or placebo (89 vs 91). The target sample size was reduced post hoc and provided 80% power for an optimistic 50% mortality reduction.

Measurements and Main Results

Findings are reported as methylprednisolone versus placebo. By day 28, fewer patients died before achieving extubation (15.7% vs 25.3% and risk ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.34–1.13), more achieved successful extubation (71.9% vs 49.5% and risk ratio, 1.45; CI, 1.14–1.85), time to successful extubation was shorter (hazard ratio, 2.05; CI, 1.42–2.96), and more were discharged alive from the ICU (65.2% vs 48.3%; risk ratio, 1.35; CI, 1.04–1.75). After treatment discontinuation, more methylprednisolone-treated patients returned to mechanical ventilation (26.6% vs 6.7%; risk ratio, 3.98; CI, 1.24–12.79)-consistent with reconstituted systemic inflammation in the presence of adrenal suppression. Participants returning to mechanical ventilation without reinstitution of methylprednisolone had increased risk of ventilator dependence and mortality. Despite loss of early benefits, methylprednisolone was associated with sizable and significant improvements in all secondary outcomes and reduction in serious complications (shock and severe infections).

Conclusions

During active intervention, methylprednisolone was safe and effective in achieving disease resolution. Our findings support rapid glucocorticoid discontinuation post extubation as likely cause of disease relapse. Gradual tapering might be necessary to preserve the significant improvements achieved during methylprednisolone administration.

### Use of corticosteroids in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143Bbga]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy remains as to whether low-dose corticosteroids can reduce the mortality and morbidity of acute lung injury (ALI) or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without increasing the risk of adverse reactions. We aimed to evaluate all studies investigating prolonged corticosteroids in low-to-moderate dose in ALI or ARDS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Content, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reported in any language that used 0.5–2.5 mg.kg.d of methylprednisolone or equivalent to treat ALI/ARDS.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and included study design, patient characteristics, interventions, and mortality and morbidity outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Both cohort studies (five studies, n = 307) and RCTs (four trials, n = 341) showed a similar trend toward mortality reduction (RCTs relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.24–1.09; p = 0.08; cohort studies relative risk 0.66, 95% CI 0.43–1.02; p = 0.06). The overall relative risk was 0.62 (95% CI 0.43–0.91; p = 0.01). There was also improvement in length of ventilation-free days, length of intensive care unit stay, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome Score, Lung Injury Scores, and improvement in Pao2/Fio2. There was no increase in infection, neuromyopathy, or any major complications. There was significant heterogeneity in the pooled studies. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that heterogeneity had minimal effect on treatment efficacy; however, these findings were limited by the small number of studies used in the analyses.

Conclusion

The use of low-dose corticosteroids was associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes without increased adverse reactions. The consistency of results in both study designs and all outcomes suggests that they are an effective treatment for ALI or ARDS. The mortality benefits in early ARDS should be confirmed by an adequately powered randomized trial.

### Early corticosteroids in severe influenza A / H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117UEQHu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Despite their controversial role, corticosteroids are often administered to patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to viral pneumonia.

Objectives

To analyze the impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients having ARDS associated with influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia.

Methods

Patients from the French registry of critically ill patients with influenza A/H1N1v 2009 infection were selected if fulfilling criteria for ARDS, excluding patients having other indication for corticosteroids, or decompensated underlying disease as the primary cause for intensive care unit admission. Survival to hospital discharge was analyzed using Cox regression, accounting for the time to administration of steroids, and after adjustment on the propensity for receiving steroid therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 208 patients with ARDS, 83 (39.9%) received corticosteroids (median initial dose of 270 mg equivalent hydrocortisone per day for a median of 11 d). Steroid therapy was associated with death, both in crude analysis (33.7 vs. 16.8%; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3–4.3; P = 0.004) and after propensity score-adjusted analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.5–5.4; P = 0.002), controlling for an admission severity Simplified Acute Physiology Score, version 3, greater than 50, initial administration of vasopressors, and immunodepression. Early therapy (≤ 3 d of mechanical ventilation) appeared more strongly associated with mortality than late administration. Patients receiving steroids had more acquired pneumonia and a trend to a longer duration of ventilation.

Conclusions

Our study provides no evidence of a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS secondary to influenza pneumonia, but suggests that very early corticosteroid therapy may be harmful.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^1123UdvM]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and refractory hypoxemia. It is not uncommon in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and is associated with considerable mortality. A recent international study found that nearly 10% of ICU patients suffered from ARDS, and the hospital mortality of ARDS patients was about 40%. Despite decades of research, current pharmacological therapies for ARDS are limited. Overwhelming lung inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Therefore, inflammation-directed therapies, such as glucocorticoid treatment, appear to be a reasonable strategy to treat ARDS patients.

Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects and have been the most investigated immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of ARDS. However, the impact of corticosteroid therapy on clinically relevant outcomes in ARDS patients remains controversial. Clinical trials evaluating corticosteroids in the management of ARDS reported conflicting results, and previous meta-analyses were underpowered to draw determinate conclusions. Thus, we conducted an updated meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS and determine whether the current evidence is reliable.

### Corticosteroid administration for viral pneumonia: COVID-19 and beyond [^115ZM5Hs]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome by many clinicians because of their perceived anti-inflammatory effects. However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial.

Objectives

The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia.

Sources

We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroid therapy for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases.

Content

We systematically summarized the effects of corticosteroid therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of action for corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Implications

Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for individuals with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% versus 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared individuals with non-severe disease, those with severe disease were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% versus 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence that corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality in people with COVID-19, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with severity of and mortality from COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111t6ft5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

GRADE recommendation statement

The use of corticosteroids in established ARDS should be the subject of a suitably powered, multicentre RCT with long-term follow-up (GRADE Recommendation: research recommendation).

GRADE recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit and the risk of harm appears small, although the group noted that the trials did not include longer term follow-up of survivors. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality from clinical trials, which were mostly conducted before the current era of lung protective ventilation. In addition, the lack of sufficient power in any individual study or in the combined MA and the heterogeneity of the dose, timing and agent used also influenced the decision. The group believed that a position of equipoise exists and the research recommendation reflects this view.

As a caveat, it is worth mentioning that specific steroid responsive disorders may mimic ARDS, for example, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

Implications for future research

A large, multicentre study on steroids in established ARDS is currently planned.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114wJ7CP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — systemic corticosteroids: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients and probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay, but the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain. Safety signals include that corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1116v4vi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

### Pharmacologic therapies for adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114ZTpVZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple pharmacologic treatments have been studied for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Objectives

Our objective was to determine the effects of pharmacologic treatments on clinical outcomes in adults with ALI or ARDS.

Search Strategy

We searched OVID versions of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to week 2, January 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 4, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to week 2, January 2004), and HEALTHSTAR (1995 to December 2003); proceedings from four conferences (1994 to 2003); and bibliographies of review articles and included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments compared to no therapy or placebo for established ALI or ARDS in adults admitted to an intensive care unit, with measurement of early mortality (primary outcome), late mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days to day 28, or adverse events. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, partial liquid ventilation, fluid and nutritional interventions, oxygen, and trials in other populations reporting outcomes in subgroups of patients with ALI or ARDS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, rated studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodologic quality of included studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus in consultation with a third reviewer. For each pharmacologic therapy, we quantitatively pooled the results of studies using random effects models where permitted by the available data. We contacted study authors when clarification of the primary outcome was required.

Main Results

Thirty three trials randomizing 3272 patients met our inclusion criteria. Pooling of results showed no effect on early mortality of prostaglandin E1 (seven trials randomizing 697 patients; relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.17), N-acetylcysteine (five trials randomizing 239 patients; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.21), early high-dose corticosteroids (two trials randomizing 187 patients; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.74), or surfactant (nine trials randomizing 1441 patients; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.12). Two interventions were beneficial in single small trials; corticosteroids given for late phase ARDS reduced hospital mortality (24 patients; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.81), and pentoxifylline reduced one-month mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95) in 30 patients with metastatic cancer and ARDS. Individual trials of nine additional interventions failed to show a beneficial effect on prespecified outcomes.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Effective pharmacotherapy for ALI and ARDS is extremely limited, with insufficient evidence to support any specific intervention.

### Evidence-based management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^11535JdU]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

This report explores the efficacy of existing therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), primarily in terms of clinically important outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality. Of the 15 therapies reviewed, the strongest evidence suggests that ALI/ARDS should be managed with a low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either low or moderately high positive end-expiratory pressure. To date there have been few large, sufficiently powered, randomized controlled clinical trials of ALI/ARDS therapies that addressed patient outcomes. However, there is relatively strong evidence to support conservative fluid management and high-fat, anti-oxidant nutritional formulations. Although most pharmacologic ALI/ARDS therapies have been ineffective, high-dose methylprednisolone is indicated in the subgroups of ALI/ARDS patients who have pneumonia or are at risk of ARDS due to fat embolization.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1116cD52]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Methodology and recommendation framework — Four of the five PICO questions had recent systematic reviews; reviewers used Covidence to screen studies, performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate, used Revman, v.5.3, for pooled analysis, assessed certainty with GRADE and created evidence profiles with GRADEPro, and applied the Instrument for assessing Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN). Recommendations were developed using the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework, designated as strong (using the phrasing "we recommend") or conditional (using the phrasing "we suggest"), and after discussion the panel elected to not provide a specific recommendation for the PICO question addressing corticosteroid molecules in ARDS. Voting was by formal web-based vote, and consensus was defined as 80% agreement among at least 75% of panel members.

### Perceptions of diagnosis and management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a survey of United Kingdom intensive care physicians [^114rtErv]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids were used by 70% of the respondents, with only 6% using them routinely. The preferred corticosteroid was methylprednisolone (56%), followed by hydrocortisone (41%). Prednisolone use was scarce (3%). There was also considerable variation in the dose of corticosteroids prescribed (Table 1). Among those respondents who prescribed corticosteroids (70% of total), eighteen per cent initiated corticosteroid therapy less than 72 hours after the onset of ARDS, a further 12% within one week, 38% between 7 and 14 days and 15% after two weeks. The duration of therapy was ≤ 1 week in 56% and between 8–14 days in 34%. Corticosteroids are being used for their anti-fibrotic properties alone in 42% and anti-inflammatory effect alone in 23%. The remaining 25% suggested they are using corticosteroids for both clinical effects. The method of corticosteroid cessation was abrupt in 37% and by a tapered reducing-dose regime in 63%. Free text comments highlighted that the use of corticosteroids were dependent on several other factors. These included: concomitant use of vasopressors (especially increasing doses); the presence of sepsis; radiological (CT) evidence of ARDS with active lung fibrosis; treatment failure/non-progressing patients; and evidence of endogenous steroid deficiency.

Table 1
The type and dose of steroid therapy initiated for acute respiratory distress syndrome

The data expressed as a percentage of responses to the total response for the type of corticosteroid initiated.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)

Eighty three percent of respondents use "occasional" or "individualised NMB as part of the management of ARDS. Fifteen per cent of respondents describe using NMB "routinely".

Prostaglandins or their derivatives

The majority of respondents (56%) reported never using prostaglandins or their derivatives in the management of ARDS, whilst 1.6% reported using them "routinely". The remaining responses (42%) were equally divided between "occasional" and "individualised" use.

Statins

Most had "never" used statins (74%) and few used them "routinely" (3%). The remainder declared that statin use was "occasional" or "individualised" according to the patient (or indeed if part of a clinical research study).

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1152wgtS]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in ARDS — In subgroup analyses, patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (> 7 d) had higher rates of survival than those who received a shorter course (7 d or less) (p value for subgroup interaction = 0.04, moderate credibility). The use of corticosteroids may lead to fewer days of mechanical ventilation (low certainty) and a shorter hospital length of stay (low certainty), with uncertain effects on ICU length of stay (very low certainty), neuromuscular weakness (very low certainty) and GI bleeding (low certainty). There was probably an increase in hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23, moderate certainty). Evidence to Recommendation states that the panel decided that corticosteroids offered moderate desirable effects, driven primarily by moderate certainty evidence that corticosteroids reduce mortality and low certainty evidence that they reduce hospital length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, while ongoing uncertainty remained due to small positive trials, lack of long-term outcomes, and that half of included patients had COVID-19 ARDS.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Special considerations and dosing note that "The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidelines had previously recommended giving methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/d within 14 days of the diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of < 200) (4)". This panel "decided to remove the qualifier based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio from the most recent recommendation". Updated analysis "did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid timing or type or dosage", so "a specific recommendation was not made for corticosteroid molecules". Reported dosing "range from 40 mg/d to 2 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone equivalent with a common duration ranging from 7 to 30 days", and common molecules in RCTs include "Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone".

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117MjuoD]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome presents as hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of heart failure sufficient to account for this clinical state. Management is largely supportive, and is focused on protective mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of fluid overload. Patients with severe hypoxaemia can be managed with early short-term use of neuromuscular blockade, prone position ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of inhaled nitric oxide is rarely indicated and both β₂ agonists and late corticosteroids should be avoided. Mortality remains at approximately 30%.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^116BwYep]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sepsis — In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, the panel noted benefit regardless of dose and did not name a specific agent or regimen; commonly used regimens included IV hydrocortisone 200–300 mg/d in divided doses or continuous infusion for 5–7 days, with some studies adding fludrocortisone 50 μg enterally daily, while historical high-dose/short-duration regimens (over 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent for less than 3 days) are not supported due to adverse effects; if sepsis presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia or with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the panel states to administer corticosteroids as per those respective recommendations, and no specific recommendations on fludrocortisone use were made.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113St5BX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The overall benefits and potential risks of corticosteroids, frequently administered to critically ill patients remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis or septic shock, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesized that corticosteroids reduce short-term mortality in critically ill patients.

Methods

We performed a search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception up to November 30, 2024. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials in human populations published in English. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RRs) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was short-term mortality (28-day or nearest reported). Secondary outcomes included ICU/hospital length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, ventilator-free days at 28 days, oxygenation index, reversed shock in sepsis or septic shock, and adverse events. We evaluated heterogeneity using I 2 and explored it using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

Results

Forty-three randomized controlled trials (n = 10853) were included. Corticosteroids reduced short-term mortality in critically ill patients compared to placebo (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77–0.94). Corticosteroid treatment for critically ill patients reduced intensive care unit (MD, -2.02 days; 95% CI, -3.14 - -0.90) and hospital (MD, -2.66 days; 95% CI, -4.58 - -0.74) lengths of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, -4.24 days; 95% CI, -6.38 - -2.10); it increased ventilator-free days at 28 days (MD, 2.83 days; 95% CI, 1.20–4.47), improved oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2) in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MD, 61.41 mmHg; 95% CI, 26.64–96.18), and reversed shock in sepsis or septic shock (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06–1.35). No significant differences were observed in infection rates (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92–1.12) and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86–1.33). Hyperglycemia was more prevalent in the corticosteroid group (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06–1.14).

Conclusions

Subgroup analysis indicated that early initiation (≤ 72 h), low-dose (e.g., < 400 mg/day hydrocortisone equivalent), and prolonged (≥ 7 days) corticosteroid therapy was associated with reduced short-term mortality in critically ill patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. For septic shock, combination therapy (hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone) may enhance efficacy.

Systemic Corticosteroids

Caution has been raised about the widespread use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19. Observational studies in patients with SARS and MERS reported no association between systemic corticosteroids (often at high dose) and improved survival, but they suggested that corticosteroids induced side effects, including osteonecrosis, and reduced viral clearance. The World Health Organization initially recommended against the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the pandemic, except in two clinical settings: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COPD exacerbations, in which specific indications for systemic corticosteroids were recognized.

A large, randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has shown that dexamethasone treatment at 6 mg/d for up to 10 days reduced mortality in patients receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or oxygen alone. A small observational study has also reported that methylprednisolone use was associated with improved survival in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. Further studies have also reported the benefits of systemic glucocorticoids on reduction of mortality at 28 days in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially those that are not on IMV or on pressor support.

Systemic steroids should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications whether or not there is evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, as there is no evidence that this approach modifies the susceptibility to a SARS-CoV-2 infection or worsens outcomes (Figure 1).

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^111whCba]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using the following search terms: ("ALI" OR "acute lung injury" OR "ARDS" OR "acute respiratory distress syndrome") AND ("steroids" OR "corticoid" OR "corticosteroid" OR "glucocorticoids" OR "hydrocortisone" OR "prednisolone" OR "dexamethasone" OR "methylprednisolone") AND ("randomized controlled trial" OR "controlled clinical trial" OR "randomized" OR "randomly" OR "trial"). The detail of the search strategy is shown in Additional file 1. Publication species were limited to humans. Besides, bibliographies of identified studies were also searched manually.

Study selection

The eligibility of each study identified from the literature search was assessed independently in a blinded fashion by two researchers. English-language, peer-reviewed studies meeting the following criteria were included in this meta-analysis: (1) study design: RCTs; (2) participant: adult patients with ARDS; (3) intervention: glucocorticoids versus control; (4) at least one of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratios), and adverse events. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Data abstraction and quality assessment

Using a standardized data collection form, two investigators independently extracted the following data from each eligible study: first author, publication year, number of patients, inclusion criteria, corticosteroid type, corticosteroid dose, therapy duration, and main outcomes. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. If hospital mortality was not reported, we used the closest time point for our analysis. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios, and adverse events.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the eligible studies. This tool comprises seven domains, and each domain scores as low, unclear, or high risk of bias: adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel to the research protocol, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

### Corticosteroid therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a multicenter, retrospective study [^11245xrW]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which has been at the center of an ongoing global pandemic. Corticoid therapy is currently a key treatment regimen and recommended specifically for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the effect of corticoid treatment for COVID-19 patients is still under evaluation. For example, one study showed that in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the use of dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality in both patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone. Another systemic review and meta-analysis showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality and the use of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients compared to those on standard care. A third study demonstrated that methylprednisolone administration reduced the risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although there was no adjustment for immortal time bias and indication bias by time-varying confounding variables. In contrast, in a randomized trial from Brazil including 393 COVID-19 patients indicated no significance difference in 28-day mortality rates between administration of methylprednisolone and placebo.

Due to uncertainty regarding efficacy of corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19, it is imperative to evaluate its role in the management of COVID-19. Immortal time bias and indication bias should be adjusted when evaluating the role of corticosteroid for COVID-19 patients in observational cohort studies. Immortal time bias refers to the requirement that patients survive long enough to receive the intervention of interest, leading to a potential incorrect overestimation of a positive treatment effect. Indication bias from time-varying confounding variables refers to having an association related to the indication of the intervention that evolves throughout the course of an illness. MSM allows proper adjustment for immortal time bias and indication bias. In this retrospective study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids for the patients with COVID-19 using multivariate analyses. Logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazards model (Cox) and marginal structural modeling (MSM) were utilized to explore the relationship between the initiation of corticosteroid therapy and 90-day mortality as well as SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. Importantly, baseline and time varying confounding factors were adjusted, with MSM allowing for proper adjustment of time-dependent confounding variables.

### Corticosteroids in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults: meta-analysis [^1149jwqP]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the efficacy of steroids in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill adults, and treatment for established ARDS.

Data Sources

Search of randomised controlled trials (1966-April 2007) of PubMed, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, American College of Physicians Journal Club, health technology assessment database, and database of abstracts of reviews of effects.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data into standardised forms; differences were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Steroid efficacy was assessed through a Bayesian hierarchical model for comparing the odds of developing ARDS and mortality (both expressed as odds ratio with 95% credible interval) and duration of ventilator free days, assessed as mean difference. Bayesian outcome probabilities were calculated as the probability that the odds ratio would be ≥ 1 or the probability that the mean difference would be ≥ 0. Nine randomised trials using variable dose and duration of steroids were identified. Preventive steroids (four studies) were associated with a trend to increase both the odds of patients developing ARDS (odds ratio 1.55, 95% credible interval 0.58 to 4.05; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 86.6%), and the risk of mortality in those who subsequently developed ARDS (three studies, odds ratio 1.52, 95% credible interval 0.30 to 5.94; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 72.8%). Steroid administration after onset of ARDS (five studies) was associated with a trend towards reduction in mortality (odds ratio 0.62, 95% credible interval 0.23 to 1.26; P(odds ratio ≥ 1) = 6.8%). Steroid therapy increased the number of ventilator free days compared with controls (three studies, mean difference 4.05 days, 95% credible interval 0.22 to 8.71; P(mean difference ≥ 0) = 97.9%). Steroids were not associated with increase in risk of infection.

Conclusions

A definitive role of corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS in adults is not established. A possibility of reduced mortality and increased ventilator free days with steroids started after the onset of ARDS was suggested. Preventive steroids possibly increase the incidence of ARDS in critically ill adults.

### Dexamethasone treatment for the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^112Xcgd7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

There is no proven specific pharmacological treatment for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial. We aimed to assess the effects of dexamethasone in ARDS, which might change pulmonary and systemic inflammation and result in a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality.

We did a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a network of 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in teaching hospitals across Spain in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 200 mm Hg or less assessed with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H 2 O or more and FiO₂ of 0.5 or more at 24 h after ARDS onset). Patients with brain death, terminal-stage disease, or receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced treatment assignments with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence using blocks of 10 opaque, sealed envelopes to receive immediate treatment with dexamethasone or continued routine intensive care (control group). Patients in the dexamethasone group received an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. Patients in both groups were ventilated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation from day of randomisation to day 28. Secondary outcome was all-cause mortality 60 days after randomisation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731795.

Findings

Between March 28, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, we enrolled 277 patients and randomly assigned 139 patients to the dexamethasone group and 138 to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data safety monitoring board due to low enrolment rate after enrolling more than 88% (277/314) of the planned sample size. The mean number of ventilator-free days was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference 4.8 days [95% CI 2.57 to 7.03]; p < 0.0001). At 60 days, 29 (21%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 50 (36%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference -15.3% [-25.9 to -4.9]; p = 0.0047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone group and control group. The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia in the ICU (105 [76%] patients in the dexamethasone group vs 97 [70%] patients in the control group), new infections in the ICU (eg, pneumonia or sepsis; 33 [24%] vs 35 [25%]), and barotrauma (14 [10%] vs 10 [7%]).

Interpretation

Early administration of dexamethasone could reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^112yQ37o]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

### Impact of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RVta3]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since its appearance in late 2019, infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have created unprecedented challenges for health systems worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options have been explored, including corticosteroids. Preliminary results of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are encouraging; however, the role of corticosteroids remains controversial.

Research Question

What is the impact of corticosteroids in mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic review of literature on corticosteroids and COVID-19 in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) of published literature through July 22, 2020, that report outcomes of interest in COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroids with a comparative group.

Results

A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 patients were identified. Corticosteroid use was reported widely in mechanically ventilated patients (35.3%), ICU patients (51.3%), and severe COVID-19 patients (40%). Corticosteroids showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51–0.83; p = 0.0006); however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted among high-dose or low-dose corticosteroid regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose corticosteroids do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids regimens.

Interpretation

Our results showed evidence of mortality benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are used widely in COVID-19 patients worldwide, and a rapidly developing global pandemic warrants further high-quality clinical trials to define the most beneficial timing and dosing for corticosteroids.

### Do we know enough to recommend corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^114XAbFT]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

We read with interest the evidence-based recommendations for the use of prolonged corticosteroids in early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) published in Critical Care Medicine by the Corticosteroid Guideline Task Force of SCCM and ESICM. Whether corticosteroids have to be administered in adult patients with ARDS remains a matter of debate. Based on nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including eight RCTs selected in the meta-analysis of Meduri et al. and one additional recent RCT, the task force found that the use of prolonged corticosteroids in early ARDS has a beneficial effect on in-hospital mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89). However, several caveats and limitations must be pointed out.

First, two trials from the meta-analysis (Rezk 2013, Sabry 2011), which were not found in the Medline/PubMed database, are at high risk of bias (especially concerning the blinding of participants and staff), and two others (Confalonieri 2005, Liu 2012), which show impressive results, are questionable. Indeed, in the Confalonieri study, delayed septic shock was far more often observed in the placebo group (52%) than in the hydrocortisone group (0%). It is unlikely that such a difference can be attributed to a beneficial effect of hydrocortisone in light of the results of the HYPRESS multicenter trial that showed that hydrocortisone did not prevent progression from severe sepsis to septic shock. In the Liu study, there was a major attrition bias since the placebo group showed markedly significant higher baseline arterial lactate concentrations.

As a result, Ruan et al.'s meta-analysis, which did not include these four small trials, found that corticosteroids in ARDS did not improve longer-term outcomes and even more could be harmful in certain subgroups, such as influenza-related ARDS.

In addition, corticosteroids did not seem to have significant side effects other than hyperglycemia. However, it can be speculated that the rate of side effects should be higher in a real-life population of ARDS, as patients with immunodepression, uncontrolled diabetes or at high risk of side effects were not included in these trials.

Considering all these points, we believe that the recommendations of the task force for adjunctive corticosteroids in ARDS are based on insufficient evidence, and at least should be limited to the subset of patients who could have been included in the supportive trials. It thus seems rather prudent to wait for the results of the ongoing multicentric trials evaluating this strategy.

### Therapeutic strategies for severe acute lung injury [^111csWyL]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In the management of patients with severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, clinicians are sometimes challenged to maintain acceptable gas exchange while avoiding harmful mechanical ventilation practices. In some of these patients, physicians may consider the use of "rescue therapies" to sustain life. Our goal is to provide a practical, evidence-based review to assist critical care physicians' care for patients with severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Data Sources

We searched the PubMed database for clinical trials that examined the use of the following therapies in severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: recruitment maneuvers, high positive end-expiratory pressure, prone position, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, glucocorticoids, inhaled nitric oxide, buffer therapy, and extracorporeal life support.

Study Selection

All clinical trials that included patients with severe acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

The primary author reviewed the aforementioned trials in depth and then disputed findings and conclusions with the other authors until consensus was achieved.

Conclusions

This article is designed to provide clinicians with a simple bedside definition for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome; to describe several therapies that can be used for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with an emphasis on the potential risks and the indications and benefits; and to offer practical guidelines for implementation of these therapies.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — methylprednisolone use is characterized by earlier initiation and specified dosing, with the task force noting a reduction in hospital mortality by approximately 7% and 11% in mild and severe ARDS, respectively, and that early (< 72 h) versus late (≥ 7 days) initiation shows response to a low dose (1 mg/kg/day vs 2 mg/kg/day) with faster disease resolution. An individual patient data analysis of four trials (n = 322) confirmed improved survival and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. The task force suggested that methylprednisolone be considered in early ARDS (up to day 7 of onset; PaO2/FiO2 of < 200) at 1 mg/kg/day and in late (after day 6 of onset) persistent ARDS at 2 mg/kg/day followed by slow tapering over 13 days; methylprednisolone should be weaned slowly (6–14 days) and not stopped rapidly (2–4 days), and infection surveillance is recommended because glucocorticoids blunt the febrile response.

### An evidence-based approach to acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114YGwWS]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

We provide an evidence-based approach to managing patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We searched MEDLINE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health for randomized trials evaluating lung-protective ventilation strategies, inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and late-phase corticosteroids for managing these patients, and for additional literature related to long-term follow-up of ARDS survivors. The results of our review suggest that pressure- and volume-limited ventilation, according to the ARDS Network protocol, can reduce mortality for patients with acute lung injury, and so may an "open lung" approach to mechanical ventilation. Those 2 strategies are currently being compared in 2 multicenter randomized trials. Although both inhaled nitric oxide therapy and prone positioning can produce dramatic acute improvements in oxygenation for some patients, there is no evidence that these interventions can benefit patients with respect to patient-important outcomes. Therefore it is unreasonable to be dogmatic about the role of inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning in ARDS. The role of corticosteroids in the late phase of ARDS is unclear and remains a very important unanswered question. With respect to long-term follow-up, we found that pulmonary dysfunction is probably not a major source of morbidity for ARDS survivors, whereas neuropsychological dysfunction is prominent. Ongoing research may suggest interventions to improve the outcome of ARDS and of critical illness in general.

Table 3
Subgroup analysis by timing of starting corticosteroid therapy

Three studies were excluded in this analysis due to no report of treatment timing.

Published meta-analyses reached inconsistent conclusions on the role of corticosteroids for ARDS. We summarize the study conclusions and study selection strategy of previous meta-analyses in Table 4. Among the included studies in these meta-analyses, an extremely protective effect for corticosteroids was observed in the two studies published by Meduri, but the effects were neutral and modest in other trials. In addition, inclusion or exclusion of trials of using corticosteroids in severe pneumonia into analysis also had an impact on the results of meta-analysis. Confalonieri and Meduri reported remarkable mortality reduction by corticosteroid therapy in a severe pneumonia study. Previous meta-analyses reporting significant mortality reduction of corticosteroid therapy usually included this pneumonia study. However, a large cohort study using a registry database reported that low-dose corticosteroids were associated with an increased mortality in pneumonia with septic shock.

Table 4
Comparisons of published meta-analyses

ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; RCTs, randomized controlled trials.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy may bring several unfavorable side effects, and one major concern in patients with ARDS is an increased risk of nosocomial infection secondary to immunosuppression. Because symptoms and signs of early infection may be masked by corticosteroids, previous RCTs performed intensive infection surveillance procedures during the study to reduce the risk of superinfection. However, these intensive surveillance procedures are not always performed outside of clinical studies. Our analysis showed that the infection risks reported in RCTs and cohort studies were conflicting (Figure 3). It is not known whether restrictive patient selection and infection surveillance procedures in RCTs played a role in making such a difference. Similar to the concern for mortality outcomes, the infection risk of corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated in an adequate time frame because the immunosuppressive effect may develop late in the clinical course. However, most studies evaluated infectious complications in a short duration (Additional file 1: e-Table S6) and the infection risk of corticosteroid therapy might, therefore, be underestimated.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Q9gKF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated the diverse treatment effects of corticosteroids among different etiologies of ARDS (Table 2). It is biologically plausible that different etiologies of ARDS have different responses to corticosteroid therapy because the pulmonary fibroproliferative response to injury may occur in an injury-specific rather than a stereotyped manner. The main damage targets differ in ARDS caused by different etiologies. Therefore, it is not surprising that the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy differs among different etiologies. Additionally, our analysis showed that corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS. The poorer outcome may be attributed to prolonged viral shedding and an increased risk of superinfection. An expert review also advised against use of corticosteroids in the management of H1N1 influenza A infection.

The dosage and timing of corticosteroid therapy in ARDS has changed over the last decades. Based on the equivalent doses of methylprednisolone, studies before 1990 usually used a high daily dose (30 mg/kg) and short period (≤ 2 days) regimen to prevent or treat ARDS. In the following two decades, most studies used a protocol of daily dose of ≤ 2 mg/kg with a gradual taper. Some investigators suggested different treatment dosages for early ARDS and persistent ARDS in which a duration of ARDS ≤ 3 days was considered as early ARDS and ≥ 5 days as persistent or unresolving ARDS. The treatment dose was suggested to be ≤ 1 mg/Kg for early ARDS, and 2 mg/Kg for persistent ARDS. We summarized the treatment outcomes of corticosteroid therapy initiated at different stages of ARDS (Table 3). Our analysis found that patients with persistent ARDS seemed more likely to benefit from corticosteroid therapy. In addition, the subgroup analysis of the ARDSnet steroid study suggested against starting corticosteroid therapy > 14 days after the onset of ARDS. These findings suggest a subgroup of ARDS might benefit most from corticosteroid therapy: persistent ARDS with the onset of ARDS < 14 days. Persistent ARDS indicates a specific subgroup or phenotype of ARDS that is characterized by exaggerated or unresolving lung inflammation. In this subgroup, the benefit of corticosteroid therapy may outweigh the treatment risk. Dosage and administration schedules may also affect treatment outcomes of corticosteroids. However, it was difficult to evaluate the effects of these two factors in the study-level analysis. Cohort studies did not use standardized treatment protocols and individual-level data are needed to conduct such analyses. In RCTs, therapeutic trials usually used a low-dose regimen (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and similar administration schedules.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113CPT6v]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains under debate. We aimed to explore the grounds for the inconsistent results in previous studies and update the evidence.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to December 2013. Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that reported mortality and that had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison. The effect of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality was assessed by relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for ICU, hospital, and 60-day mortality using a random-effects model.

Results

Eight RCTs and 10 cohort studies were included for analysis. In RCTs, corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on ICU mortality (RD, -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.53 to -0.03 and RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.25) but no effect on 60-day mortality (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.10 and RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26). In cohort studies, corticosteroids had no effect on ICU mortality (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.49) but non-significantly increased 60-day mortality (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.78). In the subgroup analysis by ARDS etiology, corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS (three cohort studies, RR, 2.45, 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.27).

Conclusions

The effects of corticosteroids on the mortality of ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures and etiologies. Corticosteroids did not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups. Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^115uPiWP]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

There were some meta-analyses exploring the effects of corticosteroids on other conditions such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), sepsis, and community-acquired pneumonia. Glucocorticoid use was found to be associated with significant improvement in clinical outcomes in these conditions. One possible reason for these findings was that critical illness might be associated with an impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress. ARDS is a devastating lung disorder and is associated with a high mortality rate. One study showed that critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) was common in ARDS (about 58%) and stress dose glucocorticoid was associated with prolong survival time. The early use of corticosteroid therapy might alleviate systemic inflammation caused by CIRCI and then was associated with survival benefit.

An anti-inflammatory pharmacologic intervention appears to be a reasonable strategy in ARDS in that dysregulated and excessive pulmonary inflammation is the pathophysiologic hallmarks of ARDS. Among the anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids are the main immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of ARDS. Early studies demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment led to rapid improvements in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ function in ARDS patients, with a significant reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma levels of proinflammatory mediators and chemokines. Animal experiments also found that corticosteroid treatment could alleviate lung injury and upregulate pulmonary glucocorticoid receptors. Unfortunately, clinical trials reported inconsistent results. Some trials found that glucocorticoids might reduce the risk of death in patients with ARDS. However, there also were some trials that failed to find such benefits. Until today, glucocorticoid use in ARDS remains highly controversial due to unclear benefits and potential side effects. Our meta-analysis pooled the latest data and suggested that glucocorticoids show beneficial effects in patients with ARDS without significant side effects. Therefore, glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS due to the beneficial effects. In addition, there has been significant progress in the management of ARDS in the past 20 years. High-quality clinical trials have confirmed that ventilation with lower tidal volumes and prone positioning can significantly decrease all-cause mortality of ARDS after 2000. With the progress of standards of care for patients with ARDS, whether glucocorticoid use can reduce the mortality rate of ARDS should be noted. When limiting to trials commenced after 2000, we found that glucocorticoid use is also associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.69–0.95; P = 0.01; I² = 46), indicating glucocorticoid use is still applicable today.

### COVID-19, asthma, and inhaled corticosteroids: another beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids? [^115kHeTo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a real pandemic. After a median incubation period of 5 days, the disease occurs in different stages, inducing upper and lower airway responses in mild disease (80–90% of patients) and progressing to bilateral pneumonia in severe disease (10–20%). A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation on intensive care. COVID-19 patients with preexisting comorbid conditions such as chronic respiratory diseases have worse disease outcomes, including a higher incidence of the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. However, it remains to be further investigated how preexisting chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their treatment might modify the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19. Approximately 300 million individuals worldwide have asthma. Considering that a significant proportion of individuals with asthma is confronted with COVID-19, it is crucial to understand which asthma patients are particularly at risk and how inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — the cornerstone of asthma treatment — may influence morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g. in transplant patients) is immunosuppressive, increasing the risk and severity of viral infections. Because of the potential risk for worse disease outcomes, the World Health Organization does not recommend systemic corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19, unless if indicated for other reasons such as acute asthma or COPD exacerbations requiring a short course of oral corticosteroids. These recommendations have caused doubt and uncertainty among patients with asthma and physicians on whether ICS therapy should be maintained during this pandemic. However, withdrawal of ICS treatment puts asthma patients at risk of severe exacerbations. A recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases using ICS concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to abandon the well-established ICS treatment in asthma. There is thus an urgent need to elucidate demographic and clinical characteristics that determine disease outcomes of COVID-19 in asthma, to investigate the impact of ICS and to unravel the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized adults — corticosteroid regimens across agents and durations were associated with several outcomes: Twelve trials suggested mortality reduction (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45–1.01). Compared with placebo, corticosteroids shortened hospital stay (risk difference −2.96, 95% CI −5.18–0.75), reduced the need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26–0.79), prevented acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10–0.56), and increased the risk for hyperglycemia (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.01–2.19), without other complications; typical agents listed were prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with a length of treatment of 4 to 10 days, and five additional studies were ongoing. The quality of evidence across outcomes was moderate, and the authors stated that "we agreed that the beneficial effects of treatment with corticosteroids outweighed the risks".
