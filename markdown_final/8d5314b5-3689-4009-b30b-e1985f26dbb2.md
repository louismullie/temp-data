## Question

What causes copd exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes COPD exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology of a COPD exacerbation. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories, especially infections versus environmental triggers. Next, I will examine the frequent exacerbator phenotype and host susceptibility. After that, I need to check for non-infectious mimics and comorbid contributors. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical clinical framework and note uncertainties and evidence gaps that affect management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. A COPD exacerbation is an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms beyond day-to-day variation that prompts a change in therapy, typically involving increased dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum production, and it is fundamentally characterized by an amplification of airway and often systemic inflammation superimposed on chronic COPD inflammation, with dynamic hyperinflation contributing to symptom severity.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I should categorize the precipitants. The most consistently identified triggers are respiratory infections and environmental exposures, with about two-thirds linked to infections or air pollution and roughly one-third having no identifiable cause in many series, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to evaluate each event in context [^116wu6RW] [^114xjzde].

> I will now examine infectious triggers, starting with viruses. Wait, let me verify the proportion attributed to viruses; modern PCR-based studies show viruses in roughly 34–56% of exacerbations, with human rhinovirus the most frequent, followed by influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and metapneumovirus, and viral-associated exacerbations tend to be more severe and longer, often precipitating hospitalization [^112nHmc9] [^111zXqj6] [^114xjzde]. But wait, what if viral detection lags symptom onset? That timing lag can underestimate viral causality, so a negative test does not exclude a viral trigger, especially early in the course [^112nHmc9].

> Next, I should review bacterial etiologies. Bacteria are isolated in about 50–70% of exacerbations, with common pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; atypical organisms like Chlamydia pneumoniae are implicated in a minority, and Pseudomonas becomes more relevant in severe disease or frequent exacerbators, which I need to keep in mind when choosing empiric therapy [^115us9Lk] [^116724KP] [^1144nr3F]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bacteria predominate in 70–75% of all exacerbations, but I should double-check; that higher estimate comes from older or selective cohorts, whereas contemporary data suggest a substantial viral burden and frequent mixed infections, so I should avoid overstating bacterial causation across all-comers [^115us9Lk] [^111zXqj6].

> Let me consider mixed infections and the viral–bacterial interface. Combined viral and bacterial infection is identified in about 25% of exacerbations and is associated with greater severity, likely reflecting viral-induced epithelial injury that facilitates secondary bacterial proliferation and altered lung microbiome dynamics, reinforcing the concept of an inflammatory cascade rather than a single-pathogen event [^115us9Lk] [^116724KP].

> I need to ensure I account for environmental triggers. Short-term exposure to elevated PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and wildfire smoke increases exacerbation risk, ED visits, hospitalizations, and mortality; traffic-related exhaust and even scented laundry products have been linked to exacerbations in observational studies, and temperature extremes, especially cold spells, further elevate risk, so exposure mitigation is a rational prevention target [^114xjzde] [^112fJfFi] [^1171mrKz] [^115rviYR].

> Now, I should review host susceptibility and the frequent exacerbator phenotype. The strongest predictor of future exacerbations is a history of prior exacerbations, and about 22% of GOLD 2 patients can already be frequent exacerbators, indicating a stable phenotype across severities characterized by higher baseline and post-exacerbation inflammation, altered airway microbiome, and worse outcomes including faster FEV1 decline and higher mortality risk [^115JsdFV] [^113Epj5r] [^111uCryj]. Hold on, I should verify the inflammatory signature; frequent exacerbators show persistently elevated sputum IL-6 and systemic CRP even during recovery, supporting an inflammatory susceptibility loop that may explain temporal clustering of events [^117Uk4LJ].

> Next, I should review non-infectious mimics and contributors. Exacerbation presentations can reflect heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, anxiety or panic, medication nonadherence, or aspiration; these comorbid or alternative diagnoses are common in older multimorbid COPD populations and can masquerade as or coexist with true inflammatory exacerbations, demanding deliberate differential diagnosis and targeted therapy rather than reflexive steroids and antibiotics [^114QXA57] [^115u8DQz] [^115wT5mG]. I should confirm that GOLD explicitly recommends evaluating for heart failure, pneumonia, and PE during exacerbation workups, which aligns with a treatable-traits approach [^114QXA57].

> Let me synthesize the mechanistic cascade to ensure internal consistency. A trigger (virus, bacterium, pollutant, or comorbidity) provokes an acute increase in airway inflammation on a background of chronic COPD inflammation, amplifies neutrophilic and, in some cases, eosinophilic pathways, increases mucus production and airway wall thickening, worsens expiratory flow limitation, and precipitates dynamic hyperinflation that drives dyspnea and respiratory failure in severe events; this mechanistic frame explains why bronchodilators, corticosteroids in selected phenotypes, and antibiotics for bacterial signals are foundational, while trigger avoidance and phenotype-targeted prevention modify risk over time [^112i7nCe] [^115UMonG] [^113TWLay].

> But wait, what about the proportion with unknown cause? I should double-check that estimate. Contemporary guidelines and reviews still cite that approximately one-third of exacerbations have no identified cause despite evaluation, highlighting diagnostic limitations, timing of sampling, and the possibility of noninfectious inflammatory flares or underrecognized comorbid drivers, which reinforces the need for careful history, examination, and judicious testing rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^116wu6RW] [^112nHmc9] [^113tGLA2].

> Finally, I need to translate this into a practical clinical framework. In any patient presenting with worsening dyspnea, cough, or sputum, I should confirm the diagnosis of an exacerbation, grade severity by care setting and need for hospitalization, actively search for infectious and environmental triggers with viral testing, sputum studies, and exposure history, screen for mimics such as heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism, and stratify future risk using prior exacerbation history to guide prevention strategies including vaccinations, smoking cessation, optimized inhaled therapy, and self-management plans, aligning with GOLD's emphasis on individualized, risk-based care [^115JsdFV] [^114QXA57] [^113TWLay] [^115rviYR].

COPD exacerbations are **most often triggered by respiratory infections** (viral or bacterial) [^112i7nCe] and by environmental exposures such as air pollution, with about 70% linked to infections and 20–30% to non-infectious causes [^notfound]. Viruses (especially rhinovirus and influenza) [^114xjzde] and bacteria (notably Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) are the principal infectious drivers [^1144nr3F], while pollutants, cold temperatures, and occupational exposures are key non-infectious triggers [^112fJfFi] [^1171mrKz]. Exacerbations reflect a **burst of airway and systemic inflammation** [^112i7nCe] that worsens airflow limitation and hyperinflation, with risk shaped by prior exacerbations, disease severity, smoking, comorbidities, and poor adherence [^115JsdFV]. Identifying and addressing these triggers — along with infection control, exposure reduction, and optimized therapy — are central to prevention [^113TWLay] [^114jKjB4].

---

## Infectious triggers

Infections are the **most common cause of COPD exacerbations**, accounting for about 70% of cases [^116wu6RW] [^114xjzde].

---

### Viral infections

- **Viruses are detected in 47–56% of exacerbations**, with rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and metapneumovirus most frequent [^112nHmc9] [^114xjzde].
- **Viral exacerbations are often more severe**, longer, and more likely to require hospitalization [^111zXqj6] [^114xjzde].
- **Dual viral–bacterial infections occur in ~25%** of exacerbations and are associated with greater severity [^115us9Lk].

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Bacteria are isolated in ~50% of exacerbations**, with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis most common [^115us9Lk] [^1144nr3F].
- **Bacterial exacerbations are more frequent in patients with chronic bronchitis** and advanced disease [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics are beneficial in bacterial exacerbations**, particularly when sputum purulence is present [^113zGnDp].

---

## Non-infectious triggers

Non-infectious factors account for **20–30% of exacerbations** [^notfound].

---

### Environmental exposures

- **Air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO2)** is strongly linked to increased exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality [^112fJfFi] [^114xjzde].
- **Short-term exposure to pollutants** (traffic, wildfire smoke, indoor biomass) acutely worsens symptoms [^112fJfFi] [^1171mrKz].
- **Cold temperatures and heatwaves** independently increase exacerbation risk [^1144nr3F] [^114xjzde].

---

### Occupational exposures

Occupational exposures to **dusts, fumes, and chemicals** in the workplace increase exacerbation risk, particularly in those with established COPD [^notfound].

---

### Medication non-adherence and improper inhaler technique

Medication non-adherence and improper inhaler technique are associated with **increased exacerbation risk**; optimizing adherence and technique reduces exacerbations [^113TWLay] [^114jKjB4].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Exacerbations reflect a **complex interplay** of host, pathogen, and environmental factors that amplify inflammation and worsen airflow limitation [^112xFViT].

---

### Inflammatory response

During exacerbations, **airway and systemic inflammation increase**, with neutrophils, macrophages, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) rising and contributing to tissue damage and hyperinflation [^113zGnDp] [^117Uk4LJ].

---

### Dynamic hyperinflation

Dynamic hyperinflation from **expiratory flow limitation** increases work of breathing, worsens dyspnea, and can precipitate respiratory failure [^115UMonG].

---

### Oxidative stress

Oxidative stress is increased during exacerbations, particularly with pollutants or smoking, and contributes to **inflammation and tissue injury** [^1161eNGk] [^111S11rX].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient characteristics **increase susceptibility** to exacerbations:

- **Prior exacerbations**: The strongest predictor of future exacerbations [^111kttjg].
- **Disease severity**: Greater airflow limitation (GOLD 3–4) increases risk [^115JsdFV] [^113Epj5r].
- **Smoking**: Current smoking elevates exacerbation risk and severity [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, GERD, anxiety/depression, and osteoporosis increase risk [^111kttjg] [^111Tcyb6].
- **Low physical activity**: Independently predicts future exacerbations [^111kttjg].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention targets **identified triggers and risk factors**:

- **Vaccination**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines reduce infection-related exacerbations [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly reduces exacerbation frequency and severity [^notfound].
- **Environmental control**: Air purifiers, avoiding pollutants, and climate adaptation reduce triggers [^112fJfFi].
- **Optimized pharmacotherapy**: LAMA, LABA, ICS combinations, and adherence reduce exacerbations [^113TWLay] [^111Tcyb6].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and reduces exacerbations [^1127Y75f] [^114ERfxq].

---

COPD exacerbations are **primarily driven by infections** and environmental exposures, with risk modulated by host factors and comorbidities. Addressing these drivers through infection control, exposure reduction, and individualized therapy is essential to prevention and improved outcomes [^114xjzde] [^113TWLay].

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

### Diagnosis of pathogens in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115us9Lk]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in prevalence. Acute exacerbations of COPD are the major cause worldwide of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs as well as decreased quality of life for the individual. The majority of exacerbations are infectious in etiology. Bacteria are detected in 50% of exacerbations and polymerase chain reaction techniques have established that, in half to two-thirds of exacerbations, viruses are causative pathogens. Combined bacterial and viral infection can be identified in 25% of exacerbations and these dual infections are often more severe. Despite occurring frequently, the mechanisms by which infection with these pathogens causes exacerbations are incompletely understood. This highlights the need for continued research, because a greater understanding of the mechanism of COPD exacerbations may lead to identification of potential targets for the development of therapeutic options for this increasingly common condition.

### Is one exacerbation enough to modify therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^114oCwQm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy for how COPD is diagnosed and managed emphasizes the importance of assessing both respiratory symptoms and exacerbations in the classification of COPD. The threshold for exacerbations to move from a less severe (Category A or B) to a more severe (Category E) group is one severe exacerbation or two or more moderate exacerbations. This threshold is the subject of the study by Vanfleteren and colleagues (pp.) that appears in this issue of the Journal.

Although acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) are common and critically important events, several questions surround their definition. The standard definition for AECOPD is a post hoc definition that is based on utilization: Exacerbations that are treated in an outpatient setting with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics are classified as moderate, and those that result in hospitalization are classified as severe. This concept has been challenged, however, with the concept that physiologic measures should be used to classify exacerbations. Although this approach may work with hospitalized patients, for whom the physiologic data needed to classify exacerbations are available, it will not work with outpatients, for whom a range of exacerbation severity is also likely. Additional questions related to AECOPDs include when the exacerbations actually begin and end and optimal prevention strategies, as well as the question addressed in this paper: whether one moderate exacerbation is more similar to two moderate exacerbations or no moderate exacerbations.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^112KBPsb]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with a significant mortality, health and economic burden. Their diagnosis, assessment and management remain suboptimal and unchanged for decades. Recent clinical and translational studies revealed that the significant heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of exacerbations could be resolved by grouping them etiologically. This is anticipated to lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that underlie each type of exacerbation and to allow the introduction of precision medicine interventions that could improve outcomes. This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations.

### COPD exacerbations. 2: aetiology [^1161eNGk]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of COPD are thought to be caused by complex interactions between the host, bacteria, viruses, and environmental pollution. These factors increase the inflammatory burden in the lower airways, overwhelming the protective anti-inflammatory defences leading to tissue damage. Frequent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, a faster decline in lung function, and poorer health status, so prevention or optimal treatment of exacerbations is a global priority. In order to evolve new treatment strategies there has been great interest in the aetiology and pathophysiology of exacerbations, but progress has been hindered by the heterogeneous nature of these episodes, vague definitions of an exacerbation, and poor stratification of known confounding factors when interpreting results. We review how an exacerbation should be defined, its inflammatory basis, and the importance of exacerbations on disease progression. Important aetiologies, with their potential underlying mechanisms, are discussed and the significance of each aetiology is considered.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 6: the aetiology of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112UJnSj]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of COPD are thought to be caused by interactions between host factors, bacteria, viruses, and changes in air quality to produce increased inflammation in the lower airway. The evidence for this and the potential mechanisms by which they result in the characteristic symptoms of exacerbations is reviewed. A better understanding of the causes and processes is needed for the appropriate use of existing treatments and the development of new ones. Future studies need to define populations clearly, stratify for known confounding factors, and should aim to identify clinical correlates so that clinical practice can be modified appropriately.

### COPD exacerbations: causes, prevention, and treatment [^1167Yh5z]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation are complex. Respiratory viruses (in particular rhinovirus) and bacteria play a major role in the cause of these events. A distinct group of patients seems susceptible to frequent exacerbations, irrespective of disease severity, and this phenotype is stable over time. Many current therapeutic strategies help reduce exacerbation frequency. Further work is required to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapies for exacerbation prevention and treatment. This article focuses on the cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, and the current preventative and acute interventions available.

### Exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: do they contribute to disease progression? [^116zA2EE]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations on decline in FEV₁ has been a controversial topic for decades. We will review some of the key studies in this area and discuss potential contributors to inconsistent results of these studies. Dissecting the heterogeneous COPD syndrome into meaningful subtypes and assessing the genetic and environmental influences on COPD-related phenotypes such as exacerbation frequency could clarify the impact of exacerbations on the natural history of COPD.

---

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^115LQ9cp]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112CENvL]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^116wu6RW]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — definition, operational criteria, severity, and common precipitants are described as an event with acute symptom change that may warrant medication change; operationally, an increase in treatment beyond regular or urgent care is required in an emergency department (ED) or a hospital; in clinical trials, treatment is defined by antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, or both; severity is ranked as mild (symptoms without treatment or outcome change), moderate (medication change such as antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids), or severe (leads to hospitalization); and two-thirds are associated with respiratory tract infections or air pollution while one-third have no identifiable cause.

---

### COPD exacerbations: defining their cause and prevention [^112i7nCe]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of worsening of symptoms, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinflation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations. Several pharmacological interventions are effective for the reduction of exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support are becoming increasingly important, but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention is in assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improvement of health status, and reduction of hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^111FksNE]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations, punctuating the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are associated with significant mortality as well as health and socioeconomic burden. They are the main drivers of the poor outcomes of COPD, which is consequently ranked as a leading cause of death and disability globally. It is estimated that every year 22%–40% of all patients with COPD experience at least one moderate or severe exacerbation, while 9%–16% experience more than one. As a result, exacerbations are responsible for one in eight emergency hospital admissions in the UK; an enormous number, considering that the 3-month mortality rate of a hospitalised exacerbation exceeds 15%. Patients experiencing frequent exacerbations have worse quality of life, accelerated lung function declineand are at increased risk of future exacerbations, myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular events and mortality.

With a definition, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies that remain insufficient and unchanged for decades, COPD exacerbations represent a major, unaddressed global health need. More specifically, their definition and diagnostic criteria are solely based on clinical characteristics, which lack specificity. The same symptoms are present in stable COPD or they can result from other respiratory or cardiac diseases. Therapeutically, exacerbations are approached as a single entity and treated uniformly with the administration of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and commonly antibiotics. In reality, they are heterogeneous, characterised by diverging underlying mechanisms, outcomes and treatment needs. More specifically, only about 30%–50% of all exacerbations are associated with enhanced airway eosinophilic inflammation and appear to respond to systemic corticosteroids, whereas around 50% are triggered by bacterial infections and may respond to antibiotics. Finally, around 30% that are triggered by virusesare currently not treated etiologically, despite the availability of potentially beneficial treatments. Importantly, the heterogeneity of COPD extends beyond exacerbations. Therefore, subgroups of patients may be predisposed to specific subtypes of exacerbations, suggesting a potential role of precision medicine in exacerbations prevention.

This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations. A detailed description of the epidemiology, mechanisms, impact or outcomes of pneumonia, in patients with COPD, or of disease entities that could mimic COPD exacerbations was considered beyond the scope of this review.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116f15gw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease definition and key features — The ATS and ERS define COPD as a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, with airflow limitation usually progressive and associated with a chronic inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases; cigarette smoking is the most common risk factor, dyspnea and exacerbations are the most prominent respiratory manifestations, and COPD is particularly common among the elderly and associated with risk factors such as smoking, pollution, aging, inactivity, and diet.

### COPD exacerbation: lost in translation [^113eT34Q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The introduction and acceptance of a standard definition can be helpful in the clinical management of COPD patients. First, exacerbations could be detected and treated promptly. This is important since a delay in starting appropriate treatment is associated with a delay in the recovery from an exacerbation. Second, frequent exacerbators who require treatment that reduces exacerbation frequency could be identified in early stages of the disease and could be treated appropriately.

The latest GOLD executive committee recognised the necessity for a standard definition of exacerbations. Although GOLD executive summary in 2001 used a general description of exacerbations based on the worsening of the clinical condition of the patient, avoiding the use a standard definition, GOLD has now included a definition of exacerbation in the guidelines for COPD. This is an important step forward.

The current definition states that: "an exacerbation of COPD is defined as an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum that is beyond normal day-to-day variations, is acute in onset, and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD". This definition is pragmatic and it is not in disagreement with previous definitions. Actually, the current definition compromises the different approaches for exacerbation. However, the inclusion of the "healthcare utilisation" approach (". may warrant a change in regular medication") in the current definition may introduce in the diagnosis of exacerbation factors related to the access to health care services which may not be related to the underlying pathophysiologal process which characterizes exacerbations.

In addition, it should be noted that the aetiology of COPD exacerbations has not yet been included in the current definition. In this respect, the definition does not acknowledge the fact that many patients with COPD may suffer from additional conditions, such as community acquired pneumonia, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary embolism that can masquerade as exacerbations but they should not be considered as causes of COPD exacerbations. In these cases the management may be challenging for physicians and mandatory for the patients. For example, patients presenting with symptoms of exacerbation may have pulmonary embolism which requires anticoagulation. However, warfarin (a common oral anticoagulative therapeutic agent) interacts with steroids or with antibiotics which are required for exacerbations treatment and thus, more intensive monitoring of the anticoagulative effect is required. Therefore, inclusion of the etiologic factors of COPD exacerbations in the definition might improve further the management of these cases.

### New developments in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115TduAZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were a poorly defined and understood entity. The application of better study designs and new research methodologies has shed considerable light on the pathogenesis of this common clinical syndrome.

Recent Findings

Inflammation is an important component of the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and exacerbations probably represent acute increases in airway inflammation brought about by one or more etiological agents. Environmental particulate and gaseous pollutants have been linked in epidemiological studies with increased respiratory symptoms and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bacterial, viral and atypical pathogens, either alone or in concert, induce the majority of acute exacerbations.

Summary

A bacterial cause of a substantial proportion of exacerbations is now firmly established by the results of bronchoscopy, molecular epidemiology, immunology and airway inflammation studies. Future research should focus on pathogenic mechanisms and host defence against the microbial pathogens associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in order to develop better treatment and prevention strategies.

### Similarities and differences in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^113mAc9H]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

There is no generally accepted definition of an exacerbation either for asthma or for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is little consistency among the symptomatic or functional criteria used in different studies. The most consistent criterion is the introduction of systemic corticosteroids for the acute worsening of the disease. The time course of an exacerbation does not seem to differ very much between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The decrease in peak flow rate is more pronounced in asthma than in COPD. The frequency of exacerbations is linked to disease severity both in asthma and COPD. Common causes are viral infections and increased environmental air pollution, whereas allergen exposure and bacterial infections are more specific for asthma and COPD exacerbations, respectively. Few data are available about the airway pathology of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Eosinophilia and/or neutrophilia have been associated with exacerbations in both diseases. Avoidance of the causal factors decreases exacerbation rate in both diseases. Pharmacologic prevention of exacerbations in asthma has been shown for inhaled corticosteroids, combination therapy with long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, and monoclonal anti-IgE. Inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting inhaled β₂-agonists, combination therapy with both, and the long-acting inhaled anticholinergic tiotropium decrease the exacerbation rate in COPD.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114XWTeM]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe, life-threatening asthma and COPD exacerbations are managed commonly in the ICU and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the commonalities and differences in the diagnosis and management of these obstructive lung diseases to improve patient outcomes via evidence-based care. In this review, we first outline triggers of acute asthma and COPD exacerbations and an initial diagnostic evaluation and severity assessment. We then review the pathophysiologic features of asthma and COPD exacerbations and create a framework for the management of exacerbations in critically ill adult patients aimed at reducing airway inflammation, reversing bronchospasm, and, in severe cases, supporting patients with mechanical ventilation or advanced therapies until clinical improvement is achieved.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^114hV1Pb]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of exacerbation risk: what do guidelines say?

COPD guidelines have historically just used lung function to grade the severity of disease, and guide treatment strategies. A more complex approach has been adopted recently, incorporating other clinical features to define clinical phenotypes. A phenotype is defined as "a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". The aim of phenotyping is to enable identification of patient groups that have distinctive prognostic or therapeutic characteristics, thereby enabling a personalized approach to treatment.

The definition of the "frequent exacerbator" phenotype, based on findings from the ECLIPSE study, has been incorporated into many COPD guidelines. Current GOLD strategy advocates assessment of exacerbation risk by: (i) GOLD spirometric classification, with GOLD 3 and 4 indicating high risk; or (ii) a history of exacerbations, with ≥ 2 exacerbations (or ≥ 1 exacerbation leading to hospitalization) in the previous year indicating high risk. GOLD subdivides patients into four categories, A, B, C or D, on the basis of symptoms and risk, with the aim of using this clinical assessment to make treatment decisions. Guidelines differ in how the risk of future exacerbations is assessed (see Additional file 1: Table S2), with a previous history of exacerbations being a common feature of many, but other characteristics such as FEV₁ included in some, but not all, guidelines, e.g. Spanish GesEPOC and the Saudi Thoracic Society. In fact, the Spanish (GesEPOC) guidelines have adopted a different approach to other national guidelines. Four clinical phenotypes are defined: non-exacerbators (< 2 exacerbations/year), an asthma-COPD overlap syndrome phenotype (ACOS), and two groups of frequent exacerbators (≥ 2 exacerbations/year), specifically exacerbators with emphysema and exacerbators with chronic bronchitis. Importantly, patients with ACOS experience more frequent and severe exacerbations, as well as worse disease-related quality of life, compared with patients having COPD.

### Preventing exacerbations in COPD [^116RRhaB]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with frequent exacerbations have high levels of anxiety and depression, significantly impaired health status and faster disease progression. Exacerbations are also the most common cause of emergency respiratory admissions to UK hospitals and are costly to health services. Here we assess whether and how drug and non-drug interventions can help in preventing exacerbations.

### Mechanisms and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111uCryj]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This review has described the impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype on patients with COPD and their considerable morbidity. Frequent exacerbators can be identified across the COPD disease spectrum and must be targeted for effective exacerbation prevention, both with pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents. Susceptibility to respiratory viral infection is likely to be an important mechanism in frequent exacerbators and novel interventions need to be developed to reduce viral infection at exacerbation. There is now some evidence that interventional therapy with an anti-inflammatory agent can modify the frequent exacerbator phenotype such that patients become infrequent exacerbators.

By understanding the mechanisms of development of frequent exacerbations, and applying appropriate interventions, we will be at last able to impact on the health status of this high-risk patient group.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### COPD exacerbation: lost in translation [^116KWEhw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The introduction and acceptance of a standard definition for exacerbations of COPD can be helpful in prompt diagnosis and management of these events. The latest GOLD executive committee recognised this necessity and it has now included a definition of exacerbation in the guidelines for COPD which is an important step forward in the management of the disease. This definition is pragmatic and compromises the different approaches for exacerbation. However, the inclusion of the "healthcare utilisation" approach (". may warrant a change in regular medication") in the definition may introduce in the diagnosis of exacerbation factors related to the access to health care services which may not be related to the underlying pathophysiological process which characterizes exacerbations. It should be also noted that the aetiology of COPD exacerbations has not yet been included in the current definition. In this respect, the definition does not acknowledge the fact that many patients with COPD may suffer from additional conditions (i.e. congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary embolism) that can masquerade as exacerbations but they should not be considered as causes of them. The authors therefore suggest that an inclusion of the etiologic factors of COPD exacerbations in the definition. Moreover, COPD exacerbations are characterized by increased airway and systemic inflammation and significant deterioration in lung function. These fundamental aspects should be accounted in diagnosis/definition of exacerbations. This could be done by the introduction of a "laboratory" marker in the diagnosis of these acute events. The authors acknowledge that the use of a test or a biomarker in the diagnosis of exacerbations meets certain difficulties related to performing lung function tests or to sampling during exacerbations. However, the introduction of a test that reflects airway or systemic inflammation in the diagnosis of exacerbations might be another step forward in the management of COPD.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Definitions of exacerbations: does it really matter in clinical trials on COPD? [^115bh5um]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Many definitions of COPD exacerbations are reported. The choice for a definition determines the number of exacerbations observed. However, the effect of different definitions on the effect sizes of randomized controlled trials is unclear. This article provides an overview of the large variation of definitions of COPD exacerbations from the literature. Furthermore, the effect of using different definitions on effect sizes (relative risk and hazard ratio) was investigated in a randomized controlled discontinuation trial of inhaled corticosteroids. The following definitions were applied: (1) unscheduled medical attention, (2) a course of oral corticosteroids/antibiotics, (3) deterioration in two major or one major and one minor symptom according to Anthonisen (referenced later), (4) a change in one or more symptoms, (5) a change in two or more symptoms, and (6) a combination of numbers 2 and 4. Relative risks for the exacerbation rate ranged from 1.19 to 1.49, and hazard ratios for time to first exacerbation ranged from 1.36 to 1.84 for the various definitions, varying from nonsignificant to significant. Because the definition of a COPD exacerbation has an impact on the effect size of interventions, there is an urgent need for concerted attempts to reach agreement on a definition of an exacerbation. Also, the exact definition to be used in a study should be specified in the protocol.

### Cough and sputum production as risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with COPD [^111CWNuc]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries, and its prevalence is projected to increase over the coming decades. According to the World Health Organization, COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD has a chronic and progressive course, and is often aggravated by exacerbations, which typically arise as a result of bronchial infection. Exacerbations are characterised by periods of increasing acute symptoms, particularly cough, dyspnoea and production of sputum, which worsen airflow obstruction, further impair quality of life and generally require a change in regular medication. Exacerbations are the most common cause of medical visits, hospital admissions and death in patients with COPD, and frequent exacerbations worsen health status and may cause a permanent decline in lung function. Chronic cough and sputum production are common in the general population, but significantly more prevalent in patients with respiratory disorders; these symptoms have been suggested as a risk factor for exacerbations of COPD. This article will review the consequences of chronic cough and sputum production in patients with COPD and analyse whether these risk factors may be useful for identifying a specific phenotype of patient that requires different management to reduce the occurrence of exacerbations.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: Do all roads lead to Rome? [^115LJhst]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The Rome chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation proposal is a welcome step forward. Celli and colleagues have attempted to revise the definition and propose a new severity classification, based on measurable clinical and laboratory variables instead. The central role of healthcare use when defining exacerbations has held us back from a better understanding of these critical events.

We agree that it is appealing to direct the definition of an exacerbation toward causation and measurable pathophysiological variables instead of symptoms alone. We also sympathize with the concept of a genuine exacerbation being an "inflammatory burst" caused by an "insult to the airways" on a background of chronic inflammation. However, practical implications of narrowing acute COPD exacerbations to these primary inflammatory events need to be considered. The clinical reality is that we have no universal marker that is specific for this implied inflammatory burst and that, despite a thorough work-up, we still do not identify a cause in many exacerbations. Currently, exacerbations remain a diagnosis of exclusion. Acute exacerbations of symptoms that are induced by comorbidities such as heart failure or even a panic attack require a different treatment approach. For patients, however, these events are equally frightening and just as much part of the reality of living with COPD. We believe that the emphasis of the Rome proposal on the inflammatory paradigm may shift the focus away from such events. Moreover, in practice, exacerbations of comorbidities and exacerbations of airway inflammation are not mutually exclusive but often coincide. Rather, we would keep the concept of an acute COPD exacerbation broad. Once a clinical diagnosis of a COPD exacerbation is made, maximal effort should be undertaken to better characterize endotypes and identify treatable traits, instead of contemplating the correct clinical label.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^114EwRAi]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States as well as throughout the rest of the world. An exacerbation of COPD (periodic escalations of symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum production) is a major contributor to worsening lung function, impairment in quality of life, need for urgent care or hospitalization, and cost of care in COPD. Research conducted over the past decade has contributed much to our current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of COPD. Additionally, an evolving literature has accumulated about the prevention of acute exacerbations.

Methods

In recognition of the importance of preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) joint evidence-based guideline (AECOPD Guideline) was developed to provide a practical, clinically useful document to describe the current state of knowledge regarding the prevention of acute exacerbations according to major categories of prevention therapies. Three key clinical questions developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format addressed the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: nonpharmacologic therapies, inhaled therapies, and oral therapies. We used recognized document evaluation tools to assess and choose the most appropriate studies and to extract meaningful data and grade the level of evidence to support the recommendations in each PICO question in a balanced and unbiased fashion.

Results

The AECOPD Guideline is unique not only for its topic, the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD, but also for the first-in-kind partnership between two of the largest thoracic societies in North America. The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee in partnership with the CTS COPD Clinical Assembly launched this project with the objective that a systematic review and critical evaluation of the published literature by clinical experts and researchers in the field of COPD would lead to a series of recommendations to assist clinicians in their management of the patient with COPD.

Conclusions

This guideline is unique because it provides an up-to-date, rigorous, evidence-based analysis of current randomized controlled trial data regarding the prevention of COPD exacerbations.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113KEtAu]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause morbidity, hospital admissions, and mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated with considerable physiologic deterioration and increased airway inflammation. About half of COPD exacerbations are caused or triggered primarily by bacterial and viral infections (colds, especially from rhinovirus), but air pollution can contribute to the beginning of an exacerbation. Type 1 exacerbations involve increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; Type 2 exacerbations involve any two of the latter symptoms, and Type 3 exacerbations involve one of those symptoms combined with cough, wheeze, or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. Exacerbations are more common than previously believed (2.5–3 exacerbations per year); many exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. We found that about half of exacerbations were unreported by the patients, despite considerable encouragement to do so, and, instead, were only diagnosed from patients' diary cards. COPD patients are accustomed to frequent symptom changes, and this may explain their tendency to underreport exacerbations. COPD patients tend to be anxious and depressed about the disease and some might not seek treatment. At the beginning of an exacerbation physiologic changes such as decreases in peak flow and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) are usually small and therefore are not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger decreases in peak flow are associated with dyspnea and the presence of symptomatic upper-respiratory viral infection. More pronounced physiologic changes during exacerbation are related to longer exacerbation recovery time. Dyspnea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increase significantly during prodrome, indicating that respiratory viruses are important exacerbation triggers. However, the prodrome is relatively short and not useful in predicting onset. As colds are associated with longer and more severe exacerbations, a COPD patient who develops a cold should be considered for early therapy. Physiologic recovery after an exacerbation is often incomplete, which decreases health-related quality of life and resistance to future exacerbations, so it is important to identify COPD patients who suffer frequent exacerbations and to convince them to take precautions to minimize the risk of colds and other exacerbation triggers. Exacerbation frequency may vary with the severity of the COPD. Exacerbation frequency may or may not increase with the severity of the COPD. As the COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to have more symptoms and take longer to recover from. Twenty-five to fifty percent of COPD patients suffer lower airway bacteria colonization, which is related to the severity of COPD and cigarette smoking and which begins a cycle of epithelial cell damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, increased submucosal vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated sputum interleukin-8 levels are associated with higher bacterial load and faster FEV₁ decline; the bacteria increase airway inflammation in the stable patient, which may accelerate disease progression. A 2-week course of oral corticosteroids is as beneficial as an 8-week course, with fewer adverse effects, and might extend the time until the next exacerbation. Antibiotics have some efficacy in treating exacerbations. Exacerbation frequency increases with progressive airflow obstruction; so patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly susceptible to exacerbation.

### Markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116dYC5h]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Most of the other commonly accepted measures and suggested biomarkers poorly reflected exacerbation severity, or the fact that there was not sufficient data to undertake a meta-analysis (See additional file: 1). This finding recalls a 2001 US Department of Health and Human Services report on exacerbation treatment outcomes from over 200 randomised controlled trials. The aim of that study was to create new guidelines to improve the management of COPD exacerbations. That study also concluded that the current literature was limited in terms of the number of studies and the amount of detail available as well as the reliability and accuracy of the clinical assessments used to discriminate between COPD exacerbations and other causes of worsening respiratory status. Thus, our observations agree with previous observations regarding the assessment of the unstable COPD literature.

As previously discussed, most of the studies used for this review were predominately with hospitalized patients (Level II). However, most COPD occurs in an out-patient setting (Level I). This has implications for our study since the latter population was poorly represented.

Our basic categorisation was according to the ATS/ERS' operational scheme for classifying the severity of COPD exacerbations as well as to out- and in-patient categories. To our knowledge, we are the first to undertake this type of literature review and thus we were faced with a lack of consistency in the definition of exacerbations as used in the various studies. We tried to overcome this difficulty by selecting and ranking clinical studies so as to improve the comparability of subjects between studies.

We were also aware that the clinical studies we analysed differed with respect to which comorbidities or identifiable causes for exacerbations were reported. Most patients were elderly and therefore were more likely to be suffering from one or more co-existing diseases such as asthma or cardiovascular disease. Such co-morbidity makes interpretation of our findings more difficult with respect to the true causes of exacerbations. If their aetiology could be determined, then susceptible patients such as those in Level I could be identified and new treatments developed to help prevent their onset and related hospital costs.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114XHeFW]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. In this section, we review (1) the epidemiology of this condition; (2) the etiology — many patients with AECOPD are thought to have a combination of viral and bacterial infections, which contribute to their exacerbation. Bacterial organisms are isolated more commonly after viral infections in patients with COPD. The role that bacterial infections play in AECOPD remains a very controversial topic; (3) the use of diagnostic procedures; (4) efficacy of antibiotics; (5) clinical parameters to stratify patients' severity; (6) different groups of antibiotics that can be used; and (7) other therapies, including bronchodilators. We summarize the current literature, with special emphasis on the assessment of the long-term impact of this condition.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^111Tcyb6]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural trajectory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening of symptoms that results in additional therapy. In many cases, exacerbations are triggered by respiratory tract infections (predominantly viral, but also bacterial) and environmental factors such as air pollution, yet in approximately one third of cases, the cause remains unknown.

COPD exacerbations have a marked negative effect on both the patient and underlying disease processes, and can result in hospitalization and readmission, an increased risk of death and a significant reduction in health status. Exacerbations are also associated with long-term decline in lung function and a high socioeconomic cost. Thus, optimizing the prevention and management of COPD exacerbations is an important clinical issue.

A key step towards meeting this goal is to identify patients at greatest risk of exacerbation. The 'frequent exacerbator' phenotype (≥ 2 exacerbations/year) describes patients who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, in contrast to infrequent exacerbators. The exacerbator phenotype, which remains relatively stable over time, has a complex pathophysiology and is prevalent across all disease severities, but is more common in patients with worse lung function.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides treatment recommendations for patients who are at high risk of exacerbation: a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination are recommended as primary choice treatment for these patients. Although the GOLD strategy document was developed with an international audience in mind, some countries and regions (e.g. Spain, UK, South America, and Canada) follow guidance outlined in their own recommendations as well.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients at high risk of exacerbation with concomitant asthma, or who experience further exacerbations following initial bronchodilator treatment. However, there is widespread evidence of inappropriate use of ICS in patients at low risk of exacerbation. Considering the known risks associated with long-term ICS use, only patients carefully considered as suitable candidates should receive treatment with the appropriate ICS and associated dose, such that treatment benefit will outweigh any potential risk.

### COPD exacerbations: the importance of a standard definition [^113XkB1k]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Efforts to assess the efficacy of new therapies in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been hampered by the lack of a widely agreed and consistently used definition. A variety of definitions have been used in clinical studies, based on changes in patient symptoms or the requirement for antibiotic therapy, oral steroids or hospitalisation. To date, none of these definitions have been assessed in detail for their reliability, responsiveness and validity determined. Considerable heterogeneity in the aetiology and manifestation of COPD exacerbations makes identification and quantification of defining symptoms extremely difficult. New approaches are therefore being sought with a view to identifying a serum or tissue marker that can be used as a valuable diagnostic tool. Improvements in data recording will also contribute to the accuracy of data retrieval and assessment. If we are to progress to a level of sophistication seen in the diagnosis and management of other diseases, it is evident that considerable research efforts will be required to improve our understanding of COPD exacerbations and develop a standard definition for these events, thereby facilitating the assessment of therapeutic approaches.

### Management of severe COPD [^115pVopx]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the burden of the disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention. Apart from smoking cessation, no approach or agent affects the rate of decline in lung function and progression of the disease. Especially in the later phase, COPD is a multicomponent disorder, and various integrated intervention strategies are needed as part of the optimum management programme. This seminar describes largely non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving health status and function of disabled patients. Exacerbations become progressively more troublesome as baseline lung function declines, commonly necessitating hospital admission and associated with the development of acute respiratory failure.

### Novel insights into the aetiology and pathophysiology of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations [^113pubUN]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations are a cardinal feature of the natural history of moderate and severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Patients with frequent exacerbations have significantly lower quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality rates. Although the effect of COPD exacerbations on lung function has been questioned in the past, recent evidence suggests that exacerbations accelerate long-term decline in lung function, specifically in smokers. The mechanism of this acceleration remains largely unknown.

Treatment decisions for COPD patients are frequently made according to exacerbation rates. In the ATS/ERS guidelines it is stated that patients with frequent exacerbations should be initiated a trial of inhaled steroids. Systemic steroids should be administered during acute COPD exacerbations, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. These treatment strategies indicate the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of exacerbations.

Although evidence for increased inflammation on COPD exacerbations has been reviewed previously, there has been little focus on why inflammation increases and which the consequences of this increase are. Investigating further these important questions may help establish a cause and effect relationship between inflammation and COPD exacerbations. The primary aim of this review is to summarize emerging explanations for why inflammation is increased during COPD exacerbations. For practical purposes an attempt is made to categorize aetiological factors of increased inflammation into extrinsic or intrinsic, as it can be seen in table 1. A secondary aim is to try to explain how increased inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations.

### Exacerbations: etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms [^111PyRKS]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Some patients with COPD are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are an important determinant of health status. Such patients have elevated airway cytokine levels, suggesting the presence of increased inflammation that may increase their susceptibility to exacerbation. The inflammatory response during a COPD exacerbation is variable, but increases in interleukin-6 levels during the exacerbation are related to the presence of a common cold. Rhinovirus infection is the most important etiologic factor in COPD exacerbations and is an important target for preventive therapy. The reduction of COPD exacerbations will have an important impact on the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.

### Admission prevention in COPD: non-pharmacological management [^114wzyT1]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are one of the commonest causes of hospital admission in Europe, Australasia, and North America. These adverse events have a large effect on the health status of the patients and impose a heavy burden on healthcare systems. While we acknowledge the contribution of pharmacotherapies to exacerbation prevention, our interpretation of the data is that exacerbations continue to be a major burden to individuals and healthcare systems, therefore, there remains great scope for other therapies to influence exacerbation frequency and preservation of quality of life. In this review, the benefits and limitations of pulmonary rehabilitation, non-invasive ventilation, smoking cessation, and long-term oxygen therapy are discussed. In addition, supported discharge, advanced care coordination, and telehealth programs to improve clinical outcome are reviewed as future directions for the management of COPD.

### Mechanisms and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Epj5r]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of symptom worsening in COPD that have both short-term and longer-term consequences. They are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and also increases in dynamic hyperinflation leading to classical exacerbation symptoms. COPD exacerbations are major drivers of health status in COPD, and are important causes of hospital admission and death. Exacerbations are also key outcomes for therapies in COPD and thus there has been much progress in their understanding in recent times.

It has also been recognized that some patients with COPD are particularly susceptible to exacerbations and these patients have been termed 'frequent exacerbators', in contrast to patients with infrequent exacerbations who experience few exacerbations over time. The frequent exacerbator phenotype has now been recognized as a major phenotype in patients with COPD and occurs across disease severities. The Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) exacerbation study showed that even in patients defined as grade 2 according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) (forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) 50% to 80% predicted), 22% of the COPD population were frequent exacerbators (Figure 1). Therefore, this review will describe the pathophysiology and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype and will also address the interaction with comorbidity, as illustrated in Figure 2.

While many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations, there is a subgroup of patients who enter a destructive cycle of frequent exacerbations with associated poorer outcome. This phenotype appears to be maintained over time.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112ugoX1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high global morbidity and mortality. COPD is characterized by poorly reversible airway obstruction, which is confirmed by spirometry, and includes obstruction of the small airways (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which lead to air trapping and shortness of breath in response to physical exertion. The most common risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking, but other environmental factors, such as exposure to indoor air pollutants - especially in developing countries - might influence COPD risk. Not all smokers develop COPD and the reasons for disease susceptibility in these individuals have not been fully elucidated. Although the mechanisms underlying COPD remain poorly understood, the disease is associated with chronic inflammation that is usually corticosteroid resistant. In addition, COPD involves accelerated ageing of the lungs and an abnormal repair mechanism that might be driven by oxidative stress. Acute exacerbations, which are mainly triggered by viral or bacterial infections, are important as they are linked to a poor prognosis. The mainstay of the management of stable disease is the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, whereas corticosteroids are beneficial primarily in patients who have coexisting features of asthma, such as eosinophilic inflammation and more reversibility of airway obstruction. Apart from smoking cessation, no treatments reduce disease progression. More research is needed to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop new treatments that reduce disease activity and progression.

### COPD exacerbations. 3: pathophysiology [^115UMonG]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The effective management of COPD exacerbations awaits a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that shape its clinical expression. The clinical presentation of exacerbations of COPD is highly variable and ranges from episodic symptomatic deterioration that is poorly responsive to usual treatment, to devastating life threatening events. This underscores the heterogeneous physiological mechanisms of this complex disease, as well as the variation in response to the provoking stimulus. The derangements in ventilatory mechanics, muscle function, and gas exchange that characterise severe COPD exacerbations with respiratory failure are now well understood. Critical expiratory flow limitation and the consequent dynamic lung hyperinflation appear to be the proximate deleterious events. Similar basic mechanisms probably explain the clinical manifestations of less severe exacerbations of COPD, but this needs further scientific validation. In this review we summarise what we have learned about the natural history of COPD exacerbations from clinical studies that have incorporated physiological measurements. We discuss the pathophysiology of clinically stable COPD and examine the impact of acutely increased expiratory flow limitation on the compromised respiratory system. Finally, we review the chain of physiological events that leads to acute ventilatory insufficiency in severe exacerbations.

### Independent effect of prior exacerbation frequency and disease severity on the risk of future exacerbations of COPD: a retrospective cohort study [^111Y5xYG]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common lung conditions observed in clinical practice and the third leading cause of death in the world. The association of COPD and smoking is well established. However, an increasing number of studies have reported a significant prevalence of COPD among non-smokers.

Exacerbations of COPD are episodes of worsening of symptoms that carry significant consequences for patients, being responsible for a large proportion of the health-care costs attributable to this prevalent condition. Consequently, their prevention is a key component of COPD-management strategies.

Despite the importance of exacerbations, we know relatively little about their determinants, probably because the heterogeneity of COPD exacerbations reflects their dependence on a complex spectrum of multiple risk factors.

The most consistent predictor of exacerbations appears to be a previous history of exacerbations. This would be supported by new large observational cohort studies such as 'The Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) Study', potentially indicating a definable phenotype of exacerbation susceptibility. However, this observational study did not include milder forms of COPD (Mild-GOLD grade 1), nor did it include COPD-confirmed patients without a history of tobacco consumption.

Although exacerbations are generally considered to become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, very few studies have researched the independent effect of COPD severity adjusted by a previous history of exacerbations.

We used the data from a retrospective population-based cohort study, including Mild-GOLD grade 1 or Non-smoker patients with confirmed COPD, to test whether a history of frequent exacerbations is the most important predictor of exacerbations in the following year, with independence of disease severity. In addition, we tried to analyse the independent effect of disease severity on the risk of susceptibility to exacerbations.

### Overview of virus-induced airway disease [^1172Lzr6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health costs of both diseases. Currently available treatments are poorly effective in both acute treatment of and prevention of acute exacerbations. New treatments for intervention and prophylaxis are therefore required; to facilitate their development, we must understand the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations. Respiratory viral infections (2/3 rhinoviruses) precipitate 80% or more of asthma exacerbations in children, and the majority of exacerbations of asthma and COPD in adults, but mechanisms of virus-induced lower airway inflammation and of host resistance against respiratory viruses are poorly understood. Development of in vitro experimental models of virus infection has identified interferon-beta and nitric oxide as possible therapeutic targets to augment antiviral immunity, and nuclear factor-kappaB as a target for development of anti-inflammatory therapies. In vivo models could also serve to identify and validate targets and as an experimental system to test candidate molecules as they emerge into clinical studies. Studies in asthma have paved the way for development of an asthma model; a similar experimental model in COPD would accelerate development of new therapies for these common diseases with enormous burdens of illness.

### Managing stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115co2dQ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Over 26,000 people died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England and Wales in 1999. The disease is a common cause of consultations in primary care and accounts for as many as 1 in 8 medical admissions. Patients with stable COPD, the focus of this article, experience chronic symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, sputum production, wheeze and chest tightness, which worsen slowly over time. We do not deal here with the management of severe acute exacerbations, which are caused by an additional (often infective) process.

### How viral infections cause exacerbation of airway diseases [^11125u5z]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are major causes of morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Over the last decade, studies using new molecular diagnostic techniques have established that respiratory viruses are a major cause of exacerbations of both asthma and COPD. The most prevalent viruses detected during exacerbations are the rhinoviruses. Despite the burden of disease associated with exacerbations, little is known about the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of airway diseases. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation in patients with both asthma and COPD, but many questions remain unanswered regarding the key inflammatory cells and mediators involved. Identifying the key inflammatory mediators involved in exacerbations holds the promise of developing diagnostic and prognostic markers of exacerbation. In addition, such studies can identify new therapeutic targets for the development of novel drugs for the prevention and treatment of exacerbations.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^1146CtYK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society have jointly produced evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This educational article gives four perspectives on how these guidelines apply to the practical management of people with COPD. A current smoker with frequent exacerbations will benefit from support to quit, and from optimisation of his inhaled treatment. For a man with very severe COPD and multiple co-morbidities living in a remote community, tele-health care may enable provision of multidisciplinary care. A woman who is admitted for the third time in a year needs a structured assessment of her care with a view to stepping up pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment as required. The overlap between asthma and COPD challenges both diagnostic and management strategies for a lady smoker with a history of asthma since childhood. Common threads in all these cases are the importance of advising on smoking cessation, offering (and encouraging people to attend) pulmonary rehabilitation, and the importance of self-management, including an action plan supported by multidisciplinary teams.

### Viral infections in obstructive airway diseases [^116E95tc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The most common syndromes associated with obstructive lung disease are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence for a viral etiology of asthmatic exacerbations is well known, but evidence for a role for viruses in COPD exacerbation is just emerging. Viruses may cause chronic infection in both diseases. This paper reviews some studies on the effects of respiratory viruses on asthma and COPD published in 2002 and discusses their relevance to current thinking in pulmonary medicine.

Introduction

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and the third most common group of chronic diseases are chronic pulmonary diseases that account for an estimated four million deaths annually. The most prevalent diseases of the respiratory tract are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, tuberculosis and lung cancer, and the most common genetic disease is cystic fibrosis (CF). COPD is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of mortality by 2030 and an estimated 300 million people suffer from asthma. COPD, asthma and CF are all chronic inflammatory conditions but their etiology and pathogenesis differ markedly. COPD and asthma are believed to be caused by exposure to relevant environmental agents (mainly cigarette smoke and aeroallergens, respectively) in patients with a susceptible genetic background, whereas CF is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator gene. The typical clinical course of these conditions is of chronic symptoms that are punctuated by periods of increased symptoms termed 'acute exacerbations'. Acute exacerbations are now recognized to be significant events in the course of the disease and have enormous implications for patients, their caregivers and for healthcare providers. Exacerbations accelerate disease progression, impair quality of life, cause significant morbidity for patients and are the major cause of mortality. In addition they are the major drivers of excess healthcare costs as they often result in unscheduled healthcare visits, treatment costs and above all hospitalizations. Therefore, preventing exacerbations is a major therapeutic goal in all three diseases and one that has not been achieved with currently available treatments.

Despite the differences between COPD, asthma and CF, all three have in common that respiratory virus infections are a major trigger of acute exacerbations. An important mechanism underlying this may be impaired host immune responses to virus infection and a better understanding of these mechanisms has the potential to lead to the development of new therapies that may be beneficial in different chronic pulmonary diseases. The aim of this article is to review the current knowledge regarding the role of viruses and host immune responses in asthma, COPD and CF, and discuss avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions.

### Exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving physical therapy: a cohort-nested randomised controlled trial [^1141aQMC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently defined as "a common preventable and treatable disease, characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gasses. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients". The World Health Organisation (WHO) lists COPD as the tenth most prevalent disease worldwide and the fourth most common cause of death in the world, responsible for 5% of overall mortality. Due to the ageing population, expanding smoking behaviour, earlier diagnosis of COPD and reduced mortality from other common causes of death, the total number of people with COPD will increase in the near future. This will rank COPD fifth worldwide in burden of disease by 2020.

Common clinical pulmonary manifestations that can be seen in COPD patients are dyspnoea with chronic cough, sputum production and recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, with disease progression significant extrapulmonary systemic effects can be observed in patients, especially in patients with moderate to severe airway obstruction: skeletal muscle dysfunction and weakness, nutritional abnormalities and weight loss. Nowadays, systemic effects of COPD are acknowledged as an important characteristic of the disease, which contribute significantly to decreased exercise capacity, decreased health status, reduced health related quality of life (HRQL), more utilisation of health care resources and increased mortality.

### Strategies to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can they impact disease progression? [^115aD3ag]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preventing disease progression is a key element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. COPD exacerbations are adverse events that can result in a decline of lung function that can persevere. Therefore, reducing exacerbation frequency has the potential to affect disease progression and improve health status of COPD patients. This narrative review explores monitoring for disease progression in COPD and its potential association with COPD exacerbations.

Recent Findings

Pharmacotherapy can slow down disease progression, but the effect is mediated only in part by reducing exacerbations. While disease progression is continuous, patients with established airflow obstruction in early stages appear more vulnerable to faster declines in lung function. Longitudinal monitoring of lung function and structure is necessary to identify patients with disease progression.

Summary

Pharmacotherapy is an effective option for preventing disease progression. A holistic approach including longitudinal pulmonary function testing, clinical symptoms and imaging may be necessary to detect disease progression for early intervention.

### Viruses exacerbating chronic pulmonary disease: the role of immune modulation [^113utKqk]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There is now convincing data implicating respiratory viruses as a major cause of acute exacerbations in asthma, COPD and CF. In all these conditions there is evidence that host immune responses to virus infection are impaired, but whether this occurs through a common mechanism, or whether mechanisms differ between the different diseases is unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms of increased susceptibility to virus infection in pulmonary diseases, the interactions between viruses and bacteria and how these impact on host immune responses. A better understanding of these mechanisms has the potential to lead to the development of novel therapies that will reduce the impact of acute exacerbations in chronic pulmonary diseases.

### Prognostic risk prediction model for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112n2aoe]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory condition defined by chronic cough, difficulty breathing, and airflow limitation. In 2019, the global prevalence of COPD among individuals aged 30 to 79 was 10.3%, accounting for approximately 391 million people. COPD ranks as the third leading cause of mortality among non-communicable diseases (NCDs) both globally and in China. The management of COPD is significantly challenged by acute exacerbations (AECOPD). According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), AECOPD is characterized by a worsening of respiratory symptoms surpassing usual day-to-day variations and leads to changes in medication. The prognosis of AECOPD can include a decline in health-related quality of life, substantial medical costs, and various complications. Additionally, patients with AECOPD are more likely to die from respiratory diseases compared to those without acute exacerbations.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify prognostic risk factors for patients with AECOPD and to develop simple, effective, and clinically valuable prediction models. These models can better estimate the risk of future deterioration in patients with exacerbations, providing reliable references for clinical care, early intervention, and personalized treatment, which are essential for improving patient survival rates and quality of life.

Owing to the heterogeneity of COPD and exacerbations, as well as the poor recognition and self-reporting of these conditions, early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with AECOPD have remained challenging in clinical practice and a focal point of research. Although various prognostic models for patients with AECOPD have been developed, which vary widely in type, performance, and applicability, the predictive performance and practical validity of these models remain unclear.

This study systematically reviews prognostic prediction models for patients with AECOPD and evaluates their potential to predict the risk of adverse outcomes. This review discusses the current state of research and explores future directions, providing a reference for the development, validation, and improvement of risk prediction models for patients with AECOPD. Furthermore, this study aims to provide a basis for their application in clinical practice.

### Complexity in clinical diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115u8DQz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

The vision: personalised management of COPD exacerbations

Assessment, management and prevention of exacerbations are anticipated to change significantly in the future. As described, the heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of COPD exacerbations can be resolved by grouping them aetiologically. Therefore, the main challenge to tackle is the development and validation of accurate biomarkers for early characterisation of the different types of exacerbations, which clearly extend beyond bacterial, viral and eosinophilic exacerbations that were discussed in detail here (figure 1). Such biomarkers could facilitate optimisation of exacerbation management and development of novel, targeted treatments. Since most exacerbations are addressed in primary care, the selected biomarkers will need to be measurable rapidly, near the patient, and simple, to facilitate implementation in primary care. RCTs focusing on the management of specific exacerbation subgroups are needed. These are likely to improve the clinical outcomes of exacerbations, but also COPD in general.

### COPD exposed to air pollution: a path to understand and protect a susceptible population [^112fJfFi]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Air pollution poses a risk to the respiratory health of individuals with COPD. Long- and short-term exposures to higher levels of particulate-rich air pollution are associated with increased COPD exacerbation, hospitalization, and mortality, collectively implicating air pollution as a cause of adverse COPD-related outcomes.

Review Findings

This review summarizes the evidence for COPD as a phenotype that confers susceptibility for adverse health outcomes in the face of common air pollution. We highlight how typical contributors to compromised urban air quality, including that from traffic, wildfire smoke, and indoor biomass combustion, adversely affect the COPD patient population. Evidence underscoring the burden of ongoing air pollution exposure on patients with COPD is discussed. We then detail the detrimental impact of that exposure on COPD pathophysiology, which in turn increases the patient's susceptibility. We specifically propose that indoor air is a particularly rational target for increased monitoring and remediation to protect patients with COPD. Because COPD is a heterogeneous disease with several endotypes, future intervention studies need to better include control populations, to highlight COPD-specific risks and identify subpopulations within patients with COPD who will benefit the most from improved indoor air quality.

Summary

Regulatory efforts must continue to broadly lower emission standards to protect this susceptible population from the negative health impacts of air pollution.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114xjzde]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — environmental and infectious triggers — are mainly linked to respiratory viral infections, with additional roles for bacterial infection, ambient air pollution, excess heat, and particulate matter; short-term exposure to fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter is associated with increased hospitalizations, ER visits, outpatient visits, and mortality, and nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 have been associated with exacerbations in mild to moderate COPD. Common viruses (human rhinovirus, influenza, para-influenza, metapneumovirus) can be detected for up to a week after onset and viral-associated exacerbations are often more severe, last longer, and precipitate more hospitalizations; invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is rare (1.3%-3.9%), and Aspergillus sensitization is a marker of increased risk of exacerbations.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112JWjUt]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills more than 3 million people worldwide every year. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or affect mortality. A better understanding of the complex disease mechanisms resulting in COPD is needed. Smoking cessation programmes, increasing physical activity, and early detection and treatment of comorbidities are further key components to reduce the burden of the disease. However, without a global political and economic effort to reduce tobacco use, to regulate environmental exposure, and to find alternatives to the massive use of biomass fuel, COPD will remain a major health-care problem for decades to come.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^111kttjg]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Key risk factors for COPD exacerbation

Numerous factors may contribute to a COPD exacerbation, the most frequent cause of which is a respiratory tract infection. However, other factors also play a contributing role, as shown in Table 1, including a change in weather/temperature, air pollution, and comorbid conditions.

Table 1
Risk factors for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Some patients may be more susceptible to developing COPD exacerbations than others, and are generally referred to as 'frequent exacerbators'. In the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study, an analysis of exacerbations in 2138 patients demonstrated that the single best predictor of frequent exacerbations was an exacerbation in the preceding year. In addition, exacerbations were more frequent and more severe (associated with hospitalization) in patients with advanced airflow obstruction: 22% of patients with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2 disease, 33% with GOLD 3 and 47% with GOLD 4 disease had frequent exacerbations (≥ 2) in the first year of follow-up. Other factors associated with increased exacerbation frequency were increased rate of lung function decline (100 mL decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) and a history of reflux or heartburn. In addition, a low level of physical activity can also predict future exacerbations, independent of pulmonary function and previous exacerbation history.

Several studies have demonstrated that a chronic bronchitis phenotype is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations in patients with COPD. However, patients with an emphysematous phenotype are also likely to exacerbate more frequently, in particular if they have severe emphysema.

### Mechanisms and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115RKzuv]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events that carry significant consequences for patients. Some patients experience frequent exacerbations, and are now recognized as a distinct clinical subgroup, the 'frequent exacerbator' phenotype. This is relatively stable over time, occurs across disease severity, and is associated with poorer health outcomes. These patients are therefore a priority for research and treatment. The pathophysiology underlying the frequent exacerbator phenotype is complex, with increased airway and systemic inflammation, dynamic lung hyperinflation, changes in lower airway bacterial colonization and a possible increased susceptibility to viral infection. Frequent exacerbators are also at increased risk from comorbid extrapulmonary diseases including cardiovascular disease, gastroesophageal reflux, depression, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment. Overall these patients have poorer health status, accelerated forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) decline, worsened quality of life, and increased hospital admissions and mortality, contributing to increased exacerbation susceptibility and perpetuation of the frequent exacerbator phenotype. This review article sets out the definition and importance of the frequent exacerbator phenotype, with a detailed examination of its pathophysiology, impact and interaction with other comorbidities.

### Acute exacerbations and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115wT5mG]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) describe the phenomenon of sudden worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. These exacerbations can range from self-limited diseases to episodes of florid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The average patient with COPD experiences two such episodes annually, and they account for significant consumption of health care resources. Although bacterial infections are the most common causes of AECOPD, viral infections and environmental stresses are also implicated. AECOPD episodes can be triggered or complicated by other comorbidities, such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary emboli, aspiration, pneumothorax), or systemic processes. Pharmacologic management includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics in most patients. Oxygen, physical therapy, mucolytics, and airway clearance devices may be useful in selected patients. In hypercapneic respiratory failure, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time for other therapies to work and thus avoid endotracheal intubation. If the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation, the focus should be on avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and minimizing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. These may require limiting ventilation and "permissive hypercapnia". Although mild episodes of AECOPD are generally reversible, more severe forms of respiratory failure are associated with a substantial mortality and a prolonged period of disability in survivors.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113zGnDp]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are of major importance in terms of their prolonged detrimental effects on patients, the acceleration in disease progression and high healthcare costs. There is still debate about how exacerbations should be defined and graded, and their mechanisms are poorly understood. The major causal agents are either bacteria or viral infections, or a combination of the two. Noninfective causes include air pollution and pulmonary embolus but, in some patients, no cause is identified. Exacerbations represent an increase in the inflammation that is present in the stable state, with increased numbers of inflammatory cells (particularly neutrophils), cytokines, chemokines and proteases in the airways, and increased concentrations of certain cytokines and C-reactive protein in the blood. There are presently no reliable biomarkers with which to predict exacerbations. Exacerbations have a long-lasting adverse influence on health status. High doses of bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment and systemic corticosteroids have some benefit. The routine use of antibiotics remains controversial but they are of benefit with exacerbations of a bacterial origin. Noninvasive ventilation is beneficial in preventing the need for intubation and its important complications but it is not certain whether its use in stable patients prevents exacerbations. Although important advances have been made, more effective treatments are needed in the future for prevention and treatment of exacerbations.

### Update on the management of COPD [^1127Y75f]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

COPD is highly prevalent and will continue to be an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is now viewed under a new paradigm as preventable and treatable. In addition, it has become accepted that COPD is not solely a pulmonary disease but also one with important measurable systemic consequences. Patients with COPD have to be comprehensively evaluated to determine the extent of disease so that therapy can be adequately individualized. We now know that smoking cessation, oxygen for hypoxemic patients, lung reduction surgery for selected patients with emphysema, and noninvasive ventilation during severe exacerbations have an impact on mortality. The completion of well-planned pharmacologic trials have shown the importance of decreasing resting and dynamic hyperinflation on patient-centered outcomes and the possible impact on mortality and rate of decline of lung function. In addition, therapy with pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplantation improve patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life, dyspnea, and exercise capacity. Rational use of single or multiple therapeutic modalities in combination have an impact on exacerbations and hospitalizations. This monograph presents an integrated approach to patients with COPD and updates their management incorporating the recent advances in the field. The future for patients with COPD is bright as primary and secondary prevention of smoking becomes more effective and air quality improves. In addition, current research will unravel the pathogenesis, clinical, and phenotypic manifestations of COPD, thus providing exciting therapeutic targets. Ultimately, the advent of newer and more effective therapies will lead to a decline in the contribution of this disease to poor world health.

### Targeting the COPD exacerbation [^114ERfxq]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of COPD have a profound detrimental effect on the patient and impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations are major objectives of the clinical management of COPD. For this approach to be successful, clinicians must combine both pharmacologic approaches and non-pharmacologic strategies aimed at improving the patient's disease management. Non-pharmacologic approaches include those that can be incorporated into the office setting as well as intervention strategies that are integrated into the lifelong management of COPD. These strategies include developing a partnership with the patient and their social supports, encouraging and facilitating smoking cessation, immunizations, proper use of supplemental oxygen, and most importantly, giving the patient the tools to manage their illness appropriately. Moreover there is clear evidence of an irrevocable decline in pulmonary function after each exacerbation, usually resulting in reduced physical activity and impaired skeletal muscle function. Not surprisingly, pulmonary rehabilitation after such events has been shown to prevent relapse, improve survival and enhance patients' overall function after acute exacerbations.

### Novel insights into the aetiology and pathophysiology of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations [^111S11rX]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Airway inflammation increases during acute exacerbations of COPD. Extrinsic factors, such as airway infections, increased air pollution, and intrinsic factors, such as increased oxidative stress and altered immunity may contribute to this increase. The evidence for this and the potential mechanisms by which various aetiological agents increase inflammation during COPD exacerbations is reviewed. The pathophysiologic consequences of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations are also discussed. This review aims to establish a cause and effect relationship between etiological factors of increased airway inflammation and COPD exacerbations based on recently published data. Although it can be speculated that reducing inflammation may prevent and/or treat COPD exacerbations, the existing anti-inflammatory treatments are modestly effective.

### Mechanisms and impact of the frequent exacerbator phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117Uk4LJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of frequent COPD exacerbations

The heterogeneity of COPD exacerbations reflects their dependence on a complex spectrum of interacting factors. Susceptibility to exacerbations and the basis of the frequent exacerbator is therefore probably multifactorial. Identifying contributory factors, such as background airway inflammation, airway microbial patterns and host immunological responses, may provide potential targets in the effort to alter a patient's exacerbation frequency phenotype.

Airway and systemic inflammation at exacerbation and in the frequent exacerbator

During exacerbations of COPD the existing airway and systemic inflammation associated with this inflammatory disease increases further. An inflammatory cascade releases inflammatory mediators, such as interleukins and chemokines, which recruit and activate immune cells. This cascade is thought to contribute to the local structural damage responsible for COPD progression, but also causes systemic inflammation with increases in acute phase proteins such as fibrinogen and C reactive protein (CRP). Although the exacerbation inflammatory process is predominantly neutrophilic, the numbers of all inflammatory cell types within bronchial mucosa increase and the inflammatory character is also influenced by the type of insult triggering an exacerbation. For example, compared to bacterially driven exacerbations viruses appear to stimulate more eosinophil activity.

The airways of frequent exacerbators, however, appear to be more inflamed with higher levels of sputum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 even in the stable state. In addition, their trajectory of inflammation is also worse with sputum IL-6 and plasma fibrinogen continuing to increase more rapidly over time.

Frequent exacerbators have higher sputum IL-6 and serum CRP during their exacerbation recovery periods, making persistent post-exacerbation inflammation a possible explanation for their higher baseline inflammation. A higher CRP during the recovery period is also associated with a shorter time until the next exacerbation perhaps suggesting an inflammatory basis to the temporal clustering of exacerbations reported by Hurst et al. who identified the 8-week post-exacerbation period as particularly high risk for exacerbation recurrence.

Persisting and increased propensity to inflammation therefore is a feature of the frequent exacerbator phenotype, although whether these features are causative or are downstream of susceptibility to the triggers of exacerbations remains to be established.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as "a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". The chief constituents of COPD are emphysema which is a permanent destructive enlargement of airspaces, and chronic bronchitis which is an excretion of sputum for at least 3 months per year for 2 successive years. Ageing, occupational exposure to dust and fumes, indoor and outdoor air pollutants, genetic risk factors and especially tobacco smoking are some of the risk factors for developing COPD. In the primary stages of the disease, the physical symptoms include a chronic cough, excessive sputum excretion, wheezing and shortness of breath and as the disease develops, dyspnea becomes more common. Mental conditions, such as anxiety and depression, are also common comorbidities of COPD and these predict a diminished quality of life, decreased exercise capacity and higher rates of exacerbations, along with increased mortality.

COPD has a considerable economic burden, such that in 2011 the yearly direct (i.e. healthcare) and indirect (i.e. production loss) cost of COPD in Europe was 48.4 billion euros. The economic costs of COPD are mostly due to the hospitalization and medication costs and are strongly influenced by the stage of the disease, as well as the severity and frequency of acute exacerbations. COPD is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity, and has the highest death rate of all chronic respiratory diseases globally. According to the latest information from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2019, COPD attributable DALYs ranked 11th in 1990 and 6th in 2019, although the age-standardised DALY rate per 100,000 population decrease by 39.8% during this time period. It has been estimated that COPD affected more than 380 million people globally in 2010, with a higher prevalence in males. Furthermore, the age-standardised prevalence rate of COPD increases with advancing age and in the future is expected to become equal among males and females, mostly due to changes occurring in the smoking habits of females.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, we present the latest findings on the cause, pathogenesis and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an infective phenotype.

Recent Findings

More than half of COPD exacerbations are infective. Bacteria are isolated in 70% of them, but viruses also play an important role, both alone and in combination with bacteria. Furthermore, in many cases, viral infection can be followed by bacterial infection in patients with COPD but not in individuals with normal lung function. Viral infection may produce changes in the lung microbiome that may precipitate subsequent bacterial infection. Research on the lung microbiome is providing new insight into the pathogenesis of infection in healthy and diseased lungs.

Summary

COPD patients have alterations in their lung microbiome that may result in chronic infection with potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) even in periods of clinical stability and associated with a higher frequency of bacterial exacerbations. Patients with this infective phenotype may require a personalized approach to therapy with the use of short-term or long-term antibiotic treatment in addition to the usual treatment for COPD.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common chronic respiratory condition in adults. The Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a collaboration between the World Health Organization and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, defines COPD as 'a preventable and treatable disease with some significant extrapulmonary effects that may contribute to the severity in individual patients. Its pulmonary component is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious inhaled particles or gases'. The main etiological agents linked with COPD are cigarette smoking and biomass exposure and the inflammatory response consists of neutrophils, macrophages and CD8+ T cells and, therefore, differs from the allergic inflammation seen in asthma. Pulmonary inflammation is further amplified by oxidative stress and excess proteases released by inflammatory cells recruited to the lung. As in asthma, acute exacerbations are a common occurrence in COPD and become more frequent as the disease progresses. Exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs and accelerate decline in lung function and quality of life in COPD patients. Historically, bacterial infections have been considered the predominant infectious etiology, however epidemiological data showing a greater frequency of exacerbations in the winter months and frequent coryzal symptoms preceding exacerbations suggest a causal role for viruses. Older studies using cell culture and serologic diagnostic tests detected viral infection in only approximately 10% to 20% of exacerbations. However, these diagnostic methods have low sensitivity for virus detection especially for RVs that are the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infections. More recent studies using modern PCR-based techniques have allowed a re-evaluation of the importance of viruses in COPD exacerbations and these studies have shown the presence of viruses in 47% to 56% of exacerbations. A recent systematic review evaluated weighted mean prevalence of respiratory viruses detected by PCR in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Eight studies were included with an overall prevalence of 34.1%, with picornaviruses including RVs being the most frequently detected pathogen, followed by influenza, parainfluenza, RSV and adenoviruses. Although these studies have higher detection rates they are likely to have underestimated the role of viral infections in COPD exacerbation as they evaluated patients at the time of presentation to healthcare services which often occurs considerably later than the onset of exacerbation and by which time virus may no longer be detectable.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common inflammatory airway disease, affecting the airways, lung parenchyma and vasculature, and is characterized by irreversible airflow limitation. COPD has been found to affect about 10% of the population above 40 years of age and ranked the third highest cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that 90% of all deaths from COPD can be linked to cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include chronic exposure to biomass smoke, household indoor smoke and outdoor air pollution. Indeed, biomass fuels' smoke has been identified as an independent risk factor leading to the development of COPD, particularly in low- and middle-income countries highly dependent on the use of biomass fuels. COPD comprises of two diseases, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, whereby an abnormal inflammatory response in the lungs occurs after exposure to noxious particles or gases, leading to airway obstruction and emphysematous changes. Symptoms of COPD are commonly chronic cough, excessive mucus production, air trapping, dynamic hyperinflation and shortness of breath upon physical exertion. Indeed, COPD exhibits symptoms beyond the lung, with systemic manifestations, such as inflammation, and is often associated with other diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. COPD may manifest frequent periods of exacerbation which is linked to increased airway and systemic inflammation and presents symptoms of breathlessness and sputum production that worsen acutely. COPD exacerbation is mainly common in patients with advanced COPD and has also been associated with viral or bacterial infections.

Clinical presentation — Patients with COPD typically report dyspnea, activity limitation and/or cough with or without sputum production and may experience acute respiratory events characterized by increased respiratory symptoms called exacerbations that require specific preventive and therapeutic measures, and they frequently harbor comorbid diseases that influence clinical condition and prognosis and require specific treatment, which can mimic and/or aggravate an acute exacerbation.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114jFyVs]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — risks and action plans note that COPD exacerbations increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, with heightened risk in the first 30 days persisting for up to 1–2 years, and that mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. An updated Cochrane review concluded that COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component, in conjunction with ongoing support, reduced in-hospital healthcare utilization and increased the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

Key messages

The key question is whether common environmental chemical exposures with known irritant or sensitising properties trigger exacerbations for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Among the environmental chemical exposures we evaluated, car and truck exhaust (OR = 4.36, 95% CI: 1.76 to 10.80) and use of scented laundry products (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.31 to 5.52) appeared to be associated with increased risk of COPD exacerbation.
Very few studies have tried to quantify the risk of COPD exacerbation from acute environmental chemical exposures. If these findings are confirmed, they may present an important opportunity for improving the quality of life for patients with COPD.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, serious and disabling lung condition, usually caused by regular exposure to noxious inhaled agents, particularly tobacco smoke –. It is a preventable and treatable disease, although it is usually progressive once established. It is characterised by persistent airflow obstruction and persistent respiratory symptoms, including dyspnoea, cough and sputum production, with episodic acute exacerbations. Guidelines recommend that the diagnosis should be considered in any patient with suggestive symptoms and a history of exposure to relevant risk factors, such as cigarette smoke and indoor biomass cooking fumes. Persistent obstruction post bronchodilator needs to be demonstrated to confirm the diagnosis. There is, however, consistent and ongoing evidence of major under-diagnosis of COPD globally including in the UK –. Based on epidemiological surveys, it is estimated that the true global prevalence of COPD is 11.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4–15.0%), yet the proportion of the population told that they have COPD is < 6% in most national data sets, and often as low as 2–3%, reflecting widespread under-recognition and under-diagnosis. The reasons for under-diagnosis are varied: some patients may not seek medical care due to mild symptoms, some may tolerate symptoms rather than seeking help or may choose to self-manage, and some may have difficulty accessing medical care –. However, many patients will consult with their primary care clinicians for persistent respiratory symptoms, or for acute episodes, representing unrecognised exacerbations, and may receive treatment (e.g. antibiotics, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antitussives) without a diagnosis being made or diagnostic investigations for the underlying problem undertaken.

Although COPD is not curable, there are a number of cogent reasons for encouraging an early diagnosis. First, as a preventable progressive condition, recognition of early disease allows targeting of preventative measures to reduce disease progression, notably interventions to reduce exposures, such as smoking cessation and reduction of exposure to airborne pollutants, including indoor biomass fuel fumes. There is some evidence to suggest that demonstration of lung damage by spirometry can support the motivation and success of smoking cessation. Other relevant lifestyle and prevention measures for patients with early COPD include diet and exercise advice and appropriate vaccination and referral for pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) offered in a variety of models where appropriate. Additionally, although pharmacotherapy is not curative, effective medication can reduce symptoms, exacerbations, lung function decline and mortality as well as improving and quality of life.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QeQCT]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Recognition that the burden of this disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention has stimulated new research into the underlying mechanisms, leading to a rational basis for evaluation of existing therapies, and has suggested novel treatment approaches. Tobacco exposure remains the main but not exclusive cause of COPD. Whether the lung is injured by changes in the balance of proteases and antiproteases, tissue damage by oxidative stress, or a combination of the two is still not known. The genetic basis of susceptibility to COPD is now being studied as is the role of computed tomography in the identification of structural damage in individuals with less symptomatic disease. Clinical diagnosis still relies heavily on an appropriate history confirmed by abnormal spirometry. Smoking cessation is possible in a substantial proportion of individuals with symptoms but is most effective if withdrawal is supported by pharmacological treatment. Treatment with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and, in more severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids reduces symptoms and exacerbation frequency and improves health status. Rehabilitation can be even more effective, at least for a year after the treatment. Recent guidelines have made practical suggestions about how to optimise these treatments and when to consider addition of oxygen, surgery, and non-invasive ventilation. Regular review of this guidance is important if future management advances are to be implemented effectively.

### Factors associated with change in exacerbation frequency in COPD [^114ukgad]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbation frequency has been shown to be an important phenotype in COPD. A few patients may shift from one category to another. There is no clear explanation or marker apart from the fact that patients on the borderline between infrequent and frequent exacerbations are more likely to change category. Thus, physicians need to consider that all patients are at risk during the course of the disease of becoming a frequent exacerbator.

Evidence Review

Definition and Triggers

Asthma exacerbations are defined as episodes of increased symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing) and progressive decrease in lung function that require a change in treatment. Similarly, COPD exacerbations are episodes of increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, often accompanied by tachypnea, tachycardia, or both, that worsen within 2 weeks from symptom onset. These heterogenous events are caused by complex interactions between a trigger and the patient's immune response. – Viruses are implicated in 40% to 50% of asthma and COPD exacerbations, and virus-induced COPD exacerbations are associated with increased health care use and a prolonged course. – Bacterial infections are thought to be a more important trigger for COPD exacerbations; however, uncertainty remains around the role of bacteria in both diseases, particularly severe asthma exacerbations in which bacterial infections have been identified more frequently. In addition, environmental or food allergens can trigger asthma exacerbations, and recognition has been growing around the importance of air pollution and extreme heat in inducing both asthma and COPD exacerbations.–

### Quantifying of severity of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: adaptations to the definition to allow quantification [^112CYDtu]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) offer a considerable clinical challenge for clinical practice and drug development. The underlying pathobiology of these characteristic events is unclear. We are far behind other disease areas, such as cardiology, where there are effective approaches for diagnosing and managing acute and potentially fatal events. A joint initiative has begun between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and the Food and Drug Administration to produce a valid diary card measure of exacerbation severity: the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Test-Patient-Reported Outcome (EXACT-PRO). This article describes the background to this initiative, using the consensus definition of a COPD exacerbation as the starting point from which to propose a new method for quantifying the severity of the event. This approach takes into account the relationships between the symptoms that make up an exacerbation and shows that they can be used in a single continuous severity scale. Methods for defining exacerbation onset and cessation are also proposed.

### Role of viruses in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zXqj6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and hospital admission. Respiratory viral infections, especially rhinoviruses, are a major cause of COPD exacerbations, with upper respiratory tract infections being associated with over 50% of COPD exacerbations. The presence of an upper respiratory tract infection leads to a more severe exacerbation and a longer symptom recovery time at exacerbation. Respiratory viral infections occurring during COPD exacerbations are more likely to lead to hospitalization. Sputum inflammatory markers were found to be higher in those patients with symptoms of a common cold or where rhinovirus was detected at exacerbation, thus suggesting that viral infections lead to greater airway inflammation and thus more severe exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are associated also with systemic inflammatory effects with increases in markers such as plasma fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Respiratory viruses have also been detected when the patients are stable, and this suggests that chronic viral infection may occur. Strategies to prevent viral infection will have a significant effect on the morbidity of COPD and will improve quality of life.

### COPD: management of acute exacerbations and chronic… [^1144nr3F]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Outpatient management of patients with stable COPD should be directed at improving quality of life by preventing acute exacerbations, relieving symptoms and slowing the progressive deterioration of lung function. The clinical course of COPD is characterized by chronic disability, with intermittent acute exacerbations that occur more often during the winter months. When exacerbations occur, they typically manifest as increased sputum production, more purulent sputum and worsening of dyspnea. 7 Although infectious etiologies account for most exacerbations, exposure to allergens, pollutants or inhaled irritants may also play a role. 8 This article reviews the management of acute exacerbations and stable COPD. Exacerbations of COPD can be caused by many factors, including environmental irritants, heart failure or noncompliance with medication use. 11 Most often, however, exacerbations are the result of bacterial or viral infection.

12 Bacterial infection is a factor in 70 to 75 percent of exacerbations, with up to 60 percent caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis. 13 Atypical organisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have been implicated in about 10 percent of exacerbations. The remaining 25 to 30 percent of cases are usually caused by viruses. 14 More serious exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation have been associated with Pseudomonas species. These exacerbations are more common in patients with severe disease and a history of frequent exacerbations.
13. Pharmacologic Management of Exacerbations Because no curative therapy is available, management of severe exacerbations of COPD should be directed at relieving symptoms and restoring functional capacity. 5 Patients with COPD often have poor baseline functional status with few respiratory reserves. Infections can worsen their condition and lead to a quick decline in pulmonary function.

OXYGENATION Initial therapy should focus on maintaining oxygen saturation at 90 percent or higher. Oxygen status can be monitored clinically, as well as by pulse oximetry. Oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula or face mask is frequently required. With more severe exacerbations, intubation or a positive-pressure mask ventilation method is often necessary to provide adequate oxygenation. Such interventions are more likely to be needed when hypercapnia is present, exacerbations are frequent or altered mental status is evident. 12.
