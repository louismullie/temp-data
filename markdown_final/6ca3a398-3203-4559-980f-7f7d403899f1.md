## Question

Can you use steroids over an amniotic membrane with ksv keratitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroids can be used over an amniotic membrane in the setting of keratitis, specifically with KSV (likely HSV) involvement, and how to do this safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the likely etiologies of keratitis. Then, I should verify the role and timing of amniotic membrane transplantation. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for topical corticosteroids in infectious versus noninfectious keratitis. After that, I need to check for any direct evidence on combining steroids with amniotic membrane. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring and precautions, and state a clear bottom line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Keratitis spans infectious and noninfectious etiologies, including bacterial, herpetic, fungal, and Acanthamoeba infections, as well as neurotrophic, exposure-related, and inflammatory ulcers. Management differs substantially by cause, so I need to ensure the etiology is established or reasonably excluded before considering steroids with an amniotic membrane graft [^115zgKik] [^1143yScH].

> Next, I should review the role of amniotic membrane transplantation. Amniotic membrane provides anti-inflammatory, anti-scarring, and pro-epithelial effects and is commonly used for persistent epithelial defects, neurotrophic keratitis, severe ocular surface disease, and as an adjunct in infectious keratitis to promote healing and reduce pain; it can be applied as a self-retained device or sutured, and is often combined with other surface rehabilitation strategies when epithelial defects persist [^113S49Wz] [^116Tqz4a] [^1117y89b].

> Now, I will examine bacterial keratitis guidance. Wait, let me verify the timing for adding steroids. The AAO recommends considering topical corticosteroids only after 24–48 hours of appropriate antibiotics and clear clinical improvement, typically after pathogen identification, and to avoid steroids in Acanthamoeba or fungal disease; if steroids are already on board at presentation, they should be reduced or stopped until infection is controlled, with close follow-up and IOP monitoring after steroid initiation [^1156Zcaf] [^115zgKik] [^115ZoEze]. Hold on, I should also note that randomized data have not shown a consistent visual acuity benefit from adjunctive steroids, though some studies suggest potential benefits in more severe ulcers, so expectations should be tempered and decisions individualized [^115gRY47] [^1143yScH].

> For herpetic keratitis, I need to check the dual-therapy approach. HSV stromal keratitis is managed with limited topical corticosteroid plus therapeutic systemic antiviral therapy; without concurrent antivirals, steroids increase the risk of epithelial disease, so I must ensure antiviral coverage is in place before and during steroid use, and taper steroids slowly to mitigate recurrence risk [^111jgrsA] [^113zN2Z3] [^116qPLBs]. But wait, what if the epithelium is actively ulcerated with stromal inflammation? The evidence base is limited, and while case series describe combining amniotic membrane with antivirals and steroids, this remains discretionary and should be guided by an ophthalmologist with close monitoring [^114U8zfD] [^116XFisd].

> I should confirm the stance on fungal and Acanthamoeba keratitis. Steroids are contraindicated in the absence of effective antifungal or anti-amoebic therapy because they suppress host defenses and can worsen infection; observational data associate prior steroid exposure with worse outcomes in fungal keratitis, reinforcing caution and the need for organism-directed therapy before any steroid consideration [^1156Zcaf] [^1143yScH] [^113bUgvi].

> Let me consider noninfectious or neurotrophic keratitis. In these settings, amniotic membrane is frequently used to promote epithelial healing, and topical steroids may be used judiciously to control inflammation, but I need to balance the risk of delayed epithelial healing and corneal melting. Thus, steroids should be used at the lowest effective dose with careful monitoring of the epithelium and IOP, and many clinicians prefer nonsteroidal strategies when neurotrophic disease predominates [^116Tqz4a] [^114nypNc] [^114Kg9US].

> Next, I should review direct evidence on combining steroids with amniotic membrane. Several case series and reports describe concurrent use of amniotic membrane with topical steroids in severe bacterial keratitis, neurotrophic ulcers, and inflammatory corneal disease, generally reporting pain reduction, accelerated epithelialization, and improved surface outcomes; however, these are uncontrolled studies, so I must interpret them as supportive but not definitive evidence for safety or efficacy [^111QbfJz] [^111nfYWw] [^113TvQYy] [^114mjJ43]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were randomized trials supporting this combination, but I should double-check — there are no randomized trials specifically testing steroids plus amniotic membrane in infectious keratitis, so clinical judgment and guideline-concordant care remain essential [^notfound].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm or exclude infection with cultures or PCR when feasible and tailor antimicrobial therapy. Second, apply amniotic membrane as indicated for persistent epithelial defect, pain control, or surface stabilization. Third, if infection is present, ensure at least 24–48 hours of effective antimicrobial therapy with documented clinical improvement before adding topical corticosteroids. Fourth, if HSV stromal disease is suspected, initiate systemic antivirals concurrently with limited topical steroids. Fifth, avoid steroids entirely if fungal or Acanthamoeba infection is suspected or confirmed until appropriate therapy is underway and controlled. Sixth, monitor closely within 24–48 hours of steroid initiation and at regular intervals thereafter, assessing epithelial healing, infiltrate activity, and IOP [^115zgKik] [^1156Zcaf] [^111jgrsA] [^1143yScH].

> Hold on, I should verify key precautions. Concurrent amniotic membrane does not obviate the need for infection control or steroid precautions. Amniotic membrane's anti-inflammatory properties complement but do not replace the need for organism-specific therapy and careful steroid timing, and rare infectious complications after amniotic membrane have been reported, underscoring the importance of infection surveillance and judicious steroid use [^116Nmf4H] [^113S49Wz] [^1117y89b].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Yes, topical corticosteroids can be used concurrently with amniotic membrane transplantation in keratitis, but only when infection is controlled or appropriately excluded, antimicrobial therapy is optimized, and close ophthalmic monitoring is in place. In bacterial keratitis, add steroids after 24–48 hours of effective antibiotics with clinical improvement. In HSV stromal keratitis, use steroids only with systemic antivirals. Avoid steroids in fungal or Acanthamoeba disease until specific therapy is effective. And in noninfectious or neurotrophic disease, use steroids cautiously at the lowest effective dose with vigilant follow-up [^115zgKik] [^1156Zcaf] [^111jgrsA] [^1143yScH].

---

In select cases of **HSV stromal keratitis with persistent epithelial defect**, combining amniotic membrane transplantation with topical corticosteroids and systemic antivirals can be considered [^114U8zfD] [^116XFisd]. This approach is reserved for refractory cases with ongoing inflammation and epithelial breakdown despite antiviral therapy, and should only be undertaken with close ophthalmic supervision. Steroids are otherwise **contraindicated in active HSV epithelial disease** due to the risk of worsening infection and delayed healing [^113zN2Z3].

---

## Clinical evidence for combining amniotic membrane and corticosteroids in HSV keratitis

Limited evidence supports combining **amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT)** with topical corticosteroids and systemic antivirals in HSV keratitis. A small case series reported improved visual acuity and corneal healing in patients with necrotizing HSV stromal keratitis and persistent epithelial defects who received multilayer AMT with antiviral and corticosteroid therapy [^116XFisd]. However, this evidence is low quality and retrospective; therefore, this strategy should be reserved for refractory cases with careful monitoring.

---

## Risks and benefits of corticosteroid use in HSV keratitis

Corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and corneal scarring but also **suppress local immunity**, potentially worsening viral replication and delaying epithelial healing if used without adequate antiviral coverage [^113zN2Z3]. The main risks include:

- **Increased viral replication**: Steroids can exacerbate HSV epithelial keratitis if used without effective antiviral therapy [^113zN2Z3].

- **Delayed epithelial healing**: Steroids may impair re-epithelialization, particularly in neurotrophic or persistent epithelial defects [^115gRY47].

- **Recurrence risk**: Steroids can increase the risk of HSV recurrence after apparent clinical resolution [^112gXCLA].

Given these risks, **corticosteroids should only be used with concurrent systemic antiviral therapy** and close ophthalmic supervision [^111jgrsA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **cautious, selective use** of corticosteroids in HSV keratitis:

- **AAO guidelines**: Corticosteroids are indicated only for HSV stromal keratitis with limited epithelial involvement, and must be used with systemic antiviral therapy (e.g. acyclovir 400 mg twice daily) [^111jgrsA].

- **Perioperative considerations**: In patients with a history of HSV ocular disease undergoing ocular surgery, antiviral prophylaxis is strongly recommended, especially when corticosteroids are used [^112gXCLA].

- **Avoidance in epithelial disease**: Corticosteroids are contraindicated in active HSV epithelial keratitis due to the risk of worsening infection and delayed healing [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy may be considered

Combination therapy with **amniotic membrane and corticosteroids** may be considered in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for combination therapy** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| HSV stromal keratitis with persistent epithelial defect | Refractory inflammation and epithelial breakdown despite antiviral therapy | - Strict ophthalmic supervision <br/> - Systemic antiviral therapy <br/> - Close monitoring for recurrence |
| Neurotrophic keratitis secondary to HSV | Persistent epithelial defect with corneal thinning | - Minimal steroid use <br/> - Adjunctive lubrication <br/> - Consider AMT alone first |
| Severe corneal inflammation with impending perforation | Emergency preservation of corneal integrity | - Short-term steroid course <br/> - Systemic antivirals <br/> - Immediate ophthalmic intervention |

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy should be avoided

Combination therapy should be **avoided in the following situations**:

- **Active HSV epithelial keratitis**: Corticosteroids can worsen viral replication and delay healing [^notfound].

- **Uncontrolled infection**: Steroids should not be used without effective antiviral therapy [^1142rtaE].

- **Patient non-compliance**: Poor adherence to antiviral therapy or follow-up increases the risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up protocols

If combination therapy is initiated, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Frequent ophthalmic examinations**: Initially every 1–2 days, then weekly until stable.

- **Intraocular pressure monitoring**: Steroids can cause IOP elevation; monitor regularly [^115fXxDw].

- **Clinical response assessment**: Monitor for epithelial healing, inflammation control, and signs of recurrence [^113Yvq4o].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence to antiviral therapy and prompt reporting of symptoms [^111M5wr7].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

If corticosteroids are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, consider **alternative therapies**:

- **Amniotic membrane transplantation alone**: Effective for persistent epithelial defects and neurotrophic keratitis [^113S49Wz].

- **Systemic antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir or valacyclovir are essential to control viral replication [^116qPLBs].

- **Adjunctive lubrication and bandage contact lenses**: Support epithelial healing and reduce discomfort [^1117y89b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In select refractory cases of HSV stromal keratitis with persistent epithelial defects, combining amniotic membrane transplantation with topical corticosteroids and systemic antivirals may be considered under strict ophthalmic supervision. This approach is **not routine** and should be reserved for cases in which standard antiviral therapy alone fails to control inflammation and epithelial breakdown. Corticosteroids are otherwise contraindicated in active HSV epithelial disease due to the risk of worsening infection and delayed healing [^113zN2Z3].

Anterior lamellar keratectomy — limitations, complications, and prophylaxis: There are limitations including recurrence of the underlying disease process and post-treatment surface irregularity and haze. Application of mitomycin-C (MMC) at the time of the initial or follow-up treatment has been investigated as a means of diminishing recurrent scar tissue or stromal deposits, and phototherapeutic keratectomy may also be repeated. PTK may defer DALK or PK but may result in postoperative haze, and another risk is corneal ectasia, particularly if ablation exceeds the anterior third of corneal stroma or if the residual corneal thickness is less than 250 μm. As with any procedure that disrupts the epithelial layer, infectious keratitis can occur; herpes virus can reactivate from excimer laser exposure, corticosteroid use, and corneal trauma, and any history of herpetic eye disease warrants strong consideration for perioperative antiviral prophylaxis. Delayed epithelial healing tends to happen with some of the underlying conditions for which keratectomy was indicated, and autologous serum and/or amniotic membrane (self-retained, glued, or sutured) may be used to facilitate healing.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^1157A8uP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Severe dry eye — beyond mild/moderate therapies, the following treatments may be considered for severe dry eye: permanent punctal occlusion can be accomplished by thermal or laser cautery with a stepwise approach so that no more than one punctum is cauterized in each eye at a session, and limited tarsorrhaphy for nonresponders. Autologous serum or autologous plasma rich in growth factors drops have been reported to improve ocular irritation symptoms and conjunctival/corneal dye staining in Sjögren's syndrome (I+, Insufficient, Strong), and a systematic review reported a benefit in symptoms with 20% autologous serum compared with artificial tears over 2 weeks; when repeated blood sampling is not possible, allogeneic serum eye drops have been shown to be an effective and safe alternative (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). For filamentary keratitis, options include debridement (moistened cotton-tip applicator, cellulose sponge, or forceps), topical mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine to decrease mucinous tear film viscosity, and soft contact lenses to prevent recurrence; if neurotrophic keratopathy is present, lenses should be used with caution due to infection risk, and insertion of a self-retaining or sutureless amniotic membrane in refractory cases should be considered with recognition of the short-term effect. Rigid gas-permeable scleral lenses have been used successfully for years, but use may be limited by fitting difficulties, cost, and patient ability to manage insertion and removal. Oral medications are available (I-, Moderate, Discretionary); cholinergic agonists such as cevimeline are FDA approved to treat dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome, improve ocular irritation symptoms and aqueous tear production, and may have fewer adverse systemic side effects than oral pilocarpine. In a trial, pilocarpine 5 mg orally four times a day produced significantly greater improvement in the ability to focus during reading and in blurred vision versus placebo in Sjogren syndrome, but there was no improvement in light sensitivity, ocular discomfort, and other dry eye symptoms; the most common side effect was excessive sweating in over 40% of patients, and Two percent withdrew due to this and other drug-related side effects.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular disease: a review of the first 233 cases from the UK user group [^112TDjpn]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT), as a new tool in the armamentarium of therapies available for ocular surface problems, became widely available in the UK in 1998. This study evaluates the indications for treatment, the surgical procedures used, and the results of a subset of the first AMT cases carried out by the group using this nationally available supply. This user group model provides data which is different from that obtained from uncontrolled case series, or clinical trials, and may be more representative of the outcomes that can be expected when a procedure becomes widely available.

Methods

The first 233 AMTs, performed by the UK user group, were evaluated by audit and outcomes were assessed at 3 months.

Results

Of the 233 transplants, there were 126 (54.1%) valid outcome returns: the outcome for persistent epithelial defects was a healed and stable surface in 11/35 (31.4%, 95% CI 16.9 to 49.3); for chemical/thermal injuries, a healed uninflamed eye with clear cornea in 5/18 (27.8%, 95% CI 9.7 to 53.4); for bullous keratopathy a pain-free, stable surface without bullae in 4/18 (22.2%, 95% CI 6.4 to 47.6); for ocular surface reconstruction, an epithelialised uninflamed conjunctiva without scarring in 12/23 (52.2%, 95% CI 30.6 to 73.2); and for limbal stem cell deficiency, a corneal phenotype in 4/7 (57.1%). The operative technique least associated with failure was use of a bandage contact lens at the end of the procedure (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.59, p = 0.004). Previous treatment with topical steroids was significantly associated with failure (OR 5.70, 95% CI 1.77 to 18.43, p = 0.004).

Conclusion

Although the outcome criteria used in this study were stringent, and the follow-up duration was short, the results of AMT by this user group were generally less favourable than those of previously reported case series. Controlled clinical trials would improve the quality of evidence for use of amniotic membrane in ocular disease.

Bacterial keratitis (initial evaluation) — treatment and follow-up guidance states: Systemic therapy is necessary for gonococcal keratitis, and it may be considered in severe cases where the infectious process has extended or the cornea is perforated. For patients treated with ocular topical corticosteroids at time of presentation of suspected bacterial keratitis, reduce or eliminate corticosteroids until infection has been controlled. When the corneal infiltrate compromises the visual axis, may add topical corticosteroid therapy following at least 2 to 3 days of progressive improvement with treatment with topical antibiotics typically after pathogen identification. Examine patients within 1 to 2 days after initiation of topical corticosteroid therapy and monitor intraocular pressure. In general, modify the initial regimen if there is lack of improvement or stabilization within 48 hours.

### A case of Corynebacterium propinquum microbial keratitis after amniotic membrane transplantation [^116Nmf4H]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, AMT is generally a safe procedure with fewer risks; however, rare bacterial infections can occur, as demonstrated in this case. The bacteria in this case were identified early using MALDI-TOF–MS, enabling prompt treatment measures based on drug susceptibility test results. Careful management, particularly with regard to the use of steroid eye drops, is crucial to prevent such complications in cases of AMT. If an infection occurs, antibiotic eye drops should be selected after considering antimicrobial-resistant infections.

### Keratitis (marginal) [^114ztVNj]. COP (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bacterial keratitis, more specifically with respect to patients with marginal keratitis, CO 2022 guidelines recommend to offer concurrent topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol 0.5%) to reduce bacterial load, in addition to topical corticosteroids (prednisolone sodium phosphate 0.5% or loteprednol 0.5% for 2 weeks) to reduce inflammation, recognizing the increased risk of infection with corticosteroid use.

### Necrotising keratitis in a cornea with no prior surgical intervention [^114rnEcH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Given the chronic and progressively worsening of the symptoms, lack of response to multiple courses of systemic and topical antimicrobial treatments, and a tendency for low-virulence pathogens, the focus shifted towards NTM and fungal origins rather than acanthamoeba, herpes or bacterial causes. The patient's history of recurrent exposure to environmental factors and steroid use further increased the likelihood of these pathogens.

The initial negative outcome from corneal scraping might be attributed to potential pathogen infiltration into deeper corneal layers. Given the persistent infection, more invasive approaches such as corneal surgery may be warranted to procure microbiological evidence and gain control over the infection.

Furthermore, molecular studies assume critical importance, particularly when staining and culture results are negative, potentially due to prior exposure to antibiotics and antifungals.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of shield ulcers of vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^1162r6KN]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report our experience with amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of severe shield ulcers.

Design

Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative case series.

Participants

Four patients (seven eyes) with grade 2 (ulcer with opaque base) and grade 3 (plaquelike lesions) shield ulcers not responding to steroid therapy with or without surgical debridement.

Intervention

Amniotic membrane transplantation with stromal side down was performed after meticulous debridement of the ulcer.

Main Outcome Measures

Healing of the ulcer with no epithelial defect.

Results

The ulcers healed with disintegration or retraction of the membrane in all patients within 2 weeks.

Conclusions

Amniotic membrane transplantation in combination with debridement is an effective surgical modality in the management of severe shield ulcers. Further studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of shield ulcer and its correct position in the treatment algorithm.

### Treatment outcomes in the DRy eye amniotic membrane (DREAM) study [^11518DLs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of cryopreserved amniotic membrane (CAM) in reducing signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in a large patient population.

Methods

A retrospective chart review at 10 clinical sites was done of patients with refractory DED who received CAM and completed at least 3 months of follow-up. Data collected were demographics; medical history including previous and current ocular treatment, diagnosis, clinical presentations, comorbidity, duration and frequency of treatment with CAM; and concomitant medications. The primary outcome was the change in dry eye workshop (DEWS) score after treatment.

Results

A total of 97 eyes of 84 patients exhibited severe dry eye despite maximal medical treatments including topical artificial tears, cyclosporine-A, serum, antibiotics, and steroids. Patients manifested with superficial punctate keratitis (86%), filamentary keratitis (13%), exposure keratitis (19%), neurotrophic keratitis (2%), and corneal epithelial defect (7%). After CAM treatment for 5.4 ± 2.8 days, 74 (88%) patients demonstrated an improved ocular surface along with a notable reduction of the severity as the overall DEWS score was significantly reduced from 3.25 ± 0.5 at baseline to 1.44 ± 0.6 at 1 week, 1.45 ± 0.6 at 1 month, and 1.47 ± 0.6 at 3 months (p < 0.001). Ten eyes (10%) required repeated treatment to complete healing. Apart from discomfort during CAM placement, there were no adverse events.

Conclusion

Placement of CAM is promising to enhance the recovery of ocular surface health and reduce signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe DED.

### Topical corticosteroids for infectious keratitis before culture-proven diagnosis [^1146wYFz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

In the corneal clinic of a university hospital in a metropolitan area, we sometimes encounter referred patients with severe corneal ulcers who have been treated with topical corticosteroids as well as antibiotic eye drops. Why were these topical corticosteroids prescribed? We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of patients with infectious keratitis treated with topical corticosteroids before a culture-proven diagnosis. During an investigative period of 4 years, 14 eyes of 14 patients were evaluated. All the patients were prescribed topical corticosteroids for the keratitis owing to unresponsive empirical antibiotic therapy, and at least six patients were treated for stromal keratitis due to herpes simplex virus.

Why did the corneal lesions of these patients worsen? Based on culture results, we diagnosed Acanthamoeba keratitis in six patients and fungal keratitis in two patients. Apart from bacterial keratitis, other microorganisms responsible for keratitis do not respond to antibiotic therapy, and the condition is worsened by the topical corticosteroids without appropriate anti-amoebic or anti-fungal therapy.

Application of topical corticosteroids for keratitis without microbiological evidence is harmful, and a differential diagnosis of herpetic stromal keratitis as well as fungal and Acanthamoeba keratitis is needed when using topical corticosteroid for the treatment of suspected infectious keratitis.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^113zN2Z3]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis — corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory mediators and affect virtually every aspect of the immune response, and the topical, intravitreal, and/or systemic use of corticosteroids can predispose to severe HSV epithelial keratitis; in a double blind placebo controlled study of 50 patients, 42% of patients with HSV stromal keratitis treated with topical corticosteroids and placebo developed HSV epithelial keratitis compared to 15 percent with topical corticosteroids and an antiviral agent, and in another randomized trial of 56 patients, 21% of the patients assigned to placebo and no patients assigned to treatment with trifluridine developed HSV epithelial keratitis during the treatment period; several case series also implicate topical and intravitreal corticosteroids as a trigger for HSV epithelial keratitis.

Table 1
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

Chief complaints at baseline visit included ocular pain (3/13 [23%]), discomfort (4/13 [31%]), light sensitivity (2/13 [15%]), blurred vision (11/13 [85%]), and redness (8/13 [62%]). While slit-lamp examination revealed severe corneal staining in all patients, the median ocular discomfort score was 0 out of 3 (mean score of 0.9 ± 1.1), which further indicates that the majority of the study sample had underlying NK.

Each patient received a median of 1 PKS application (range: 1–3); eight eyes (62%) received a single application, whereas a second and third PKS was placed in 3 (23%) and 2 (15%) eyes, respectively. Placement and removal of PKS were uneventful in all patients, and PKS was well tolerated by all patients. PKS was placed for a duration of 6.8 ± 3.4 days (range: 2–15), during which time antibiotics were continued and steroids discontinued. The cAM fell out spontaneously in one eye prior to dissolution on day 4. Aside from this case, the cAM was completely dissolved in all eyes upon removal of PKS.

### Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis [^114nypNc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Early diagnosis, severity-based treatment, and careful monitoring of NK patients are mandatory to achieve epithelial healing and prevent progression of corneal damage, especially since worsening of NK is frequently asymptomatic (Table 1).

All topical medications should be discontinued because they have detrimental effects on the ocular surface epithelium. Additionally, all ocular surface-associated diseases, such as exposure keratitis, dry eye, and limbal stem cell deficiency, which may worsen the prognosis of NK, need to be taken care of. For instance, it will be necessary to correct any eyelid dysfunction, to consider punctal occlusion, and/or perform limbal cell transplantation.

Treatment of NK should be based on disease severity. Treatment for stage 1 disease aims at improving epithelial quality and transparency and avoiding epithelial breakdown. In the presence of PED, therapy is aimed at preventing stromal involvement and corneal ulcer formation as well as promoting corneal healing. More severe cases, with corneal ulcer and stromal melting, require immediate attention to stop the stromal lysis and prevent perforation,(Table 1).

Pharmacological treatments for NK are not available. However, the use of preservative-free artificial tears may help improve the corneal surface at all stages of disease severity. Topical steroids have been proposed for NK to control ocular inflammation (if present); however, steroids may increase the risk of corneal melting and perforation by inhibiting stromal healing, and their use should be considered with great caution. Topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may also inhibit the healing process and should be avoided. In the event of stromal melting, use of topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine, and systemic administration of tetracycline or medroxyprogesterone may be considered.–Use of topical antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection in eyes with NK at stages 2 and 3 is recommended.

Nonpharmacological treatments for NK include therapeutic corneal or scleral contact lenses in the event of PED to promote corneal epithelial healing. Contact lens use may increase the risk of secondary infections.

### Severe corneal ulceration after cosmetic keratopigmentation [^116BL3J1]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Keratopigmentation is a well-described procedure often used to address corneal opacities. Purely cosmetic keratopigmentation, in the absence of underlying corneal pathology has increased in popularity recently, with the intention of changing eye color appearance. In the context of this increased popularity, public knowledge and data regarding the risks of this procedure are lacking.

Methods

This study is a case report conducted at a single academic institution.

Results

Here we present a case of a patient who underwent purely cosmetic keratopigmentation and who developed severe corneal ulceration as a sequela. We outline the clinical course and management of this ulceration, which ultimately resolved with amniotic membrane grafting as well as oral and topical steroids.

Conclusions

This case serves as an important illustration of the risks that may be associated with purely cosmetic keratopigmentation.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis [^111QbfJz]. Cornea (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids.

Methods

In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured.

Results

The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7–10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1–3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 ± 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed.

Conclusions

Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^1117y89b]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — tapering topical antibiotics and ocular surface rehabilitation is individualized to response; topical therapy is tapered according to the clinical response, and modification of therapy may mean a change in the type, concentration, or frequency of antibiotic treatment. However, most antibiotic eye drops should not be tapered below subtherapeutic dosing as it may increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistance, and because prolonged use of topical antibiotics causes toxicity, they should be tapered as the infection improves. Medication toxicity can cause worsening inflammation or even corneal melting. If there is a persistent epithelial defect and the infection is under control, adjunctive therapies to rehabilitate the surface should be instituted, such as lubrication, antibiotic ointment, bandage contact lens, amniotic membrane coverage, or tarsorrhaphy, and more prolonged therapy may be mandated by the presence of virulent or indolent organisms or for immunocompromised patients.

### Role of steroids in the treatment of bacterial keratitis [^116iHUDe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of bacterial keratitis is more challenging in the setting of a corneal allograft since it can lead to graft rejection or failure. The incidence of microbial keratitis following keratoplasty ranges between 1.76% and 7.4% in the developed world–and up to 12.1% in developing nations. Most post-keratoplasty infections occur within the first year, and graft clarity is maintained only in 23%–50% of the cases.–There are no randomized controlled trials on the use of corticosteroids for bacterial keratitis in the setting of a corneal allograft. The consensus from the reported studies and our empirical experience suggest that corticosteroids should be cut in half until the culture-positive bacterial infection is well controlled and the epithelial defect is almost healed. For patients with a distant history of a corneal allograft and who are not on corticosteroids at baseline anymore, intensive topical antibiotics should be used for at least 48 hours before the initiation of topical corticosteroids and with the support or microbiological results that demonstrate a bacterial etiology.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^1156Dkbx]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Corneal edema — care management emphasizes that the therapeutic goal is to control the cause and enhance quality of life by improving visual acuity and comfort, with treatment starting with medical management and surgery considered when insufficient. Lowering an elevated IOP is helpful, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should not be the first line of therapy when endothelial dysfunction is suspected, and topical corticosteroid can control inflammation once infection has been ruled out or controlled. Microcystic or bullous epithelial disease may necessitate a bandage contact lens, with thin lenses with high water content and high oxygen diffusion coefficients possibly safest, and supportive management should be initiated to reduce inflammation and/or pain in cases of acute hydrops. For patients with persistent discomfort and limited or no visual potential, procedures such as conjunctival flap, amniotic membrane tissue transplantation, or scarification are generally better options, while keratectomy and keratoplasty procedures can be considered for reduced vision or significant pain due to bullous keratopathy.

### Established and emerging ancillary techniques in management of microbial keratitis: a review [^115Fu7FZ]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Microbial keratitis is a sight-threatening condition and an ocular emergency, because of the potential for rapid progression. Intensive topical antimicrobials are the mainstay and the gold standard of treatment for microbial keratitis. However, despite appropriate diagnosis and therapy, treatment failure is still common, and can result in significant morbidity due to corneal perforation and/or scarring. For this reason, clinicians continue to seek novel treatment techniques in order to expand the armamentarium of tools available to manage microbial keratitis, and in doing so improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we examine the evidence for some established, as well as a few emerging ancillary techniques used to manage microbial keratitis. These include topical corticosteroids, corneal collagen cross-linking, intrastromal antimicrobials, amniotic membrane transplantation and miscellaneous other techniques. Of these, collagen cross-linking shows some promise for selected cases of infectious keratitis, although more research in the area is required before it is accepted as mainstream treatment for this potentially blinding condition.

### Treatment outcomes in the DRy eye amniotic membrane (DREAM) study [^116V3Vbj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Ten patients (10%), who had exposure keratitis or epithelial defects, did not heal at the time of CAM removal and required repeat treatment to complete the healing. For these patients, the overall DEWS score was significantly reduced from 3.60 ± 0.7 at the baseline to 2.5 ± 0.7 at 1 week, 1.90 ± 0.9 at 1 month, and 1.90 ± 0.9 at 3 months. The corneal staining scores improved from 3.3 ± 1.0 at baseline to 1.9 ± 1.2 at 3 months.

The ocular surface remained stable during the follow-up period while the patients continued to use conventional treatment including artificial tears (96%), cyclosporine-A (57%), steroids (32%), antibiotics (23%), serum drops (11%), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8%). There was no significant change in the number of topical medications after CAM placement. Apart from CAM intolerance, there were no adverse events.

### Comparison of the acute ocular manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Chinese eyes: a 15-year retrospective study [^111FAcZu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment for both SJS and TEN had been evolving in the past 16 years. There has been increasing use of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) to treat severe ocular manifestations as several large case series have shown improved ocular outcomes as well as ocular surface histology (Table 4). In the most recent prospective case series published by Gregory, he proposed another acute phase grading system to guide when AMT is indicated. In his study, severe cases which had either corneal epithelial defect beyond punctate keratopathy, or at least 1 lid margin with staining involving more than one-third of its length, or any section of bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva with staining of more than 1 cm in largest diameter, should receive urgent AMT to preserve vision and decrease the risk of ocular surface scarring and dry eyes. For the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the evidence to support its use was contradictory. IVIG did not appear to reduce the severity of visually significant ocular complications in the study by Yip et al, whereas another study by Aihara et al, which combined IVIG with corticosteroids, showed beneficial effect in reduction of the severity-of-illness score, as well as improvement in ophthalmic lesions. Using systemic pulse steroid alone at disease onset has also been shown to be beneficial in preventing ocular complications. In our study, all of our cases received early intravenous pulse steroid (1 mg/kg/day for 3 days). We believe this has significantly reduced the severity of the ocular inflammation in our series, and could explain our lower rate of amniotic membrane transplantation. However, the beneficial effect of this universal steroid usage was also a significant confounding factor in this study.

### Outcome of lamellar graft patching for the treatment of noninfectious corneal perforations [^116pMeQT]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Corneal perforation is a serious sight-threatening condition caused by infectious keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis (NTK), trauma, and corneal stromal melts due to inflammatory diseases or persistent epithelial defects (PEDs). To restore eyeball integrity and avoid endophthalmitis or secondary glaucoma, proper medical and surgical interventions are needed, such as bandage contact lens, tissue glue, conjunctival flap patch, amniotic membrane transplantation, and penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). – In large corneal perforations with stromal melts, tectonic PKP is the standard procedure; however, its postoperative management is often challenging.

Tectonic lamellar graft patching may be an alternate surgical procedure to tectonic PKP. The advantages of lamellar graft patching over PKP include no risk of endothelial rejection, a lesser need for postoperative steroids, lesser incidence of glaucoma, and less risk of damage to intraocular tissues. – However, the long-term prognosis of lamellar graft patching for corneal perforation remains elusive. We hypothesized that lamellar graft patching, rather than tectonic PKP, can be an effective surgical procedure to avoid postoperative complications, especially in noninfectious diseases. Furthermore, it is probable that the prognosis of lamellar graft patching would be valuable in different causative diseases. In this study, we focused on the cases in which we performed lamellar graft patching for corneal perforations caused by acute sterile stromalysis due to PED secondary to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) by cicatricial keratoconjunctivitis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK), NTK due to herpes simplex keratitis (HSK), or other diseases. We evaluated the surgical outcomes of lamellar graft patching and assessed the tectonic integrity, clearness of the graft, visual outcome, and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications.

Table 4
Overall Healing Outcomes for Patients with Persistent Epithelial Defects Treated with Amniotic Membrane-derived Dry Matrix

Best corrected vision (BCVA) was secondary outcome measure, with results shown in Figure 1. Eighty-four percent of the patient's vision remained stable (n = 48) or improved (n = 22). Only 15% of patients were worse off with their BCVA at the end of treatment period. Overall mean pretreatment BCVA was recorded as 1.74 ± 0.73 LogMAR compared to posttreatment BCVA of 1.64 ± 0.79 LogMAR.

Figure 1
Data corresponding to the change in best correct visual acuity (BCVA) of all defects treated with amniotic membrane-derived dry matrix.

Concomitant treatments and overall duration of treatment length with AMDDM are shown in (Table 5). Eighty-nine percent of the PEDs were treated with topical antibiotics and 69% had topical steroid treatment simultaneously at the time of treatment. Twenty-five PEDs were treated with topical (17.2%) or systemic (9.7%) immunotherapy. Eighteen epithelial defects (19.4%) were treated with plasma eye drops. Eight patients had simultaneous tarsorrhaphy (seven lateral, one medial) when treated with AMDDM for better lens fit, for which 56% (n = 5) showed complete healing and 22% (n = 2) were partially healed at the end of the treatment period.

Table 5
Concomitant Medications and Average Duration of Treatment of Amniotic Membrane-derived Dry Matrix

Overall, 14% (n = 14) of the PEDs which showed no improvement ended up having complete tarsorrhaphy (n = 5) and limbal stem cell transplant (n = 6) from the follow-up data. Table 6 shows the follow-up care of patients with partial or no healing. Owing to the small number of patients in each group in the study, it was not feasible to make accurate inferences on the factors associated with failure of the healing of these epithelial defects.

### Sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation for severe bacterial keratitis [^111nfYWw]. Cornea (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of early sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of severe bacterial keratitis to reduce pain, inflammation, and haze, and to promote healing.

Method

A noncomparative case series including 3 eyes of 3 consecutive patients with severe bacterial keratitis exhibiting persistent epithelial defect/ulcer, more than 5 mm in diameter, located within 3mm from the visual axis with infiltration occupying more than 50% of the corneal thickness. They were retrospectively reviewed following early (ie, within 96 hours) sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation via ProKera together with selective topical antibiotics and preservative-free steroid. Pain relief, inflammation, haze, and corneal epithelial healing were monitored.

Results

ProKera was inserted once in 1 eye and twice in the other 2 eyes. Pain was significantly relieved and inflammation was markedly reduced in all cases. The corneal epithelial defect and stromal ulceration rapidly healed while visual acuity improved in 2 of the 3 eyes.

Conclusion

Temporary sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation via ProKera allows easy insertion and replacement of the membrane in the office, as well as early intervention to promote epithelialization, reduce pain, haze and inflammation in cases with severe bacterial keratitis. This result justifies large series controlled studies in the future.

### Bilateral keratoconjunctivitis associated with lichen planus [^115UJm1q]. Cornea (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a case of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis in a patient with lichen planus.

Methods

Case report and review of the English literature.

Results

To our knowledge, this is the fourth reported case of keratoconjunctivitis associated with lichen planus. A 33-year-old Navajo man with lichen planus had recurrent and progressive keratoconjunctivitis that failed to improve on multiple topical medications. Tapered oral prednisone, 2% topical cyclosporin, and amniotic membrane transplantation pacified the acute exacerbation.

Conclusions

Our patient with lichen planus developed an ocular surface disease with cicatricial conjunctivitis, keratouveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, punctate epithelial erosions, and persistent epithelial defects leading to noninfectious or infectious corneal ulceration. Amniotic membrane transplantation may play an adjunctive role in refractory cases of lichen planus-related keratoconjunctivitis. Topical cyclosporin may stabilize the ocular surface when combined with systemic immunosuppression in severe cases.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^115ZoEze]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis (initial evaluation) — systemic therapy is necessary for gonococcal keratitis and may be considered in severe cases where the infectious process has extended or the cornea is perforated. For patients treated with ocular topical corticosteroids at time of presentation of suspected bacterial keratitis, reduce or eliminate corticosteroids until infection has been controlled. When the corneal infiltrate compromises the visual axis, may add topical corticosteroid therapy following at least 2 to 3 days of progressive improvement with treatment with topical antibiotics typically after pathogen identification. Examine patients within 1 to 2 days after initiation of topical corticosteroid therapy and monitor intraocular pressure. In general, modify the initial regimen if there is lack of improvement or stabilization within 48 hours.

### Ocular adverse events associated with antibody-drug conjugates for cancer: evidence and management strategies [^114Sde6V]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Management

Dose modifications

Ocular AEs can often be managed with dose modification (interruption or reduction) or treatment discontinuation of the ADC, depending on the type, persistence, and severity of the ocular AE. Ocular AEs, including abnormal corneal findings on ophthalmic examination, changes in visual acuity, or conjunctivitis, should be managed by treatment interruption in patients with grade ≥ 2 AEs until improvement to grade ≤ 1, with treatment resumed at a reduced dose. Dose delays and dose reductions were reported in several studies of ADCs, with most patients remaining on treatment and recovering from the ocular AEs following dose modification and close monitoring. Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered in patients with grade 4 ocular AEs, including corneal epithelial defect, severe superficial keratopathy, ulcerative keratitis, or corneal perforation. Although rare, treatment discontinuation due to ocular AEs has been reported in ADC trials. As mentioned previously, dose modification recommendations may vary based on the individual ADC, so it is important to refer to the prescribing information of the approved ADC.,

Available treatments

Ophthalmologists may utilize ophthalmic-specific treatments for different ocular AEs, including topical preservative-free lubricating eye drops for dry eye or delayed corneal epithelial healing; ophthalmic topical corticosteroids for non-infectious conjunctivitis or keratitis; and ophthalmic topical antibiotics for corneal epithelial defects or ulcers. Caution must be exercised with the long-term use of topical corticosteroids given the risks of infection and eye pressure elevation. Based on our anecdotal experience, patients with dry eye and concurrent whorl-like staining and/or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis may be treated with preservative-free artificial tears 4–6 times daily, oral doxycycline 20 mg twice daily, vitamin A ointment applied nightly at bedtime, and limited application of topical steroid (eg, around the time of infusions). If a topical steroid is to be considered on an ongoing basis, patients should be informed of potential complications and the need for regular follow up with an eye care provider. Other options to consider for corneal disorders include therapeutic bandage contact lenses or scleral contact lenses. Further studies are needed to characterize the underlying pathogenesis of ocular AEs for various agents and to determine whether available treatment options are likely to be of benefit.

### Safety and efficacy of amniotic cytokine extract in the treatment of dry eye disease [^1122aMMt]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition with multifactorial etiologies characterized by tear film instability and ocular surface inflammation. The clinical presentation of DED includes disruptions in the integrity of the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, a rapid tear break-up time, and reports of a range of symptoms associated with ocular discomfort and irritation, including dryness, grittiness, and foreign body sensation. Multiple subtypes of DED may occur within patients, including aqueous-deficient and evaporative forms of the disease, with overlap being common, as well as comorbidity with other ocular conditions, such as blepharitis. The prevalence of DED varies across studies due to differences in study population and diagnostic criteria, with estimates ranging from 5% to 50% of the study population based on the presence of symptoms with or without clinical signs. Risk factors that are commonly associated with DED include advancing age, female gender, meibomian gland dysfunction, a history of ocular surgery, contact lens wear, and exposure to low humidity or high airflow.

A range of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies have been evaluated and recommended for the treatment of patients with DED through the use of staged-treatment algorithms based on the nature and severity of the patient's condition. Inflammation of the ocular surface is a common factor across patients and is often a target for therapy, with treatment options including topical anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory agents. One form of therapy that has been recommended for the treatment of DED includes amniotic membrane transplantation.

In cases of severe conditions affecting the ocular surface that can result in alteration of the function and integrity of the tear film, including conjunctival scarring, trauma, and persistent epithelial defects, transplantation of amniotic membrane is recognized as a therapeutic treatment option. Amniotic membrane, the thin avascular inner layer of the fetal membranes, may be transferred to the ocular surface as a temporary graft to act as a bandage, shielding ocular tissue, as well as promoting healing of the damaged structures. The transparent amniotic membrane has been demonstrated to promote epithelialization, and possess anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and anti-fibrotic properties. Preserved amniotic membrane has been used to treat patients with DED, resulting in improvements in patient-reported ocular symptoms and clinical signs, as well as corneal nerve restoration.–

### Treatment outcomes in the DRy eye amniotic membrane (DREAM) study [^1158Ycpq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, the ocular surface did not heal in 10% of cases following single placement of CAM and required repeat treatment. These cases had exposure keratopathy, neurotrophic conditions, or persistent epithelial defect. These results are comparable with what has been reported previously by Suri et al, who have published a recurrence rate of 14.3%. This recurrence may be explained by the nature of the underlying disease or associated comorbidities. In fact, 39% of the cases had associated blepharitis in this study, and the improvement of lid hygiene helped improve the dry eye symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to look for other comorbidities and treat them accordingly.

DED presents as a public health problem, with substantial economic implications including increased prescription medication use and expenditures for DED. It has been shown that CAM can alleviate DED accompanied with a significant reduction in usage of concomitant topical medications. However, the patients in the current study continued to use conventional treatment as per their usual routine even though their symptoms were refractory before CAM placement. Hence, it may be advisable to reduce the number and frequency of concomitant medications to minimize potential toxicity, economic burden, and impact on quality of life.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation in ophthalmology: an updated perspective [^112qXJj7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown the wide-ranging applications of AMT that exist within ophthalmic settings, alongside a discussion of the relevant literature. We hope this review gives the reader greater understanding of the clinical scenarios in which AMT may provide benefit. Given its widespread use, there are likely to be scenarios where usage will be beneficial, but similarly, there will be times when it is not required. Our understanding of AMT is not yet complete, but it is improving. It is clear that AMT is beneficial in some conditions, and, as discussed above, offers a good option in some challenging situations. With time, our understanding will improve, along with clarifying the clinical scenarios for which it is required.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^114U8zfD]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

HSV stromal keratitis with epithelial ulceration — rarity and limited evidence: Herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis with epithelial ulceration presents less commonly than HSV stromal keratitis without ulceration and is most often confused with microbial keratitis. In the two HEDS trials, only 9% and 12% of patients, respectively, had stromal keratitis with ulceration, and the numbers were too small to determine the best course of therapy. One case series of 15 patients reported success combining amniotic membrane graft with topical corticosteroid and antiviral treatment, but a role for amniotic membrane transplantation in HSV keratitis remains speculative. Electron microscopy detected intact virions in stromal keratocytes in patients with epithelial ulceration, suggesting a possible need to obtain therapeutic levels with oral antiviral therapy when the epithelium is ulcerated in HSV stromal keratitis.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^114Kg9US]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — medical and surgical management can be divided into managing the principal initiating process and the resulting problems, with conventional treatment involving an antibiotic drop or ointment to protect against secondary bacterial infection. Temporary tarsorrhaphy with botulinum toxin, or suture can be helpful when blinking or eyelid closure is inadequate, and a bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane may be helpful in delayed healing. Pressure patching used to be standard treatment, but a study found that this does not positively impact comfort or speed of healing, and progressive thinning or a small perforation usually requires structural support with tissue adhesive. Topical corticosteroids are often used to reduce intraocular and corneal inflammation and with long-term use IOP and cataract formation should be monitored. A rigid gas permeable lens — or hybrid or scleral lens when greater stability is needed — will often improve vision when surface irregularity is a factor and may obviate more invasive procedures. Surgical strategy depends on the tissue layer(s) involved, with lamellar keratoplasty or penetrating keratoplasty possibly indicated for deeper disease, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may be used to remove calcific band keratopathy.

### Pathogenesis and management of herpes simplex virus keratitis [^111YwBHF]. Eye (2003). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) remains a common cause of unilateral corneal disease. Despite intense research over three decades, the mainstay of therapy continues to be topical and, more recently, systemic acyclovir plus topical corticosteroid in some cases. There is increasing recognition that HSK after keratoplasty can occur not only as a result of recurrence in patients with HSK, but also in patients with other primary diagnoses as a result of activation of HSV in the host, or by transmission of virus in the donor tissue.

### Amniotic membrane extract and eye drops: a review of literature and clinical application [^113SB5d8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AME and AMEED have the potential for increased clinical use in corneal surface disorders. There is a need for additional clinical trials to determine standardization and efficacy of these products. While there are no reports of recognized complications of treatment using AMEED, a longer observation period and a larger patient population are necessary to validate its safety. However, with standardization of production, better preservation of AM prior to processing, stabilization of biological activities, and adequate well-designed clinical trials, AME and its derivatives are potentially useful as a treatment option for ocular surface disorders and an adjunct to surgical procedures, such as AMT and limbal grafts.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^116XuECY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome staged management and treatment recommendations outline a stepwise approach. Step 1 includes "Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis", environmental modification, dietary education "including oral essential fatty acid supplementation", medication review, "Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)", and "Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 2 additions including "Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity", Demodex therapy with "Tea tree oil or lotilaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex", tear conservation with "Punctal occlusion" and "Moisture chamber spectacles/goggles", "Overnight treatments (such as ointment or moisture chamber devices)", "In-office, physical heating and expression of the meibomian glands (including thermal pulsation devices)", and prescription drugs to manage dry eye disease (DED) such as "Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)", "Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)", "Topical secretagogues", "Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)", "Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)", "Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)", "Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway", and "Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 3 options including "Oral secretagogues", "Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops", "Platelet-rich plasma eye drops", "Blood-based products", and therapeutic contact lenses including "Soft bandage lenses with caution" and "Rigid scleral lenses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 4 options including "Topical corticosteroid for longer duration", "Amniotic membrane grafts", "Surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery)", and "Other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation)". Notes state that "One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state", that options "are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid", that "The severity and etiology of the DED state will dictate the range and number of management options selected from one or more steps", and that prescription drug use "needs to be considered in the context of the individual patient presentation, and the relative level of evidence supporting their use for those specific indications".

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1179x62B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adenoviral conjunctivitis — therapy and monitoring — There is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenovirus infection; however, artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical steroids, oral analgesics, or cold compresses may be used to mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics in this viral infection should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Topical corticosteroids are helpful to reduce symptoms and may reduce scarring in severe cases, with close follow-up warranted for patients treated with corticosteroids; in an animal model, administration of topical corticosteroids led to prolonged viral shedding, and it is not known whether this is the case in humans. Because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum, povidone-iodine has been investigated as a treatment consideration. Off-label use of topical ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel has been investigated for the treatment of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and has shown potential benefit specific against adenovirus serotypes, but further efficacy on a larger scale needs to be demonstrated before definitive recommendations can be made. For patients with membranous conjunctivitis, debridement of the membrane can be considered to prevent corneal epithelial abrasions or permanent cicatricial changes.

Results

A total of 97 eyes of 84 patients [12 (14%) male, 69 (82%) female, and 3 (4%) unknown] were included in this study. They exhibited severe dry eye (DEWS 3.25 ± 0.5) despite maximal medical treatments such as artificial tears (82%), steroids (44%), cyclosporine-A (40%), antibiotics (30%), serum drops (8%), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (5%). Punctal plugs were also noted in 29 cases (35%). The majority of patients presented with ocular discomfort (83%) and blurry vision (60%). Other symptoms included ocular pain (35%), redness (29%), and light sensitivity (14%). Most of the cases manifested with superficial punctate keratitis (86%) followed by exposure keratitis (19%), filamentary keratitis (13%), epithelial defect (7%), and neurotrophic keratitis (2%). Comorbidities included blepharitis (39%), cataract (36%), glaucoma (20%), lagophthalmos (7%), and conjunctivitis (5%).

### Topical corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis [^115gRY47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular infectious disease that can lead to severe visual disability. Risk factors for bacterial corneal infection include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery. Topical antibiotics constitute the mainstay of treatment in cases of bacterial keratitis, whereas the use of topical corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics remains controversial. Topical corticosteroids are usually used to control inflammation using the smallest amount of the drug. Their use requires optimal timing, concomitant antibiotics, and careful follow-up.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis. Secondary objectives included evaluation of health economic outcomes and quality of life outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 July 2014. We also searched the Science Citation Index to identify additional studies that had cited the only trial included in the original version of this review, reference lists of included trials, earlier reviews, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines. We also contacted experts to identify any unpublished and ongoing randomized trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had evaluated adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids in people with bacterial keratitis who were being treated with antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year. These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa. All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group. The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94). However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11). For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups. The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90). One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available). We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes. Although the four trials were generally of good methodological design, all trials had considerable losses to follow-up (10% or more) in the final analyses. Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is inadequate evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive topical corticosteroids compared with no topical corticosteroids in improving visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratitis. Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid, but may be due to insufficient power to detect a treatment effect.

### Combined anterior chamber washout, amniotic membrane transplantation, and topical use of corticosteroids for severe peripheral ulcerative keratitis [^114mjJ43]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anterior chamber washout, amniotic membrane transplantation, and topical use of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe peripheral ulcerative keratitis with membranous endothelial exudation.

Methods

Twelve patients (12 eyes) with severe corneal ulceration were included. All ulcers were located at the corneal periphery, accompanied by central corneal epithelial defects and stromal edema. Membranous endothelial exudates were observed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The duration of the ulcers was 1 to 10 months (mean, 3.0 ± 2.9 months) before the patients visited our institution. Corneal inflammation and ulceration could not be controlled after 2 weeks of topical antiinflammation treatment. Bacterial, fungal, and Acanthamoeba infections were not detected. Surgical treatment was performed. After the necrotic corneal tissue was cut, exudation clinging to the endothelium was removed. Then, amniotic membrane was placed on the corneal lesion. Postoperatively, corticosteroid eye drops and topical and systemic antiinflammation medication were given. Healing of corneal ulcers and improvement of stromal edema were detected by slit-lamp microscopy. All patients were followed up for 3 to 15 months (mean, 6.5 ± 3.7 months).

Results

All corneal ulcers healed by 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. The corneal stromal edema subsided within 1 month. All patients achieved a stable ocular surface. There was no recurrence during the follow-up.

Conclusions

Anterior chamber washout and amniotic membrane transplantation combined with topical corticosteroids seems to be effective for the treatment of severe peripheral ulcerative keratitis with endothelial exudates.

Treatment outcomes

Of the overall patient population, sixty-three cases (75.9%) received topical antifungal monotherapy, while 20 cases (24.1%) received a combined antifungal treatment. Combined topical antifungal treatment (33.3% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.139) and voriconazole/natamycin combination (10% vs. 0%, p = 0.044) were more common in the PS group than in the NPS. For systemic antifungal agents, fluconazole was the most commonly used in both groups (53.3, 67.9%), followed by amphotericin B (26.7, 32.1%). The use of systemic voriconazole was significantly higher in the PS group (23.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.003).

The median EHT was 27 days in the PS group and 23 days in the NPS group. Sixty percent of the PS group had a final BCVA of < 0.1 compared to 44.2% in the NPS group (Table 3). As a complication, corneal perforation was the most common (8 cases, 7 cases) in both groups, followed by endophthalmitis (2 cases, 1 case). The proportion of corneal perforation was slightly higher in the PS group compared to the NPS group (p = 0.126).

### Clinical features, risk factors and outcomes of contact lens-related bacterial keratitis in nottingham, UK: a 7-year study [^112UqkTs]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical management and outcomes

Full follow-up details were available for 134 (97.1%) patients. The majority (130, 97.0%) of patients were successfully treated with intensive topical antibiotics alone, including levofloxacin / moxifloxacin monotherapy (65, 48.5%) and dual therapy (69, 51.5%), consisting of cefuroxime in combination with amikacin, gentamicin, or levofloxacin. Topical steroids were used in 55 (41.0%) cases, with a mean start time of 11.1 ± 11.6 days after the initial presentation. Topical steroids were used in both microbiological-positive (31, 50%) and microbiological-negative (24, 33.3%) cases for a mean duration of 23.6 ± 20.3 days, after excluding cases that required long-term topical steroid use (e.g. eyes with previous keratoplasty) from the analysis. Hospitalisation for intensive treatment was warranted in 52 (37.7%) patients, with microbiological-positive cases having a greater need and longer duration of hospitalisation (p < 0.01) (Table 1). Three (2.2%) patients underwent optical penetrating keratoplasty for treating post-infection corneal scar and one (0.7%) patient required amniotic membrane grafting for managing persistent corneal epithelial defect. Recurrence of infection and corneal melt were noted in 11 (8.2%) and 6 (4.5%) cases, respectively, but were successfully managed with topical antibiotics. No significant adverse event, such as corneal perforation or uncontrollable infection requiring therapeutic keratoplasty or anophthalmic surgery, was noted.

Of the 134 patients, the mean CDVA improved significantly from 0.70 ± 0.76 logMAR at presentation to 0.21 ± 0.40 logMAR at final follow-up (p < 0.001), with 114 (85.1%) patients achieving an equal or better final CDVA compared to the initial CDVA (Fig. 1). The proportion of patients with CDVA of ≥ 0.30 logMAR increased from 42.5% to 80.6% (p < 0.001). The mean complete corneal healing time was 21.4 ± 15.2 days, with 31 (23.1%) cases having a delayed corneal healing (i.e. > 30 days).

### Steroids in the management of infectious keratitis [^1143yScH]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To summarize the evidence base on the use of topical corticosteroids for infectious keratitis.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

Infectious keratitis is a painful condition that often results in visually significant corneal stromal scarring, even when antimicrobial therapy is successful. Corticosteroids may reduce inflammation and subsequent scar formation and while relieving the acute ocular pain associated with a corneal ulcer. However, corticosteroids also reduce the host immune response, which could hinder the ability to clear infection. The safety and effectiveness of corticosteroids depends to a large part on the efficacy of the antimicrobials being used to treat the underlying infection. Randomized trials have found that corticosteroids are safe and effective for herpetic keratitis when used with appropriate antiviral therapy, and are safe for bacterial keratitis when used with broad spectrum topical antibiotics. The effectiveness of corticosteroids for bacterial keratitis has not been shown conclusively, although more advanced bacterial corneal ulcers may do better with corticosteroids. No randomized trials have assessed the safety and effectiveness of steroids for fungal or acanthamoeba keratitis. Animal studies suggest corticosteroids may be harmful in fungal keratitis, and observational human studies have found that steroids are harmful for fungal and acanthamoeba keratitis when started prior to anti-amoebics.

Conclusions

Topical corticosteroids, when used as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy, may be beneficial if the antimicrobial being used can effectively clear or suppress the infection, such as in bacterial and herpetic keratitis. Randomized trials would be helpful to further delineate the role of corticosteroids for infectious keratitis.

### Role of steroids in the treatment of bacterial keratitis [^116vqSEA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea which, when severe, can be sight threatening. Because keratitis can result from both infectious and noninfectious etiologies, diagnosis and management can sometimes prove challenging. Out of the estimated 30,000 cases of microbial (bacterial, fungal, and parasitic) keratitis that occurs annually in the USA, the vast majority are bacterial in nature. The incidence of bacterial keratitis is ten times higher in tropical climates and developing nations than in temperate environments and in the developed world.–Risk factors for bacterial keratitis include contact lens wear, corneal trauma, ocular surface disease, history of ocular or eyelid surgery, HIV infection, and immunodeficiency. Organisms that comprise the normal ocular flora, such as Streptococci and Staphylococci, can lead to ulceration if normal host defenses are violated.–In contact lens wearers, a higher prevalence of bacterial keratitis due to gram-negative rods (eg, Pseudomonas spp.) is seen.

Patients with bacterial keratitis typically present with decreased vision, pain, and photophobia. Clinical signs include a corneal epithelial defect that stains with fluorescein and associated stromal infiltrate. In severe cases, the loss of stromal tissue and ulceration occur (Figure 1). The extent of visual loss depends on the size and location of the infiltrate as well as on the surrounding corneal edema. The severity of the corneal infection generally correlates with the degree of anterior chamber cellular reaction and possible hypopyon formation. Intraocular pressure can be high due to obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory cells or low due to ciliary body inflammation and aqueous hyposecretion.

Corneal scrapings for smears and cultures are the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial keratitis, and the corneal examination alone is not enough to discriminate between bacterial and other forms of infectious or noninfectious keratitis, even for experienced clinicians. Empirical therapy with topical antibiotics is generally started at presentation and tailored according to microbiologic results, taking into consideration the size and severity of the infection. Inadequate control of the infection can lead to severe ulceration, perforation, endophthalmitis, blindness, and even loss of the eye. Unfortunately, even if the causative organisms are eradicated, the loss of vision can ensue from the subsequent scarring and vascularization of the cornea. Anterior lamellar keratoplasty or full thickness corneal transplantation may then be necessary to restore visual clarity. The long-term prognosis for corneal grafts after history of severe corneal ulcers is guarded.

### Freeze-dried amniotic membrane graft with a spongy layer in bilateral peripheral ulcerative keratitis: a case report [^112JUWUX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is a group of inflammatory corneal ulcers with stromal thinning and peripheral localization. It begins with immune cellular infiltrates in the juxtalimbal cornea, followed by a crescent-shaped ulcer that appears parallel to the limbus. In 10 to 30% of cases, it is associated with scleritis, and in 40% of cases, both eyes are affected. The risk of perforation increases in case of associated scleritis and decreases with the introduction of an immunosuppressant.

Medical management of PUK includes intense lubrication and antibiotics, along with topical and systemic steroids and immunosuppressants to control the underlying inflammatory process. In advanced stages of thinning, surgical procedures are necessary to preserve globe integrity.

Amniotic membranes (AM) are known for their anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-angiogenic, healing, and analgesic properties, partly because they contain growth factors, cytokines, and metalloproteinases inhibitors. Their use in ophthalmology has been widely described in the surgical management of ocular surface conditions such as eye burns, corneal defects, infectious keratitis, pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Cryopreservation and freeze-drying are two different preservation methods. Sterilization followed by freeze-drying has the advantage of maintaining the AM viable for a long time at room temperature without altering its physical, biological, and morphologic characteristics.

We report a case of bilateral PUK with a high risk of perforation surgically treated with a FD-AM graft.

### Effect of OTX-101, a novel nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine A, on corneal staining in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca: a pooled analysis of phase 2b / 3 and phase 3 studies [^112SjLRd]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease, also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and is accompanied by ocular symptoms in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity and ocular surface inflammation and damage play etiological roles. Dry eye disease is a vicious cycle in which hyperosmolarity leads to an inflammatory cascade that results in ocular surface damage.

The clinical presentation of KCS varies from patient to patient, and the relationship between signs and symptoms is not linear. Symptoms of KCS may include burning, stinging, grittiness, foreign body sensation, and dryness. Although the prevalence of KCS is difficult to determine because of inconsistent definitions and populations, studies have shown that the prevalence ranges from 5% to 33%.

Treatment of KCS progresses in a stepwise approach, starting with education, lid hygiene, and modification of environmental factors and then progressing to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management. There are currently 2 topical ocular pharmacologic treatments in use to treat KCS, cyclosporine 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis; Allergan, Irvine, CA) and lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution (Xiidra; Shire US Inc, Lexington, MA).

The current pharmacologic treatments of KCS have several limitations. Almost 20% of patients with dry eye are dissatisfied with their overall treatment, which may include artificial tears, ocular lubricants, and prescription medications; areas of dissatisfaction include symptom relief, treatment side effects, and amount of time it takes to experience symptom relief. In addition, lipophilic drugs such as cyclosporine A (CsA) have low ocular tissue bioavailability and require innovative approaches to get more of the drug into ocular tissue. This highlights the unmet need for an improved ophthalmic drug delivery system.

### Application of our understanding of pathogenesis of herpetic stromal keratitis for novel therapy [^114vzS6k]. Microbes and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

HSV-1 ocular infection can cause herpes stromal keratitis (SK), an immunopathological lesion. Frequent recurrences can lead to progressive corneal scaring which can result in vision impairment if left untreated. Currently, the acute and epithelial forms of SK are usually controlled using anti-viral drugs. However, chronic forms of SK which are inflammatory in nature, require the addition of a topical corticosteroid to the anti-viral treatment regimen. In this review, we highlight the essential events involved in SK pathogenesis which can be targeted for improved therapy. We also examine some approaches which can be combined with the current treatments to effectively control SK.

### The outcomes of corneal sight rehabilitating surgery in Stevens-Johnson syndrome: case series [^114HzfgX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regular postoperative therapy

Postoperative routine medication is shown in Fig. 1. Intravenous glucocorticoid 5 ~ 10mg/d, antibiotic eye drops, glucocorticoid eye drops (except fungal infection), and tacrolimus eye drops were routinely administered for 3 days after surgery. The dosage was gradually reduced according to the patient's condition. The surgeon closely observed the patient's intraocular pressure and corneal repair. The patients were observed daily while they were in the hospital, weekly after leaving the hospital but before the amniotic membrane melted and corneal epithelialization occurred, monthly for the next three months, and trimonthly thereafter. The conjunctival sutures were removed after the amniotic membrane melted. The corneal sutures were removed after they loosened or after more than one year.

Fig. 1
Postoperative routine medication

Main outcome measures

VA, optical clarity of the cornea, corneal epithelialization, corneal vascularization, and IOP were reviewed. The lid, conjunctival, and corneal changes at presentation were graded according to the classification of Sotozono et al. Successful keratoplasty was defined on the basis of corneal epithelialization, decrease in corneal neovascularization, and improvement in VA.

Additional treatment

For patients with persistent epithelial defect or delayed epithelialization, contact lenses were first used to promote epithelialization. If the condition of the cornea did not improve, amniotic membrane was transplanted and 40% diluted (with artificial tears eyedrop) autologous serum eyedrops (four times daily) was administered. If the condition of the cornea still did not improve, permanent tarsorrhaphy was performed. If the cornea had superficial punctate keratopathy, deproteinized calf blood extract eye gel was administered four times per day.

IOP was monitored because of the long-term administration of glucocorticoid eyedrops. If the IOP was above the normal level, IOP-lowering medications were administered at first with or without tapering the dose or concentration of the glucocorticoid eyedrops. If the IOP could not be controlled, external drainage surgery was performed.

If the result of real time PCR of the resected tissues was positive, a topical antiviral drug was administered four times per day over six months. Systemic antiviral medicine was administered for three months in addition to monitoring the results of blood laboratory tests.

If a patient had fungal or bacterial keratitis, anti-fungal or anti-bacterial drugs were administered.

### Phase 3 efficacy (worse-eye analysis) and long-term safety evaluation of OTX-101 in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca [^11129Vcb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This phase 3, randomized, multicenter study included a 12-week, double-masked, vehicle-controlled treatment phase and a subsequent long-term safety extension phase of up to 52 weeks. Primary efficacy and safety results of the treatment phase have been previously described. The current analysis focuses on the worse-eye efficacy results of the treatment phase, and on the long-term safety results of the extension phase.

The study adhered to the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines and all applicable US federal regulations and local legal and regulatory requirements. The study protocol was approved by a central Institutional Review Board and all patients provided written informed consent prior to screening.

Men and women ≥ 18 years of age were eligible to enroll in the treatment phase if they had a self-reported history of KCS for ≥ 6 months prior to screening and clinical diagnosis of bilateral KCS. Additional key inclusion criteria were lissamine green conjunctival staining sum score excluding superior zones of 3 to 9 out of a possible score of 12 in the same eye, global symptom assessment in dry eye score ≥ 40 both at screening and baseline visits, corrected Snellen visual acuity (VA) score better than 20/200 in each eye, and willingness to discontinue any current dry eye treatment. Patients who successfully completed the treatment phase were eligible to enroll in the long-term safety extension if they had corrected Snellen VA better than 20/200 in each eye at week 12 of the treatment phase.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation: structural and biological properties, tissue preparation, application and clinical indications [^113S49Wz]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The amniotic membrane is a single epithelial layer of the placenta. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-scarring, anti-angiogenic and possibly bactericidal properties. The basement membrane of the amniotic membrane acts as a substrate to encourage healing and re-epithelialisation. It has been used in many ocular surface diseases including persistent epithelial defects (corneal or conjunctival), chemical or thermal burns, limbal stem cell deficiency, cicatrising conjunctivitis, ocular graft versus host disease, microbial keratitis, corneal perforation, bullous keratopathy, dry eye disease, corneal haze following refractive surgery and cross-linking, band keratopathy, ocular surface neoplasia, pterygium surgery, and ligneous conjunctivitis. This review provides an up-to-date overview of amniotic membrane transplantation including the structural and biological properties, preparation and application, clinical indications, and commercially available products.

Results

Thirteen eyes of 13 consecutive patients (6 females, 7 males) with a mean age of 67.3 ± 11.8 were included in this study. All patients presented with corneal ulcers despite prior conservative treatment with artificial tears (11/13, [85%]), antibiotics (11/13 [85%]), ointment (11/13 [85%]), steroids (6/13 [46%]), antivirals (3/13 [23%]), NSAIDs (3/13 [23%]), BCL (1/13 [8%]), and mydriatics (1/13 [8%]). Ulcers were located centrally (7/13 [54%]), peripherally (3/13 [23%]), or both centrally and peripherally (3/13 [23%]) as evidenced by corneal staining. The majority of corneal ulcers (9/13 [69%]) resulted from underlying neurotrophic keratitis (NK) caused by acoustic neuroma removal (n = 1), lagophthalmos (n = 3), herpetic infection (simplex or zoster) (n = 3), and advanced diabetes mellitus (DM) (n = 2). The etiologies of the remaining ulcers were autoimmune disease (n = 2), chemical burn (n = 1), and dry eye (n = 1). Relevant clinical data for each patient are summarized in Table 1.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^116m2QvA]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) — patients with multiorgan systemic GVHD are treated with systemic immunosuppression, with systemic corticosteroids the mainstay of initial treatment and commonly used in conjunction with a T-cell inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus); in corticosteroid-refractory GVHD, therapies studied include cyclophosphamide, biologics, and photopheresis with varied success. For ocular GVHD, aggressive lubrication is particularly useful in treating secondary keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and punctal occlusion can be considered. There is a role for topical corticosteroids in treating conjunctival hyperemia and scarring, and topical T-cell modulator (cyclosporine) and autologous serum tears can be used to treat dry eye syndrome associated with GVHD. Other secondary complications, such as cicatricial eyelid malposition or limbal stem cell failure, should be managed on a case-by-case basis, and scleral lenses may be helpful for vision correction and relief from dry eye symptoms.

### Role of steroids in the treatment of bacterial keratitis [^115Nky8Y]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Out of the 500 participants, follow-up data were available on 442 patients at 3 months (88.4%) and 399 patients at 12 months (79.8%). In terms of baseline characteristics, the only difference between the corticosteroid group (222 participants at 3 months) and the placebo group (220 participants at 3 months) was the presence of more central ulcers in the corticosteroid group (P -value, 0.02). In terms of outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as far as BCVA, size of scar, time to resolution of the epithelial defect, or rate of perforation are concerned. Counterintuitively, more participants in the placebo arm experienced a statistically significant increase in intraocular pressure (25–35 mmHg) than in the topical corticosteroid arm (P -value, 0.04).

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^112gCByB]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis (initial evaluation) — care management notes that topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases. Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics, and fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present, with combination fortified-antibiotic therapy as an alternative for severe infection or eyes unresponsive to initial treatment; there is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics. Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome, and subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics. For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended), and severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.

### Bilateral topical anaesthetic abuse keratopathy [^115tNiZ3]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her late 30s presented with severe pain, photophobia and redness in both eyes (BE) for 3weeks. She was diagnosed and on treatment elsewhere for presumed bilateral herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, with oral antivirals and topical steroids for 4months. Examination showed bilateral near-total corneal epithelial defects with hypertrophic edges and diffuse stromal oedema. Detailed history uncovered frequent use of topical proparacaine hydrochloride solution (0.5%) for severe pain. She underwent bilateral amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) with tarsorrhaphy, resulting in rapid epithelialisation of the corneal surface and a gradual decrease in inflammation. She underwent sequential penetrating keratoplasty (PK) for visual restoration after the inflammation subsided completely. Our case highlights the deleterious effects of topical anaesthetic when used frequently. The clinical picture can often be confused with infectious keratitis. As noted in our case, patients commonly withhold a history of its use, which leads to diagnostic delay and vision-threatening complications.

### Treatment of patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca with optive: results of a multicenter, open-label observational study in Germany [^1147q1qe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Optive, a new dry eye product containing sodium carboxymethylcellulose (0.5%) and glycerol (0.9%), in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).

Methods

This was a non-interventional and observational study including patients with dry eye who required a change of medication or were naïve to dry eye treatment (N = 5,277). Disease severity, tear break-up time (TBUT), tolerability, and change in clinical symptoms were recorded at baseline and at final visit (2 to 4 weeks after first treatment).

Results

The severity of KCS was mild in 18.6%, moderate in 59.9%, and severe in 21.5% of patients based on physicians' assessment. TBUT was measured in 4,338 patients before switching to or initiating therapy with Optive and at final visit. Baseline measurement of mean TBUT was 7.7 ± 3.9 seconds. This value increased to 10.0 ± 4.7 seconds at final visit. Most patients (85.4%) reported improvement in local comfort. The majority (75.1%) of patients felt an improvement in symptoms after changing their treatment. Two percent of patients reported adverse events, and 0.4% were treatment-related.

Conclusions

Optive was well tolerated and improved the symptoms of dry eye after 2 to 4 weeks.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116qPLBs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV — HSV stromal keratitis management — topical steroid regimen with systemic antiviral prophylaxis, avoidance of prolonged topical antivirals, and ophthalmology oversight. For patients who also have stromal keratitis, largely due to inflammation rather than replicating virus, topical steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Prednisolone 1% eye drops (1 drop to affected eye 6–8 times a day) is given for at least 10 weeks, followed by a slow taper. Steroids should be given in conjunction with acyclovir 400 mg twice daily (AII) or valacyclovir 500 mg daily (AIII) for at least one year to decrease the risk of recurrent stromal inflammation. Topical antivirals should not be used for extended durations to prevent recurrence, as this can cause toxicity to the eye that can be confused with persistent infection. As HSV keratitis exists along a continuum between epithelial viral replication and stromal inflammation, all cases should be managed by an ophthalmologist (AIII).

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^115fXxDw]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — medical management can be divided into two phases addressing the initiating process and the resulting problems; conventional treatment involves an antibiotic drop or ointment to protect against secondary bacterial infection, temporary tarsorrhaphy with botulinum toxin or suture can be helpful when blinking or eyelid closure is inadequate, and a bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane may be helpful in cases of delayed healing. Pressure patching used to be standard treatment, but a study found that this does not positively impact comfort or speed of healing, and progressive thinning of cornea or a small perforation usually requires structural support with application of a tissue adhesive. Topical corticosteroids are often used to reduce intraocular and corneal inflammation and IOP and cataract formation should be monitored with long-term topical corticosteroid use; a rigid gas permeable lens — or hybrid or scleral lens when greater stability is needed — will often improve vision when surface irregularity is a factor and such lenses may obviate the need for more invasive procedures.

### Management of ocular surface inflammation with persistent epithelial defects using a sutureless human amniotic membrane dehydrated matrix: a prospective study utilizing a digital ocular surface assessment tool [^1152PE3f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

OSD embodies a range of indications, including corneal damage (erosion, thinning, neurotrophic changes, and laceration), ocular surface inflammation, filamentary keratitis, PED, and limbal stem-cell deficiency. These conditions disrupt the homeostasis of the ocular surface, and if not appropriately managed can lead to stromal melting, scarring, or even perforation, with a threat of long-term visual impairment.

Primary ocular surface disorders (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, neurotrophic disease secondary to herpes stromal keratitis, chemical injury) and systemic conditions affecting the limbal stem cells (Stevens–Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid) are the risk factors responsible for PED development. In these conditions, the ocular surface experiences prolonged inflammatory episodes that can alter the normal functioning of the epithelial basement membrane and limbal stem cells. Neurotrophic disease accompanied by herpes stromal keratitis is known to be initiated by immunopathological processes involving T cell–mediated responses governed by proinflammatory cytokines. principally IL1 release from affected epithelial cells. The amniotic membrane, alongside its other mentioned mechanisms, also secretes IL1ra, which has been proved to be a natural antagonist of IL1. Late PED development is one of the serious postoperative complications following penetrating keratoplasty, affecting 4.2% of this group. This is more commonly associated with limbal stem-cell deficiency leading to increased risk of infection, stromal collagen destruction, and corneal neovascularization threatening graft survival.

The effectiveness of HAMDM (Omnigen) in the treatment of PED of various etiologies (n = 90) has been reported, with complete resolution of 63.6% and partial healing of 23.3% (Table 8). The PED-healing rate in this cohort (n = 16) was 87.6% showing complete resolution and 6.2% partial resolution. Although our patient cohort was smaller, the research was conducted by the same clinician group, and it may be assumed that improvement in healing outcome is due to greater clinical experience and confidence in treatment use, as well as better patient selection. In addition to this, these assessments were conducted prospectively to ensure more accurate mapping of complex OSD patients presenting to these centers in the UK.

### Amniotic membrane transplantation combined with antiviral and steroid therapy for herpes necrotizing stromal keratitis [^116XFisd]. Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate therapeutic effect of multilayer amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in conjunction with antiviral and corticosteroid therapy on herpes necrotizing stromal keratitis.

Design

Retrospective interventional case series.

Participants

Fifteen patients (15 eyes) with herpes necrotizing stromal keratitis, persistent corneal inflammation, and impending ulcer, despite topical and systemic antiviral treatment for over 2 weeks.

Methods

Multilayer AMT was performed in the 15 eyes. Antiviral medications and appropriate corticosteroids were administered after surgery. Remodeling of amniotic membrane (AM) and growth of epithelial cells were detected by confocal microscopy.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity and corneal status (ulceration, edema, and opacification).

Results

Follow-up ranged from 7 to 13 months (mean ± standard deviation, 8.9 ± 1.8). Visual acuity improved by ≥ 2 lines in 14 eyes. Central corneal ulcers healed completely at 2.0 ± 0.6 weeks, and paracentral ulcers at 2.1 ± 0.6 weeks (t = 0.314, P = 0.759). Corneal stromal thickness was restored in eyes with central ulcers at 2.4 ± 1.2 weeks and in those with paracentral ulcers at 2.6 ± 0.7 weeks (t = 0.425, P = 0.678). Superficial epithelial cells, together with small basal epithelial cells, gradually migrated to the surface of AM on postoperative weeks 1 to 3. There were corneal nebulae in 11 eyes, corneal maculae in 3 eyes, and a corneal leukoma in 1 eye at the end of follow-up. No recrudescence occurred in any eye.

Conclusion

Multilayer AMT combined with antiviral and corticosteroid therapy appears effective in treating herpes necrotizing stromal keratitis. It provides patients with marked scars and visual impairment an opportunity for subsequent keratoplasty by arresting the inflammatory response and reducing the graft bed diameter.

### Freeze-dried amniotic membrane graft with a spongy layer in bilateral peripheral ulcerative keratitis: a case report [^116kRXLy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the early stages, PUK is usually managed with intense lubrication to promote healing, topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, topical steroids and ciclosporin to control the underlying condition. Steroids should be used in association with tears substitutes because they inhibit collagen synthesis and can delay scarring. In more advanced stages with impending perforation, a surgical approach is often needed to preserve globe integrity. Resection of the adjacent conjunctiva aims at reducing juxtalimbal source of the immune trigger and inflammatory cells, and AM grafting promotes rapid healing by releasing growth factors and reduces inflammation by sequestering inflammatory cells infiltrating the ocular surface. The AM, with its anti-inflammatory properties, seems in theory more appropriate in PUK than cryanoacrylate glue. Howewer Yin J et al. show no difference in success in managing perforations with glue depending on the aetiology. Only larger size of the perforation and single glue application were correlated with higher failure rate. Similarly, a tenon patch taken from the patient's own inflamed eye seems less appropriate than an amniotic membrane. However, tenon grafts could be a solution in emergency situations. These three different methods can also be successfully combined in current practice. Glue can also be used instead of sutures.

### Self-retained cryopreserved amniotic membrane for the management of corneal ulcers [^113TvQYy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical outcomes of self-retained cryopreserved amniotic membrane (cAM) for the treatment of corneal ulcers.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective review of consecutive patients with non-healing corneal ulcers that underwent treatment with self-retained cAM (PROKERA ® Slim). The primary outcome measure was time to complete corneal epithelialization. Ocular discomfort, corneal staining, corneal signs, and visual acuity were assessed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Complications, adverse events, and ulcer recurrence were also recorded.

Results

A total of 13 eyes (13 patients) with recalcitrant corneal ulcers were included for analysis, 9 (69%) of which progressed from neurotrophic keratitis (NK). Prior to cAM application, patients used conventional treatments such as artificial tears (n = 11), antibiotics (n = 11), ointment (n = 11), steroids (n = 6), and antivirals (n = 3). Self-retained cAMs (n = 1.5 ± 0.8) were placed for 6.8 ± 3.4 days, during which time antibiotics were continued. Four cases (31%) were subsequently treated with bandage contact lens (n = 3) and tarsorrhaphy (n = 1). All corneal ulcers healed in a median of 14 days (range: 4–43). This was accompanied by a significant improvement in ocular discomfort, corneal staining, and corneal signs at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months (P < .05). Recurrence was noted in one case. No adverse events were observed.

Conclusion

Self-retained cAM may be a valuable, in-office treatment option for healing recalcitrant corneal ulcers of various etiologies, especially those with underlying NK. Further prospective, controlled studies are warranted.

### Vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^117WDiDv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Complications

Severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis is most frequently a self-limiting disease; however, in some cases sight-threatening complications may develop. The corneal epithelium acts as a barrier to circulating pathogens, but may become damaged in severe disease both due to trauma from upper tarsal papillae and a complex array of inflammatory molecules. This combination of repeated trauma and inflammatory milieu may then lead to shield ulcers and plaques. Shield ulcers usually form on the upper third of the cornea and can lead to sight-threatening complications in up to 6% of patients. They begin as punctate epithelial erosions which coalesce to form macroerosions which then develop into shield ulcers which can be self-limiting or develop further consequences such as bacterial keratitis. Plaques form when inflammatory debris accumulates at the base of a shield ulcer. They are particularly resistant to topical therapy and may require surgical intervention.

Patients with long-standing vernal keratoconjunctivitis may also develop limbal stem cell deficiency due to longstanding inflammation. The prevalence of limbal stem cell deficiency in patients with VKC may be as high as 1.2% and occurs in older patients with VKC. Treatment may include amniotic membrane transplantation or allo-limbal stem cell transplantation. Other commonly associated complications from vernal keratoconjunctivitis include keratoconus and irregular astigmatism due to frequent eye rubbing in the atopic pediatric populationand steroid-induced glaucoma from frequent use of topical corticosteroids.
