## Question

54 yo F with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate 15 mg weekly and low-dose prednisone 7.5 mg daily), presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation, HR 110, BP 132/82. Echo shows normal LV function, mild pericardial effusion, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Labs: Na 138, K 4.3, Cr 0.8, LFTs WNL. She is started on amiodarone for rate/rhythm control, but continues to have AF at 24h. Her rheumatologist suggests adding colchicine 0.6 mg BID to "help prevent pericarditis recurrence". Is this a safe combination?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adding colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily to amiodarone is safe in a 54-year-old woman with new-onset atrial fibrillation and a mild pericardial effusion, and what dose adjustments or monitoring are needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic interaction between colchicine and amiodarone. Then, I should verify the clinical risk of toxicity with this combination. Next, I will review guideline-based dosing recommendations for colchicine in the setting of CYP3A4/P-gp inhibition. After that, I need to check the patient's renal and hepatic function to determine if further dose reduction is warranted. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-mitigated plan and confirm whether the indication for colchicine is appropriate in this context.

> Let me first confirm the interaction mechanism. Colchicine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, and amiodarone is a moderate inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, so coadministration increases colchicine exposure and the risk of toxicity, particularly gastrointestinal, hematologic, and neuromuscular adverse effects [^507c27ea] [^824cbe26] [^ed6b3d73].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect. Multiple sources indicate that moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors can roughly double colchicine plasma concentrations, and some reports suggest even greater increases with P-gp inhibition, which meaningfully narrows the therapeutic index and increases toxicity risk, especially with higher colchicine doses or impaired clearance [^824cbe26] [^507c27ea].

> I should confirm the clinical toxicity profile. The most common effects are gastrointestinal intolerance, but serious toxicity includes myelosuppression, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis; case series document rhabdomyolysis with colchicine plus interacting drugs, and FDA labeling warns about blood dyscrasias and neuromuscular toxicity, particularly in older adults or those with renal impairment [^38845a0d] [^c1fd254f] [^4c6ce38b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check guideline-based dosing in the presence of CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors. Authoritative guidance recommends reducing colchicine dose to 0.3–0.6 mg daily when coadministered with moderate inhibitors like amiodarone, and some expert reviews advise a 50% dose reduction in this scenario, which would argue against 0.6 mg twice daily and support 0.3–0.6 mg once daily instead [^da2c9c76] [^490c0050] [^824cbe26].

> Next, I should review the patient's organ function. With normal renal and hepatic labs, no additional dose reduction is mandated beyond that required for the drug–drug interaction, but I still need to ensure cautious titration and monitoring given the narrow therapeutic index and age-related susceptibility to toxicity [^c99956bc] [^4c6ce38b].

> Let me consider the indication itself. The rheumatologist's intent is to prevent pericarditis recurrence; however, a small, stable pericardial effusion without inflammatory features is not an indication for colchicine prophylaxis, and routine use for asymptomatic effusions is discouraged. Colchicine is indicated for acute or recurrent pericarditis, not for silent effusions, so I should clarify the clinical context before committing to chronic therapy [^490c0050] [^da2c9c76].

> I will now examine a practical, risk-mitigated approach. If, after shared decision-making, colchicine is still desired for a compelling reason, I would reduce the dose to 0.3–0.6 mg once daily, avoid loading doses, and monitor closely for diarrhea, nausea, weakness, and laboratory signs of myelosuppression or myopathy. Given the interaction, I would also reassess the need for amiodarone and consider alternatives if feasible, and I would avoid other CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that could further increase colchicine exposure [^da2c9c76] [^507c27ea] [^824cbe26].

> But wait, what if the AF persists and amiodarone is necessary? I should confirm that amiodarone remains the most appropriate antiarrhythmic here. Guidelines reserve amiodarone for selected patients given its extracardiac toxicity, and if rhythm control is not urgent, switching to a noninteracting agent could obviate the colchicine interaction risk entirely, which may be the safer long-term strategy in this case [^006efed1] [^5f7c4ce6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily with amiodarone is not considered safe without dose adjustment due to increased colchicine exposure. If colchicine is used at all, the dose should be reduced to 0.3–0.6 mg once daily with vigilant monitoring, and the indication for colchicine in a patient with a mild, asymptomatic pericardial effusion should be reconsidered in light of current guidance [^507c27ea] [^da2c9c76] [^490c0050].

---

The combination of **amiodarone and colchicine** is not safe without dose adjustment because amiodarone inhibits CYP3A4 and P-gp, which increases colchicine levels and the risk of serious toxicity, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and bone marrow suppression [^507c27ea] [^824cbe26]. If colchicine is used for pericarditis prevention, the dose should be reduced to **0.3–0.6 mg daily** and the patient monitored closely for GI intolerance, myopathy, and cytopenias [^da2c9c76] [^c1fd254f]. Given the patient's normal renal and hepatic function, a reduced dose with monitoring is reasonable, but alternative anti-inflammatory strategies should be considered to avoid the interaction risk [^c99956bc].

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction

Amiodarone is a **moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor** [^507c27ea], and colchicine is a CYP3A4 substrate and P-gp substrate; thus, coadministration increases colchicine exposure and toxicity risk [^824cbe26].

---

## Clinical evidence of adverse effects

Case reports and series document **myopathy and rhabdomyolysis** with colchicine plus CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors, including amiodarone [^38845a0d]. Serious toxicity — such as bone marrow suppression, neuromyopathy, and multiorgan failure — has also been reported, particularly with interacting drugs or renal impairment [^c1fd254f] [^507c27ea].

---

## Guideline recommendations

Current guidance advises **dose reduction** of colchicine to 0.3–0.6 mg daily when coadministered with moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors like amiodarone, and close monitoring for toxicity is recommended [^da2c9c76] [^eaafd01c].

---

## Patient-specific risk assessment

In this patient, normal renal and hepatic function mitigate some risk, but the combination still warrants caution; **age-related susceptibility** and concomitant prednisone may increase adverse effects, so monitoring is essential [^c1fd254f].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce colchicine to 0.3–0.6 mg daily if used with amiodarone [^da2c9c76].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for GI intolerance, myopathy, and cytopenias; check CBC and CK if symptoms occur [^c1fd254f].
- **Alternatives**: Consider NSAIDs or corticosteroids for pericarditis prevention to avoid the interaction [^490c0050].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Dose adjustment | Colchicine 0.3–0.6 mg daily with amiodarone |
| Monitoring | - CBC <br/> - CK <br/> - Symptoms of myopathy <br/> - GI intolerance |
| Alternatives | NSAIDs or corticosteroids for pericarditis prevention |

---

The combination is **not safe without dose adjustment**; if colchicine is necessary, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, and consider alternatives to minimize interaction risk [^507c27ea].

### Select drug-drug interactions with colchicine and cardiovascular medications: a review [^ed6b3d73]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical utility of colchicine in the prevention and management of various cardiovascular conditions, including secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, acute and chronic pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation. As a result, it is reasonable to anticipate increased use of colchicine within the cardiovascular specialty. However, colchicine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and a substrate of the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), creating the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Therefore, when colchicine is administered concomitantly with other cardiovascular agents that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-gp, there is an increased risk of significant DDIs, potentially leading to negative sequelae. This article summarizes the evidence supporting the use of colchicine for cardiovascular disease, describes the mechanisms behind DDIs with select cardiovascular medications, and provides suggestions regarding colchicine dosing and management of DDIs to minimize the risk of poor tolerability and colchicine toxicity.

Key Points

Question

Are drug-drug interactions associated with the clinical safety and efficacy of colchicine in people with COVID-19?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of the COLCORONA trial including 4432 patients, interactions with statins and calcium channel blockers did not modify the association between randomization to colchicine vs placebo and the risk of any safety end point. Findings were similar for efficacy end points.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that drug-drug interaction-associated changes in colchicine pharmacokinetics do not translate into clinically significant changes in its safety and efficacy profile.

Over the past decade, advances in the knowledge of colchicine pharmacology, drug safety, and mechanisms of action have led to changes in colchicine dosing and to potential new uses for this very old drug. In this review, we discuss the pharmacologic properties of colchicine and summarize what is currently known about its mechanisms of action. We then discuss and update the use of colchicine in a variety of illnesses, including rheumatic and, most recently, cardiovascular diseases.

### Colchicine and the heart [^eaafd01c]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Potential drug–drug interactions with colchicine

The risk of serious drug–drug interaction (DDIs) in patients taking colchicine relates to the prescribed dose, the presence of advanced renal or liver disease, and the nature of adjunctive medication. Table 1 provides a list of commonly used medications metabolized via CYP3A4 and P-gp grouped by potency,7w and lists the maximum doses of colchicine that have been reported as being safe in patients with and without advanced renal or liver disease.

Table 1
Safe use of colchicine with commonly used drugs that affect clearance of colchicine

Concomitant use of colchicine must be carefully considered in all patients prescribed with several specific drugs, including clarithromycin and anti-fungal agents, even in the absence of severe renal or liver dysfunction. In patients without advanced renal or liver disease, long-term colchicine has been safely used at doses up to 1.0 mg daily in combination with other medication without dose adjustments. 8w Colchicine has been used at doses up to 1.0 mg daily in the presence of mild renal and liver disease; however, because the risk of DDIs is enhanced with drugs that have effects on CYP3A4 and P-gp, it is prudent to limit the dose to 0.5 mg daily. If colchicine is required in patients with severe renal or liver disease, doses of 0.5 mg should be administered no more than on alternate days.9w

Important drug interactions

Due to the combination of limited oral availability and being a substrate for P-gp and CYP3A4, colchicine is subject to a range of significant drug interactions, especially with P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent use of CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs can result in a doubling of colchicine plasma concentration, and the use of P-gp inhibitors may quadruple colchicine concentrations. Considering the low apparent percentage of colchicine that is metabolized by CYP3A4, it is likely that the interactions attributed to CYP3A4 are actually due, at least in part, to P-gp inhibition, as many CYP3A4 inhibitors are also P-gp inhibitors. Interacting drugs include diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, other protease inhibitors, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ciclosporin and telmisartan. Co-administration of verapamil, a potent P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the clearance of colchicine by ≈50%, thereby increasing plasma colchicine concentrations, indicating that the dose of colchicine should be reduced by ≈50% in individuals receiving concomitant verapamil.

### Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with psoriasis: a multicenter study [^b00c42ae]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings of worse electroanatomical markers of atrial cardiomyopathy (ie, a greater relative extension of LA low‐voltage zones) align with previous studies in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and HIV infection. These studies reported significant abnormalities in atrial electromechanical function, suggesting direct involvement of the atrial wall by the inflammatory process. Our study also supports previous findings on catheter ablation of AF in patients with systemic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which higher AT recurrence rates were reported. This reinforces the concept that LA ablation using thermal energy may not resolve the pathophysiological processes underpinning inflammation‐related atrial cardiomyopathy. Whether a recently‐introduced ablation energy source, pulsed field ablation, which is associated with a lower postablation proinflammatory and profibrotic response, may yield more favorable outcomes in patients with inflammation‐associated atrial cardiomyopathy is an important research question that future studies will need to address.

Our findings indicate that elevated baseline levels of widely available laboratory markers of inflammation, such as CRP, are significantly associated with an increased risk of AT recurrence post ablation, particularly in patients with psoriasis with preablation CRP > 1 mg/dL. This observation corroborates previous reportsand may underscore the need to optimize the pharmacological control of inflammatory disease activity using disease‐modifying drugs before proceeding with catheter ablation in patients with psoriasis and AF. Among possible strategies, prescribing biologic drugs among patients with moderate to severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis may offer particular value. Notably, TNF‐α inhibitors have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction in psoriasis patients, whereas IL‐17A inhibitors have demonstrated improved myocardial function in nonrandomized studies. However, the beneficial effects of these agents on rhythm outcomes in patients with psoriasis and AF require formal testing in future studies. The prescription of additional anti‐inflammatory drugs, such as colchicine, postablation has been proposed as a strategy to reduce postprocedural pericarditis and AT recurrence. However, recent data from a randomized, placebo‐controlled trial enrolling an all‐comers population of patients with AF receiving thermal ablation showed no benefits of postprocedural colchicine in terms of rhythm outcomes. Whether a postablation course of colchicine (or other anti‐inflammatory drugs) may benefit patients with AF and systemic inflammatory disorders remains to be clarified in future studies. It is plausible to speculate that anti‐inflammatory medications might have a synergistic effect with postprocedural antiarrhythmic drugs, facilitating the maintenance of sinus rhythm after PVI in the challenging context of inflammation‐related atrial cardiomyopathy.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^a39ac2f6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the USA. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

Colchicine: dosing, safety and tolerability

Colchicine exhibits a dose-dependent response with a narrow therapeutic index. Most side effects tend to resolve upon dose reduction or discontinuation. When divided into two daily doses and gradually increased, it is well-tolerated. For acute gout attacks, the recommended initial dose is 1.0 mg or 1.2 mg, followed by a 0.5 mg or 0.6 mg dose after 1 h. The maintenance dose is 0.5–0.6 mg, once or twice daily after the attack subsides. In familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients, it is well-tolerated up to 0.5 mg three times daily for the prevention of attacks and amyloidosis, in the absence of renal impairment. Gastrointestinal intolerance, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or discomfort, is the most common adverse reaction, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Treatment dosages may lead to mild leukopenia. Depending on the administered dosages and the presence of renal dysfunction, aplastic anemia, granulocytopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia may also occur. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are additional but rare side effects. The hepatic P450 cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme metabolizes colchicine, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp; also known as multidrug resistance protein-1; MDR1) efflux pump in the liver and kidneys removes it. The MDR1 gene, encoding P-gp, and specific MDR1 polymorphisms have been associated with elevated P-gp expression and decreased serum colchicine concentrations. Consequently, drugs strongly inhibiting CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, such as clarithromycin, fenofibrate, cyclosporine, and antifungals like itraconazole and ketoconazole, should be avoided, as they increase colchicine concentrations. Amiodarone, carvedilol, verapamil, and diltiazem may impede clearance, necessitating lower doses. While statins are generally well-tolerated, combining colchicine with atorvastatin has been linked to rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and in the elderly. Hemodialysis patients require dose reduction. Toxicity symptoms of colchicine typically resolve within a week to several months after discontinuation.

Data from patient studies indicate the safety of colchicine use during the peripartum period and breastfeeding. However, there is controversy regarding its effects on sperm production and function despite the belief that paternal exposure is consistent

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, maintenance therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating low-dose amiodarone (100–200 mg/day) for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and normal LV function, but in view of its adverse effect profile, reserve it for situations when other rhythm control strategies are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated.

Colchicine for secondary prevention — In clinically stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colchicine 0.5 mg daily reduced recurrent cardiovascular events, with the composite primary endpoint occurring in 6.8% in the colchicine group compared with 9.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001), although the study showed a trend toward increased risk of death from noncardiovascular causes. In acute coronary syndrome, the COLCOT trial reported the primary endpoint occurred in 5.5% of patients treated with colchicine compared with 7.1% in the placebo group (P = 0.02), driven primarily by reductions in strokes and urgent hospitalizations for angina leading to coronary revascularization. Trials excluded patients with creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min and were limited to a duration of just over 2 years; use should be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease (eGFR, < 30 mL/min/m2). Colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, necessitating careful evaluation for drug–drug interactions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericarditis after myocardial infarction — persistent/late symptom therapy and cautions: Given the rarity of post-MI pericarditis (0.1% to 0.5%) in the era of early coronary reperfusion therapy, high-dose aspirin 500–1000 mg every 6–8 h until symptoms improve and colchicine 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily for 3 mo are listed as additional therapy. Daily dosing should be used in patients who weigh < 70 kg and further adjusted in patients with stage 4–5 kidney disease, severe hepatic impairment, or with concomitant P-glycoprotein and/or moderate and severe CYP3A4 inhibitors. Routine use of high-dose aspirin or colchicine is not indicated for the management of asymptomatic pericardial effusions, and glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (other than aspirin) are potentially harmful due to possible increase in risk of recurrent MI or impaired myocardial healing and risk of rupture.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^71d6799f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Colchicine–statin interactions — mechanistic considerations: Interactions between colchicine and statins that undergo several different metabolic pathways have been described in the literature, suggesting that the underlying cause is likely multifactorial. Colchicine undergoes hepatic demethylation by CYP3A4 and does not appear to impair CYP3A4 activity; thus, the drug–drug interaction between colchicine and statins is likely attributable to competitive inhibition, which may result in increased concentrations of both substrates. Additionally, colchicine is a substrate for P-gp, and colchicine likely competes for P-gp–mediated efflux, resulting in accumulation of both substrates in myocytes and other target cells.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### Risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in rheumatoid arthritis: Danish nationwide cohort study [^eb8eda68]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

In the recent years, the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been extended to cover the increased comorbidity, especially that due to cardiovascular disease. Newly developed guidelines recommend annual screening for cardiovascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, to counter the reported increased risk of, for example, acute myocardial infarction and stroke. As no evidence has been available on the risk of atrial fibrillation, the focus has primarily been on standard primary prevention of hard end points by traditional risk score assessment. Overall, our findings corresponded to one new case of atrial fibrillation per 12 rheumatoid arthritis patients followed for 10 years after diagnosis. Given the augmented risk of atrial fibrillation (which is often asymptomatic) and the ample opportunity for diagnosis of arrhythmia at the recommended annual screening appointments, we suggest that the clinical focus should here include screening for atrial fibrillation, not least in light of the relative easiness of such screening, the risk of stroke with subsequent disability and societal burden, and the powerful effect of anticoagulation treatment. Moreover, these findings may indicate that rheumatoid arthritis can add to future risk stratification scores for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and lower the threshold for anticoagulation. As inflammation is likely to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and stroke, this study also underlines the importance of rigorous control of inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, not only for the management of joint symptoms but also to reduce the need for drugs with potential adverse cardiovascular effects and, ultimately, to diminish the inflammation driven atherothrombotic process.

Abstract

Colchicine is a unique, sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for decades for the prevention of acute inflammatory flares in gout and familial Mediterranean fever. In recent years, clinical trials have demonstrated its potential in a range of cardiovascular (CV) conditions. Colchicine is avidly taken up by leucocytes, and its ability to bind to tubulin and interfere with microtubular function affects the expression of cytokines and interleukins, and the ability of neutrophils to marginate, ingress, aggregate, express superoxide, release neutrophil extracellular traps, and interact with platelets. In patients with acute and recurrent pericarditis, clinical trials in > 1600 patients have consistently shown that colchicine halves the risk of recurrence [relative risk (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42–0.60]. In patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes, multicentre randomized controlled trials in > 11 000 patients followed for up to 5 years demonstrated that colchicine may reduce the risk of CV death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and ischaemia-driven revascularization by > 30% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49–0.81). The use of colchicine at doses of 0.5–1.0 mg daily in CV trials has proved safe. Early gastrointestinal intolerance limits its use in ∼10% of patients; however, ∼90% of patients tolerate it well over the long term. Despite isolated case reports, clinically relevant drug interactions with moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/competitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors/competitors are rare if this dosage of colchicine is used in the absence of advanced renal or liver disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the contemporary data supporting the efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients with CV disease.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^2f95407e]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Gemfibrozil: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

Other fibrates: Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of this combination.

Cyclosporine: The use of lovastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided.

Danazol, diltiazem or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin: In patients taking concomitant danazol, diltiazem or verapamil, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses. The benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil should be carefully weighed against the risks of these combinations.

Amiodarone: In patients taking concomitant amiodarone, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses.

Colchicine: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine.

Ranolazine: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of ranolazine. Dose adjustment of lovastatin may be considered during co-administration with ranolazine.

Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 9.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^afe06ec7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

PAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome] to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

### Atrial fibrosis and inflammation in Postoperative atrial fibrillation: comparative effects of amiodarone, colchicine, or exosomes [^430ed4a7]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from human heart-derived cells have shown promise in suppressing inflammation and fibroblast proliferation. However, their precise benefits in atrial fibrillation (AF) prevention and the role of their antifibrotic/anti-inflammatory properties remain unclear.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to conduct a head-to-head comparison of antiarrhythmic strategies to prevent postoperative AF using a rat model of sterile pericarditis. Specifically, we aimed to assess the efficacy of amiodarone (a classic antiarrhythmic drug), colchicine (an anti-inflammatory agent), and EVs derived from human heart-derived cells, which possess anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties, on AF induction, inflammation, and fibrosis progression.

Methods

Heart-derived cells were cultured from human atrial appendages under serum-free xenogen-free conditions. Middle-aged Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into different groups, including sham operation, sterile pericarditis with amiodarone treatment, sterile pericarditis with colchicine treatment (2 dose levels), and sterile pericarditis with intra-atrial injection of EVs or vehicle. Invasive electrophysiological testing was performed 3 days after surgery before sacrifice.

Results

Sterile pericarditis increased the likelihood of inducing AF. Colchicine and EVs exhibited anti-inflammatory effects, but only EV treatment significantly reduced AF probability, whereas colchicine showed a positive trend without statistical significance. EVs and high-dose colchicine reduced atrial fibrosis by 46% ± 2% and 26% ± 2%, respectively. Amiodarone prevented AF induction but had no effect on inflammation or fibrosis.

Conclusions

In this study, both amiodarone and EVs prevented AF, whereas treatment with colchicine was ineffective. The additional anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of EVs suggest their potential as a comprehensive therapeutic approach for AF prevention, surpassing the effects of amiodarone or colchicine.

### Colchicine for pericarditis: hype or hope? [^ab74c115]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Colchicine has been effectively used in the treatment of several inflammatory conditions, such as gouty attacks, serositis related to familial Mediterranean fever, Behçet syndrome, and more recently also in acute and recurrent pericarditis. Growing evidence has shown that the drug may be useful to treat an acute attack and may be a way to cope with the prevention of pericarditis in acute and recurrent cases and after cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, clinicians are often sceptical about the efficacy of the drug, and concerns have risen on possible side effects and tolerability. In this review, we analyse current evidence to support the use of the drug, as well as possible harms and risks related to drug interactions, reaching the conclusion that colchicine is safe and useful in recurrent pericarditis, if specific precautions are followed, although less evidence supports its use for the treatment of acute pericarditis, where colchicine remains optional and there is a need for further multicentre confirmatory studies. This paper also reviews specific dosing and precautions for the clinical use.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^1117aa44]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^1888fab2]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Strategies to reduce risk

Once potential MDIs are recognized, providers could substitute one of the interacting drugs with a more benign, non-interacting one. Amiodarone could be replaced with propafenone which would eliminate the amplified risk of hemorrhage resulting from the warfarin-aspirin interaction. The FDA and the American Geriatrics Society 2019 updated the AGS Beers Criteria® for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults recommend that amiodarone should not be a first-line choice. Ondansetron, which prolongs the QT, could be avoided in patients already on medications that prolong the QT if prescribed anti-emetics that are not associated with changes in the QT interval. Tramadol, which acts as both an opiate and inhibitor of neurotransmitter uptake, exposes patients to multiple serious ADEs. Non-opiate analgesics could be substituted for tramadol and, if there was no indication for the psychotropic effect, no additional medication would be necessary. Substitution of methotrexate, an immunosuppressant prescribed for patients with various autoimmune diseases, would be difficult to replace given its unique role in treating patients with autoimmune diseases. Other strategies would have to be employed such as meticulous attention to those medications which interact with methotrexate to increase the risk of renal or hepatic injury.

Colchicine has an important role in managing various conditions, including gout, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behçet's syndrome, recurrent pericarditis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. The adverse effect profile of colchicine is well understood. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, colchicine has been associated with overdose and fatalities. When ingested in toxic amounts, the mainstay of management is supportive care. Strategies to minimize the risk of colchicine poisoning can focus on three broad causes: unauthorized access, intentional overdose and inappropriate dosing. Culturally safe and appropriate education about storage and appropriate use of colchicine is essential to minimize the risk of overdose.

Study population

For a matter of selection criteria, we classified patients according to the severity of COVID-19: the mild form of the disease was defined in patients with flu-like symptoms without dyspnoea and imaging findings of pneumonia; the moderate form was defined in patients with fever, dyspnoea and imaging findings of pneumonia; the severe form in those with the same findings of moderate form plus respiratory rate ≥ 30 times per minute or oxygen saturation (SatO 2) ≤ 92%; and the critical form was defined when patients presented respiratory failure or shock. The inclusion criteria were: individuals hospitalised with moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab specimens and lung CT scan involvement compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia; older than 18 years; body weight > 50 kg; normal levels of serum Ca 2+ and K +; QT interval < 450 ms at 12 derivations ECG (according to the Bazett formula) and negative serum or urinary β-HCG if woman under 50 years. The exclusion criteria were defined as: mild form of COVID-19 or in need for ICU admission; diarrhoea resulting in dehydration; known allergy to colchicine; diagnosis of porphyria, myasthenia gravis or uncontrolled arrhythmia at enrolment; pregnancy or lactation; metastatic cancer or immunosuppressive chemotherapy; regular use of digoxin, amiodarone, verapamil or protease inhibitors; chronic liver disease with hepatic failure; and inability to understand the consent Form.

Setting

Patients were evaluated daily, and blood collection for general laboratory tests were performed at days 0, 2, 4 and 7 if discharge did not happen before. Twelve derivations ECG were performed each 24–48 hours. The definition of requirement of oxygen supply was a measure of SatO 2 ≤ 92% at rest. The criteria for discharging patients from the hospital were the absence of dyspnoea and SatO 2 > 92%, both for at least 48 consecutive hours.

Main endpoints

The primary endpoints were clinical parameters, such as the time of need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalisation; need for admission and length of stay in ICU; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed clinical and laboratory parameters: measures of serum CRP, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day 0 to day 7; the number, type and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms.

Sotalol — role in atrial fibrillation — Sotalol is not effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, but it may be used to prevent AF. Placebo-controlled studies found it safe and effective at doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg twice daily. In the CTAF study, sotalol and propafenone were less effective than amiodarone. In an uncontrolled stepped-care study beginning with propafenone and then sotalol after failure, paroxysmal AF occurred in nearly 50% of patients and only 27% with persistent AF converted to sinus rhythm at 6 mo. In recurrent AF after cardioversion, propafenone was as effective as sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm 1 y after cardioversion. Sotalol should be avoided in patients with asthma, HF, renal insufficiency, or QT interval prolongation.

### Drug-drug interactions and the clinical tolerability of colchicine among patients with COVID-19: a secondary analysis of the COLCORONA randomized clinical trial [^b804fe8f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The most frequent drug-drug interactions in this study involved atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, statins that provide high-intensity decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Colchicine interactions with statins have particular importance given the prevalence of statin use and between-statin differences in pharmacokinetic metabolism and risk of muscle-related adverse effects. Atorvastatin metabolism and excretion occur through CYP3A4 and P-gp, whereas rosuvastatin relies primarily on CYP2C9 and organic anion transporter family member 1B1. Atorvastatin may increase total colchicine exposure by approximately 24%, whereas rosuvastatin should have no effect on colchicine exposure. Case reports describe colchicine adverse effects among people receiving concomitant atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. In contrast, our analysis, which included participants randomly assigned to colchicine and placebo and used prospective assessment of concomitant medication and adverse events, suggests that the modestly increased colchicine exposure with concomitant atorvastatin use has little clinical relevance. In addition, our results agree with the tolerability of colchicine and rosuvastatin in 2 clinical trials comparing colchicine and rosuvastatin vs standard of care in COVID-19, in which adverse events occurred infrequently in the colchicine and rosuvastatin arm. The management of other drug-drug interactions, such as colchicine and simvastatin, should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis due to the small numbers in our analysis.

### Colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis: a review of 83 cases [^38845a0d]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 74-year-old man with medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidaemia and coronary artery disease on atorvastatin presented to the emergency department with profound weakness. The patient reports he first noticed his weakness 4 weeks after starting colchicine, prescribed for recurrent pericarditis with pericardial effusion, a complication following recent coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was also on prednisone therapy for presumed post-pericardiotomy syndrome. The weakness involved all four limbs but was more notable in the lower extremities, with preserved sensation and tenderness to palpation. Labs showed an elevated creatinine phosphokinase and serum creatinine consistent with rhabdomyolysis. Discontinuation of the offending medications, including colchicine and atorvastatin, as well as intravenous fluid resuscitation with physical rehabilitation, led to improvement in the patient's symptoms. He was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility to continue physical therapy.

Pericarditis — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine options list aspirin 500–1,000 mg 3 times daily, ibuprofen 600–800 mg 3 times daily, and indomethacin 25–50 mg 3 times daily, each with wks (acute) to mo (recurrent) duration, Weekly tapering, Monitoring Needed, and LOE A, A, and B, respectively. Colchicine is listed as 0.6 mg twice daily or 0.6 mg once daily with 3 mo (acute), 6–12 mo (recurrent), tapering May be considered, and Monitoring Needed (LOE A). A footnote states ibuprofen and aspirin are common first-level treatments for the first episode of pericarditis associated with colchicine for 3 months, and adds that aspirin can be given as 325–650 mg 3 times daily. Monitoring is mandatory for all medications and may include specified laboratory and imaging assessments, and dose reduction for colchicine 0.3–0.6 mg daily should be considered when co-prescribing potent inhibitors of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4.

### Risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in rheumatoid arthritis: Danish nationwide cohort study [^8fface2b]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Another important consideration was whether our adjustments for confounding factors were adequate. In general, we controlled for age and calendar year by including these as additional time scales and by presenting age stratified results. In addition, the main results were similar in age and sex matched models in which length of follow-up was similar in the two groups, averaging five years. We lacked information on several important cardiovascular risk factors, and as patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have a higher prevalence of smoking, dyslipidaemia, and reduced physical exercise, availability of such information could change the risk estimates, although some of this unmeasured confounding was probably controlled for by inclusion of several cardiovascular drugs and comorbidities in the analyses

Moreover, most of these confounders, such as heart failure and dyslipidaemia, reduced physical exercise, and adverse effects of antirheumatoid arthritis drugs are inherently prevalent in rheumatoid arthritis and to some extent represent intermediaries in the pathway from rheumatoid arthritis to stroke or atrial fibrillation. Consequently, their inclusion in our analyses would tend to underestimate the risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in the average patient with rheumatoid arthritis.

Overall, these potential sources of bias and confounding were inherent to the observational nature of our study and, despite our attempts to identify their contributions to the results, we cannot exclude the effects of additional unmeasured factors.

Conclusions

This study of more than 18 000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found a 40% increase in risk of atrial fibrillation and a 30% increase in the risk of stroke. The augmented risk of stroke in rheumatoid arthritis adds significantly to existing evidence, and the novel finding of an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation suggests that this arrhythmia is relevant in cardiovascular risk assessment of these patients.

### Ataxia caused by amiodarone in older people [^33df3a46]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognised side-effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid and eyes. Neurological side-effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur, and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side-effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system especially in older patients.

### Simvastatin (floLipid) [^0971d23c]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The combined use of simvastatin with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 and 7.2)].

Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with simvastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone and the risk is increased when they are co-administered [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.7)].

The benefits of the combined use of simvastatin with the following drugs should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of combinations: other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates, ≥ 1 g/day of niacin, or, for patients with HoFH, lomitapide), amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, or ranolazine [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Table 3 in Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] [also see Dosage and Administration, Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (2.4)].

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been observed with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. In an ongoing, double-blind, randomized cardiovascular outcomes trial, an independent safety monitoring committee identified that the incidence of myopathy is higher in Chinese compared with non-Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of a niacin-containing product. Caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin in doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. It is unknown if the risk for myopathy with coadministration of simvastatin with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products observed in Chinese patients applies to other Asian patients [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Lovastatin [^9144721c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other drug interactions

Cyclosporine: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of cyclosporine (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).

Danazol, Diltiazem, Dronedarone, or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil particularly with higher doses of lovastatin (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis; CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).

Amiodarone: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when amiodarone is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).

Coumarin Anticoagulants: In a small clinical trial in which lovastatin was administered to warfarin treated patients; no effect on prothrombin time was detected. However, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been found to produce a less than two seconds increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of warfarin. Also, bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time have been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly with lovastatin. It is recommended that in patients taking anticoagulants, prothrombin time be determined before starting lovastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to insure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the dose of lovastatin is changed, the same procedure should be repeated. Lovastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants.

Colchicine: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine. See WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis.

Ranolazine: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of ranolazine. See WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis.

Propranolol: In normal volunteers, there was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with concomitant administration of single doses of lovastatin and propranolol.

Digoxin: In patients with hypercholesterolemia, concomitant administration of lovastatin and digoxin resulted in no effect on digoxin plasma concentrations.

Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: In pharmacokinetic studies of lovastatin in hypercholesterolemic non-insulin dependent diabetic patients, there was no drug interaction with glipizide or with chlorpropamide (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies).

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^8d6ba648]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

### Risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in rheumatoid arthritis: Danish nationwide cohort study [^3151f471]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

To our knowledge, the incidence of atrial fibrillation has not previously been examined in a large rheumatoid arthritis population, and only a very limited number of small clinical studies have examined the occurrence of arrhythmias in these patients, with no reports on atrial fibrillation. Although the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is a novel finding that must be tested in other cohorts, several lines of evidence support this result. Firstly, mounting evidence indicates that heart failure is more prevalent in rheumatoid arthritis compared with controls. As heart failure is strongly associated with atrial fibrillation (and vice versa), this observation may explain some of the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, as also suggested by the fact that in our study estimates atrial fibrillation risk were primarily affected by time varying confounder adjustment for loop diuretics, which are routinely used for heart failure. Secondly, patients with rheumatoid arthritis show increased arterial stiffness, which is a risk factor for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Thirdly, recent reports have also suggested use of glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation; however, although such associations could explain part of the increased risk of atrial fibrillation in rheumatoid arthritis, these studies were cross sectional in their design and subject to confounding by indication (that is, the drugs were prescribed for diseases associated with atrial fibrillation including rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Fourthly, inflammation itself has been proposed as playing a role in development of atrial fibrillation, and increased circulating concentrations of inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein have been associated with atrial fibrillation and lower rates of successful cardioversion. Increased P wave dispersion in electrocardiography, which is considered to be a predictor of atrial fibrillation, also occurs more frequently in people with rheumatoid arthritis and seems to be highly correlated with the level of systemic inflammation. The sum of current evidence therefore clearly suggests that chronic inflammation contributes to the increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs — sotalol may be initiated in outpatients with little or no heart disease as long as the baseline uncorrected QT interval is less than 450 ms, serum electrolytes are normal, and risk factors associated with class III drug–related proarrhythmia are considered, and it is safest to start sotalol when the patient is in sinus rhythm; amiodarone can also usually be given safely on an outpatient basis, with loading regimens of 600 mg daily for 4 wk or 1 g daily for 1 wk followed by lower maintenance doses; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide should not be started out of hospital and out-of-hospital initiation of dofetilide is not permitted; amiodarone, class IA or IC agents, or sotalol can be associated with bradycardia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, which is more frequent with amiodarone and more common in women than in men.

Amiodarone — evidence for conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation includes the following: In the SAFE‑T trial of persistent AF, conversion occurred in 27% after 28 d with amiodarone versus 24% with sotalol and 0.8% with placebo. Oral amiodarone is associated with a conversion rate between 15% and 40% over a period of 28 d. In a comparative study, amiodarone and propafenone showed similar rates (40%) in persistent AF averaging 5 mo in duration, and all amiodarone conversions occurred after 7 d, with responses between 1 and 14 d. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, visual disturbances, thyroid abnormalities, nausea, constipation, phlebitis with peripheral IV administration, and serious toxicity including death due to bradycardia ending in cardiac arrest.

### Refining drug safety in rheumatology [^e1b563e7]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This issue explores several important safety concerns that currently plague the rheumatologist and health care providers who care for patients with rheumatic diseases. Weighing safety against efficacy can be a complex task that is best alleviated by understanding the issues, nature, and breadth of problems associated with drug use. Therapeutic decision-making must be evidence-based, judicious, and appropriate for the patient and situation. Understanding drug safety is paramount to ensuring both success of therapy and benefit to the patient. Similarly, it is important not to underestimate the impact of uncontrolled disease activity in decision-making. Drug safety must be weighed against the severity and risks of the disease under treatment. Clearly the benefit/risk ratio has improved for many of the therapies discussed in this book. The use of both conventional and novel therapies mandates an understanding of the mechanisms of action, unique toxicities, screening and monitoring measures, and rules for drug avoidance.

### Colchicine [^507c27ea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Colchicine is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Of the cytochrome P450 enzymes tested, CYP3A4 was mainly involved in the metabolism of colchicine. If colchicine is administered with drugs that inhibit P-gp, most of which also inhibit CYP3A4, increased concentrations of colchicine are likely. Fatal drug interactions have been reported.

Physicians should ensure that patients are suitable candidates for treatment with colchicine and remain alert for signs and symptoms of toxicities related to increased colchicine exposure as a result of a drug interaction. Signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity should be evaluated promptly and, if toxicity is suspected, colchicine should be discontinued immediately.

Table 4 provides recommendations as a result of other potentially significant drug interactions. Table 1 provides recommendations for strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors.

Co-administration of P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin or cyclosporine) have been demonstrated to alter the concentration of colchicine. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. See FPI for a complete list of reported and potential interactions (2.4, 5.3, 7).

### Low-dose colchicine for atherosclerosis: long-term safety [^2d8784a7]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Low-dose colchicine (0.5mg daily) is now FDA-approved for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease and will be increasingly prescribed in clinical practice. In this State-of-the-Art Review, data were collated from contemporary systemic reviews of case reports, drug registries, and placebo-controlled trials that assessed specific issues of safety related to the continuous use of colchicine in a range of clinical settings to inform physicians, pharmacists, and patients of the absolute risks of continuous use of low-dose colchicine, including among individuals taking statin therapy. Based upon these collective data, it is concluded that aside mild diarrhoea on initiation of colchicine that typically subsides in the vast majority of patients within a week of therapy, continuous use of low-dose colchicine is well tolerated and very safe. It does not affect renal, liver, or cognitive function, has no adverse effects on bleeding, wound healing, fertility, or pregnancy, and does not increase risks of cancer, serious infection, or cause-specific mortality. When appropriately prescribed to patients without significant renal or hepatic impairment, reports of myelosuppression, myotoxicity, and serious drug-drug interactions are rare and no more frequent than placebo, including in patients taking statin therapy. Physicians, pharmacists, and patients can be reassured that in the absence of significant renal or hepatic impairment continuous use of low-dose colchicine can be used safely in patients with atherosclerosis for the purpose of reducing cardiovascular risk.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^b25abf68]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^0d38c9c6]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Colchicine is one of the oldest available drugs. It has been used for centuries to treat and prevent gouty attacks and more recently to prevent attacks of autoinflammatory diseases such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Its main mechanism of action is the capability to block the polymerization of tubulin, thus affecting the function of microtubules. The capability to concentrate in white blood cells, especially granulocytes, and interfere with their function explains its potentiality as an anti-inflammatory drug. Colchicine (0.5mg twice daily for patients > 70kg or once daily for those weighing less) in addition to standard anti-inflammatory therapy, in either acute or recurrent pericarditis, may hasten the response to anti-inflammatory therapy and reduce the subsequent risk of recurrences. After exclusion of contraindication and appropriate dose adjustment, the drug is safe and well tolerated. The more common side effect is gastrointestinal intolerance occurring in 5–10% of cases and may be controlled by dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b8d5d76c]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin–colchicine coadministration — evidence and recommendations are as follows: Clinically significant drug–drug interactions (DDIs) have been reported with atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin when used in combination with colchicine, with simvastatin–colchicine most frequently reported (subject of 6 cases), including 1 case that progressed to rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure, and death; rosuvastatin is not subject to pathways that interact with colchicine metabolism or disposition. Evidence suggests that coadministration may produce synergistic muscle-related toxicity, so patients should be monitored closely for muscle-related signs and symptoms. Coadministration of rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, or pravastatin with colchicine is reasonable when clinically indicated, whereas combination therapy with atorvastatin or simvastatin and colchicine may be considered in appropriate patients. Colchicine dose adjustments are recommended when used with a CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitor, specifically loading doses of no more than 0.6–1.2 mg and maintenance doses of 0.3–0.6 mg daily; dose reductions may be considered for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin when coadministered with colchicine, given the potential for interactions mediated by both CYP3A4 and P-gp pathways. In patients with renal impairment, reduced doses of colchicine should be considered when used with a statin.

### Colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease management [^9692139f]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colchicine-an anti-inflammatory alkaloid-has assumed an important role in the management of cardiovascular inflammation ≈3500 years after its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt. Primarily used in high doses for the treatment of acute gout flares during the 20th century, research in the early 21st century demonstrated that low-dose colchicine effectively treats acute gout attacks, lowers the risk of recurrent pericarditis, and can add to secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events. As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted anti-inflammatory cardiovascular therapy, colchicine currently has a unique role in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The safe use of colchicine requires careful monitoring for drug-drug interactions, changes in kidney and liver function, and counseling regarding gastrointestinal upset. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine relevant to atherosclerosis, the potential role of colchicine in primary prevention, in other cardiometabolic conditions, colchicine's safety in cardiovascular patients, and opportunities for individualizing colchicine therapy using clinical and molecular diagnostics.

### Drug-drug interactions and the clinical tolerability of colchicine among patients with COVID-19: a secondary analysis of the COLCORONA randomized clinical trial [^81900665]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled COLCORONA trial, the presence of a drug-drug interaction leading to higher colchicine exposure at baseline was not associated with an increase in the risk of overall or gastrointestinal adverse events in the colchicine arm. Most drug-drug interactions were classified as ORCA class 3 or 4, and individuals at the highest risk of colchicine-related adverse events, such as those with chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal disorders, were excluded from the COLCORONA trial. Thus, the findings of this analysis suggest that low-dose colchicine may be continued despite certain drug-drug interactions in carefully selected individuals who receive close follow-up.

Colchicine exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting microtubule polymerization within neutrophils and other professional and nonprofessional immune cells. The adverse gastrointestinal effects of colchicine have been known for millennia, but the tolerability and efficacy of low-dose colchicine regimens were established first in 2010. The pharmacokinetic effects of colchicine drug-drug interactions of varying severity have been studied, but the clinical consequences remain unclear. Our study provides evidence suggesting that colchicine can be used safely in the presence of ORCA class 3 or 4 drug-drug interactions in individuals without other risk factors who receive close follow-up.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^17603789]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^7f7cc4ce]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage must be individualized based on severity of arrhythmia and response. Use the lowest effective dose. Obtain baseline chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and liver aminotransferases. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment

Recommended Dosage:

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Administration:

Administer amiodarone hydrochloride tablets consistently with regard to meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Administration of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Pharmacology and mechanism of action

When ingested, standard oral doses of 0.6–1 mg of colchicine are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations occurring ≈1 h after ingestion. However, peak concentrations occur later with higher doses (1.8 h with 1.8 mg and 4.5 h with 4.8 mg), suggesting a saturable influx transporter for colchicine in the gut wall. The oral bioavailability of colchicine is ≈50%, the volume of distribution is 5–8 l/kg and it has 40% protein binding to albumin. Colchicine is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is present in the gut wall, kidneys, liver, and blood–brain barrier, with its primary function being to facilitate the export of xenobiotics such as colchicine out of the body to protect against toxicity. Colchicine is also metabolized by demethylation via cytochrome P4503A4, but < 5% of clearance is by this route. Around 10–20% is removed via renal excretion, and the majority of drug is eliminated as parent drug or metabolites in the faeces. Following a single 1 mg dose, colchicine plasma half-life is ≈4.4 h in young healthy adults, but this increases to 26–31 h following multiple oral doses of 0.6 mg twice daily, consistent with enterohepatic recycling (and possibly some auto-inhibition of clearance). The half-life will be even longer in older people, those with renal or hepatic dysfunction or those who have ingested toxic amounts. In people with moderate–severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10–30 ml/min) colchicine clearance is halved and so the dose needs to be halved to reduce the risk of toxicity.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^24acac3a]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

SAFE-T trial — amiodarone versus sotalol versus placebo for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF): the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 665 patients (amiodarone 267, sotalol 261, placebo 137). After a 28 d run-in, spontaneous conversion occurred in 27% with amiodarone, 24% with sotalol, and 0.8% with placebo; among those not converted pharmacologically, direct-current shocks failed in 28%, 26.5%, and 32%, respectively. Median time to AF recurrence favored amiodarone (487 d) versus sotalol (74 d) or placebo (6 d), while in ischemic heart disease the median time did not differ between amiodarone (569 d) and sotalol (428 d).

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^88c40261]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A wide range of dosing regimens are used for treating AF (3–7.5 mg/kg bolus and follow on infusions of 1200–1500 mg/24 hours or 10 mg/kg/24 hours). This lack of consensus on the best dosing regimen was reflected in our results. There was no uniform dosing strategy used and 35% of patients did not receive a loading dose. Patients receiving an amiodarone bolus typically received an "ampoule" of 300 mg regardless of weight and had a median delay in a follow-on infusion of 2 hours. Patients receiving a loading dose and an infusion were less likely to have recurrence when compared to those in whom only a continuous infusion without a bolus was administered.

Several studies have reported risk factors for development of AF in the critically ill patient, mainly in the cardiothoracic surgical setting. Cardiovascular disease has previously been implicated in the development of AF. Factors which are predictive of increasing risk include coronary artery disease, cardiomegaly, low left ventricular ejection fraction, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and right ventricular dysfunction. Other studies have suggested inflammatory processes as a risk factor for AF, with SIRS, sepsis and a raised C reactive protein being implicated. Consistent with these, we found AF recurrence associated with congestive cardiac failure, altered fluid balance, low serum magnesium and an elevated white cell count, the latter supportive of the association with SIRS. The two patients with hyperthyroidism were not suspected clinically of such at the time of amiodarone administration.

### Comparison of sotalol versus amiodarone in maintaining stability of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (sotalol-amiodarone fibrillation efficacy trial [safe-T]) [^4242b7bb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The Sotalol-Amiodarone Fibrillation Efficacy Trial (SAFE-T) is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial in which the effects of sotalol and amiodarone in maintaining stability of sinus rhythm are being examined in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation at 20 Veterans Affairs medical centers. The time to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients with atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm is the primary outcome measure, with a number of parameters as secondary end points. SAFE-T had randomized 665 patients when enrollment terminated on October 31, 2001. Follow-up of patients continued until October 31, 2002, for a maximum period of 54 months and a minimum period of 12 months for all patients.

### Risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in rheumatoid arthritis: Danish nationwide cohort study [^1c155733]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation

The overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was approximately 40% higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients than in the general population (age and sex matched event rates of 8.2 and 6.0 per 1000 person years). Women were at slightly higher relative risk than men, and the relative risk of atrial fibrillation was markedly increased in the youngest age groups; the absolute risk attributable to rheumatoid arthritis ranged from 25% in the oldest to 70% in the youngest age group.

The change in risk estimates after inclusion of baseline cardiovascular drug use and comorbidity in the analysis was negligible (table 3). The risk of atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatoid arthritis was somewhat reduced when all cardiovascular drug use and comorbidity was updated during follow-up (incidence rate ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.35). Interestingly, this effect was primarily driven by inclusion of loop diuretics (incidence rate ratio 1.25, 1.16 to 1.34, when these were included alone). To assess the influence of surveillance bias as a result of regular outpatient visits for rheumatoid arthritis, we did several sensitivity analyses. Firstly, we excluded cases of atrial fibrillation within the first month of the rheumatoid arthritis index (82 events) to reduce the effect of increased surveillance in relation to the diagnosis (consequent incidence rate ratio 1.39, 1.30 to 1.49). Secondly, we repeated analyses including only admissions with atrial fibrillation as the primary diagnosis (consequent incidence rate ratio 1.43, 1.29 to 1.59). Thirdly, we excluded users of vitamin K antagonists at baseline and during follow-up to diminish the contribution of patients with unreported prevalent atrial fibrillation (consequent incidence rate ratio 1.43, 1.33 to 1.53). Fourthly, we assessed risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with osteoarthritis (incidence rate ratio 1.17, 1.08 to 1.24), which was significantly lower compared with patients with rheumatoid arthritis, even though osteoarthritis is likely to lead to increased surveillance. Fifthly, we restricted analysis to follow-up of approximately half a million patients who were diagnosed as having cardiovascular disease as defined in table 1(consequent incidence rate ratio 1.43, 1.24 to 1.65).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d171daab]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rate control, acute control, choice of agents, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV amiodarone for acute rate control in patients with AF with rapid ventricular response being critically ill and/or with decompensated HF if β-blockers and nondihydropyridine CCBs are ineffective or contraindicated.
