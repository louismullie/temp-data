## Question

If tissue biopsy from nsclc 4 months ago only showed kras mutation the patient never received any treatment is it worth it to send a liquid biopsy now

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is worth sending a liquid biopsy now for a treatment‑naive NSCLC patient diagnosed 4 months ago whose initial tissue biopsy "only showed a KRAS mutation". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the initial tissue testing was sufficiently comprehensive and whether the KRAS subtype was defined. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and regulatory labels say about using plasma for initial driver testing and how to act on negative plasma results. Next, I will review the detection performance of KRAS in plasma and the implications of ctDNA shedding in NSCLC. After that, I will weigh benefits versus limitations for this specific clinical context, including turnaround time, breadth of profiling, and the need for a reflex plan. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with contingencies based on results and urgency of treatment start, drawing on high‑credibility evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the adequacy of the initial workup. A report that "only showed a KRAS mutation" is incomplete without the specific codon and amino acid change, because only KRAS G12C is currently targetable in metastatic NSCLC, and standard of care demands comprehensive genomic profiling for key drivers such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET exon 14, RET, NTRK, and KRAS G12C prior to starting systemic therapy in advanced non‑squamous disease; if the original panel was limited, additional testing is warranted to avoid missing actionable alterations [^1126gBCD] [^116c9hzT] [^114rEbr6].

> Now, I need to check what the regulatory label and guidelines say about using plasma as an initial testing modality in this exact KRAS G12C context. The FDA Lumakras (sotorasib) label explicitly permits selecting patients for KRAS G12C therapy based on the presence of the mutation in tumor or plasma specimens and instructs that if plasma is negative, tumor tissue should be tested, establishing plasma as a valid standalone starting point with a mandated reflex plan for negatives [^114rEbr6] [^114s3n4x].

> Next, I should review the performance characteristics of plasma detection for KRAS G12C in NSCLC and the implications for false negatives. In the CodeBreaK 100 data included in the Lumakras label, retrospective testing identified KRAS G12C in plasma in about 70% of tissue‑positive NSCLC cases, implying roughly a 30% plasma false‑negative rate that necessitates reflex to tissue when plasma is negative, not absence of the mutation [^114s3n4x]. Hold on, I should verify broader shedding biology too; multiple ctDNA analyses show that NSCLC tends to have lower ctDNA tumor fraction than colorectal cancer, with detection rates for KRAS G12C in NSCLC around 70–75% in trial datasets and shedding influenced by tumor burden and metastatic sites, including relatively poor association with brain metastases, reinforcing the need for a reflex pathway when plasma is uninformative [^115fXZHF] [^116WSK6a] [^116LQiCZ].

> Let me consider the concrete benefits of liquid biopsy now for this patient. First, it can clarify whether the KRAS variant is G12C versus non‑G12C, which is decisive for targeted therapy consideration. Second, a broad plasma CGP panel can capture other actionable drivers missed by a limited tissue assay, potentially avoiding an invasive repeat biopsy. Third, plasma typically returns faster than tissue and has demonstrated noninferiority for identifying actionable alterations in prospective studies, which can accelerate time to appropriate therapy selection when tissue is scarce or slow, while still allowing for tissue reflex if needed [^1126gBCD] [^111eo12u] [^116c9hzT].

> But wait, I need to ensure we are explicit about limitations and the reflex strategy. Because liquid biopsy in NSCLC can yield a negative result despite the presence of an actionable driver due to low ctDNA shedding, a negative or indeterminate plasma result should trigger confirmatory tissue CGP whenever feasible; using ctDNA tumor fraction can help distinguish informative negatives and prioritize tissue confirmation to avoid missing a matched first‑line therapy, which has been associated with materially improved outcomes when obtained before therapy start [^1126gBCD] [^111TpQYy] [^115NUuux].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "there is no KRAS‑targeted therapy", but that's outdated for NSCLC; older ctDNA series noted no approved KRAS agents at the time of their analyses, which no longer reflects current practice. I should correct that: KRAS G12C inhibitors are FDA‑approved for advanced NSCLC, and patient selection can be made from tumor or plasma with mandated tissue reflex if plasma is negative, so resolving whether the KRAS variant is G12C is clinically actionable now [^114s3n4x] [^114rEbr6].

> Next, I should review how this approach affects timeliness. While overall time‑to‑treatment was not significantly reduced in the intention‑to‑treat analysis of LIBELULE, sensitivity analyses showed shorter time to treatment in patients who actually received systemic therapy, in advanced non‑squamous NSCLC, and in those with first‑line targetable alterations when liquid biopsy was incorporated at the first visit; taken together with prospective evidence that plasma genotyping matches tissue for actionables with faster turnaround, early liquid biopsy can meaningfully expedite appropriate therapy in precisely the subgroup where molecular results drive first‑line choice [^114urUXA] [^111eo12u].

> I should double‑check the pragmatic testing path for this patient. Given 4 months have elapsed without systemic therapy and the initial tissue result was limited, I would send a comprehensive FDA‑cleared plasma CGP assay now that reports KRAS codon‑specific variants and the full NSCLC driver panel, recognizing that assays such as Guardant360 CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx are established in this space and have been used in regulatory datasets; if plasma returns positive for a clearly actionable driver (e.g. KRAS G12C or another standard first‑line biomarker), act on it, and if plasma is negative or indeterminate, reflex promptly to tissue CGP and plan a repeat biopsy if archival tissue is insufficient, aiming to have a tissue path in motion in parallel if the patient is clinically deteriorating [^114s3n4x] [^1126gBCD] [^111TpQYy].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis directly answers the question. Yes, it is worth sending a liquid biopsy now because it can (1) establish whether the KRAS alteration is the targetable G12C variant per FDA labeling, (2) broaden molecular profiling beyond a limited tissue panel without immediate re‑biopsy, (3) return results quickly to inform first‑line choices, and (4) capture inter‑lesional heterogeneity, while a negative result must reflex to tissue to avoid missing an actionable driver; this strategy is aligned with ESMO guidance and is explicitly supported by the Lumakras label's tumor‑or‑plasma selection framework and by prospective data on plasma genotyping performance and timeliness [^114rEbr6] [^1126gBCD] [^111eo12u] [^114urUXA].

---

It is appropriate to obtain a liquid biopsy now because **liquid biopsy can detect additional actionable mutations** (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK, HER2) that may have been missed or untested in the initial tissue sample, and **KRAS G12C can be confirmed in plasma** to guide targeted therapy selection [^111eo12u] [^114rEbr6]. Liquid biopsy is minimally invasive [^116T195x], offers rapid turnaround [^111eo12u], and is **recommended by guidelines** when tissue is limited or to complement tissue testing [^1126gBCD]; if plasma is negative, reflex tissue testing is advised [^114rEbr6] [^111TpQYy]. This approach helps ensure no actionable driver is missed and enables timely, personalized treatment.

## Clinical utility of liquid biopsy in NSCLC

Liquid biopsy analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, providing **real-time insights** into the tumor's genomic landscape [^116T195x]. It is **minimally invasive** and offers several advantages over tissue biopsy, including:

- **Minimally invasive**: Reduced patient discomfort and risk compared to tissue biopsy [^116T195x].

- **Rapid turnaround**: Faster results, enabling timely treatment decisions [^111eo12u].

- **Comprehensive profiling**: Ability to detect multiple genomic alterations simultaneously, including actionable mutations and resistance mechanisms [^116c9hzT].

- **Real-time monitoring**: Allows for serial monitoring of tumor evolution and response to therapy [^1142ob3D].

---

## Detection of additional actionable mutations

In NSCLC, numerous **actionable mutations** beyond KRAS — EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK, and HER2 — have corresponding targeted therapies that significantly improve patient outcomes [^114zHwvH]. Liquid biopsy can detect these alterations when they were missed or untested on the initial tissue biopsy because of limited tissue or sampling bias [^111eo12u].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major oncology guidelines (IASLC, ESMO) recommend **comprehensive molecular profiling** for all patients with advanced NSCLC and endorse liquid biopsy as a complementary or alternative approach when tissue is insufficient or unavailable [^1126gBCD]. The IASLC consensus highlights the role of liquid biopsy in identifying **actionable genomic alterations** and guiding targeted therapy selection, and ESMO likewise recommends its use to detect oncogenic drivers and resistance mutations, particularly when tissue biopsy is not feasible or could delay treatment initiation.

---

## Clinical scenarios where liquid biopsy is beneficial

Liquid biopsy is **particularly beneficial** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Insufficient tissue**: When the initial tissue biopsy sample is inadequate for comprehensive molecular testing [^1126gBCD].

- **Tumor heterogeneity**: To capture tumor heterogeneity and detect mutations that may not be present in a single tissue sample [^116T195x].

- **Monitoring disease progression**: To detect emerging resistance mutations or new actionable targets during disease progression [^1142ob3D].

- **Patient preference**: When patients prefer a less invasive procedure compared to repeat tissue biopsy [^116T195x].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Liquid biopsy can have **lower sensitivity** than tissue biopsy in some settings — particularly in patients with low tumor burden or non-shedding tumors [^116WSK6a]. Negative plasma results can represent **false negatives** and should prompt **confirmatory tissue testing** when feasible [^111TpQYy] [^114rEbr6]. Assay-to-assay variability in sensitivity, specificity, and genomic coverage can affect results; therefore, **test selection matters** [^111tmAkB].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting liquid biopsy

Several studies have demonstrated the **clinical utility** of liquid biopsy in NSCLC:

- **NILE study**: Demonstrated that liquid biopsy is at least as effective as tissue-based genotyping for identifying actionable genomic alterations, with significantly shorter turnaround times [^111eo12u].

- **LIBELULE trial**: Showed that early liquid biopsy testing reduced time to treatment initiation and improved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC.

- **Real-world studies**: Consistently highlight the practical benefits of liquid biopsy, including reduced complications, lower costs, and improved patient management [^1139VEzK].

---

## Clinical decision-making algorithm

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **clinical decision-making algorithm** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Perform comprehensive molecular profiling on initial tissue biopsy [^1126gBCD] |
| 2 | If tissue biopsy reveals only KRAS mutation, consider liquid biopsy to detect additional actionable mutations [^111eo12u] |
| 3 | If liquid biopsy detects actionable mutations, initiate targeted therapy accordingly [^114zHwvH] |
| 4 | If liquid biopsy is negative or inconclusive, consider repeat tissue biopsy or alternative diagnostic methods [^114rEbr6] [^111TpQYy] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given that the initial tissue biopsy showed only a KRAS mutation and the patient remains untreated, it is **clinically justified to perform a liquid biopsy** now [^1126gBCD]. Liquid biopsy can detect additional actionable mutations that may have been missed or untested on the initial sample, enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes [^111eo12u]. Current clinical guidelines and available evidence strongly support its use in this scenario, particularly when tissue samples are limited or unavailable [^116c9hzT].

- **Overview of recommendations for molecular testing in NSCLC**: Although comprehensive molecular testing using broad biomarker panels is the preferred recommendation, in cases where this is not feasible, the proposed minimal testing panels should be considered, depending on the disease stage and particular patient situation.

- **Molecular testing for oncogenic drivers**: Molecular testing is recommended only for non-squamous NSCLC, but the multidisciplinary team (MDT) can decide to order testing in certain situations, such as for young patients, light smokers, or long-time ex-smokers.

- **Early-stage disease considerations**: In early-stage disease, it may be reasonable to broaden the search for biomarkers to identify other oncogene-dependent situations (minimally EGFR status, and ALK, ROS1, and RET gene fusions) that show limited or no benefit from immunotherapy. At the time of writing, no national or international recommendations include this. In such cases, initiating targeted therapy before and/or after surgery or radiation may be considered if no alteration is found in a simple endoscopic or CT biopsy, or in an EBUS sample but only in the liquid biopsy. This is after eliminating possible contamination during the technique and alterations related to clonal hematopoiesis, with the quantification showing a good variant allele frequency. The liquid biopsy result should be taken into account for targeted therapy.

In relation to diagnostic investigations for small cell lung cancer, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend considering comprehensive molecular profiling via blood, tissue, or both in rare cases. This is particularly suggested for patients with extensive stage or relapsed small cell lung cancer who do not smoke tobacco, smoke lightly, have a remote smoking history, or face a diagnostic or therapeutic dilemma at the time of relapse. If not previously done, such profiling may change management.

### Measurement of ctDNA Tumor Fraction Identifies Informative Negative Liquid Biopsy Results and Informs Value of Tissue Confirmation [^115NUuux]. Clinical cancer research (2024). Low credibility.

Timely tissue reflex testing enables use of targeted therapy and is associated with prolonged benefit for patients

We then studied the clinical value of confirmatory tissue testing for those with indeterminate liquid results (ctDNA TF < 1%). Subsequent TBx CGP after LBx prior to 1L therapy was associated with higher likelihood of receiving matched targeted therapy (43/254, 17% vs. 9/220, 4%; Fig. 5A). Targeted therapy use was limited in patients whose tissue CGP detected KRAS and MET alterations (2/16 and 1/7, respectively), likely due to lack of options (non-G12C KRAS, Supplementary Fig. S7) or testing occurring prior to approval of appropriate targeted therapies. When excluding non-G12C KRAS patients along with driver negative patients, 130 patients had a targetable driver on confirmatory TBx testing following a negative LBx. Among 81 with TBx results prior to 1L therapy, 53% (43) received targeted therapy compared with 18% (9/49) of patients with testing results after start of 1L treatment (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S1). For patients treated with targeted therapy after timely tissue reflex CGP, both median rwPFS (15.9 months; Fig. 5C) and median rwOS (45.8 months; Fig. 5D) are favorable, consistent with prolonged benefit from the selected therapy.

### The emerging role of "liquid biopsies", circulating tumor cells, and circulating cell-free tumor DNA in lung cancer diagnosis and identification of resistance mutations [^1113XRk9]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic advances in the treatment of lung cancer are partly due to a more complete understanding of its genomic portrait. The serial monitoring of tumor genotypes, which are unstable and prone to changes under selective pressure, is becoming increasingly necessary. Although tumor biopsies remain the reference standard for the diagnosis and genotyping of lung cancer, they are invasive and not always feasible. "Liquid biopsies" have the potential to overcome many of these hurdles, allowing rapid and accurate identification of de novo and resistant genetic alterations, as well as real-time monitoring of treatment responses.

In this review, insights into new liquid diagnostic platforms are provided, and the role of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the diagnosis and identification of resistance mutations in lung cancer is discussed.

### A highly verified assay for KRAS mutation detection in tissue and plasma of lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer [^116vwcuL]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The KRAS Mutation Test v2 is used for the qualitative detection and identification of 28 mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of the human KRAS gene. The objective of this study was to verify the performance of the KRAS Mutation Test v2 and evaluate its accuracy by correlating it with a next-generation sequencing method on the Illumina MiSeq platform.

In this study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and plasma specimens from patients with non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer were used. The results report specificity, precision, analytical sensitivity, and accuracy compared with the MiSeq method.

The KRAS Mutation Test v2 demonstrated exquisite sensitivity and specificity and broad coverage of KRAS mutations. Precision was 100% (108 of 108) across all samples, operators, and instruments for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and 99.8% (615 of 616) for plasma. Analytical sensitivity was high with the detection of 1% mutant sequence in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples and as low as 25 mutant sequence copies/mL for plasma samples. The test also showed high overall concordance for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue as well as for plasma specimens when compared with MiSeq sequencing results.

The KRAS Mutation Test v2 is a highly robust, reproducible, and sensitive test for the qualitative detection of 28 mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 of the KRAS gene in both solid (tissue) and liquid (plasma) biopsies from colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer, and is a convenient option for KRAS mutation detection.

### Potential clinical utility of liquid biopsy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^113cAbRZ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, the types of liquid biomarkers, detection technologies, platforms, and the lack of a standardized ctDNA detection manual all contribute to the great heterogeneity among the included studies. Second, there were 10 extensive stage patients enrolled in our analysis, but their impact may be negligible. In addition, even though we have completed a comprehensive and systematic search of the literature, publication bias is still inevitable. Finally, some studies did not report detailed information on histology and radiology, and further analysis was therefore limited.

### Biomarker testing and time to treatment decision in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer [^1173gJRz]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Testing for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement has become standard in managing advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, many institutions in Europe, North America, and other world regions continue to face the challenge of facilitating timely molecular testing with rapid result turnaround time. We assessed the prevalence of biomarker testing for advanced NSCLC patients and whether testing affected the timeliness of treatment decisions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of a random sample of one-quarter of all patients with advanced NSCLC referred to the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013.

- **Results**: Of 300 patients reviewed, 175 seen by medical oncology had nonsquamous NSCLC, 72% of whom had biomarker testing carried out. Patients tested for biomarkers were more likely to be female (47% versus 21%, P = 0.002), Asian (27% versus 6%, P = 0.005), and never smokers (42% versus 8%, P < 0.0001). Only 21% of patients with biomarker testing had results available at their initial oncology consultation. This group had a shorter median time from consultation to treatment decision (0 versus 22 days, P = 0.0008) and time to treatment start (16 versus 29, P = 0.004). Thirteen percent underwent repeat biopsy for molecular testing after the initial consultation. Of those with positive EGFR or ALK results, 19% started chemotherapy before biomarker results became available.

- **Conclusions**: Awaiting biomarker testing results can delay treatment decisions and treatment initiation for patients with advanced NSCLC.

### Liquid biopsy testing for the management of patient with non-small cell lung cancer carrying a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion [^117UKNah]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence suggests that liquid biopsy might play a relevant role in the management of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Here, we show how the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) in our cancer center employed liquid biopsy to support therapeutic decisions in a patient with NSCLC carrying a rare EGFR mutation.

A 44-year-old woman, a never-smoker with an EGFR, ALK, and ROS1-negative lung adenocarcinoma and multiple brain metastases, received systemic therapy and surgery before being referred to our Institute. The MTB suggested next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing of a tumor biopsy, which revealed a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion (p. His773dup; c.2315_2316insCCA) and EGFR amplification.

The MTB recommended treatment with erlotinib and follow-up with liquid biopsy using both cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). An increase in EGFR mutation levels in cfDNA revealed resistance to treatment about 6 months before clinical progression. Extremely low levels of EGFR p.T790M were detected at progression. Based on preclinical data suggesting the activity of osimertinib against EGFR exon-20 insertions, the MTB recommended treatment with brain and bone radiotherapy and osimertinib. A dramatic reduction in EGFR mutation levels in cfDNA was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. The PET scan demonstrated a metabolic partial remission that was maintained for 9 months.

This case supports the evidence that liquid biopsy can aid in the management of metastatic NSCLC. It also suggests that treatment with osimertinib might be a therapeutic option in patients with EGFR exon-20 insertions.

### Liquid biopsy-based single-cell metabolic phenotyping of lung cancer patients for informative diagnostics [^116Rok9A]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical treatment decisions in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are primarily driven by tumor genetics. However, patients with similar driver oncogene mutations may have variable responses to the same treatment. For example, clinical decision-making involving EGFR-TKI is usually based on tumor genotyping to identify the existence of EGFR-sensitive mutations. Despite this, at least 20–30% of NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations either do not respond or quickly develop resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment.

Focusing solely on genetic alterations may not fully explain why some NSCLC patients exhibit diverse responses to EGFR-TKIs, even if they possess the same EGFR-sensitive driver oncogenes and lack other resistance-causing mutations. Similarly, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the primary treatment strategy for NSCLC patients without driver oncogene mutations, yet response profiles to chemotherapy vary among patients. There is currently no simple and cost-effective method available in clinical settings to predict therapy responses prior to treatment initiation or to identify potential drug resistance while patients are still benefiting from therapy. The absence of an effective approach for pre-identifying non-responders and short-term beneficiaries presents a significant challenge in clinical decision-making for NSCLC patients.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^115phhGe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging tool to understand the mutational landscape of cancer through minimally invasive liquid biopsies and has the potential to better capture tumor genomic heterogeneity that exists across all tumor lesions, including primary and metastatic sites, in the body. CtDNA can be utilized clinically in biomarker selection and risk stratification and can potentially serve as an early surrogate of tumor response and long-term outcomes. Although tissue-based molecular profiling remains the gold standard, liquid-based assays have become an alternative approach for tumor mutation detection and companion diagnostic purposes, with multiple tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Most panel-based ctDNA assays have a limit of detection (LOD) near 0.5% or 0.1%, while tumor-informed approaches can have sensitivity at 0.01% or below. Despite this, false negatives are still possible depending on the patient's disease, for example, if they have early-stage disease or a non-shedding tumor. Therefore, recommendations state that patients who test negative for select biomarkers with liquid biopsies should be reflexed to routine biopsy and testing with biopsy specimens if feasible. In addition to the clinical utility of companion diagnostics, there are collaborative initiatives to build an evidentiary roadmap to using ctDNA as an early endpoint for regulatory decision-making. However, key knowledge gaps remain, such as establishing the baseline ctDNA tumor fraction across tumor sites.

### Measurement of ctDNA tumor fraction identifies informative negative liquid biopsy results and informs value of tissue confirmation [^111TpQYy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

This work illustrates the utility of circulating tumor DNA tumor fraction to distinguish true negative liquid biopsy results from indeterminate results that may benefit from follow-up tissue testing. This will support clinicians in the decision of whether to act on negative liquid biopsy results and begin non-targeted therapy or to prioritize obtaining tissue for confirmatory comprehensive genomic profiling.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^111tmAkB]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

It should be noted that not all NGS assays are identical. There are differences in the type and breadth of biomarkers they can detect and levels of detection, the specific enrichment methods used (especially for targeted assays), tissue requirements for testing, and importantly the associated costs. In most cases, tissue specimens collected from patients with advanced lung cancer have a low tumor cell content, and diagnosis often relies on small bronchial or transparietal biopsies. This may pose a challenge for molecular testing, depending on the test platform used. Interestingly, a high success rate for reporting five or more biomarkers on CNBs and fine-needle aspirations has been reported in one study of 1,402 NSCLC small samples (10% FNA, 70% core needle biopsies) submitted for clinical NGS testing.

Ideally, NGS testing should cover both DNA and RNA, as assessing DNA alone does not accurately capture all gene fusions (essential for ALK, NTRK, RET, ROS1). Furthermore, comprehensive genomic profiling may provide additional data on molecular alterations beyond established actionable biomarkers.

Two types of NGS assays are commonly used for molecular testing: amplicon-based and hybrid capture-based NGS. Amplicon-based NGS uses multiple primers for direct genomic region amplification. It shows high analytical sensitivity for specific targets and performs efficiently with limited material. However, it is not as reliable in detecting fusions or copy number alterations. In addition, its multiplex design often limits the number of genes and regions they can cover. Consequently, ampl

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^115fXZHF]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To inform prognosis, treatment response, disease biology, and KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity, we conducted exploratory circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling on 134 patients with solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12C mutation treated with single-agent divarasib (GDC-6036) in a phase 1 study.

- **Experimental design**: Plasma samples were collected for serial ctDNA profiling at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 prior to treatment) and multiple on-treatment time points (cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 3 day 1).

- **Results**: KRAS G12C ctDNA was detectable from plasma samples in 72.9% (43/59) and 92.6% (50/54) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively, the majority of whom were eligible for study participation based on a local test detecting the KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue. Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was associated with tumor type, disease burden, and metastatic sites. A decline in ctDNA level was observed as early as cycle 1 day 15. Serial assessment showed a decline in ctDNA tumor fraction associated with response and progression-free survival. Except for a few cases of KRAS G12C sub-clonality, on-treatment changes in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency mirrored changes in the overall ctDNA tumor fraction.

- **Conclusions**: Across tumor types, the KRAS G12C mutation likely represents a truncal mutation in the majority of patients. A rapid and deep decline in ctDNA tumor fraction was observed in patients responding to divarasib treatment. Early on-treatment dynamics of ctDNA were associated with patient outcomes and tumor response to divarasib treatment.

### Beyond standard practice in liquid biopsy: Selective venous sampling [^1173CuZ8]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsy is a molecular diagnostic procedure that aims to provide readily accessible genetic profiling of tumors for primary diagnosis, detection of minimal residual or metastatic disease, and therapeutic decision-making, especially for molecularly targeted treatments. Cancers release various biological markers into the circulation, although the most widely used are cell-free tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells. The paucity of biological material means that laboratory methods mainly based on genetic sequencing expose this innovative diagnostic method to a considerable incidence of false negatives. The three cases presented here show how the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy may be improved through selective venous sampling.

### Sensitive multiplex detection of KRAS codons 12 and 13 mutations in paraffin-embedded tissue specimens [^114yo6g4]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer patients harboring KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13 do not benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapies. Efficient and robust methods are therefore required for routine clinical testing of KRAS mutation status.

- **Aims**: To evaluate a novel multiplex assay for the rapid detection of common KRAS mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.

- **Methods**: Genomic DNA was amplified by multiplex PCR using primers targeting the KRAS codon 12/13 region and an internal control gene. PCR products were hybridized on a liquid bead array containing target-specific probes and detected by particle flow cytometry.

- **Results**: Analytical performance assessed with plasmid DNA and genomic DNA extracted from cell lines or model FFPE cell line dilutions showed specific detection of seven distinct KRAS mutations with a limit of detection equivalent to 1% tumor. The assay was evaluated at two independent sites with a total of 140 clinical specimens. At site 1, about 45% of the specimens from a set of 86 archived FFPE blocks with unknown KRAS mutation status were found positive for a KRAS mutation. At site 2, each of the seven mutations was detected in at least five independent specimens from a selected set of 54 residual genomic DNAs previously tested with an ARMS/Scorpion laboratory-developed test.

- **Conclusions**: This novel single-well assay is a sensitive tool compatible with the clinical laboratory workflow for the rapid assessment of KRAS mutations in solid tumor specimens. Its performance and multiple…

### Preclinical study and parallel phase II trial evaluating antisense STAT3 oligonucleotide and checkpoint blockade for advanced pancreatic, non-small cell lung cancer and mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer [^116biHH3]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical trial translational correlatives focused on liquid biopsy findings. Given the lower number of NSCLC and MRD CRC patients, translational analyses concentrated on the pancreatic cancer cohort. Of 12 pancreatic patients tested, 4 exhibited baseline KRAS mutations detected through cfDNA, and 2 patients exhibited KRAS mutations detected through exosome DNA. The presence of baseline KRAS mutation by either method was not associated with patient outcomes. Baseline mutation status was assessed via tumor biopsies obtained from 15 pancreatic cancer patients, where three patients exhibited both TP53 mutations and SMAD4 mutations. The presence of TP53 or SMAD4 mutations (n = 7) was associated with longer PFS (median 9.43 vs. 1.31 months, log-rank p = 0.034).

Among the entire cohort, 2 patients exhibited STK11 mutations: 1 with pancreatic cancer (290+1G > T) and another with NSCLC (721G > C). Both patients achieved a best response of SD. The pancreatic cancer and NSCLC patients with STK11 mutations were taken off study at 3 and 7 months, respectively, due to grade 3 transaminitis without evidence of progression of disease.

Flow cytometry was conducted on biopsy samples from six pancreatic cancer patients. Five experienced a best response of PD, while one exhibited SD lasting 9 months. Interestingly, the one patient who achieved SD exhibited a higher proportion of dendritic cells than the other five patients (figure 4A). Flow cytometry noted trends in increased PD-1 expression on peripheral CD8 T cells and CD4 T effector and T regulatory cells (figure 4B).

### Residual ctDNA after treatment predicts early relapse in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^111HmLJv]. Annals of Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of residual disease in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following treatment with curative intent holds promise for identifying patients at risk of relapse. New methods can detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma to fractional concentrations as low as a few parts per million, requiring clinical evidence to inform their use.

- **Patients and methods**: We analyzed 363 serial plasma samples from 88 patients with early-stage NSCLC (48.9% at stage I, 28.4% at stage II, and 22.7% at stage III), predominantly adenocarcinomas (62.5%), treated with curative intent by surgery (n = 61); surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy (n = 8); or chemoradiotherapy (n = 19). Tumour exome sequencing identified somatic mutations, and plasma was analyzed using patient-specific RaDaR™ assays with up to 48 amplicons targeting tumour-specific variants unique to each patient.

- **Results**: ctDNA was detected before treatment in 24%, 77%, and 87% of patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively, and in 26% of all longitudinal samples. The median tumour fraction detected was 0.042%, with 63% of samples showing 98.5% detection, preceding clinical detection of recurrence of the primary tumour by a median of 212.5 days. ctDNA was detected after treatment in 18 out of 28 (64.3%) patients who had clinical recurrence of their primary tumour. Detection within the landmark timepoint 2 weeks to 4 months after treatment end occurred in 17% of patients and was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^116WSK6a]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To further validate the finding that different tumor types bearing the same KRAS G12C mutation may have distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, we utilized a pan-cancer real-world genomic database comprising patients who received liquid biopsy-based CGP at Foundation Medicine Inc. as part of routine clinical care. Estimated using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay, the median ctDNA tumor fraction was 3.5%, 13.2%, and 4.6% among patients with stage IV KRAS G12C-positive NSCLC (n = 507), colorectal cancer (n = 83), and other solid tumors (n = 271), respectively [Supplementary Fig. S2].

Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was positively associated with tumor volume [sum of longest diameter (SLD)], with Pearson's r = 0.412 and r = 0.420 in NSCLC and colorectal cancer, respectively (Fig. 2C), consistent with previous studies. There was also a trend of positive association between baseline ctDNA tumor fraction and the number of metastatic sites (Fig. 2D). Among patients with NSCLC, the presence of liver, bone, lymph node, or adrenal gland metastasis showed a mild trend of positive association with higher ctDNA tumor fractions (Fig. 2E). On the other hand, the presence of brain metastasis showed no association with higher ctDNA tumor fractions (Fig. 2E). Among patients with colorectal cancer, the presence of liver metastasis was associated with higher levels of ctDNA tumor fraction regardless of the presence or absence of lung metastasis (Fig. 2F and G). In contrast, no association was found between baseline ctDNA tumor fraction and the number of prior lines of systemic therapy (Fig. 2H).

### Usefulness of circulating tumor DNA in identifying somatic mutations and tracking tumor evolution in patients with non-small cell lung cancer [^112kXUCi]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

In agreement with biopsy-based findings, we found that KRAS and EGFR gene mutations were significantly mutually exclusive, whereas MET and CDK6 amplifications were significantly mutually co-occurring with BRAF amplifications. A low cumulative percent variant allele frequency (VAF) in ctDNA was an independent predictor of longer progression-free survival (PFS) after adjusting for patient age, sex, and smoking status. Low levels of cumulative percent ctDNA potentially indicate a low tumor burden as detected in the blood and thus less severe disease. Given the fleeting nature of ctDNA, it is not surprising to find no significant association of ctDNA with overall survival (OS).

Other studies have also demonstrated the prognostic value of pretreatment or presurgery cell-free DNA levels as a surrogate marker for tumor burden and treatment response in many cancers. Studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in patients harboring EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF mutations when targeted agents were directed against these driver and resistant mutations.

In our study, patients with BRAF, PIK3CA, or KRAS mutations, as detected by ctDNA, showed significantly worse survival rates. Although FDA-approved BRAF-targeted therapy is available for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients with positive BRAF findings received EGFR-targeted therapies or chemotherapies because of the presence of actionable EGFR-sensitizing or KRAS mutations. Despite the PIK3CA mutations, PIK3CA-targeted therapies were rare because PIK3CA mutations often went undetected in tissue biopsy samples and are not considered actionable in NSCLC. Currently, no KRAS-targeted therapy is available.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^116c9hzT]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

Precision medicine in patient care requires specialized knowledge that is best delivered via a well-coordinated and well-educated multidisciplinary team (MDT), up-to-date with the latest developments in lung biomarker research and testing technology. Molecular testing should be performed in clinical situations where there is evidence that targeting particular molecular alterations makes a clinical difference. Specimen acquisition and processing of tissue should follow well-established standard procedures and protocols. For genomic testing, next-generation sequencing using multigene panels is highly recommended.

Besides methodological aspects, effective collaboration and communication within the MDT are paramount. Patients should be evaluated by MDTs implementing rapid on-site evaluation and reflex testing to improve testing efficiency and reduce the time-to-treatment initiation.

### Liquid biopsy testing for the management of patient with non-small cell lung cancer carrying a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion [^113iQ1es]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence suggests that liquid biopsy might play a relevant role in the management of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Here, we show how the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) in our cancer center employed liquid biopsy to support therapeutic decisions in a patient with NSCLC carrying a rare EGFR mutation.

A 44-year-old woman, a never-smoker, with an EGFR, ALK, and ROS1-negative lung adenocarcinoma and multiple brain metastases, received systemic therapy and surgery before being referred to our Institute. The MTB suggested NGS testing of a tumor biopsy, which revealed a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion (p. His773dup; c.2315_2316insCCA) and EGFR amplification. The MTB recommended treatment with erlotinib and follow-up with liquid biopsy, using both cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

- **Detection of resistance**: An increase of EGFR mutation levels in cfDNA revealed resistance to treatment about 6 months before clinical progression. Extremely low levels of EGFR p.T790M were detected at progression.

- **Treatment recommendation**: Based on preclinical data suggesting activity of osimertinib against EGFR exon-20 insertions, the MTB recommended treatment with brain and bone radiotherapy and osimertinib. A dramatic reduction of EGFR mutation levels in the cfDNA was observed after 4 weeks of treatment.

- **Outcome**: The PET scan demonstrated a metabolic partial remission that was maintained for 9 months.

This case supports the evidence that liquid biopsy can aid in the management of metastatic NSCLC. It also suggests that treatment with osimertinib might be a therapeutic option in patients with EGFR exon-20 insertions.

### Practical considerations for the use of circulating tumor DNA in the treatment of patients with cancer: A narrative review [^116T195x]. JAMA Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine based on tumor profiling and identification of actionable genomic alterations is pivotal in cancer management. Although tissue biopsy is still preferred for diagnosis, liquid biopsy of blood-based tumor analytes, such as circulating tumor DNA, is a rapidly emerging technology for tumor profiling.

This review presents a practical overview for clinicians and allied health care professionals for the selection of the most appropriate liquid biopsy assay, specifically focusing on circulating tumor DNA and how it may affect patient treatment and case management across multiple tumor types. Multiple factors influence the analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of testing. This review provides recommendations and practical guidance for best practice. Methodologies include polymerase chain reaction-based approaches and those that use next-generation sequencing (e.g. capture-based profiling, whole exome, or genome sequencing). Factors that may influence utility include sensitivity and specificity, quantity of circulating tumor DNA, detection of a small vs. a large panel of genes, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

Currently, liquid biopsy appears useful in patients unable to undergo biopsy or where mutations detected may be more representative of the predominant tumor burden than for tissue-based assays. Other potential applications may include screening, primary diagnosis, residual disease, local recurrence, therapy selection, or early therapy response and resistance monitoring.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^111HU9km]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) emphasize the importance of appropriate and comprehensive molecular testing in the management of patients with NSCLC. Currently, tumor testing at diagnosis and upon progression on targeted therapy is recommended. The standard of care mandates testing for all patients with advanced NSCLC, and testing should be considered for early-stage NSCLC, particularly where therapies targeting EGFR and ALK are available.

New therapies and molecular assays are continuously improving, so clinical practice recommendations are evolving documents that are regularly updated. It is essential to highlight that molecular testing at diagnosis and progression (when feasible) is advised based on clinical trial data. Broad molecular profiling should be performed to identify molecular alterations for which there is clinical evidence supporting targeted or other therapies that offer clinical benefits, or to support early drug access or clinical trials.

All expert guidelines advocate using a broad multi-panel approach as the preferred and most highly recommended option. Although recommendations are made mostly based on histopathology, the patient's clinical situation should also be carefully considered. The choice of specific treatment should be guided by clinical trial evidence and the recommendations for clinical practice.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^113nntJy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

Oncogenic driver mutations in KRAS have been shown to be a frequent initiating event that usually occurs early during tumorigenesis. However, subclonal KRAS driver mutations also exist and were reported to be more common in certain tumor types (e.g. colorectal cancer) than others. Here, we tracked KRAS G12C and overall ctDNA tumor fractions simultaneously at baseline and upon treatment with divarasib using serial plasma profiling. Except for a few outliers with a subclonal KRAS G12C mutation, dynamics of KRAS G12C VAF upon divarasib treatment mirrored that of the overall ctDNA tumor fraction. These data from a clinical study with a KRAS G12C inhibitor represent strong evidence that the KRAS G12C mutation is likely truncal in the vast majority of patients across tumor types.

In this study, we observed that patients with metastatic NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors bearing the KRAS G12C mutation have different mutation detectability in plasma samples associated with distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, and these results were further validated with an independent real-world pan-cancer liquid biopsy cohort. In general, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer tend to have a higher ctDNA tumor fraction and thus higher detectability of the KRAS G12C mutation in plasma samples than patients with metastatic NSCLC. This may impact the utility of a blood-based diagnostic assay for KRAS G12C inhibitors, potentially resulting in a higher rate of reflex testing with a tissue-based assay in NSCLC. In addition to tumor type, we found that ctDNA tumor fractions…

### Libelule: A randomized Phase III study to evaluate the clinical relevance of early liquid biopsy in patients with suspicious metastatic lung cancer [^114urUXA]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Genomic profiling is a major component for first-line treatment decisions in patients with NSCLC, and the timeliness of biomarker testing is essential to improve time to treatment initiation (TTI) or avoid inappropriate treatment.

- **Methods**: The Phase III LIquid Biopsy for the Early detection of LUng cancer Lesion (LIBELULE) trial (NCT03721120) included patients with radiological suspicion of advanced lung cancer. They were randomized (1:1), with the control arm receiving diagnostic procedures according to each center's practice, and the liquid biopsy arm undergoing additional testing at the first visit using the InVisionFirst-Lung assay. Treatment initiation and type were defined according to the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to initiation of appropriate treatment based on informative genomic and pathological results in the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: A total of 319 patients were enrolled (liquid biopsy [LB]: 161; control: 158). The median age was 68 years; 28.8% were non-smokers, 18.1% had a performance status of 2 or higher, and 56.7% had adenocarcinoma. In the LB arm, 81% of patients had circulating tumor DNA findings. The mean TTI was not significantly reduced (LB: 29.0 days; control: 34 days, p = 0.26). Sensitivity analyses found a shorter TTI in patients from the LB arm who received systemic treatment (LB: 29.1 days; control: 38.9 days, p = 0.01), in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC (LB: 29.5 days; control: 40.3 days, p = 0.01), and in patients with first-line targetable alterations (LB: 21 days).

### The current state of molecular testing in the treatment of patients with solid tumors, 2019 [^113deKBL]. CA (2019). High credibility.

After vetting and education concerning this new molecular testing and assessment program at disease site committee and tumor board meetings, it was further decided that genomic testing would be reflexed and ordered by pathology for selected clinical stages of solid tumors. The initial pilot project for this reflex testing was in NSCLC stages IB through IV. Before this initial pilot of genomic reflex testing in lung cancer, approximately 50% of the tumors in patients with advanced lung cancer were being tested for even the minimal NCCN guideline biomarkers. Now, over 95% of advanced lung cancers undergo genomic profiling evaluation that has resulted in pervasive use at the point of care.

An illustrated example of this was a recent patient's lung cancer demonstrating an actionable mutation in BRAF. The success of this pilot study in reflex profiling has expanded to other cancer disease sites, such as advanced head and neck cancers, ovarian cancers, glioblastoma multiforme, sarcoma, and rare tumors. Over the past 18 months, more than 300 tumors have undergone clinical grade genomic profiling, and those data are readily available to the treating physician through web access.

Importantly, physician education is a key component to the establishment of a comprehensive cancer molecular genomics program. Initiation of the more routine use of molecular markers and genomic profiling has stimulated interest and participation in the expanding clinical applications. Along with the assistance of molecular pathology, presentation of genomic data is now frequently requested, and this provides significant insight into treatment options.

### Assessing the clinical utility of liquid biopsies across 5 potential indications from therapy selection to population screening: A review [^1142MvQN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

There has been great enthusiasm for the emerging technology of molecular-based tests to detect and quantify tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, colloquially known as a liquid biopsy. However, less attention has been given to how their clinical utility depends on the indication for testing, which includes a range of clinical situations, each presenting unique challenges.

- **Observations**: Five indications for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) blood testing were considered. (1) For therapy selection, ctDNA tests can identify genetic alterations in patients with cancer amenable to targeted therapy, but most patients do not have a targetable alteration. (2) For response to therapy, the absence of residual tumor DNA following cancer surgery could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but it is unclear that this will happen in practice. (3) For disease surveillance following cancer treatment, ctDNA tests may well detect cancer recurrence before symptoms appear, yet earlier intervention may have no effect on mortality. (4) For diagnosis of suspected cancer, ctDNA tests are able to identify some symptomatic cancers, but how they add to the conventional diagnostic evaluation is unknown. (5) For screening for cancer, multicancer tests can detect many types of cancer, but their low sensitivity for early-stage tumors raises questions as to whether screening can help patients live longer or live better.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Circulating tumor DNA tests are being promoted for multiple indications. Numerous studies are ongoing, but randomized clinical trials of their effectiveness are necessary to fully understand their potential impact on clinical practice.

### Concordance between comprehensive cancer genome profiling in plasma and tumor specimens [^1116YU3D]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Detection of somatic genomic alterations in the plasma of patients with cancer ("liquid biopsy") is increasingly being used in the clinic. However, the concordance of alterations identified in liquid biopsies with those detected in cancer specimens is not routinely being determined.

- **Methods**: We sought to systematically compare alterations found by a massively parallel sequencing liquid biopsy assay covering 39 genes (NEOliquid [NEO New Oncology GmbH, Köln, Germany]) with those identified through routine diagnostic testing in a certified central pathology laboratory in a cohort of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. NEOliquid is based on enrichment of the genomic territory of interest by hybrid capture and is capable of detecting point mutations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and gene rearrangements/fusions in a single assay.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 82 patients with matched blood/tissue samples, the concordance between NEOliquid and tissue-based routine testing was 98%. The sensitivity of NEOliquid was higher than 70%, and the specificity was 100%. Discordant cases included those with insufficient amounts of circulating tumor DNA in plasma and cases in which known driver mutations (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)), 1 systolic gene [IDH1] R132H, kinesin family member 5B gene [KIF5b-ret proto-oncogene [RET], or MNNG HOS Transforming gene [MET] exon 14) were found in the plasma but were not interrogated by routine tissue analyses.

- **Conclusions**: In summary, NEOliquid offers accurate and reliable detection of clinically relevant alterations.

### Liquid biopsy-based precision therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors: A real-world experience from a community-based oncology practice [^115bwEPT]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

For each patient involved in the study, potential molecular targets and therapeutic options were evaluated based on the aberrations detected by the assay. A critical distinction was made between actionable mutations, which are aberrations amenable to targeted therapy with any FDA-approved agent, and non-actionable mutations. A test report indicating one alteration was deemed a "positive" test, whereas the absence of any alterations was classified as a "negative" test result. Furthermore, within the subset of patients with a positive test result, a further classification was made to differentiate those with non-actionable mutations from those with actionable mutations who could benefit from target-specific, FDA-approved agents, either within or outside the FDA indication/off-label use. Additionally, the availability of target-based clinical trial opportunities for patients with a positive test but no actionable mutation was also documented.

The choice of therapeutic option was primarily at the discretion of the treating oncologist and was reviewed retrospectively. Treatment was deemed "matched" if the patient received at least one agent targeting at least one aberration, achieved through an FDA-approved agent, an off-label agent, or a signal-based clinical trial opportunity. Patients who were administered non-targeted therapy when an actionable mutation or signal was available were considered "unmatched", and the rationale for not matching was documented.

In patients who received signal-based targeted therapy, a "matching score" was utilized, where, for each patient, the number of received matched drugs (numerator) was divided by the number of aberrations.

### Molecular adequacy of image-guided rebiopsies for molecular retesting in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A single-center experience [^116aLWtX]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In the era of biomarker-driven systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC, the role of routine repeated biopsies for decision-making outside EGFR-mutant disease remains unproven. We report our center's experience of safety and adequacy for molecular retesting of tumor material obtained from image-guided lung rebiopsies in NSCLC.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of patients undergoing image-guided lung rebiopsies at a single cancer center between 2011 and 2014. The primary objective was to determine the pathological success rate. Secondary and exploratory objectives were to determine the technical success rate, histological concordance, molecular adequacy, genotypes identified, and complication rate.

- **Results**: In all, 103 patients underwent transthoracic image-guided procedures. A total of 66 rebiopsies in NSCLC were identified and analyzed. The pathological success rate was 87.1%. A high histological discordance rate was observed (12 of 52 evaluable cases [23.1%]). Pretest molecular adequacy as determined by the lung pathologist was 78.8% (52 of 66). Of 52 adequate samples, 51 were sent for molecular analysis, with a total of 209 genes analyzed (including EGFR, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene [ALK], KRAS, BRAF, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene [DDR2], NRAS, ROS1, and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene gene [RET]). The rate of postgenotyping molecular adequacy was 87.1% (182 of 209). Overall, 20 new potentially actionable mutations were identified, with 13 of 66 patients (19.7%) starting to receive new targeted treatment.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^116LQiCZ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To inform prognosis, treatment response, disease biology, and KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity, we conducted exploratory circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling on 134 patients with solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12C mutation treated with single-agent divarasib (GDC-6036) in a phase 1 study.

- **Experimental design**: Plasma samples were collected for serial ctDNA profiling at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 prior to treatment) and multiple on-treatment time points (cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 3 day 1).

- **Results**: KRAS G12C ctDNA was detectable from plasma samples in 72.9% (43/59) and 92.6% (50/54) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively, the majority of whom were eligible for study participation based on a local test detecting the KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue. Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was associated with tumor type, disease burden, and metastatic sites. A decline in ctDNA level was observed as early as cycle 1 day 15. Serial assessment showed a decline in ctDNA tumor fraction associated with response and progression-free survival. Except for a few cases of KRAS G12C sub-clonality, on-treatment changes in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency mirrored changes in the overall ctDNA tumor fraction.

Across tumor types, the KRAS G12C mutation likely represents a truncal mutation in the majority of patients. A rapid and deep decline in ctDNA tumor fraction was observed in patients responding to divarasib treatment. Early on-treatment dynamics of ctDNA were associated with patient outcomes and tumor response to divarasib.

### Potential clinical utility of liquid biopsy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^1167iboY]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the clinical utility of liquid biopsy, focusing on early-stage NSCLC and commonly detected biomarkers: circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), methylation signatures, and microRNAs. The present study indicated that liquid biopsy could reliably facilitate more precise and effective management of early-stage NSCLC.

The early detection of lung cancer is critical for reducing its mortality and morbidity. In recent decades, many studies have investigated the screening and diagnostic values of different biomarkers, including ctDNA, CTCs, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. Our analysis indicated that these common biomarkers could provide similar diagnostic accuracy for early-stage NSCLC, with acceptable effectiveness, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.84 to 0.87.

With the development of platforms and technology, ctDNA analysis has provided a practical approach to the noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors. In addition, the analysis of cfDNA fragmentomics profiles was newly highlighted as the novel approach and pattern for the accurate screening, early detection, and monitoring of human cancer. With the advantages of early appearance in the disease course, cancer specificity, biological stability, and ready accessibility in bodily fluids, aberrant DNA methylation analysis combined with machine learning provided the opportunity to overcome the challenge of the low abundance of ctDNA in plasma samples. CTCs in the blood could serve as effective screening and diagnostic markers to discriminate small malignant pulmonary tumors.

### Genetic features and therapeutic relevance of emergent circulating tumor DNA alterations in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers [^113bN6JZ]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Liquid biopsies have been used to elucidate tumor cell evolution in several cancer types, including non-small cell lung and colorectal cancer. The role of ctDNA in tracking genetic changes in response to treatment has also been demonstrated across several studies in colorectal cancers. Whether evolutionary changes in ctDNA, including the emergence of new alterations and changes in tumor mutation burden (TMB), have therapeutic relevance across cancer types remains undefined.

Therefore, we analyze a national cohort of patients with advanced and refractory esophagogastric, pancreatic, biliary, and hepatocellular cancers who underwent serial liquid biopsies using a clinical ctDNA assay to characterize ctDNA changes over time. Our results uncover mechanisms of treatment resistance to conventional therapies and demonstrate a high prevalence of emergent ctDNA alterations at progression that are associated with treatment actionability. We also observe considerable fluctuations in TMB and suggest the clinical utility of serial liquid biopsies in a case series of patients who received subsequent treatment matched to emergent alterations.

As the standard practice is to obtain genomic profiling at a singular timepoint regardless of treatment history, our study supports the clinical utility of repeat tumor-naive liquid biopsies in a subset of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^111ixkWY]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To interrogate patterns of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shedding in different tumor types exhibiting the KRAS G12C mutation, we leveraged an independent real-world pan-cancer cohort comprising patients who received liquid biopsy-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using FoundationOne Liquid CDx, which targets 324 genes as part of routine clinical care. Approval for this cohort, including a waiver of informed consent and a HIPAA waiver of authorization, was obtained from the WCG Institutional Review Board (Protocol No. 20152817). Specifically, samples from patients with physician-reported stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors were examined. The ctDNA tumor fraction was estimated using two approaches: an aneuploidy-based measure when feasible or the maximum somatic allele frequency calculated from the allele fraction of somatic coding alterations, as described previously.

- **The Flatiron Health–Foundation Medicine clinicogenomic database**: The Flatiron Health–Foundation Medicine NSCLC clinicogenomic database (FH-FMI CGDB) was used to assess the prognostic impact of ctDNA levels in patients with KRAS G12C-positive tumors. This nationwide (US-based) database contained data collected between January 2011 and September 2023, originating from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (∼800 sites of care). Only patients who received a FoundationOne Liquid CDx test result within 60 days of beginning first-line advanced therapy that detected a KRAS G12C alteration were included.

**Serial ctDNA analysis to evaluate genomic evolution following treatment**: Plasma DNA collected at the time of disease progression was analyzed through targeted sequencing to identify evidence of genomic evolution following treatment and potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy. In total, 16 patients in the mCRC cohort and 2 patients in the non-colorectal cancer cohort had plasma DNA available at disease progression, allowing comparison with the baseline pretreatment ctDNA analysis (Fig. 3A). Twelve patients (12/18, 67%) were found to have at least one acquired mutation upon disease progression. Of note, 2 patients with NSCLC in the non-colorectal cancer cohort had no detectable mutations in their progression plasma sample, and 4 patients in the mCRC cohort retained the original BRAF V600E mutation, but no new mutations were identified at progression. Fifty percent (9/18) of patients showed emergence of ≥ 1 KRAS or NRAS mutation, which was not detectable at baseline. Polyclonal KRAS mutations were observed in 6 of 9 patients (67%). Moreover, other MAPK pathway alterations such as MAP2K1 mutation were detected in 22% of patients. In addition to these findings, amplifications of MET and EGFR were detected in 2 patients, whereas 1 patient acquired MET amplification alone (Fig. 4C).

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor Divarasib in solid tumors [^1139eVue]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging tool with potential clinical applications in diagnosing cancer, detecting mutations, capturing tumor heterogeneity, tracking tumor evolution, and monitoring response to therapy. We observed that different tumor types with the KRAS G12C driver mutation have distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, and this is further impacted by tumor burden and metastatic sites. Tumor-specific features in ctDNA shedding may impact the utility of a blood-based diagnostic assay for KRAS G12C inhibitors.

Longitudinal tracking revealed that the dynamics of KRAS G12C variant allele frequency largely mirrored the overall ctDNA tumor fraction upon divarasib treatment, providing evidence that the majority of KRAS G12C mutations are truncal across indications. We also showed that changes in ctDNA tumor fraction upon treatment were associated with patient outcomes and response to divarasib treatment, supporting the potential utility of ctDNA as an early readout of treatment response in future clinical trials.

### Kras mutations in non-small cell lung cancer [^114R4Ufy]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor a single specific mutated oncogene that is thought to be the primary genetic "driver" leading to cancer. The two most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer encode for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS. EGFR kinase domain mutations were only recently identified, but they have already been established in the clinic as valid predictors of increased sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). By contrast, even though KRAS mutations were identified in NSCLC tumors more than 20 years ago, we have only just begun to appreciate the clinical value of KRAS tumor status. Recent studies indicate that patients with mutant KRAS tumors fail to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and their disease does not respond to EGFR inhibitors. There is a dire need for therapies specifically for patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC. In this review, we summarize the initial discovery of RAS mutations in NSCLC, describe work exploring associations with clinical factors and outcomes, and provide an overview of approaches to targeting KRAS mutant NSCLC.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^114WLz5j]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Traditionally, tumor tissue has been the standard biospecimen for most molecular-based biomarker testing. However, it carries several inherent limitations related to the accessibility of the biopsy locations, inadequate tissue for molecular testing, and tumor heterogeneity, particularly in patients progressing on treatment. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are not suitable for ctDNA evaluation. Increasingly, liquid biopsy offers a more practical alternative in the diagnostic setting if tumor tissue testing is not possible and more often at the time of progression or metastasis when tissue may not be accessible. NSCLC has been the main test area for establishing this sampling method for examining tumor-derived alterations.

Liquid biopsy refers to the procedure of collecting blood, from which molecular components can be isolated and examined. In lung cancer, liquid biopsies are most frequently used to isolate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which can then be assessed for gene mutations. The first liquid biopsy test ever approved was the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 in 2016, which uses plasma specimens as a companion diagnostic test for the detection of exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitution mutations in the EGFR gene to guide therapy with anti-EGFR TKIs. More sensitive tests have become available since. Liquid biopsy is non-invasive, and bypasses issues related to tumor heterogeneity, thus having the potential to be used for real-time detection and monitoring of lung cancer disease progression. It does have limitations, however, namely the risk…

### Molecular testing for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: How to implement evidence-based recommendations [^111N1Q4x]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of relevant biomarkers has reshaped our approach to therapy selection for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The unprecedented outcomes demonstrated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in molecularly defined cohorts of patients have underscored the importance of genetic profiling in this disease. Despite published guidelines on biomarker testing, successful tumor genotyping faces significant hurdles at both academic and community-based practices. Oncologists are now faced with interpreting large-scale genomic data from multiple tumor types, possibly making it difficult to adhere to practice standards in lung cancer.

In addition, physicians' lack of time, resources, and face-to-face opportunities can interfere with the multidisciplinary approach that is essential to the delivery of care. Finally, several challenges exist in optimizing the amount and quality of tissue for molecular testing. Recognizing the importance of biomarker testing, a series of advisory boards were recently convened to address these hurdles and clarify best practices. We reviewed these challenges and established recommendations to help optimize tissue acquisition, processing, and testing within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach.

### How to keep up with molecular testing and targeted therapies in lung cancer [^114zHwvH]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). High credibility.

Until the early 2000s, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was treated as a single disease with all histologic subtypes treated alike with standard chemotherapy agents. Over the past two decades, the treatment paradigms for advanced NSCLC have changed dramatically with the discovery of multiple targeted therapies that are now approved for the treatment of NSCLC tumors with specific oncogene drivers or molecular alterations. Molecular testing has become integrated and critical for the clinical management of advanced NSCLC. The discovery and success of these targeted therapies have reshaped the classification of NSCLC on the basis of molecular classification and enabled a personalized approach in thoracic oncology. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the molecular profiling of NSCLC, and approved and emerging targeted therapies for the treatment of NSCLC.

### Lumakras [^114s3n4x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lumakras was demonstrated in a subset of patients enrolled in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial (CodeBreaK 100 [NCT03600883]). Eligible patients were required to have locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with disease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients also needed an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).

All patients were required to have prospectively identified KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in tumor tissue samples by using the QIAGEN therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit performed in a central laboratory. Of the 126 total enrolled subjects, 2 (2%) were unevaluable for efficacy analysis due to the absence of radiographically measurable lesions at baseline. Of the 124 patients with KRAS G12C mutations confirmed in tumor tissue, plasma samples from 112 patients were tested retrospectively using the Guardant360® CDx. Among these, 78 out of 112 patients (70%) had the KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimens, 31 out of 112 patients (28%) did not have the KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimens, and 3 out of 112 (2%) were unevaluable due to Guardant360® CDx test failure.

### Liquid biopsy for mutations testing in non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study [^11538BUK]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) gene mutations have recently been approved to select advanced stages non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatments. In this setting, liquid biopsy may represent a valuable option for BRAF mutational testing in patients without tissue availability. Here, we reviewed 196 plasma-based liquid biopsies analyzed by an in-house developed next-generation sequencing panel, termed SiRe. Overall, 6 (3.1%) out of 196 BRAF mutated cases were identified, with a median allelic frequency of 3.4%. Exon 15 p.V600E was the most commonly detected mutation (2/6, 33.3%). Our data highlighted that the SiRe panel is a robust tool for BRAF mutation assessment on circulating tumor DNA. Further investigation is required to develop a diagnostic algorithm to harmonize BRAF testing on tissue and blood in advanced stages NSCLC patients.

### Incorporating BEAMing technology as a liquid biopsy into clinical practice for the management of colorectal cancer patients: an expert taskforce review [^111RaQAr]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

A blood-based approach enables the detection of the emergence or disappearance of genetic mutations linked to resistance or susceptibility to targeted therapies. The emergence of RAS mutations is a frequent mechanism of resistance in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy. A recent study utilizing the OncoBEAM RAS assay provides preliminary evidence to support the role of monitoring emerging RAS in CRC patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy. In this study, 62 of 70 (89%) of mCRC patients who initially responded to anti-EGFR therapy and chemotherapy were found to develop resistance. At the time of resistance, acquired mutations in KRAS were detected by BEAMing in the plasma of 27/62 (44%) patients.

In order to evaluate whether newly detected KRAS mutations were already present in treatment-naïve primary tumors as undetectable low-frequency clones or were truly acquired mutations, the investigators utilized the OncoBEAM RAS assay on the original tumor tissue to re-analyze archival samples from 20 of 27 patients for traces of KRAS clones. This analysis revealed that seven (35%) patients had low-frequency KRAS mutations and that overall, these seven patients had a poorer prognosis than those determined to be truly KRAS wild type (median progression-free survival: 3.0 versus 8.0 months, P = 0.0004).

In another study, researchers conducted a post hoc investigation of patients enrolled in the phase III CRYSTAL study to determine the treatment effects of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone for patients whose tumors had mutations in one o.

### The current state of molecular testing in the treatment of patients with solid tumors, 2019 [^112j7cia]. CA (2019). Low credibility.

In 2019, optimum cancer care requires state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics, a solid knowledge base to interpret and apply the results, and a nearly constant awareness of changes on the horizon. The field is moving that quickly. Comprehensive testing performed on our patients at the beginning of 2019 is likely to be incomplete today. Drug approvals are no longer based solely on large phase 3 trials; these late-stage trials are being replaced by "basket" and "umbrella" trials, allowing us to ensure that the right drug is given to the right patient faster. Subsequent new regulatory and payer approvals seem to come daily.

Precision medicine is now a part of our standard practice, but with this comes many new challenges. How do we deal with tumor heterogeneity, and will liquid biopsies satisfactorily replace tissue-based testing? Are we justified in, and can we afford, testing a large sample of patients, knowing that we will only rarely find the sought-after "needle in the haystack?" How do we manage our patients' expectations when there is so much press and hype surrounding our new discoveries? Can we afford to develop and ultimately pay for increasingly expensive therapies targeting increasingly smaller proportions of patients? There is, of course, no turning back, but there is much work ahead.

### Diagnostic strategies toward clinical implementation of liquid biopsy RAS/BRAF circulating tumor DNA analyses in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^114sSwEG]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). Low credibility.

Detection of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in tumor tissue is currently used to predict resistance to treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Liquid biopsies are minimally invasive, and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation analyses may better represent tumor heterogeneity. This study examined the incorporation of liquid biopsy RAS/BRAF ctDNA analyses into diagnostic strategies to determine mCRC patient eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy.

Tumor tissue and liquid biopsies were collected from 100 mCRC patients with liver-only metastases in a multicenter prospective clinical trial. Three diagnostic strategies incorporating droplet digital PCR ctDNA analyses were compared with routine tumor tissue RAS/BRAF mutation profiling using decision tree analyses. Tissue DNA mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were present in 54%, 0%, and 3% of mCRC patients, respectively. A 93% concordance was observed between tissue DNA and liquid biopsy ctDNA mutations. The proportion of patients with RAS/BRAF alterations increased from 57% to 60% for diagnostic strategies that combined tissue and liquid biopsy mutation analyses.

Consecutive RAS/BRAF ctDNA analysis followed by tissue DNA analysis in the case of a liquid biopsy-negative result appeared to be the most optimal diagnostic strategy to comprehensively determine eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy in a cost-saving manner. These results highlight the potential clinical utility of liquid biopsies for detecting primary resistance to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy.

### Circulating tumor DNA for personalized lung cancer monitoring [^1159A8sb]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

NSCLC testing using ctDNA is a promising step for precision medicine and the liquid biopsy towards a new era where continuous genetic profiling of tumors enables the most effective treatment. The approach discussed in the paper could also be further applied to other cancers, such as breast and colorectal, where ctDNA testing has already been studied. Careful consideration and comparison of this new method with traditional biomarkers and tests is needed to ensure ctDNA testing benefits patients and makes a smooth transition from the lab to the clinic.

### A novel multiplex droplet digital PCR assay to identify and quantify KRAS mutations in clinical specimens [^113Qt7ij]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). Low credibility.

Reactivating point mutations in KRAS are critical drivers in pancreatic cancer and have been attributed to resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy in colorectal cancer. Although KRAS genotyping provides limited clinical utility in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer patients at present, inferences about the fractional abundance of KRAS mutations may inform on tumor purity in traditionally challenging clinical specimens and their potential use in precision medicine. KRAS genetic testing has indeed become an essential tool to guide treatment decisions in colorectal cancer, but an unmet need for methods standardization exists. Here, we present a unique droplet digital PCR method that enables the simultaneous detection and quantification of KRAS exon 2, 3, and 4 point mutations and copy number alterations.

We have validated the following mutations and amplifications by conducting this assay in a cohort of 100 DNA samples extracted from fresh frozen tumor biopsies, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, and liquid biopsy specimens:

- **Exon 2 mutations**: G12S, G12R, G12D, G12A, G12V, G12C
- **Exon 3 mutations**: G13D, G60V
- **Exon 4 mutations**: Q61H, Q61L, A146V, A146T, A146P
- **Copy number alterations**: Focal KRAS amplifications

Despite its modest lower limit of detection (approximately 1%), this assay will be a rapid, cost-effective means to infer the purity of biopsy specimens carrying KRAS mutations and can be used in noninvasive serial monitoring of circulating tumor DNA to evaluate clinical response and/or detect early signs of relapse.

### Application of liquid biopsies in cancer targeted therapy [^1175WMhR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

As a growing body of evidence demonstrates intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, both during carcinogenesis and also throughout treatment resulting in acquired drug resistance, the utility of blood-based assays or "liquid biopsies" is becoming increasingly recognized in clinical practice and trial design. "Liquid biopsies" provide a less invasive approach to the gold standard of interrogating tumors by tissue biopsies, which are frequently unfeasible, associated with morbidity, and cannot be performed as often.

### Evolution and clinical impact of EGFR mutations in circulating free DNA in the BELIEF trial [^111jgqmr]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Longitudinal evaluation of mutations in blood samples was a prespecified secondary objective in the BELIEF trial of erlotinib and bevacizumab in advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC. Here, we report the testing results and explore the correlation of EGFR status in blood with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were prospectively collected from patients at baseline, at response evaluation, and at progression, and sent to a central laboratory. Circulating free DNA was purified and EGFR mutations were analyzed with a validated real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

- **Results**: EGFR exon 19/21 mutations were detected in 55 of 91 baseline blood samples (60.4%) and correlated with a significantly worse progression-free survival: 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.0–14.8 mo) for the patients who were positive versus 22.9 months (95% CI: 9.5–33.9 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.0020). Among the 74 samples at response, exon 19/21 mutations were detected only in three samples (4.1%). In contrast, 29 of 58 patients (50.0%) were exon 19/21 positive at progression and showed a significantly worse median overall survival of 21.7 months (95% CI: 17.0–30.9 mo) compared with 37.4 months (95% CI: 22.6–53.1 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.011). Blood samples at the three time points were available for 48 patients. Of those, among 14 exon 19/21 EGFR-negative at presentation, 13 (93%) were persistently negative for the sensitizing mutations after progression and the p.T790M could only be detected in the blood of two patients.

### Complications, costs, and health care resource use with tissue biopsy followed by liquid biopsy versus tissue re-biopsy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer [^1139VEzK]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

As more targeted therapies become available, testing for all actionable mutations has presented challenges, including limited tissue availability and prolonged wait times. In an observational study, patients with advanced NSCLC with actionable mutations had an average wait of 46.5 days from diagnosis to positive biomarker test. Difficulty accessing some tumors and tumor heterogeneity may also limit the feasibility of tissue biopsy. Such issues can lead to underreporting of genotypes and missed opportunities for targeted treatment.

Liquid biopsy, in which circulating tumor DNA is genotyped to identify mutations, is gaining acceptance as a complement to tissue biopsy for genetic testing for NSCLC. This technique can provide additional information to facilitate therapeutic decision-making in cases of insufficient biopsy tissue. Liquid biopsy is also less invasive, and results can be obtained more rapidly, which improves disease management and prognosis. Liquid biopsy, coupled with tissue biopsy, is predicted to identify actionable mutations more effectively than tissue biopsy alone while also reducing costs.

Recommendations from IASLC and ESMO support the use of liquid biopsy in NSCLC. IASLC considers liquid biopsy testing a valid complement to tissue biopsy genotyping for tumors of patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC. ESMO recommends liquid biopsy NGS assays as a complement or alternative to tissue NGS to identify actionable mutations in treatment-naive patients with NSCLC, especially when tissue biopsy could delay treatment or when invasive procedures may pose a risk to the patient.
