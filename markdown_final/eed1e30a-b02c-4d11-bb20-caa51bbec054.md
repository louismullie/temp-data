## Question

Norepinephrine and the autonomic nervous system

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about norepinephrine's role in the autonomic nervous system, including its synthesis, release, receptor pharmacology, organ-level effects, pathophysiology, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of norepinephrine within the sympathetic nervous system. Then, I should verify receptor subtypes and their signaling. Next, I will examine organ-specific physiological and pathophysiological effects, followed by measurement methods and clinical correlates. Finally, I will consider therapeutic strategies that modulate norepinephrine signaling and synthesize key takeaways with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical and neurochemical framework. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) is the principal neurotransmitter of postganglionic sympathetic neurons, synthesized from dopamine via dopamine β-hydroxylase and released at neuroeffector junctions, whereas preganglionic sympathetic neurons are cholinergic and release acetylcholine onto nicotinic receptors in sympathetic ganglia; the adrenal medulla also secretes catecholamines, including epinephrine and norepinephrine, into the circulation during stress responses, which complements local neuronal norepinephrine release [^113kTyzc] [^114XKY2z].

> Wait, let me verify the receptor landscape before attributing effects. Adrenergic receptors are G protein–coupled receptors with nine human subtypes: three α1 (α1A, α1B, α1D), three α2 (α2A, α2B, α2C), and three β (β1, β2, β3); α1 receptors are generally Gq-coupled and mediate vasoconstriction, α2 receptors are Gi-coupled and often presynaptically inhibit norepinephrine release, and β receptors are Gs-coupled and increase cAMP with chronotropic/inotropic and metabolic effects; subtype-specific functions and tissue distributions explain much of the organ-specific physiology and pharmacology of norepinephrine [^111X6B7e] [^114xneXK].

> I will now examine cardiovascular effects, but hold on, I should separate acute from chronic actions. Acutely, norepinephrine increases heart rate and contractility via β1-adrenergic signaling in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and myocardium, and it increases systemic vascular resistance via α1-mediated vasoconstriction, thereby elevating mean arterial pressure. Chronically, sustained sympathetic activation drives β1-adrenergic receptor desensitization, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and arrhythmogenesis, and it contributes to heart failure progression through adverse remodeling and neurohormonal activation, which is why β-blockade is foundational in heart failure therapy [^115RnvfX] [^112VfGpC] [^113Droyx].

> Next, I should review renal and hemodynamic interactions. Sympathetic efferents to the kidney increase renin release, promote sodium reabsorption, and constrict renal arterioles, thereby raising systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure; renal sympathetic denervation disrupts both efferent and afferent renal nerves and can reduce blood pressure in resistant hypertension, though patient selection and procedural heterogeneity remain key issues, and sympathetic overactivity in hypertension is linked to impaired neuronal norepinephrine reuptake and increased spillover, particularly from the heart and kidneys [^114VPUsy] [^111Ve4q7] [^117MP8xc].

> Let me consider metabolic regulation, and I need to ensure I distinguish direct neural effects from circulating catecholamines. Sympathetic norepinephrine increases hepatic glucose production via α/β-adrenergic stimulation of hepatocytes, promotes adipose lipolysis, and suppresses insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells while stimulating glucagon from α-cells; recent data also indicate local catecholamine synthesis within pancreatic islets, suggesting that norepinephrine signaling can arise both from innervation and from intra-islet sources, which complicates the classical neuron-centric model [^115sAvMD] [^114Y2zie].

> I should confirm immune and inflammatory modulation. Norepinephrine released from sympathetic varicosities signals to immune cells via adrenergic receptors, generally skewing toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, whereas the parasympathetic cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway restrains inflammation via α7 nicotinic receptors on macrophages; in chronic kidney disease and other inflammatory states, autonomic imbalance with sympathetic overactivity and reduced vagal tone contributes to a pro-inflammatory milieu, and vagus nerve stimulation has shown anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical and some clinical contexts [^115k1Df4] [^113xL2MV] [^116o3MW5].

> But wait, what about bone and reproduction — do these fit the same logic? In bone, β2-adrenergic signaling suppresses osteoblast proliferation and increases RANKL, promoting osteoclastogenesis and net bone loss, while in the ovary, noradrenergic signals help maintain oocyte quiescence under stress, illustrating that sympathetic norepinephrine coordinates energy conservation and reproductive pausing during adverse conditions. These are good reminders that norepinephrine's roles extend beyond classic cardiovascular and metabolic domains [^114F2k98] [^111ZRQhs].

> I need to check central nervous system contributions, because peripheral sympathetic tone is shaped by brainstem circuits. The locus coeruleus provides widespread noradrenergic innervation and modulates arousal, attention, stress responses, and memory consolidation; dysregulation of LC-NE signaling is implicated in anxiety, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases, and recent work shows that norepinephrine release in the cerebellum contributes to aversive learning, linking central NE to both cognitive and autonomic adaptations to threat [^112uN2br] [^116SWnJ6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease causality without anchoring to measurement methods. Sympathetic activity can be assessed indirectly via plasma norepinephrine or heart rate variability, and more directly via microneurography and radiotracer norepinephrine spillover; in essential hypertension, muscle sympathetic nerve activity and regional norepinephrine spillover are increased, and in heart failure, cardiac sympathetic denervation and impaired norepinephrine reuptake can be visualized with iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging, which correlates with disease severity and prognosis [^111TcRv6] [^1137Lt8A].

> I should double-check the pathophysiological themes that recur across diseases. Sympathetic overactivity is a hallmark of essential hypertension and contributes to target organ damage, insulin resistance, and renal injury; in heart failure, initial compensatory adrenergic drive becomes maladaptive, accelerating remodeling and arrhythmias; in metabolic syndrome and obesity, sympathetic activation links overnutrition to insulin resistance via lipolysis and hepatic glucose output; and in critical illness, prolonged catecholamine excess is toxic, prompting "decatecholaminization" strategies such as beta-blockade in septic shock to mitigate harm while preserving perfusion [^117MP8xc] [^113Droyx] [^112uYceR] [^115DW63F].

> Next, I should review therapeutic modulation, and I need to ensure I separate evidence-based from investigational approaches. Beta-adrenergic antagonists reduce sympathetic effects on the heart and are cornerstone therapy in heart failure and ischemic heart disease; centrally acting α2-agonists like clonidine reduce sympathetic outflow; renal denervation lowers blood pressure in selected resistant hypertension phenotypes; vagus nerve stimulation aims to enhance parasympathetic tone and has anti-inflammatory effects; and droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, treats neurogenic orthostatic hypotension by replenishing deficient noradrenergic tone, illustrating bidirectional therapeutic targeting of the norepinephrine axis [^112VfGpC] [^114VPUsy] [^115k1Df4] [^115JGFZJ].

> Let me reconsider the broader integrative picture to ensure coherence. Norepinephrine sits at the intersection of neural circuits, endocrine signaling, and immune modulation, coordinating cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral responses to internal and external demands; its effects are context-dependent, shaped by receptor subtype, tissue expression, and temporal dynamics, so therapeutic manipulation must be precise and disease-context aware to avoid blunt-force disruption of adaptive physiology [^112D9C9L] [^116CEphY].

> In summary, norepinephrine is the principal sympathetic neurotransmitter that, via nine adrenergic receptor subtypes, integrates cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and central nervous system responses. Its dysregulation contributes to hypertension, heart failure, metabolic disease, and inflammatory states, and modern therapeutics increasingly target sympathetic circuits with pharmacologic, device-based, and neuromodulatory approaches, though careful patient selection and mechanistic understanding remain essential to translate this knowledge into improved outcomes [^115RnvfX] [^117EYfcH].

Norepinephrine (NE) is the **primary neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system** [^115RnvfX], released from postganglionic neurons to mediate "fight-or-flight" responses [^113kTyzc] by increasing heart rate, contractility, and vascular tone [^1161tzKo]. It acts on α1, α2, and β-adrenergic receptors [^111X6B7e] to regulate cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune functions [^116o3MW5]; sustained NE signaling contributes to hypertension, heart failure, and metabolic disorders [^111TcRv6] [^112ZRLoa] [^112u8DuS]. The parasympathetic system counterbalances NE effects via acetylcholine [^115RnvfX], maintaining autonomic homeostasis [^117EYfcH].

---

## Synthesis and release of norepinephrine

- **Biosynthesis**: NE is synthesized from tyrosine via dopamine, with dopamine β-hydroxylase converting dopamine to NE [^112B6KtZ].

- **Release**: NE is released from postganglionic sympathetic neurons [^113kTyzc] and the adrenal medulla, acting locally and systemically [^116o3MW5].

- **Termination**: NE action ends via reuptake, enzymatic degradation (MAO, COMT), and diffusion [^111Ve4q7].

---

## Adrenergic receptors and signaling pathways

NE signals through **G protein-coupled adrenergic receptors** [^111X6B7e]:

| **Receptor subtype** | **Primary g protein** | **Major physiological effects** |
|-|-|-|
| α1 | Gq | Vasoconstriction, increased vascular tone [^1161tzKo] |
| α2 | Gi | Inhibits NE release, reduces sympathetic outflow [^114xneXK] |
| β1 | Gs | Increased heart rate, contractility, renin release [^112VfGpC] |
| β2 | Gs | Vasodilation, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis [^115sAvMD] |
| β3 | Gs | Lipolysis, thermogenesis [^115sAvMD] |

---

## Physiological functions of norepinephrine

NE coordinates **multisystem responses** to maintain homeostasis and respond to stress:

- **Cardiovascular system**: Increases heart rate, contractility, and vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure and perfusion [^1161tzKo].

- **Metabolic effects**: Stimulates glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis to mobilize energy [^115sAvMD].

- **Immune modulation**: Influences immune cell activity and inflammation via adrenergic receptors on immune cells [^115k1Df4].

---

## Norepinephrine in autonomic balance

The autonomic nervous system maintains balance through **sympathetic (NE) and parasympathetic (acetylcholine) signaling** [^115RnvfX]. NE-driven sympathetic effects are countered by parasympathetic activation, which lowers heart rate, promotes digestion, and conserves energy [^113kTyzc]. This balance is **dynamic**, adjusting to physiological needs and environmental cues [^112D9C9L].

---

## Pathophysiological implications of norepinephrine dysregulation

Excess or deficient NE signaling underlies **multiple diseases**:

- **Hypertension**: Chronic sympathetic overactivity increases vascular resistance and blood pressure [^111TcRv6] [^114uKGif].

- **Heart failure**: Persistent NE activation causes remodeling, arrhythmias, and worsens outcomes [^112ZRLoa] [^113Droyx].

- **Metabolic disorders**: NE-driven lipolysis and insulin resistance contribute to obesity and diabetes [^112u8DuS] [^112uYceR].

- **Neurological disorders**: LC-NE dysregulation is implicated in anxiety, depression, and neurodegeneration [^112uN2br] [^114LCr3d].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Modulating NE signaling is a **key therapeutic strategy**:

- **Beta-blockers**: Reduce sympathetic effects in cardiovascular disease [^112ZRLoa].

- **Alpha-blockers**: Lower blood pressure by blocking α1-mediated vasoconstriction [^notfound].

- **Renal denervation**: Reduces sympathetic outflow in resistant hypertension [^114VPUsy].

- **Vagus nerve stimulation**: Enhances parasympathetic tone to counter sympathetic overactivity [^115k1Df4].

---

Norepinephrine is the **principal sympathetic neurotransmitter** that coordinates cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune responses; its dysregulation contributes to disease, and therapies targeting NE signaling restore autonomic balance and improve outcomes [^115RnvfX].

### Impaired cardiac sympathetic activity is associated with myocardial remodeling and established biomarkers of heart failure [^1137Lt8A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Activation of the sympathetic nervous system has long been recognized as a distinct characteristic of the clinical syndrome of HF(21), which would entail higher sympathetic nerve activity, while ECV expansion, commonly seen in HF, would reduce innervation density. Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity is an initial compensatory mechanism in HF to stimulate contractility and maintain cardiac output but ultimately leads to lower β‐adrenergic receptor responsiveness and density. This desensitization of myocardial β‐adrenergic receptors can reflect an impairment of the norepinephrine neuronal uptake function, which can be evaluated by 123 I‐MIBG, and also an increase in circulating norepinephrine concentrations. In this study, cardiac sympathetic function was most impaired in HFrEF, and in this subgroup, there was a significant correlation between sympathetic function and systolic performance assessed by LVEF and GLS (Figure S1). Sympathetic function was lower in HFpEF compared with controls (Figure 1A), without a significant association with systolic and diastolic performance, suggesting that β‐adrenergic receptor responsiveness and sympathetic function are partially preserved in the early stages of HF or when LVEF is preserved or marginally depressed. The mediation analysis provided (Figure S2) does not suggest that autonomic dysfunction, as assessed by the 123 I‐MIBG H/M ratio, is the exclusive mediator in the impact of ECV or NT‐proBNP on HF severity. Instead, our aim was to highlight that autonomic dysfunction plays a mediating role, acknowledging the potential involvement of other mediators as well.

### Sympathetic nervous system: evaluation and importance for clinical general anesthesia [^115nBVo2]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

For more than 100 yr, scientists have studied the sympathetic nervous system and its cardiovascular control mechanisms. Muscle sympathetic activity is the most important direct and rapidly responding variable for evaluation of sympathetic neural outflow. Because of its significance in response to environmental challenges and its role in cardiovascular control, great attention has been paid to the sympathetic nervous system in both health and disease and, more recently, also during general anesthesia. In fact, general anesthesia can also be considered as an investigational tool to assess mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation. This review evaluates different methods for determination of sympathetic nervous system activity and describes its role in human neurohumoral circulatory control. Furthermore, the effects of general anesthesia on sympathetic nervous system activity and their relevance for clinical anesthesia are discussed.

Introduction

The autonomic nervous system is a vast network of neurons under involuntary control that is essential for maintaining physiological homeostasis throughout the body. In 1921, Langley divided the autonomic nervous system into the opposing sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which generally act antagonistically within a given organ through release of norepinephrine (typically mediating "fight or flight" responses) and acetylcholine (typically mediating "rest and digest" responses), respectively. This provided a foundation for modern physiology and medicine that has remained mostly intact a century later. Despite the vaunted position of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, the molecular, cellular, and functional diversity of their constituent neurons and circuits remains largely unknown, most notably at the central nervous system level.

One critical organ controlled by the autonomic nervous system is the heart. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems powerfully influence heart rate, rhythm, and contractility to meet internal and external demands. Classical physiological studies have shown that the sympathetic nervous system exerts control of heart rate on a time scale of seconds, while the parasympathetic nervous system exerts control on an even faster, beat-to-beat timescale and is thus thought to be responsible for the tight coordination between cardiac and pulmonary function. Cardiac parasympathetic outflow originates from brainstem preganglionic neurons, residing primarily in the nucleus ambiguus (Amb) in the medulla. A minority of cardiac parasympathetic neurons are located in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, which controls ventricular inotropy and excitability, but does not control heart rate. Amb neurons innervate cholinergic neurons in parasympathetic cardiac ganglia located on the surface of the heart, and these ganglion neurons in turn innervate the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and myocardial tissue. Acetylcholine release from these ganglion neurons reduces heart rate, AV conduction velocity, and myocardial contractility by engaging cardiac muscarinic receptors. Altered sympathetic-parasympathetic signaling balance to the heart has been implicated in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases –, and is molecularly targeted by common cardiac therapies such as β-blockers and atropine, but the neuronal cell types within the cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems have not been molecularly defined.

### Crystal structure of the α-adrenergic receptor reveals molecular determinants of selective ligand recognition [^111X6B7e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Adrenergic receptors (ARs), or adrenoceptors, are aminergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) subdivided into nine distinct subtypes in humans, — three α 1 ARs (α 1A, α 1B, α 1D), three α 2 ARs (α 2A, α 2B, α 2C), and three βARs (β 1, β 2, β 3). ARs are widely yet differentially expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral sympathetic nerves, as well as in sympathetically innervated tissues throughout the body. Upon activation by the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, ARs mediate a large variety of physiological functions, many of which are of considerable clinical relevance. For instance, drugs blocking β 1 AR are widely prescribed to treat hypertension and heart failure, while β 2 AR agonists are used as bronchodilators in asthma therapy.

In contrast to βARs, the therapeutic potential of αARs is largely unexploited for at least two reasons. First, there is a lack of truly selective ligands for individual α 1 AR and α 2 AR subtypes, which often mediate opposing physiological functions. As a consequence, drugs that act through αARs are only second-line agents to treat hypertension, pain, or neuropsychiatric disorders, due to their off-target side effects and limited therapeutic benefits. Second, there is an incomplete understanding of the individual αAR subtypes' physiological and pathophysiological roles, as the lack of selective compounds has hampered research. Nonetheless, studies in transgenic mice indicate that distinct α 1 AR subtypes mediate different functions in the heart, CNS, and urogenital system –. Stimulation of α 1A AR and α 1B AR, respectively, reduces or augments the severity of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and ischemic disease. In the CNS, α 1A AR stimulation is antiepileptic and enhances neurogenesis, whereas excessive α 1B AR activation is detrimental to brain function. In addition, α 1 ARs contribute to the regulation of immune cells, and pre-clinical studies suggest that α 1 AR-blockers may protect against hyperinflammatory responses –. The α 1 AR antagonist prazosin is currently under evaluation in clinical trials for the prevention of cytokine storm syndrome caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19;). Similar to α 1 ARs, individual α 2 AR subtypes differentially regulate important physiological processes, such as blood pressure homeostasis, placenta development, mood, and pain perception.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^115fWV9r]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

There are still many areas of uncertainties and room for improvement regarding norepinephrine use. First, consensus of clinical definitions is needed, such as refractory shock or high-dose vasopressors. With the emergence of novel vasoactive drugs, endeavors proposing equivalences between medications (catecholaminergic and non-catecholaminergic) could facilitate comparison between agents and clinical settings. Future studies should address the optimal timing of norepinephrine initiation, dosing strategies in special populations such as obese patients, and vasoactive drug weaning or de-escalation. Finally, the integration of closed loop-vasopressors infusion systems might enhance clinical practice in the near future.

In conclusion, norepinephrine is a pillar of ICU's pharmacological arsenal. Over the years, we have increased our understanding on the properties, clinical use, and adverse effect profile of this drug. Tackling the specific uncertainties in future research could translate into safer and better patient care.

### Dopamine regulates pancreatic glucagon and insulin secretion via adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors [^114Y2zie]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DA signaling in the periphery is increasingly recognized as having critical roles in metabolic regulation. Our results offer new insights into outstanding questions concerning the sources of DA and its related catecholamine NE for local α-cell and β-cell adrenergic and dopaminergic signaling in the pancreas. Historically, peripheral catecholamine signaling in the pancreas focused primarily on autonomic innervation of islets. NE from sympathetic inputs acts on α-cell and β-cell adrenergic receptors to raise glucagon, suppress insulin release, and ultimately elevate blood glucose. Sympathetic nervous innervation was therefore long considered to be the key source of NE acting on the endocrine pancreas. However, there is increasing awareness that the precise extent of islet innervation is highly variable and species-dependent –. Compared to rodents, recent studies suggest much sparser innervation of human islets. Furthermore, most sympathetic axons innervating the pancreas are associated with the smooth muscle cells of local blood vessels rather than local islet cells. Islets also lack direct dopaminergic innervation in either humans or rodents. Together, these studies suggest that autonomic sympathetic innervation cannot be the sole source of pancreatic catecholamines. Rather, growing evidence suggests that de novo local production of NE and DA by islet cells is a key source of catecholamines in the endocrine pancreas.

### Maintenance of quiescent oocytes by noradrenergic signals [^111ZRQhs]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The adrenergic innervation of the ovary is thought to be required for modulation of the function of ovarian vasculature and ovarian sheath cells. Despite the reports from multiple animals that the ovaries are innervated by cells expressing norepinephrine in vertebrates or octopamine in invertebrates, the function of noradrenergic innervation of the ovary is unclear. In D. melanogaster, octopamine is required for the egg-laying process. However, C. elegans mutants lacking octopamine, and zebrafish and mouse mutants lacking norepinephrine reproduce normally –, indicating that the role of noradrenergic signaling in fertility might be hidden under well-fed laboratory conditions. Because of the well-known roles of noradrenergic signals in the responses to stresses such as the fight-or-flight responseand to starvation, we investigated the function of norepinephrine and octopamine in ovaries under unfavorable conditions, where the maintenance signal for oocyte quiescence will be manifest. Here, we show that noradrenergic signal is essential to maintain quiescent oocyte pools in all four model organisms of C. elegans, C. remanei, Drosophila and zebrafish under the stressful conditions, revealing a new role of noradrenergic signaling in safeguarding oocytes.

### Β-amyloid redirects norepinephrine signaling to activate the pathogenic GSK3 β / tau cascade [^111g4gND]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The brain noradrenergic system is critical for normal cognition and is affected at early stages in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we reveal a previously unappreciated direct role of norepinephrine signaling in connecting β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau, two key pathological components of AD pathogenesis. Our results show that Aβ oligomers bind to an allosteric site on α 2A adrenergic receptor (α 2A AR) to redirect norepinephrine-elicited signaling to glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. This norepinephrine-dependent mechanism sensitizes pathological GSK3β/tau activation in response to nanomolar accumulations of extracellular Aβ, which is 50- to 100-fold lower than the amount required to activate GSK3β by Aβ alone. The significance of our findings is supported by in vivo evidence in two mouse models, human tissue sample analysis, and longitudinal clinical data. Our study provides translational insights into mechanisms underlying Aβ proteotoxicity, which might have strong implications for the interpretation of Aβ clearance trial results and future drug design and for understanding the selective vulnerability of noradrenergic neurons in AD.

### The sympathetic nervous system in the 21st century: neuroimmune interactions in metabolic homeostasis and obesity [^116CEphY]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions & future perspectives

Relative to brain research, sympathetic neuroscience is lagging several decades behind - owing to the dispersed and difficult anatomical access and technical limitations that the developments we envision will likely surpass. These will be necessary to overcome the conceptual barrier that stagnated in the era of adrenergic receptor pharmacology, which solely accounts for post-synaptic adrenergic targeting in organs. Although such models account for the action of a few adrenergic drugs that are routinely used in the clinic (such as mydriatics, bronchodilators or vasopressors), sympathetic nerves are seldom considered as a neural circuit, whereby pre-synaptic manipulations of a node within the network might not be predicted by post-synaptic adrenoceptor agonism or centrally acting sympathomimetics which have a widespread top-down action. Moreover, the assessment of adrenoceptor subtype expression across cell types mainly originates from bulk tissue techniques that do not account for expression by resident immune cells. Only single nuclei sequencing has parsed apart tissue heterogeneity, particularly that of WAT&BAT, which cannot be analyzed by conventional cell sorting.

Moreover, the linearity of post-synaptic agonism falls apart as adrenoceptors are also expressed in sympathetic neurons, suggesting that feedforward or feedback circuits may exist among ganglia. Whether intra- and inter ganglionic circuitry exists is an open question, despite the highly suggestive TH+ axon bundles between every two ganglia along the paravertebral sympathetic chain. Such ganglionic circuits can be influenced by resident immune cells that cleanse norepinephrine or produce neuromodulators such as opioids. Thus, the field needs to rise from the era of post-synaptic adrenoceptor pharmacology to that of neural networks. As such, the classic view that SNS is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response antagonised by the PNS is an incomplete description of autonomic metabolic control in light of the modern neuronal network theory. Not only do adipose tissues and liver (although still under discussion) receive innervation exclusively from the SNS, but PNS in the heart can act as a cardioprotective buffer whilst sympathofacilitator drugs exert effective control of metabolic tissues to facilitate weight loss and restore the homeostasis of the neuroendocrine loop of leptin action.

### The autonomic nervous system and hypertension [^113XGayZ]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Physiological studies have long documented the key role played by the autonomic nervous system in modulating cardiovascular functions and in controlling blood pressure values, both at rest and in response to environmental stimuli. Experimental and clinical investigations have tested the hypothesis that the origin, progression, and outcome of human hypertension are related to dysfunctional autonomic cardiovascular control and especially to abnormal activation of the sympathetic division. Here, we review the recent literature on the adrenergic and vagal abnormalities that have been reported in essential hypertension, with emphasis on their role as promoters and as amplifiers of the high blood pressure state. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying these abnormalities and their importance in the development and progression of the structural and functional cardiovascular damage that characterizes hypertension. Finally, we examine the modifications of sympathetic and vagal cardiovascular influences induced by current nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions aimed at correcting elevations in blood pressure and restoring the normotensive state.

### The sympathetic nervous system in hypertension: roadmap update of a long journey [^1172YV6V]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

RESIDUAL RISK AND SYMPATHOINHIBITION

Many studies have shown that despite the favorable effects of antihypertensive drug treatment on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality the cardiovascular risk of treated hypertensive patients remains higher than the one seen in the control normotensive population, even when blood pressure values are reduced to or almost to the recommended blood pressure targets. Several are the possible factors which may be involved in the phenomenon. These include the poor control of associated cardiovascular risk factors, as shown in many intervention studies, due also to the fact the multifactorial risk profile makes control of the individual risk components much more difficult. It may also depend on the genetic profile which makes cardiovascular risk unmodifiable with intervention on blood pressure values. A further mechanism relates to the late initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment, when functional or structural cardiovascular alterations associated with a high blood pressure state become scarcely modifiable by treatment. An additional mechanism, closely related to the sympathetic abnormalities reported in essential hypertension, should be mentioned. Namely the fact that antihypertensive drug treatment, despite its ability to exert sympathoinhibitory effects, does not appear to completely reverse the adrenergic overdrive related to hypertension, leaving the sympathetic function higher than the one seen in the true normotensive individuals. This may mean that a not negligible portion of the SNS activation is irreversible and that this phenomenon may adversely affect the cardiovascular risk profile of the treated hypertensive patient.

### Molecular and cellular biology of adrenergic receptors [^114DVY5G]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Adrenergic receptors form the interface between the sympathetic nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Genomic or cDNA clones for 8 types of mammalian adrenergic receptors have been obtained. Much has been learned about the structure and functional properties of the β(2)-adrenergic receptor. Less is known about the functional properties and the physiologic role of the other adrenergic receptors. Further progress in this field may lead to the development of more selective drugs to modify the physiologic processes controlled by these receptors.

### Catecholamines for inflammatory shock: a jekyll-and-hyde conundrum [^112qJcYv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Catecholamines are endogenous neurosignalling mediators and hormones. They are integral in maintaining homeostasis by promptly responding to any stressor. Their synthetic equivalents are the current mainstay of treatment in shock states to counteract myocardial depression and/or vasoplegia. These phenomena are related in large part to decreased adrenoreceptor sensitivity and altered adrenergic signalling, with resultant vascular and cardiomyocyte hyporeactivity. Catecholamines are predominantly used in supraphysiological doses to overcome these pathological consequences. However, these adrenergic agents cause direct organ damage and have multiple 'off-target' biological effects on immune, metabolic and coagulation pathways, most of which are not monitored or recognised at the bedside. Such detrimental consequences may contribute negatively to patient outcomes. This review explores the schizophrenic 'Jekyll-and-Hyde' characteristics of catecholamines in critical illness, as they are both necessary for survival yet detrimental in excess. This article covers catecholamine physiology, the pleiotropic effects of catecholamines on various body systems and pathways, and potential alternatives for haemodynamic support and adrenergic modulation in the critically ill.

### Development of a systems medicine approach to spinal cord injury [^115GbaNE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

The autonomic nervous system multi-organ integrative system

The ANS regulates homeostatic processes such as immune function through the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axis, hypothalamus-pituitary brainstem axis, and parasympathetic systems. Post-SCI ANS abnormalities may be primarily related to neural axis injury level or injury completeness. Initial post-injury neurogenic shock, caused by loss of sympathetic tone, predicts poor neurological recovery. Severe cervical SCI ANS disruption leads to immune dysfunction through splenic atrophy, altered metabolism, and susceptibility to septic shock.

Injury above T6 is a crucial threshold for disturbed autonomic regulation due to the loss of control over the splanchnic vascular bed. Chronic post-SCI blood pressure instability is more common than previously understood. Autonomic dysregulation leads to the uncontrolled release of catecholamines and glucocorticoids, impairing immune function. Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) occurs when a normal sensory stimulus inappropriately results in severe hypertension. AD can depress the immune system, increasing infection risk by reducing splenic leucocytes and increasing glucocorticoid release. Indicators of ANS injury severity include low serum norepinephrine and low-frequency systolic blood pressure fluctuations. Increased allostatic load and autonomic dysfunction have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases.

### Autonomic nervous system involvement in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116sVXQE]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Sympathetic nervous system activation in PAH

Over the last 30 years, accumulating evidence has supported the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PAH, strengthening the hypothesis for the role of SNS activation in PAH development. Microneurography was used to compare the muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) between patients with PAH and healthy controls and showed increased sympathetic nerve traffic in PAH patients. MSNA was also directly correlated with heart rate, presence of pericardial effusion, oxygen saturation, New-York Heart Association class, 6-min walk distance (6-MWD), and pulmonary arterial acceleration time and was associated with clinical deterioration. Administration of hyperoxia decreased MSNA frequency and burst amplitude, suggesting that peripheral chemoreceptors contribute in part to increased MSNA.

Increased SNS activity in PAH was also assessed by neurohormonal activation, despite conflicting results between studies. In a small clinical study comprising 32 patients with PAH, plasma norepinephrine concentration was strongly correlated to PVR and was associated with poor estimated 5-year survival. Some other studies have shown an increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration in PAH patients compared to healthy controls, although these norepinephrine levels did not exceed normal values and were not correlated with any hemodynamic parameter. To determine the involvement of catecholamine pathway in PAH, many groups have directed their research towards catecholamine receptors.

### Norepinephrine release in the cerebellum contributes to aversive learning [^116SWnJ6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic events forge learned associations of sensory signals with aversive outcomes and can lead to excessive conditioned fear responses as well as anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorders(PTSD). While a central role for dopamine release from ventral midbrain axons in the striatum has long been established for forms of reward-based learning, the circuitry underlying aversive learning has been controversial, with evidence endorsing roles for both a subset of ventral midbrain dopamine neurons, and for locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) neurons, which possess axons that project widely to many brain regions –.

NE release from LC projections has been implicated in "fight-or-flight" responses to stressful stimuli and stimulus-associated fear. Aversive stimuli and stress-related behaviors trigger NE release from LC axons in the hypothalamus during forced swimming and tail suspensionand within the amygdala following foot-shock, where it activates β-adrenergic receptors –. Indeed, systemic β-adrenergic receptor antagonists or α2-AR adrenergic receptor agonists impair fear acquisition –.

LC axons also project to the cerebellum (CB), a brain region implicated in emotional associative learning – via its outputs to the amygdala, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus and pre-frontal cortex –. Notably, stimulation of the CB vermis produces freezing and bradycardia, whereas lesions of the vermis (lobules IV and V) inhibit autonomic and behavioral fear responses –. However, roles for NE in the CB in fear learning have not been directly explored.

Here, we report that conditioned aversive learning relies on an experience-dependent increase of NE release in the CB when a conditioned stimulus (CS) becomes associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). Importantly, this learned potentiation of NE release is correlated with freezing, and the disassociation of the predictive US with LC axonal or cell body activity impairs acquisition of learned freezing, without affecting motor functions. The discovery that plastic changes in the synaptic activity of LC-NE projections to the cerebellum play a central mechanism in aversive learning may be key to deciphering how animals learn to avoid threats, as well as assist in identifying the causes of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and impulse control disorders.

### Autonomic nervous system involvement in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113AEwT1]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although PAH is generally associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activation, the precise role of autonomic nervous system involvement in the pathogenesis of PAH is still not fully understood. Pharmacologic adrenergic blockade, reduction of neurohormonal activation, and novel direct methods to attenuate sympathetic nervous system activation such as renal denervation and pulmonary artery denervation may be beneficial in PAH. Further studies are needed to determine the extent of involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PAH and to assess the effectiveness and safety of targeting the autonomic nervous system and RAAS for the treatment of PAH patients.

### The locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system in the healthy and diseased brain: a narrative review [^112uN2br]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a compact nucleus of noradrenergic neurons in the brainstem. Despite its relatively small size, the LC has widespread axonal connections and serves as the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) throughout the central nervous system. The LC-NA system plays a critical role in regulating cognitive and physiological processes, and its dysfunction has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Results

This narrative review explores the anatomy, neurochemistry, and function of the LC-NA system in both the healthy and diseased brain. We first provide a detailed overview of LC connectivity, highlighting its afferent and efferent projections and their implications for brain-wide noradrenaline modulation. Next, we discuss the neurochemical properties of noradrenaline, emphasizing its synthesis, release dynamics, and receptor interactions. The core of this review focuses on the functional roles of the LC-NA system, systematically addressing each function first in the healthy brain and then discussing associated disorders. Specifically, we explore the role of LC-NA signaling in attention and arousal, stress, emotion and pain, memory, motion, and neuroprotection, followed by discussions on psychiatric disorders, cognitive dysfunctions, and neurodegenerative diseases that arise from its dysregulation. Lastly, we examine the involvement of the LC in epilepsy, highlighting how alterations in noradrenaline signaling contribute to seizure susceptibility and propagation.

Conclusion

By integrating anatomical, neurochemical, and functional perspectives, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the LC-NA system's role in brain function and its relevance as a therapeutic target in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

### A narrative on the neurobiological roots of attachment-system functioning [^1175Pc9B]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Facilitation of prolonged proximity-seeking behavior

Noradrenaline secretion from the locus coeruleus as part of the sympathetic nervous system initiates a rapid "fight-or-flight" response that constitutes a quick yet short-lived physiological activation. To maintain the energy needed for prolonged proximity-seeking behavior, a slower but more sustained stress reaction is manifested via the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, predominantly cortisol. Following its production, often around fifteen to twenty minutes after the initial stressor, cortisol, a steroid hormone, is released into the bloodstream. The influence of cortisol on the body is multifaceted, encompassing an enhancement in glucose availability for energy and suppression of the immune response to prevent overreaction, among other functions. Thus, we propose that the energy needed for prolonged "social flight" behavior can be sustained through Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis involvement. Studies in humans have shown that attachment behavior is linked to cortisol, not only in situations that provoke an attachment threat, such as a conflict discussion within a close relationship, but also more generally in terms of daily cortisol patterns and associations with depression.

### Atrial autonomic innervation: a target for interventional antiarrhythmic therapy? [^11786NjG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The autonomic nervous system contributes to the creation of atrial fibrillation substrates. Atrial electrophysiology is influenced differently by sympathetic and parasympathetic activation. Several strategies are available to modulate the complex interaction between the autonomic nervous system and the heart. However, different approaches target the problem differently making the prediction of arrhythmogenic and/or antiarrhythmic effects difficult. We discuss the role of the autonomic nervous system on the development of a substrate for atrial fibrillation and explore the potential antiarrhythmic and/or arrhythmogenic effect of modulation of the autonomic nervous system by renal sympathetic denervation, ganglionated plexi ablation, ganglion stellatum ablation, high thoracic epidural anesthesia, low-level vagal nerve stimulation, and baroreflex stimulation.

### Freezing revisited: coordinated autonomic and central optimization of threat coping [^111RXad4]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

Animals have sophisticated mechanisms for coping with danger. Freezing is a unique state that, upon threat detection, allows evidence to be gathered, response possibilities to be previsioned and preparations to be made for worst-case fight or flight. We propose that - rather than reflecting a passive fear state - the particular somatic and cognitive characteristics of freezing help to conceal overt responses, while optimizing sensory processing and action preparation. Critical for these functions are the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and acetylcholine, which modulate neural information processing and also control the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. However, the interactions between autonomic systems and the brain during freezing, and the way in which they jointly coordinate responses, remain incompletely explored. We review the joint actions of these systems and offer a novel computational framework to describe their temporally harmonized integration. This reconceptualization of freezing has implications for its role in decision-making under threat and for psychopathology.

### The sympathetic nervous system in hypertension: roadmap update of a long journey [^113X5uT8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the publication in 2010 in the American Journal of Hypertension of our state-of-the-art paper on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in hypertension, several studies have been published allowing to considerably expand our knowledge in the field and to strengthen some new concepts that 11 years ago were making their initial steps in the world of the SNS in hypertension.

The goal of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the new findings, new concepts, and future directions of the research targeted on SNS in hypertension. The roadmap of the journey will include the following stages. First, we will provide a brief summary on what we regard as well established notions on SNS in hypertension. We will then examine the evolution of the new concepts on the pathophysiology of the SNS activation in the high blood pressure state, highlighting the relevance of the immune system and the inflammatory process in the development of the adrenergic overdrive, but also discussing the potential role of genetic and other factors which directly or indirectly may exert sympathoexcitatory effects. A further step will be to describe the main features of the SNS in resistant hypertension, a clinical condition which became in the past years an area of intense investigation. During the last decade, a consistent amount of interest has been focused on heart rate as potential sympathetic marker, given the evidence that the latest European guidelines on hypertension have recognized the importance of elevated heart rate values as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Another important step of the long journey will be represented by the results of major meta-analyses recently published aimed at providing conclusive information on how hypertension and other comorbidities may affect the SNS. The last stage of the journey will be devoted to (i) the analysis of the data obtained in the past decade on the involvement of the SNS in the blood pressure effects of bilateral renal nerves ablation (as well as of other invasive approaches) and (ii) the possibility that the so-called "residual risk" displayed by treated hypertensive patient may be at least in part linked to the behavior of the sympathetic responses to antihypertensive drugs.

### Greater daily psychosocial stress exposure is associated with increased norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in young adults [^114wcKSD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary novel finding of the present study is that increased cumulative exposure to common naturally occurring everyday psychosocial stressors was positively related to increased norepinephrine‐induced vasoconstriction in healthy young adults. However, neither stressor severity nor stressor‐related emotional or cognitive processes were related to end‐organ vasoconstrictor responsiveness to exogenous norepinephrine. Taken together, these data suggest that daily psychosocial stressor exposure by itself is sufficient to adversely influence microvascular vasoconstrictor function, regardless of the perceived severity, control over the stressor, or the emotional consequences of the exposure. These findings add to the growing body of literature linking naturalistic daily psychosocial stress to impaired microvascular function 24, 31, 32 and provide additional mechanistic insight to stress‐related cardiovascular risk.

Exposure to stress is a powerful activator of the sympathetic nervous system, 1 and the resultant release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine is essential for the cardiovascular alterations that prepare an organism for "fight or flight". 33 In the laboratory setting, application of acute psychological stressors (eg, mental arithmetic, anxiety‐provoking speech tasks, cognitive challenges, etc.) elicits significant increases in blood pressure. 34, 35, 36 The stress‐induced pressor response is thought to be mediated, in large part, by increased sympathetic nervous system activity, though there is substantial heterogeneity in sympathetic reactivity to acute psychological stress. 7, 37 Nevertheless, sympathetic hyperreactivity to stress has been prospectively linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk, 3 clearly highlighting the clinical importance of stress‐induced overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, it appears that heightened cardiovascular responsiveness to stress is most predictive of the future development of high blood pressure in individuals with high amounts of daily life stress, 16 suggesting an important link between persistent chronic life stress and dysregulation of the acute stress response.

### Autonomic nervous system and adrenal response to cold in man at Antarctica [^114FsN5Q]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of the autonomic nervous system and adrenal system in acclimatization to cold in tropical men during short or prolonged sojourns at Antarctica.

Methods

The study was carried out on volunteers of the 18th winter over team (WOT) and 19th summer team (ST) of an Indian Antarctic Expedition. The ST members were evaluated at Delhi; during voyage; and on days 7, 30, and 60 of their stay at Antarctica. Identical studies were performed in WOT members who had stayed at Antarctica for 14 months. The parameters examined included heart rate, blood pressure, oral temperature, index finger skin temperature, heart rate variability, urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine, and salivary cortisol.

Results

The resting heart rate and blood pressure in ST members significantly increased (P < .05) on days 7 and 30 of their stay at Antarctica and returned to baseline Delhi values by day 60. The index finger temperature declined (P < .05) on day 7 at Antarctica and remained at lower levels during the entire period of observations. Heart rate variability showed an imbalance of autonomic nervous system effects with predominance of low-frequency band on day 7 of stay and returned to Delhi values by day 60. The urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine and salivary cortisol were also increased on day 7 and declined to baseline Delhi values after 2 months of stay. Compared with the ST group, the WOT group showed a significantly higher (P < .05) resting heart rate, blood pressure, and low-frequency power and urinary excretion of norepinephrine.

Conclusions

These observations suggest that Antarctic residency during austral summer results in gradual attenuation of sympathetic tone and a shift of autonomic balance toward the parasympathetic side. However, WOT members showed a predominance of sympathetic and adrenal activity compared with initial responses of ST members, suggesting deconditioning or possible resetting of the autonomic nervous system.

### Autonomic modulation of the immune response and implications for CNS malignancies [^114XKY2z]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
ANS regulation of physiology.

Overview of the autonomic nervous system, divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Both subdivisions rely on a two-neuron circuit prior to reaching an end organ, in general. The SNS preganglionic neurons are found in the lateral horn of the spinal cord from approximately T1–L2 and are, in general, cholinergic, while post-ganglionic neurons extending to target organs release catecholamines. PNS preganglionic neurons arise from cranial nerve nuclei or the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord from T12-L1 and travel via the cranial/vagus nerves and pelvic splanchnic nerves. The PNS pre- and post-ganglionic neurons are generally cholinergic via nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, respectively. Created with Biorender.com.

The SNS is colloquially responsible for the "fight-or-flight" adaptive framework, generally geared towards preparing the body for the identification of and response to dangerous environments and stimuli. Beyond this acute transient extreme, its baseline action maintains homeostatic function of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, along with roles in temperature regulation, thirst, satiety, digestion, micturition, and reproductive processes. SNS preganglionic neuronal cell bodies are located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord from T1 to L2/4 and extend axons out to synapse with extra-spinal post-ganglionic neurons that then innervate target sites. The SNS uses acetylcholine (ACh) with nicotinic receptors at the pre-/post-ganglionic neuron synapse. The post-ganglionic neurons of the SNS then release catecholamines (predominantly norepinephrine (NE), but notably dopamine in the kidneys and epinephrine (Epi) at the adrenal medulla) and non-classical neurotransmitters such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) at the target sites, with the exception of ACh in the case of sweat gland innervation.

### The autonomic nervous system and heart failure [^112ZRLoa]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) is characterized by hemodynamic abnormalities that result in neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. Alterations in receptor activation from this autonomic imbalance may have profound effects on cardiac function and structure. Inhibition of the sympathetic drive to the heart through β-receptor blockade has become a standard component of therapy for HF with a dilated left ventricle because of its effectiveness in inhibiting the ventricular structural remodeling process and in prolonging life. Several devices for selective modulation of sympathetic and vagal activity have recently been developed in an attempt to alter the natural history of HF. The optimal counteraction of the excessive sympathetic activity is still unclear. A profound decrease in adrenergic support with excessive blockade of the sympathetic nervous system may result in adverse outcomes in clinical HF. In this review, we analyze the data supporting a contributory role of the autonomic functional alterations on the course of HF, the techniques used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, the evidence for clinical effectiveness of pharmacological and device interventions, and the potential future role of autonomic nervous system modifiers in the management of this syndrome.

### Renal autonomic dynamics in hypertension: how can we evaluate sympathetic activity for renal denervation? [^114VPUsy]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

This review explores the various pathophysiological factors influencing antihypertensive effects, involving the regulation of vascular resistance, plasma volume, cardiac function, and the autonomic nervous system, emphasizing the interconnected processes regulating blood pressure (BP). The kidney's pivotal role in BP control and its potential contribution to hypertension is complicated but important to understand the effective mechanisms of renal denervation (RDN), which may be a promising treatment for resistant hypertension. Excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) can elevate BP through various physiological changes, contributing to chronic hypertension. Renal sympathetic efferent nerve activation leads to elevated norepinephrine levels and subsequent cascading effects on vasoconstriction, renin release, and sodium reabsorption. RDN reduces BP in resistant hypertension by potentially disrupting sensory afferent nerves, decreasing feedback activation to the central nervous system, and reducing efferent sympathetic nerve activity in the heart and other structures. RDN may also modulate central sympathetic outflow and inhibit renal renin-angiotensin system overactivation. While evidence for RDN efficacy in hypertension is increasing, accurate patient selection becomes crucial, considering complex interactions that vary among patients. This review also discusses methods to evaluate autonomic nerve activity from the golden standard to new potential examination for finding out optimization in stimulation parameters or rigorous patient selection based on appropriate biomarkers.

### Clinical study of droxidopa in patients with neurogenic orthostatic… [^115JGFZJ]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview Systolic blood pressure is transiently and minimally decreased in healthy individuals upon standing. Normal physiologic feedback mechanisms work through neurally-mediated pathways to maintain the standing blood pressure, and thus maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. The compensatory mechanisms that regulate blood pressure upon standing are dysfunctional in subjects with orthostatic hypotension, a condition that may lead to inadequate cerebral perfusion with accompanying symptoms of syncope, dizziness or lightheadedness, unsteadiness and blurred or impaired vision, among other symptoms. The autonomic nervous system has a central role in the regulation of blood pressure. Primary Autonomic Failure is manifested in a variety of syndromes. Orthostatic hypotension is a usual presenting symptom.

Primary Autonomic Failure may be the primary diagnosis, and classifications include pure autonomic failure, also called idiopathic orthostatic hypotension autonomic failure with multiple system atrophy and also Parkinson's disease. Regardless of the primary condition, autonomic dysfunction underlies orthostatic hypotension. The current withdrawal design study will measure the efficacy of droxidopa on symptoms of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients randomized to continued droxidopa treatment versus placebo, following 14 days of double-blind treatment. droxidopa. It has been approved for use in Japan since 1989. Droxidopa has been shown to improve symptoms of orthostatic hypotension that result from a variety of conditions including Shy Drager syndrome, Pure Autonomic Failure, and Parkinson's disease.

There are four stereoisomers of DOPS; however, only the L-threo-enantiomer is biologically active. The exact mechanism of action of droxidopa in the treatment of symptomatic NOH has not been precisely defined; however, its NE replenishing properties with concomitant recovery of decreased noradrenergic activity are considered to be of major importance. Droxidopa has been marketed in Japan since 1989. Data from clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance programs conducted in Japan show that the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions with droxidopa are increased blood pressure, nausea, and headache. In clinical studies, the prevalence and severity of droxidopa adverse effects appear to be similar to those reported by the placebo control arm.

### Cardiac autonomic innervation [^1157zDm9]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system plays a key role in regulating changes in the cardiovascular system and its adaptation to various human body functions. The sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system is associated with the fight and flight response, while the parasympathetic division is responsible for the restorative effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Disorders involving these two divisions can lead to, and are seen as, a manifestation of most common cardiovascular disorders. Over the last few decades, extensive research has been performed establishing imaging techniques to quantify the autonomic dysfunction associated with various cardiovascular disorders. Additionally, several techniques have been tested with variable success in modulating the cardiac autonomic nervous system as treatment for these disorders. In this review, we summarize basic anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system including adrenergic receptors. We have also discussed several imaging modalities available to aid in diagnosis of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and autonomic modulation techniques, including pharmacologic and device-based therapies, that have been or are being tested currently.

### The sympathetic nervous system in heart failure physiology, pathophysiology, and clinical implications [^113Droyx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a syndrome characterized initially by left ventricular dysfunction that triggers countermeasures aimed to restore cardiac output. These responses are compensatory at first but eventually become part of the disease process itself leading to further worsening cardiac function. Among these responses is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that provides inotropic support to the failing heart increasing stroke volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain mean arterial perfusion pressure, but eventually accelerates disease progression affecting survival. Activation of SNS has been attributed to withdrawal of normal restraining influences and enhancement of excitatory inputs including changes in: 1) peripheral baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes; 2) chemical mediators that control sympathetic outflow; and 3) central integratory sites. The interface between the sympathetic fibers and the cardiovascular system is formed by the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Dysregulation of cardiac beta(1)-AR signaling and transduction are key features of heart failure progression. In contrast, cardiac beta(2)-ARs and alpha(1)-ARs may function in a compensatory fashion to maintain cardiac inotropy. Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may have an impact on the adaptive mechanisms, susceptibilities, and pharmacological responses of SNS. The beta-AR blockers and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis form the mainstay of current medical management of chronic heart failure. Conversely, central sympatholytics have proved harmful, whereas sympathomimetic inotropes are still used in selected patients with hemodynamic instability. This review summarizes the changes in SNS in heart failure and examines how modulation of SNS activity may affect morbidity and mortality from this syndrome.

### Sympathetic neural activity in hypertension and related diseases [^114Nft7Q]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Several hemodynamic variables, such as blood pressure, vascular resistance, cardiac output, and heart rate, are regulated, among others, by sympathetic cardiovascular influences. This has led many years ago investigators to advance the hypothesis that alterations in the sympathetic modulation of the cardiovascular system may occur in hypertension and related disease.

Methods

The role of the sympathetic nervous system as promoter and amplifier of the hypertensive state has been examined in a consistent number of studies carried out by making use of sophisticated and sensitive approaches to evaluate adrenergic function, such as the norepinephrine spillover technique and the recording of efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic-nerve traffic.

Results

The results of the above-mentioned investigations support the concept that adrenergic activation characterizes essential hypertension, correlating with the clinical severity of the disease. Furthermore, sympathetic cardiovascular influences may favor the hypertensive disease progression, by concurring with other hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic factors at the development of target organ damage. Finally, an adrenergic overdrive of pronounced degree also characterizes hypertension-related cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In several of these clinical conditions, the adrenergic overdrive plays a role in the disease's physiopathology and prognosis.

Conclusions

The data reviewed in this article provide evidence that sympathetic activation represents a hallmark of the essential hypertensive state. They further show that adrenergic neural factors may participate at the development and progression of the hypertensive state and its complications. This represents the rationale for the use of antihypertensive and, in more in general, cardiovascular drugs capable to exert sympatho-inhibitory effects.

### Sympathetic blocks for sympathetic pain [^115eeFD4]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an integral component of the body's response to stress. Once activated, the SNS has broad-reaching effects on multiple organ systems that modulate pain, behavior, and mood. Blockade of the system can improve pain associated with multiple etiologies, including vascular, visceral, and neuropathic pain. Multiple techniques are available to block the SNS and provide options that improve analgesia and can be individualized to a particular patient's needs and disease state.

### Molecular and functional diversity of the autonomic nervous system [^112D9C9L]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a pivotal role in regulating organ functions through descending brain-to-body signalling. The pathways involved are broadly categorized into two major branches: the sympathetic nervous system, which mediates 'fight or flight' responses, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which governs 'rest and digest' functions. Historically, the ANS was considered to mediate simple motor functions with limited neurochemical diversity. However, recent advances in neurotechnology have shown that brain-to-body communication is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. This review synthesizes current knowledge about the molecular, anatomical and functional diversity of autonomic motor neurons. Here we present a comparative analysis of the cellular architecture of the ANS and the suggested roles of distinct neuron populations. Additionally, we explore the emerging view that the ANS interacts with diverse systems involving metabolism, immunology and ageing, which extends its role beyond simple brain-organ modulation. Finally, we emphasize the need for cell-type-specific and longitudinal studies of the ANS to uncover novel mechanisms underlying body-brain interactions and to identify new translational opportunities for therapeutic interventions.

### Nerves in bone: evolving concepts in pain and anabolism [^114F2k98]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

NE

NE is the canonical neurotransmitter of postganglionic noradrenergic sympathetic nerves. Adrenergic receptors (ARs) including β 1, β 2, α 1B, α 2A, α 2B, and α 2C, have been detected in osteoblast lineage cells, 27, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114 and β 2, α 2A, α 2B, and α 2C are expressed in osteoclast lineage cells. 111 There is an abundance of pharmacological agents targeting ARs owing to their therapeutic value against life‐threatening conditions such as hypertension, asthma, and cardiac arrest. 115 Thus, these drugs have been exploited to great lengths for mechanistic studies into noradrenergic influence on bone and the potential for their use to improve bone mass, and are thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. 116 The effects of sympathetic signaling through NE have been extensively studied following the discovery of the central leptin‐sympathetic outflow‐bone axis (reviewed in Elefteriou and colleagues 117). Briefly, bone mass is increased by genetically disrupting the noradrenergic signaling axis, either by knockout of the NE‐synthetic enzyme dopamine β‐hydroxylase or β 2 ‐AR. 27, 118 Mechanistically, sympathetic activity induces osteopenia as a result of activation of the β 2 ‐AR on osteoblasts, which suppresses osteoblast proliferation and promotes release of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis. 27, 113, 118 Although chronic stimulation of sympathetic outflow may have detrimental effects on bone, β 2 ‐AR signaling in osteoblasts and osteocytes also disrupts their capacity to maintain the endosteal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) niche; and thus, upon physiological activation can positively regulate hematopoiesis. 110, 119 In the context of cancer, both progression and metastasis are associated with chronic stress, a condition that stimulates sympathetic outflow. 120, 121, 122 In bone metastasis, sympathetic signaling via activation of β 2 ‐AR on osteoblasts leads directly to cancer cell recruitment and indirectly to vascular changes that promote colonization of metastatic cancer cells in the bone marrow. 121, 123, 124 Last, NE uptake by bone and immune cells may also contribute to extraneuronal control of local NE homeostasis and actions on the skeleton. 56, 125, 126

### Role of epinephrine in acute stress [^114N8iQa]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article presents the likely pathway of stimuli generated by the recognition of high-intensity stressors to ultimately produce a fight-or-flight response. A key element is the recognition that psychological stressors that do not directly alter the internal environment represent the most important etiology of a fight-or-flight response. Adrenomedullary secretion is a critical component of that response; impromptu stimulation of the adrenal medulla can produce plasma epinephrine concentrations greater than 10,000 pg/mL. When these plasma levels reach the hypothalamus to act on the CNS, the result is facilitation of the decision making, and decision execution processes (fight-or-flight), and perhaps further sympathetic stimulation and vasopressin release. Subjects with underlying cardiovascular and/or metabolic pathology may be particularly susceptible to potentially lethal reactions to this neuroendocrine response. Additionally, since this biological reaction may be triggered by sudden changes in the social environment, the coordinated actions of epinephrine, sympathetic stimulation and vasopressin must be directed at not only optimizing the chances for survival, but also at attaining maximal preservation of the individual environmental and social domains.

### RCAN1 links impaired neurotrophin trafficking to aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system in down syndrome [^113GPA61]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Down syndrome, a disorder that affects multiple tissues and results in delayed development and intellectual disability, is thought to originate from increased dosage of gene products encoded by human chromosome 21 (refs). To date, investigations of anomalies in the nervous system in Down syndrome have predominantly focused on the central nervous system (CNS) where cognitive impairment has been proposed to stem, in part, from abnormal brain development and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. However, individuals with Down syndrome also exhibit marked dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, the molecular and cellular bases of which remain undefined. The sympathetic nervous system is a branch of the autonomic nervous system that is essential for organ homeostasis. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons innervate diverse peripheral organs and tissues to govern fundamental physiological processes including regulation of blood glucose levels, cardiac output and body temperature. An emergent concept is that a dysfunctional sympathetic nervous system might be an instigating factor in the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure and diabetes, diseases that are more prevalent in individuals with Down syndrome than in the general population. In addition, individuals with Down syndrome have blunted cardiovascular responses to autonomic tasks including stress and exercise tests, and reduced secretion of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine. Notably, impaired autonomic regulation of heart rate and blood pressure in the absence of congenital heart defects has been observed in Down syndrome. Autonomic dysfunction in Down syndrome has been associated with reduced physical work capacity and chronic incompetence, manifested as attenuated heart rate responses to exercise. In particular, chronotropic incompetence has been postulated to be predictive of coronary heart disease and early mortality. Although impaired autonomic functions are manifested in infants and young children with Down syndrome, it remains unknown whether functional deficits originate, in part, from aberrant development of the sympathetic nervous system.

Advances in autonomic nervous system (ANS) research in recent years have led to numerous discoveries that have initiated a return of this classic discipline back to the center stage of health and disease. At the same time, a number of challenges and knowledge gaps have been recognized to clarify the role of the ANS in cardiopulmonary diseases and to leverage ANS science for human therapy. As such, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in partnership with the Office of Strategic Coordination of the Office of the National Institutes of Health Director, convened a workshop on "Autonomic Neural Mechanisms of Cardiopulmonary Regulation" September 2 to 3, 2020. The workshop executive summary and conference recording can be found at. The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary and international group of experts in basic, translational, and clinical research in neuroscience and cardiopulmonary disorders, and more than 200 representatives of multiple federal and nonfederal agencies and academic institutions.

The premise of the workshop was driven by a need to articulate gaps and research priorities specific to the ANS — the latter responsible for regulation of cardiac, vascular, and pulmonary physiology via maintaining a balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs to the heart, vasculature, and lungs in response to stimuli. The ANS plays a key role in the development and progression of cardiopulmonary disease and in sleep and circadian rhythm pathophysiology. To this end, ANS-targeted interventions have been developed to target ANS impairment. This includes pharmacologic therapies directed toward modulation of sympathetic nervous system activation such as beta-blockers, while recognizing limitations of off-target action and long-term side effects. Nonpharmacologic interventions such as vagal nerve stimulation, renal and carotid body denervation, and stellectomy are other options; however, they are invasive, expensive, and also associated with side effects. Furthermore, there are limitations with human model systems including heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), plasma catecholamines, and noradrenaline spillover that can have limitations in terms of largescale implementation, can be confounded in certain states such as heart failure (HF), and have age- and sex-specific influences that need to be considered. The overarching conceptual framework of opportunities presented in this report is characterized by a better understanding of the complex, hierarchical neural networks in health and cardiopulmonary disease to develop more sophisticated tools and interventions to inform ANS research discovery and interventional studies (Central Illustration).

### The sympathetic nervous system alterations in human hypertension [^111TcRv6]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Several articles have dealt with the importance and mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system alterations in experimental animal models of hypertension. This review addresses the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology and therapy of human hypertension. We first discuss the strengths and limitations of various techniques for assessing the sympathetic nervous system in humans, with a focus on heart rate, plasma norepinephrine, microneurographic recording of sympathetic nerve traffic, and measurements of radiolabeled norepinephrine spillover. We then examine the evidence supporting the importance of neuroadrenergic factors as promoters and amplifiers of human hypertension. We expand on the role of the sympathetic nervous system in 2 increasingly common forms of secondary hypertension, namely hypertension associated with obesity and with renal disease. With this background, we examine interventions of sympathetic deactivation as a mode of antihypertensive treatment. Particular emphasis is given to the background and results of recent therapeutic approaches based on carotid baroreceptor stimulation and radiofrequency ablation of the renal nerves.

### The role of the locus coeruleus / norepinephrine system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders: an update [^114LCr3d]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to provide an update on current and emerging knowledge of the neuropathological processes affecting the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) system, their effect on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease symptomatology, including efforts to translate these notions into therapeutic actions targeting the noradrenergic system.

Recent Findings

Over the past 2 years, work from multiple groups has contributed to support an early role of locus coeruleus degeneration and/or hyperactivation in the neurodegenerative process, including a trigger of neuroinflammation. Imaging advances are allowing the quantification of locus coeruleus structural features in vivo, which is critical in the early stages of disease. Nonmotor and noncognitive symptoms, often secondary to the involvement of the LC/NE system, are becoming more important in the definition of these diseases and their treatment.

Summary

The diverse symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which is not limited to cardinal motor and cognitive abnormalities, strongly suggests a multisystem neurodegenerative process. In this context, it is increasingly clear how the LC/NE system plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the neurodegenerative process.

### The sympathetic control of blood pressure [^114uKGif]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypertension - the chronic elevation of blood pressure - is a major human health problem. In most cases, the root cause of the disease remains unknown, but there is mounting evidence that many forms of hypertension are initiated and maintained by an elevated sympathetic tone. This review examines how the sympathetic tone to cardiovascular organs is generated, and discusses how elevated sympathetic tone can contribute to hypertension.

### Obesity: a neuroimmunometabolic perspective [^112u8DuS]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Neuroimmunology and immunometabolism are burgeoning topics of study, but the intersection of these two fields is scarcely considered. This interplay is particularly prevalent within adipose tissue, where immune cells and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have an important role in metabolic homeostasis and pathology, namely in obesity. In the present Review, we first outline the established reciprocal adipose-SNS relationship comprising the neuroendocrine loop facilitated primarily by adipose tissue-derived leptin and SNS-derived noradrenaline. Next, we review the extensive crosstalk between adipocytes and resident innate immune cells as well as the changes that occur in these secretory and signalling pathways in obesity. Finally, we discuss the effect of SNS adrenergic signalling in immune cells and conclude with exciting new research demonstrating an immutable role for SNS-resident macrophages in modulating SNS-adipose crosstalk. We posit that the latter point constitutes the existence of a new field - neuroimmunometabolism.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

Data reviewed in this paper document the continuous interest of clinicians and investigators for defining the sympathetic abnormalities characterizing the hypertensive state together with their impact on cardiovascular risk profile, target organ damage, and clinical outcome. Directions for future research in the area include an in-depth analysis of (i) the pathophysiological link between genetic background and the neurogenic abnormalities characterizing hypertension, (ii) the crosstalks between the immune system and the sympathetic neural function, and (iii) the potential impact of antihypertensive combination drug treatment on the neuroadrenergic function, with a specific analysis of what this may mean for the impact of the so-called "residual sympathetic activation" on the residual cardiovascular risk.

### Central and peripheral neural circuits regulating glucose homeostasis [^115sAvMD]. NPJ Biomedical Innovations (2025). Medium credibility.

Sympathetic nervous system

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a key driver of glucose mobilization. While the sympathetic nervous system is well known to be activated by stressors to elicit the "fight or flight" response, activity in the SNS is also modulated by nutrient signals, particularly hypoglycemia. As well as its actions at the adrenal to elicit the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, SNS activity results in release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides such as norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y, and ATP within metabolic organs. These neurotransmitters/peptides act locally to modify cell function.

Sympathetic activation stimulates hepatic glucose production through both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. These actions are primarily via the actions of norepinephrine on hepatocyte adrenergic receptors. In addition, sympathetic activation increases liver blood flow. There is some evidence that SNS activity also modulates immune function in the liver. Epinephrine infusion into isolated rat liver promoted IL6 cytokine and blunted TNF responses to lipopolysaccharide. However, low sympathetic activity reduced hepatic natural killer T cells and increased hepatic cytokine production in mice.

In the pancreas, ex vivo studies examining the effects of neurotransmitters and in vivo studies using targeted neuromodulation suggest that SNS activity increases glucagon release and suppresses insulin secretion to increase blood glucose. Experimental stimulation of pancreas-projecting sympathetic neurons impaired glucose tolerance, while their inhibition improved it, underscoring their critical role in glucose homeostasis. SNS activity also results in vasoconstriction resulting in reduced blood flow to the islet –. In the immune system, islet macrophages express adrenergic receptors, and norepinephrine has dose-dependent effects, with reduced expression of T helper 1 and increased expression of T helper 2 cytokines at high NE concentrations while low NE concentrations had the opposite effect.

Sympathetic innervation also extends to white and brown adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, sympathetic tone induced thermogenesis in brown fat while sympathetic activity increased lipolysis and transition of white to brown adipocytes ("beiging") in WAT. In addition, SNS activation inhibited adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. In brown adipose tissue, sympathetic activation increased glucose uptake and thermogenesis, contributing to energy expenditure and metabolic flexibility. Sympathetic activation in adipose tissue increases innate lymphoid cells that may contribute to beiging. This, in turn, may also recruit eosinophils producing nerve growth factor to adipose tissue resulting in increased sympathetic innervation.

### The sympathetic nervous system and the metabolic syndrome [^112u9T6W]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Studies performed in the past two decades have unequivocally shown that several of the components of the metabolic syndrome are associated with indirect and direct markers of adrenergic overdrive. This is the case for hypertension and obesity, in which resting tachycardia, elevated plasma norepinephrine values, increased sympathetic nerve traffic, as well as augmented levels of total and regional norepinephrine spillover have been reported. This is also the case for insulin resistance, i.e. a metabolic condition frequently complicating the various components of the pathological condition identified as the 'metabolic syndrome'. After briefly describing the epidemiological and the cardiovascular risk profile of the disease, this paper will examine the behaviour of the sympathetic nervous system in the metabolic syndrome as well as the mechanisms potentially responsible for this neurogenic abnormality. This will be followed by an analysis of the role played by neuroadrenergic factors in disease progression as well as in the pathogenesis of its complications. Finally, the therapeutic implications of these findings will be highlighted.

### Neuropathology of stress [^111ce7TF]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Importantly, physiological 'stress' responses also occur following rewarding, "positive" and appetitive stimuli (e.g. winning a competition, sexual activity). Although they are often not considered to be stressors in classic, generally "negative", terms, the physiological responses elicited by them can be as large as those seen after more aversive stimuli. For the purpose of definition, a stressor in the context of this review will refer to any environmental demand that exceeds the physiological regulatory capacity of an organism, in particular during situations of unpredictability and uncontrollability. They are characterized by the absence of an anticipatory response (unpredictable), or a reduced recovery (uncontrollable) of the neuroendocrine reactions to stress. Taken together, depending on the type of stressor, various signals converge to orchestrate an integrated stress response that 'resets' many peripheral and central processes and allow an individual to adapt to the changes in its environment and thus to restore homeostasis.

The physiological stress response can be divided into two different time domains with a very quick response and a delayed response. The first phase of the stress response is considered the "alarm reaction" or the "fight-fright-or-flight" response, which involves the rapid activation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that causes the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. These hormones quickly elevate basal metabolic rate, blood pressure and respiration, and increase blood flow to the more vital organs that are essential for the "fight-or-flight" response, such as the heart and skeletal muscles. At a later stage, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is activated as well. In this classic neuroendocrine circuit, limbic and hypothalamic brain structures coordinate emotional, cognitive, neuroendocrine and autonomic inputs, which together determine the magnitude and specificity of an individual's behavioral, neural and hormonal responses to stress.

### Is It time to abandon the kidney-centered view on the origin of primary hypertension? [^117MP8xc]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Sympathetic Nervous System

Substantial evidence suggests that primary hypertension is accompanied by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation through multiple studies. Indeed, studies using drugs that block cardiac sympathetic effects have shown that a significant subset of borderline hypertensive patients exhibit increased neuroadrenergic drive, evidenced by elevated heart rates. Then, meta-analyses of over 100 studies report that, despite some negative findings, venous plasma norepinephrine — an indirect marker of sympathetic tone — is significantly elevated in hypertensive compared with normotensive individuals. Furthermore, by subtracting norepinephrine clearance from norepinephrine plasma values, Australian researchers demonstrated increased norepinephrine spillover from sympathetic neuroeffector junctions in primary hypertension, particularly in younger patients. This is true particularly at the level of the kidney, the heart, and the central nervous system — that is, in 3 cardiovascular areas of major importance in homeostasis, regulation of circulation as well as in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Finally, direct intraneural microneurographic recordings of postganglionic efferent sympathetic nerve activity to skeletal muscle confirm the crucial role of sympathetic overactivity in hypertension, which may not be limited to primary forms but also to hypertension secondary to primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, and BP-amplifying conditions like obesity.

Synthesizing the results obtained via the various methodological approaches mentioned above, the role of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension development can be summarized as follows. First, the sympathetic activation occurring in primary hypertension is an early phenomenon in the clinical course of the disease detectable in different BP phenotypes, including hypertension of the elderly and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Second, the neurogenic alteration parallels the disease progression, becoming more evident from mild to moderate and more severe hypertensive states, including therapy-resistant hypertension and malignant hypertension. Third, while sympathetic overactivity is generally not observed in most secondary forms of hypertension, exceptions include cases of renal artery stenosis and end-stage kidney disease, where SNS hyperactivity has been shown to sustain hypertension despite intensive antihypertensive measures. Finally, SNS overactivation contributes to the development and progression of target organ damage, particularly affecting the heart and kidneys. Specifically, kidney dysfunction can amplify adrenergic activation, which, in turn, exerts deleterious effects that accelerate renal disease progression. In extreme hypertensive states, including malignant hypertension, renal ischemia caused by increased sympathetic outflow to the renal vasculature — leading to vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and tubulointerstitial injury — activates the RAAS and triggers reflex sympathetic activation. This creates a vicious cycle in which ischemia further enhances SNS activity, exacerbating renal vasoconstriction and damage.

### Neuroimmune control of inflammation in acute kidney injury and multiorgan dysfunction [^113xL2MV]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The nervous and immune systems engage in critical bidirectional communication that influences both physiological regulation and disease progression. This review discusses the neuroimmune axis and its role in controlling inflammation in acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiorgan dysfunction. Central to this regulation is the inflammatory reflex pathway, which consists of sensory afferent and motor efferent arcs. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) suppresses inflammation via vagus nerve activation, norepinephrine release, and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signaling in macrophages. Inflammatory mediators activate the afferent vagus nerve, transmitting signals to the brain initiating an anti-inflammatory response. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and pulsed ultrasound (pUS) activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and attenuate inflammation and protect against AKI. Specifically, pulsed ultrasound prior to kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) reduces inflammation and preserves renal function in a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway-dependent manner. Beyond the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, other organ systems receive direct vagal innervation and stimulation of these pathways leads to an anti-inflammatory effect and organ protection. Multiorgan neuroimmune communications, including lung-kidney interactions and the liver-brain-gut axis are discussed, emphasizing their relevance in systemic inflammatory conditions. The role of the inflammatory reflex pathway in sepsis is addressed, emphasizing its potential to modulate the dysregulated immune response contributing to multiorgan failure. Finally, the discussion covers the role of the sympathetic nervous system, particularly renal sympathetic nerve activity, in modulating renal function and inflammation in AKI. Understanding and targeting these neural circuits may offer novel therapeutic strategies for AKI and related conditions.

### Sympathetic augmentation in hypertension: role of nerve firing, norepinephrine reuptake, and angiotensin neuromodulation [^111Ve4q7]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that essential hypertension is commonly neurogenic and is initiated and sustained by sympathetic nervous system overactivity. Potential mechanisms include increased central sympathetic outflow, altered norepinephrine (NE) neuronal reuptake, diminished arterial baroreflex dampening of sympathetic nerve traffic, and sympathetic neuromodulation by angiotensin II. To address this issue, we used microneurography and radiotracer dilution methodology to measure regional sympathetic activity in 22 hypertensive patients and 11 normotensive control subjects. The NE transport inhibitor desipramine was infused to directly assess the potential role of impaired neuronal NE reuptake. To evaluate possible angiotensin sympathetic neuromodulation, the relation of arterial and coronary sinus plasma concentrations of angiotensin II to sympathetic activity was investigated. Hypertensive patients displayed increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity and elevated total systemic, cardiac, and renal NE spillover. Cardiac neuronal NE reuptake was decreased in hypertensive subjects. In response to desipramine, both the reduction of fractional transcardiac 3[H]NE extraction and the increase in cardiac NE spillover were less pronounced in hypertensive patients. DNA sequencing analysis of the NE transporter gene revealed no mutations that could account for reduced transporter activity. Arterial baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve traffic was not diminished in hypertensive subjects. Angiotensin II plasma concentrations were similar in both groups and were not related to indexes of sympathetic activation. Increased rates of sympathetic nerve firing and reduced neuronal NE reuptake both contribute to sympathetic activation in hypertension, whereas a role for dampened arterial baroreflex restraint on sympathetic nerve traffic and a peripheral neuromodulating influence of angiotensin II appear to be excluded.

### Noradrenergic dysfunction and the psychopharmacology of posttraumatic stress disorder [^115TrQDS]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The catecholamine norepinephrine is a critical effector of the mammalian stress response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-a syndrome intrinsically related to the experience of extraordinary stress. Symptom-linked hypernoradrenergic derangements have been observed in PTSD and several studies have examined the potential therapeutic effects of agents that dampen the centrally hyperactive noradrenergic state. These agents include compounds that decrease norepinephrine release (e.g. centrally acting alpha(2) agonists such as clonidine) and those which block post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors (e.g. centrally acting alpha(1) or beta receptor antagonists such as prazosin or propranolol). In this article, we review studies of central noreadrenergic hyperactivity under both basal and challenge conditions and explore the evidence for these derangements as potential psychopharmacologic targets in patients with PTSD. Given the significant involvement of CNS norepinephrine hyperactivity in PTSD, and its link to intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms, it is not surprising that interventions directed at this system have therapeutic potential in PTSD. The utility of these anti-adrenergics in the clinical treatment of PTSD remains to be determined, though it is possible that they may prove to have primary roles in a disorder that is only modestly responsive to antidepressant treatment.

### Distinct binding conformations of epinephrine with α-and β-adrenergic receptors [^114xneXK]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the sympathetic nervous system, endogenous epinephrine and norepinephrine regulate various physiological functions by activating adrenergic receptors (ARs). There are nine distinct AR subtypes in humans: α 1A, α 1B, α 1D, α 2A, α 2B, α 2C, β 1, β 2, and β 3. Three distinct genes that encode α 2 -AR subtypes have been identified. Mouse genetic studies with individual α 2 -AR gene deletions have shown distinct and overlapping physiological functions. While α 2A -ARs decrease sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, α 2B -ARs increase blood pressure. Both α 2A -AR and α 2C -AR are needed to regulate neurotransmitter release. α 2 -AR agonists are used to treat hypertension, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other diseases –. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α 2 -AR agonist used for prolonged sedation in hospitalized patients, procedural sedation and general anesthesia and treating emergence delirium –. The pharmacological blockade of α 2A -AR by a clinically used antagonist reduces Alzheimer's disease-related pathology and improves cognitive deficits in an Alzheimer's disease transgenic model. All ARs belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. α 2 -ARs are Gi-coupled GPCRs that can inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease intracellular cAMP levels.

Epinephrine is a hormone and is produced primarily by the chromaffin cells of adrenal glands. The release of epinephrine is triggered by stress and plays major roles in fight-or-flight responses by increasing blood flow to muscles, heart output, the pupil dilation response, and blood sugar levels by binding to α- and β-ARs. Epinephrine activates the β 1 -AR–Gs signaling pathway to increase cardiac output, whereas it stimulates the α 2A -AR–Gi signaling pathway to decrease blood pressure. Surprisingly, other than the epinephrine–α 1A -AR–Gq structure we recently identified, little structural information is available for epinephrine bound to a GPCR–G-protein complex. There are two structures of epinephrine bound to β 1 -AR or β 2 -AR alone with the nanobody 6B9, which stabilizes β-ARs in an active state. Epinephrine binds β 1 -AR and β 2 -AR in an identical manner.

### Decatecholaminisation during sepsis [^115DW63F]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The syndrome is characterised by autonomic dysfunction and increased plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline. These catecholamines originate mainly from the activated sympathetic nervous system, but also originate from the adrenal gland, gut, and immune cells. While necessary and life-saving in the early fight or flight reaction to any insult, prolonged adrenergic stress is detrimental and contributes to organ dysfunction. Strategies to reduce adrenergic stress have been proposed (Table 1) under the umbrella term decatecholaminisation.

Table 1
Decatecholaminisation strategies for patients with septic shock

Evidence and class of recommendations vary between the different interventions

Esmolol (Table 2) is a short-acting cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic blocker which has been tested in septic animals and in preliminary studies in human sepsis. In the largest trial to date, Morelli et al. enrolled septic shock patients with tachycardia (> 95 beats/min) and an ongoing requirement for high-dose norepinephrine despite 24 h of active resuscitation. In this high-risk population (28-day mortality of 80.5% in the control group), esmolol titrated to control heart rate was both safe and efficacious, reducing mortality to 49.4%. The observed decrease in norepinephrine requirements could be mediated by a blunted immune response, resulting in an improved microcirculation, or enhanced adrenergic receptor sensitivity.

### Dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease: neurocardiological abnormalities [^112wAn48]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of abnormal autonomic-nervous-system function occur commonly in Parkinson's disease (PD). Orthostatic hypotension in patients with parkinsonism has been thought to be a side-effect of treatment with levodopa, a late stage in the disease progression, or, if prominent and early with respect to disordered movement, an indication of a different disease, such as multiple system atrophy. Instead, patients with PD and orthostatic hypotension have clear evidence for baroreflex failure and loss of sympathetic innervation, most noticeably in the heart. By contrast, patients with multiple system atrophy, which is difficult to distinguish clinically from PD, have intact cardiac sympathetic innervation. Post-mortem studies confirm this distinction. Because PD involves postganglionic sympathetic noradrenergic lesions, the disease seems to be not only a movement disorder with dopamine loss in the nigrostriatal system of the brain, but also a dysautonomia, with norepinephrine loss in the sympathetic nervous system of the heart.

### Biological embedding of childhood adversity: from physiological mechanisms to clinical implications [^114YD4XU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Autonomic axis

In response to stress, amygdala signaling initiates sympathetic activation via the brainstem, terminating in adrenergic signals to end organs (e.g. liver, heart, digestive tract, and pancreas) and induction of adrenal medullary epinephrine/norepinephrine release producing the prototypical "fight or flight" response. The parasympathetic branch exerts countervailing control, and dynamic sympathetic-parasympathetic balance shapes overall stress physiology. Experimental animal models and observational human studies have consistently linked ELA to autonomic dysregulation, including both hyper- and hypo-responsiveness of sympathetic or parasympathetic pathways. Imbalance in either sympathetic- or parasympathetic-dominant directions again represent manifestations of excess allostatic load and predict stress-related diseases, including heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and psychopathologies. Pathology associations may differ by pattern of autonomic imbalance. Several studies, for instance, found that attenuated sympathetic reactivity correlated with antisocial behavior with callous-unemotional traits in ELA-exposed boys, while heightened reactivity correlated with antisocial behavior without callous-unemotional traits. Such findings remain exploratory, and the direction of causal links, if present, is unclear. Among few studies specifically examining mechanisms of autonomic changes, one found that volumetric changes in the amygdala, hippocampus, and PFC statistically mediated autonomic changes as well as risk of psychopathology. Overlapping regulation by corticolimbic structures and core molecular mediators (e.g. CRF) suggests that some HPA-related alterations may also impact autonomic functioning.

### The neuroimmune response during stress: a physiological perspective [^116o3MW5]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

The SNS is a central neuronal mediator of the stress response. Sympathetic fibers reach all immune organs and the preganglionic cholinergic innervation to the adrenal gland (sympathetic–adrenal–medullary axis; SAM), inducing secretion of catecholamines adrenaline, and NA. These catecholamines are secreted directly into the bloodstream and are thereby delivered to the entire organism. In contrast to this systemic response, sympathetic fibers individually target almost every tissue in the body, including all primary and secondary lymphoid organs. The sympathetic fibers at one tissue can be activated independently of fibers at another site, locally releasing NA. This innervation of the lymphoid organs is dynamic, and it has been shown for example that chronic stress increases the sympathetic innervation to the lymph nodes.

The local innervations also allow a corrective response to be initiated that is relevant to the specific stressors. Thus, for example, heat or cold stress, requires adaptation of the brown fat tissue to restore the temperature imbalance, while a scary sight requires adaptation of the cardiovascular system to allow effective escape, or priming of the immune system to promote tissue healing. Such specificity in regulating the different organs is enabled by sympathetic fibers that can be differentially activated in the cardiovascular system, the adipose tissue and the spleen, in response to different physical stressors. Moreover, differences can be observed in the sympathetic activity of nerve fibers that innervate cells in the adrenal medulla that secrete adrenaline vs noradrenaline. The differential activity can be regulated at multiple levels, either at the target site itself, the spinal cord or the brain, but all signals must be synchronized to execute an orchestrated response.

### Sympathetic activation in hypertension: importance of the central nervous system [^112PYoTe]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The central nervous system (CNS) organizes the sympathetic outflow and various inputs from the periphery. The brain renin-angiotensin system has been studied in various regions involved in controlling sympathetic outflow. Recent progress in cardiovascular research, particularly in vascular biology and neuroscience, as well as in traditional physiological approaches, has advanced the field of the neural control of hypertension in which the CNS plays a vital role. Cardiovascular research relating to hypertension has focused on the roles of nitric oxide, oxidative stress, inflammation, and immunity, and the network among various organs, including the heart, kidney, spleen, gut, and vasculature. The CNS mechanisms are similarly networked with these factors and are widely studied in neuroscience. In this review, I describe the development of the conceptual flow of this network in the field of hypertension on the basis of several important original research articles and discuss potential future breakthroughs leading to clinical precision medicine.

### Ambroxol for the treatment of fibromyalgia: science or fiction? [^112Xai7R]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Sympathetic nervous system, glia, and dopamine

Sympathetic nervous system

One indication of sympathetic nervous system involvement in FMS was detected in a subgroup of obese female FMS patients by Okifuji et al. They found a strong correlation between body-mass index and levels of the sympathomimetic epinephrine and IL6. The latter agent is reduced by ambroxol. Investigations into heart-rate variability have shown persistent excessive sympathetic activity in FMS. Norepinephrine injections can induce FMS pain.

In 2009, Martinez-Lavin and Solanopresented a hypothesis on FMS in which sodium channels play a major role, and the authors suggested that sodium-channel blockers could become a therapeutic option for FMS pain. This renders the sodium-channel blocker ambroxol interesting for therapy: sodium channels localized in DRGs have a molecular gatekeeper function for impulses from peripheral nociceptors. Trauma, infection, or other factors may induce neuroplasticity via overexpression of sympathetic fibers and sodium channels in DRGs. The authors considered enhanced DRG excitability to play a key role in FMS pain. Since DRGs are potential sites of sympathetic–nociceptive short circuits, individuals who are genetically predisposed for sympathetic hyperactivity and those with inherent sodium channelopathies would be at risk of developing FMS. In addition, stressful environmental conditions in today's society could possibly contribute to sympathetic hyperactivity, and anti-inflammatory vagus-nerve activity might not be sufficient to counteract this. If FMS is interpreted in this context as a sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain syndrome, sodium-channel blockers gain importance as a therapeutic option for FMS pain. At least, the sodium channel Na v 1.8, which is selectively blocked by ambroxol, is of importance in the sympathetic nervous system. Schofield et aldemonstrated that Na v 1.8 occurs on the sympathetic superior cervical ganglion and can be blocked. Facer et aldemonstrated the presence of Na v 1.8-immunoreactive sensory nerve fibers in the human myocardium, which are – interestingly with regard to sympathetic function – frequently closely associated with small capillaries.

### Adrenergic nervous system in heart failure: pathophysiology and therapy [^117Cy5ni]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF), the leading cause of death in the western world, develops when a cardiac injury or insult impairs the ability of the heart to pump blood and maintain tissue perfusion. It is characterized by a complex interplay of several neurohormonal mechanisms that become activated in the syndrome to try and sustain cardiac output in the face of decompensating function. Perhaps the most prominent among these neurohormonal mechanisms is the adrenergic (or sympathetic) nervous system (ANS), whose activity and outflow are enormously elevated in HF. Acutely, and if the heart works properly, this activation of the ANS will promptly restore cardiac function. However, if the cardiac insult persists over time, chances are the ANS will not be able to maintain cardiac function, the heart will progress into a state of chronic decompensated HF, and the hyperactive ANS will continue to push the heart to work at a level much higher than the cardiac muscle can handle. From that point on, ANS hyperactivity becomes a major problem in HF, conferring significant toxicity to the failing heart and markedly increasing its morbidity and mortality. The present review discusses the role of the ANS in cardiac physiology and in HF pathophysiology, the mechanisms of regulation of ANS activity and how they go awry in chronic HF, methods of measuring ANS activity in HF, the molecular alterations in heart physiology that occur in HF, along with their pharmacological and therapeutic implications, and, finally, drugs and other therapeutic modalities used in HF treatment that target or affect the ANS and its effects on the failing heart.

Autonomic Dysfunction

Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is a major contributor to CRPS pathogenesis and is frequently referred to as sympathetically maintained pain. In the early stage of CRPS, plasma norepinephrine levels in the affected limb are significantly reduced, indicating diminished sympathetic outflow. Clinically, this phenomenon presents as vasodilation, redness, warmth, and edema. However, the decreased norepinephrine release may trigger a compensatory upregulation of vascular α1-adrenoceptors, leading to vasoconstriction and the characteristic cold, bluish appearance of the limb during the chronic "cold" phase of CRPS. In patients with CRPS, increased expression and density of α-adrenoceptors have been observed in epidermal cells and nociceptors on the affected and unaffected sides compared to healthy controls. Epidermal cells expressing α-adrenoceptors, such as keratinocytes, under norepinephrine stimulation, may release proinflammatory mediators that stimulate nociceptors and contribute to peripheral pain. Moreover, sympathetic-afferent coupling, the interactions between sympathetic and sensory nerves that heighten pain sensitivity, plays a significant role in peripheral and central sensitization in CRPS. Structural brain changes have also been reported in CRPS, including atrophy in regions associated with autonomic regulation, such as the ventromedial frontal cortex and the right anterior insula, indicating central involvement in autonomic dysfunction. Moreover, psychological factors and autoimmune mechanisms are believed to influence autonomic dysfunction and will be discussed in subsequent sections.

SNS ACTIVATION: NEW PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INSIGHT

The last decade has seen the development of new concepts in the pathophysiological background leading to the neuroadrenergic overdrive in hypertension. These in particular include 3 areas.

The first one refers to the role of immunologic and inflammatory factors, whose importance in the development of the neuroadrenergic activation received in recent years growing experimental support. The current knowledge on this participation can be summarized as follows. An increased number of studies have shown that immune mechanisms play a primary role in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension by contributing via the participation of macrophages and immune competent cells at the inflammatory state which characterizes not only hypertension but the atherosclerotic vascular process and congestive heart failure. Evidence has been accumulated, particularly in essential hypertension, that the relationships between the immune system and SNS are bidirectionally interactive. Concerning the role of the SNS as triggering mechanism of the interaction, demonstration has been provided that (i) an increase in sympathetic activity elicits T-lymphocytes activation and vascular inflammation,(ii) significant correlations have been found between circulating plasma norepinephrine and interleukin-6 produced by T-lymphocytes as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced by macrophages and monocytes, and (iii) chronic SNS activation desensitizes lymphocyte β 2 -adrenoceptors, thereby altering the immune function. On the other hand, inflammation and T-lymphocyte activation, which are both triggered by oxidative stress, may favor a sympathetic activation. In any case proinflammatory substances and mediators may trigger signal to the central nervous system activating the sympathetic neurogenic component. The evidence on a direct role of inflammatory and immune factors in the development and/or in the progression of hypertension-related sympathetic activation is still lacking in human beings. Recently, however, some evidence confirming the importance of the inflammatory process in the neuroadrenergic activation has been provided in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis, in which sympathetic nerve traffic recording displayed a level of neuroadrenergic activation greater for magnitude than the one detected in age-matched healthy controls. The SNS overdrive was also significantly potentiated when rheumatoid arthritis was detected in hypertensive patients.

### Quantitative sensory testing and norepinephrine levels in REM sleep behaviour disorder-a clue to early peripheral autonomic and sensory dysfunction? [^115yHpsq]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is characterized by pathological dream-enacting behaviour during REM sleep and is considered a premotor stage of alpha-synucleinopathies (α-SYN), such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA). It is already known that several autonomic symptoms can occur in this prodromal stage of α-SYN. We recently described the prevalence of transient orthostatic hypotension (OH) in iRBD. In addition to obstipation and olfactory dysfunction, OH is one of the most common autonomic features of α-SYN. Regarding the onset and manifestation of PD in iRBD, there remains debate whether central or peripheral pathology is the first to appear. One hypothesis posits the spread of alpha-synuclein towards the brain from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of various peripheral autonomic impairments and of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the skin; first metabolic brain changes; and a reduction in intraepithelial nerve fibre density in iRBD. Here, we characterized peripheral autonomic and somatosensory functions in iRBD by means of noninvasive quantitative sensory testing (QST), norepinephrine (NE) blood plasma levels, orthostatic BP, and heart rate changes.

### The autonomic nervous system and inflammation in chronic kidney disease [^115k1Df4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating physiological processes and maintaining homeostasis through its two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system. Dysregulation of the autonomic system, characterized by increased sympathetic activity and reduced parasympathetic tone, is a common feature in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease. This imbalance contributes to a pro-inflammatory state, exacerbating disease progression and increasing the risk for cardiovascular events. The sympathetic system promotes inflammation by releasing catecholamines, which activate adrenergic receptors on immune cells. The parasympathetic system exerts anti-inflammatory effects via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by the vagus nerve. Targeting the autonomic system to restore the balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic components offers promising approaches to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes in CKD and cardiovascular disease. Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are pharmacological agents that modulate sympathetic activity and have shown anti-inflammatory effects. Lifestyle interventions, such as a healthy diet, physical exercise, mindfulness, and meditation, enhance parasympathetic activity and improve autonomic function. Vagus nerve stimulation has emerged as a promising therapy, demonstrating significant potential in reducing inflammation and improving clinical outcomes in various conditions, including CKD, myocardial infarction and stroke. Despite mixed results in heart failure trials, vagal nerve stimulation has consistently improved quality-of-life measures. Understanding the mechanisms underlying autonomic system regulation of inflammation can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to restore autonomic balance and improve patient outcomes in CKD and cardiovascular disease.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^1161tzKo]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Normal BP regulation — Physiology of the baroreflex

BP is regulated by the baroreflex — an automatic, autonomic-mediated reflex responsible for buffering acute changes in BP which may be induced by postural change, exercise, haemorrhage or other physiological stress. The body's response to orthostasis illustrates this well. When a healthy person stands up, 500–700 mL blood pools into abdominal, pelvic and lower limb blood vasculature. The consequent reduction in venous return to the heart is sensed by stretch-sensitive baroreceptors in the carotid artery and aortic arch, and mechanoreceptors in the heart and lungs. Neural impulses are transmitted to the brainstem (the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius in the pons) via afferent neurons and are integrated and processed in the Central Autonomic Network in the brain — interconnected areas between the brainstem and forebrain responsible for controlling autonomic impulses. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow is then increased via efferent post-ganglionic autonomic neurons which release noradrenaline. Noradrenaline acts on α- and β-adrenoceptors in the blood vessels (causing vasoconstriction) and heart (increasing heart rate and contractility). In addition, adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla, and augments β-adrenoceptor activation in the heart, contributing to the increased heart rate and contractility. Finally, the increased sympathetic output also stimulates the hypothalamus to produce anti-diuretic hormone, thus increasing plasma volume and stimulating the renin-angiotensin system.

### Denying the truth does not change the facts: a systematic analysis of pseudoscientific denial of complex regional pain syndrome [^113xhUfX]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Autonomic Nervous System Mechanisms

A variety of studies indicate that autonomic nervous system alterations contribute to CRPS. CRPS is associated with both regional disturbances in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in the affected limband a range of systemic autonomic disturbances and central changes in autonomic drive. Consistent with the latter, early bilateral reductions in SNS-mediated vasoconstrictor responses post-fracture prospectively identify patients who subsequently go on to develop CRPS, suggesting a potential contributory role. Regarding specific autonomic changes, early studies suggested a regional reduction in turnover of the SNS neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which together with upregulated adrenoceptor responses, might contribute to altered vasoregulation in the CRPS affected limb. Evidence from more recent experimental studies evaluating the effects of the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrineand the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosinin CRPS-affected limbs specifically support activation of α1-adrenoceptors on primary afferent fibers by norepinephrine as a contributor to the dynamic mechanical allodynia and punctate hyperalgesia associated with CRPS.

Central Nervous System Mechanisms

Evidence for central nervous system involvement in CRPS predominantly emerges from neuroimaging studies. Cortical reorganization, as evidenced by a reduction in size of the representation of the CRPS-affected limb in the somatosensory cortex compared with the contralateral limb, has been observed in CRPS and is thought to explain some sensory features of CRPS such as its glove- or stocking-like distribution (ie not conforming to a specific dermatome or to a specific peripheral nerve distribution). Furthermore, the degree of cortical reorganization has been shown to positively correlate with the pain intensity and the amount of hyperalgesia, as well as tactile acuity, in CRPS patients. However, it must be stated that these very consistent findings were recently challenged.

Patients with CRPS also exhibit impairments in endogenous pain inhibitory pathways in the brain, increased glucose metabolism in pain-related brain regions, and alterations within the default mode network during resting-state fMRI. Longitudinal studies suggest that successful treatment of CRPS may normalize changes in brain structure and function, such as a reversal of primary somatosensory cortex reorganization; an increase in gray matter in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus; and enhanced functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the periaqueductal gray, a primary source of endogenous pain inhibition.

### The how and why of sleep: motor theory and catecholamine hypothesis [^113oFN6x]. Neuron (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep entails profound changes in the brain and body, marked by altered states of consciousness and reduced somatic and autonomic motor activity. Regarding "how" sleep is regulated, whole-brain screening revealed large sleep-control networks spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. We unify diverse experimental evidence under a "motor theory", in which the sleep-control mechanism is integral to somatic and autonomic motor circuits. Regarding the "why" question, sleep deprivation impairs cognition, emotion, metabolism, and immunity. We propose catecholamine (dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline) inactivation as the fundamental biological process underlying sleep's numerous benefits. Beyond brain arousal and motor activity, catecholamines regulate metabolism and immunity; their sleep-dependent suppression yields wide-ranging advantages, promoting repair and rejuvenation. Furthermore, catecholaminergic neurons are metabolically vulnerable; their need for rest and recovery may drive homeostatic sleep pressure. Together, the motor theory offers a unifying framework for sleep control, while the catecholamine hypothesis posits a core mechanism mediating sleep's multifaceted benefits.

### Autonomic involvement in Parkinson's disease: pathology, pathophysiology, clinical features and possible peripheral biomarkers [^112u2J3H]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system involvement occurs at early stages in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), and affects the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems (ENS). It has been proposed that alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) pathology in PD has a distal to proximal progression along autonomic pathways. The ENS is affected before the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), and distal axons of cardiac sympathetic nerves degenerate before there is loss of paravertebral sympathetic ganglion neurons. Consistent with neuropathological findings, some autonomic manifestations such as constipation or impaired cardiac uptake of norepinephrine precursors, occur at early stages of the disease even before the onset of motor symptoms. Biopsy of peripheral tissues may constitute a promising approach to detect α-SYN neuropathology in autonomic nerves and a useful early biomarker of PD.

### The sympathetic nervous system and blood pressure in humans: implications for hypertension [^117EAnh8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

A neurogenic component to primary hypertension (hypertension) is now well established. Along with raised vasomotor tone and increased cardiac output, the chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension has a diverse range of pathophysiological consequences independent of any increase in blood pressure. This review provides a perspective on the actions and interactions of angiotensin II, inflammation and vascular dysfunction/brain hypoperfusion in the pathogenesis and progression of neurogenic hypertension. The optimisation of current treatment strategies and the exciting recent developments in the therapeutic targeting of the sympathetic nervous system to control hypertension (for example, catheter-based renal denervation and carotid baroreceptor stimulation) will be outlined.

### Sympathetic control of the circulation in hypertension: lessons from autonomic disorders [^116eV1BR]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

Inappropriate sympathetic overactivity is consistently observed in patients with essential hypertension. The present review summarizes the recent advances that have been made in our understanding of the role of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension.

Recent Findings

Studies in patients with autonomic disorders underscore the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the long-term maintenance of hypertension. Abnormalities in the afferent limb of the sympathetic nervous system, in the regulation of central neurons where sympathetic outflow originates, and in the modulation of efferent sympathetic function, can all produce autonomic disorders that are associated with hypertension. More subtle dysfunctions in any of these components have been described in essential hypertension and can contribute to its pathogenesis. These include impaired buffering capacity of arterial baroreflexes, increased central sympathetic outflow, and enhanced norepinephrine release (or decrease reuptake) from sympathetic nerve terminals. Whether genetic polymorphisms of adrenoreceptors are associated with essential hypertension is an area of active research.

Summary

Increased sympathetic activity can contribute to sustained hypertension not only because of its hemodynamic effects (increased cardiac output and vascular resistance), but also by altering renal and water handling by the kidney, and by inducing cardiac and vascular remodeling. Antihypertensive agents that directly or indirectly target this sympathetic overactivity may be particularly useful in long-term treatment of essential hypertension.

### Current perspectives of the roles of the central norepinephrine system in anxiety and depression [^115RQwj2]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Norepinephrine (NE) is a major monoamine neurotransmitter that has widespread effects across multiple brain areas to regulate arousal and stress responses. The underlying function of the NE cortical system is to balance vigilance/scanning behavior with focused attention on novel environmental stimuli and the state of arousal. The central NE system is involved intrinsically with the stress response system, and dysregulation within the NE system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders. Central NE activity paradoxically has either anxiogenic or anxiolytic effects, depending on whether the time course of the stress is acute or chronic, whether the stress is predictable or unpredictable, and which underlying brain regions are affected. Under conditions of chronic stress, NE system activity dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system may turn a homeostatic stress response into a pathological stress response. Data suggest that the NE interplay with the serotonin system may exert neurobiological normalization of the pathophysiological state of anxious depression. Accordingly, pharmacological interventions targeting the NE system can result in anxiolytic, rather than anxiogenic, outcomes when used to treat patients with anxiety and depression.

### Norepinephrine: more of a neurohormone than a vasopressor [^112LdkSV]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Septic shock causes unpredictable cardiovascular responses through adrenoreceptor-mediated changes in cardiac function and vascular responsiveness. The use of norepinephrine should be regarded as neurohormonal augmentation therapy to defend decompensating haemodynamic function rather than as a rescue therapy to treat shock. Recent trials represent a perceptible change in clinical practice to preferentially use norepinephrine early in resuscitation to defend the mean arterial pressure and to use norepinephrine as a neurohormone rather than as a vasopressor.

### Autonomic imbalance: prophet of doom or scope for hope? [^111AXYNk]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome

In a study of healthy individuals, prolonged mild hyperinsulinaemia was shown to disrupt the circadian rhythm of cardiac autonomic activity. Thus, the authors suggested that early changes in the neural control of cardiac activity may provide a potential mechanism mediating a pathophysiological link between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular disease.

Individuals with the metabolic syndrome have alterations in the function of the autonomic nervous system as increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with several of the specific metabolic syndrome components (e.g. obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance). Unresolved, however, is whether the aberrations of the autonomic nervous system contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome or are a consequence of the metabolic syndrome. A recent study of 1298 individuals with different numbers of metabolic abnormalities showed that altered cardiac autonomic function existed in individuals with one or two metabolic abnormalities. Furthermore, as a result of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, but not insulin resistance in persons with one metabolic abnormality, the authors suggested that altered cardiac autonomic function precedes the presence of insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome. Prospective studies are, however, needed to answer this question with regard to the natural history. One prospective study of 433 non-obese, normotensive men followed for 5 years showed that autonomic dysfunction contributed to the development of obesity as sympathetic overactivity (i.e. plasma norepinephrine concentrations) and serum uric acid levels predicted future weight gain and elevation of blood pressure.

In individuals with a history of diabetes, it is well known that dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system is a potential complication. Impaired autonomic function may, however, be a mechanism associated with early glucose dysmetabolism and thus autonomic dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenic pathway leading to the development of diabetes.

### The role of the sympathetic nervous system in intestinal inflammation [^1145g5t5]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

The nervous system in the intestine controls motility, secretion, sensory perception, and immune function. Peptidergic neurones with neurotransmitters such as substance P and nerve growth factors have been the main focus of neuroimmunomodulation research in the gut. This review summarises the present knowledge concerning the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in modulating intestinal inflammation. The role of the SNS for gut inflammation is compared with its role in rheumatoid arthritis which demonstrates notable similarities. Nerve fibres of the SNS not only enter the enteric plexuses but also innervate the mucosa and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The SNS has pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, adenosine, and others can evoke remarkably different opposing effects depending on concentration (presence of sympathetic nerve fibres and extent of neurotransmitter release), receptor affinity at different receptor subtypes, expression of adrenoceptors, availability of cotransmitters, and timing of SNS activity in relation to the inflammatory course. This review attempts to integrate the different perspectives of the pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of the SNS on inflammatory disease of the gut.

### The role of sympathetic nervous activity in renal injury and end-stage renal disease [^112iNESw]. Hypertension Research (2010). Low credibility.

Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity is observed in patients with renal injury, renovascular hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Elevated sympathetic activity is of prognostic relevance in that plasma norepinephrine concentrations predict survival and the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD, as well as future renal injury in normotensive healthy subjects with renal function in the normal range. Renal injury, CKD and ESRD are often associated with obesity, and its common sequelae hypertension and diabetes. In fact, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the main causes of ESRD in western societies and together account for approximately more than 50% of ESRD incidence in the United States and Japan. Obesity also leads to increases in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have clearly documented that heightened sympathetic nervous activity has an important role in the onset and maintenance of obesity and hypertension. Elevated sympathetic nervous activity may actually represent an important mechanism contributing to the onset and maintenance of renal injury at least in part through its concomitant adverse effects on obesity and hypertension. Understanding the contribution of sympathetic nervous hyperactivity to the onset and maintenance of renal injury might aid in the prevention and treatment of renal injury, CKD and ESRD. Very recently, renal sympathetic denervation was shown to be a potentially novel therapeutic strategy in resistant hypertension. In addition, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are recommended as the initial therapy because of their renal protective effect, especially in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes or with proteinuria. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of our current knowledge on the relationships between sympathetic nerve activity and renal function to further our understanding of the precise roles of sympathetic nerve activity in renal injury, particularly in the context of obesity and hypertension. These insights may be useful to improve prevention and treatment of renal injury in these patients.

### Autonomic nervous system function in chronic hypotension associated with bartter and gitelman syndromes [^111Wm8qk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction has a major role in the blood pressure (BP) decrease associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The clinical picture of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes includes reduced extracellular fluid volume and normotension or hypotension, but no study has explored autonomic nervous system status in patients with hypotensive episodes associated with these diseases. We tested sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function in 4 patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes with chronic hypotension. Each patient underwent a battery of autonomic reflex tests, including BP and heart rate response to orthostatism, Valsalva maneuver, cold-pressor test, hand-grip test, and deep breathing. Plasma catecholamines also were measured. BP was monitored during tests by means of continuous noninvasive finger BP recording. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1 patient who experienced syncope episodes. Valsalva ratio ranged from 1.21 to 1.61. During the cold-pressor test, the range of systolic and diastolic BP increases were 8 to 31 and 6 to 24 mm Hg, respectively. During the hand-grip test, systolic and diastolic BP increases ranged from 10 to 39 and 8 to 32 mm Hg, respectively. During hyperventilation, the difference between the highest and lowest heart rates was 12 or more beats/min in all patients. Patients' plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased during standing. Our preliminary results suggest that chronic hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes is not associated with sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction, even when orthostatic hypotension is present. This normal autonomic function suggests that other pathophysiological mechanisms, such as the characteristic vasoconstrictor abnormal cell signaling, may account for hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes.

### Sympathomodulatory effects of antihypertensive drug treatment [^113A2e5v]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An activation of sympathetic neural influences to the heart and peripheral circulation has been shown to represent a hallmark of the essential hypertensive state, adrenergic neural factors participating together with other variables at the development and progression of the high blood pressure state as well as of the hypertension-related target organ damage. This represents the rationale for employing in hypertension treatment drugs which combine the blood pressure-lowering properties with the modulatory effects on the sympathetic neural function.

Methods and Results

Several studies published during the past 40 years have investigated the impact of antihypertensive drugs on the sympathetic target as assessed by indirect and direct approaches. In the present paper, the effects of different monotherapies or combination drug treatment used in hypertension to lower elevated blood pressure values on various adrenergic markers will be examined. This will be followed by a discussion of the (i) hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic consequences of employing antihypertensive drugs with sympathomodulatory or sympathoexcitatory properties and (ii) mechanisms potentially responsible for the adrenergic responses to a given antihypertensive drug. The final part of this review will address the questions still open related to the impact of antihypertensive drug treatment on sympathetic function. Two questions in particular will be examined, i.e., whether antihypertensive drugs with sympathomodulatory properties may be capable to fully restore a "normal" adrenergic drive and how far sympathetic activity should be reduced in hypertensive patients.

Conclusion

Future investigations aimed at answering these questions will be needed in order to improve cardiovascular protection in treated hypertensive patients.

### Autonomic nervous system: a therapeutic target for cardiac end-organ damage in hypertension [^115zRkcg]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Dietary Sodium Restriction

A meta-analysis of 85 studies reports an approximately linear relation between dietary sodium intake and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in normotensive individuals and in patients with hypertension. The current guidelines on hypertension recommend a dietary intake of sodium restricted to < 100 mmol (≈5.8 g sodium chloride) per day. A high dietary sodium intake is considered to enhance sympathetic activity, likely mediated by the brainstem. Direct infusion of sodium into cerebrospinal fluid elevated blood pressure and increased sympathetic activity in the adrenal glands of rodents. Accordingly, a high sodium intake is associated with high levels of plasma norepinephrine in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension. It is unknown whether ANS modulation by dietary sodium restriction influences HF and AF. However, sodium restriction is recommended in patients with HF to reduce congestive symptoms, likely by attenuating fluid retention.

### Dual cholinergic signals regulate daily migration of hematopoietic stem cells and leukocytes [^117AVXbi]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and leukocytes circulate between the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood following circadian oscillations. Autonomic sympathetic noradrenergic signals have been shown to regulate HSPC and leukocyte trafficking, but the role of the cholinergic branch has remained unexplored. We have investigated the role of the cholinergic nervous system in the regulation of day/night traffic of HSPCs and leukocytes in mice. We show here that the autonomic cholinergic nervous system (including parasympathetic and sympathetic) dually regulates daily migration of HSPCs and leukocytes. At night, central parasympathetic cholinergic signals dampen sympathetic noradrenergic tone and decrease BM egress of HSPCs and leukocytes. However, during the daytime, derepressed sympathetic noradrenergic activity causes predominant BM egress of HSPCs and leukocytes via β 3 -adrenergic receptor. This egress is locally supported by light-triggered sympathetic cholinergic activity, which inhibits BM vascular cell adhesion and homing. In summary, central (parasympathetic) and local (sympathetic) cholinergic signals regulate day/night oscillations of circulating HSPCs and leukocytes. This study shows how both branches of the autonomic nervous system cooperate to orchestrate daily traffic of HSPCs and leukocytes.

### Autonomic nervous system activity changes in patients with hypertension and overweight: role and therapeutic implications [^111EW6Dd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sympathetic activity is increased in hypertension and heart failure, and is responsible for initiation and development of the diseases. While specific causes of this increase are mostly unknown, genetic influences, behavioural and lifestyle factors appear to be involved. Increased SNS activity is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure through multiple mechanisms, including desensitization of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors, adverse effects on excitation–contraction coupling, and fibrosis.

The effects of the SNS activation are mediated by adrenergic neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) having vasoconstriction properties. It has been shown that the norepinephrine spillover is increased in patients with high blood pressure, and this increase is mainly seen in the heart and the kidneys, both tightly involved in blood pressure control. The release of these adrenergic neurotransmitters induces action on cardiovascular and metabolic systems by targeting organs involved in homeostasis control as the heart, kidneys, veins, and arterioles, and leading to renin release, sodium retention, increase in heart rate, arrhythmias, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, these targets of the SNS contribute to increase blood pressure. Regarding the metabolic effects, the adrenergic neurotransmitters are responsible for action on different organs and tissues: on fat cell to increase lipolysis resulting in an increase in fatty acid release, on the liver to increase gluconeogenesis, on pancreatic β-cells to decrease insulin secretion. Conversely, free fatty acids may enhance sympathetic activity. If the sympathetic activity is raised chronically, it may lead to development of insulin resistance and hypertension, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The role of therapeutic inhibition of sympathetic overdrive in the prevention of the metabolic disorders and the associated adverse outcomes requires adequate testing in properly sized randomised controlled trials.

In contrast to increased sympathetic activity, parasympathetic activity is decreased in patients with hypertension, suggesting a sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance.

A higher prevalence of hypertension is found in diabetic patients with a defective parasympathetic control. Moreover, there is an association between this defect and hypertension profile and vascular complications.

As well as being involved in hypertension, abnormal activation of the SNS has been implicated in metabolic syndrome, known risk factors for hypertension.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^1119T4tT]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Loss or dysregulation of the normally precise control of heart rate via the autonomic nervous system plays a critical role during the development and progression of cardiovascular disease — including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. While the clinical significance of regulating changes in heart rate, known as the chronotropic effect, is undeniable, the mechanisms controlling these changes remain not fully understood. Heart rate acceleration and deceleration are mediated by increasing or decreasing the spontaneous firing rate of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. During the transition from rest to activity, sympathetic neurons stimulate these cells by activating β-adrenergic receptors and increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The same signal transduction pathway is targeted by positive chronotropic drugs such as norepinephrine and dobutamine, which are used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock and severe heart failure. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate–sensitive hyperpolarization–activated current (I f) in pacemaker cells is passed by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels and is critical for generating the autonomous heartbeat. In addition, this current has been suggested to play a central role in the chronotropic effect. Recent studies demonstrate that cyclic adenosine monophosphate–dependent regulation of HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel isoform 4) acts to stabilize the heart rate, particularly during rapid rate transitions induced by the autonomic nervous system. The mechanism is based on creating a balance between firing and recently discovered nonfiring pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. In this way, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels may protect the heart from sinoatrial node dysfunction, secondary arrhythmia of the atria, and potentially fatal tachyarrhythmia of the ventricles. Here, we review the latest findings on sinoatrial node automaticity and discuss the physiological and pathophysiological role of HCN pacemaker channels in the chronotropic response and beyond.

### Sympathetic axonal sprouting induces changes in macrophage populations and protects against pancreatic cancer [^111oBimY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer with a poor prognosis that develops from the exocrine part of the pancreas. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems densely innervate the pancreas and regulate exocrine secretions of acinar and ductal cells. The role of the autonomic nervous system in PDAC development has been addressed in recent studies that have revealed a more complex and unexpected picture when compared to other cancer models. Indeed, the interruption of parasympathetic innervation or activity strongly promotes PDAC progression in Kras -mutated mouse models, revealing an antitumor effect of parasympathetic cholinergic signaling. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in PDAC has been studied in relation to stress. It was reported that chronic restraint stress ﻿promotes Kras -induced pancreatic tumorigenesis through the elevation of circulating adrenal-derived catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and ﻿stimulation of β2 adrenergic receptor-dependent pancreatic epithelial growth. This study reported that surgical removal of the celiac ganglionic plexus, that provides sympathetic efferent inputs to the pancreas, extended the survival of mice ﻿with established PDAC. However, the surgical procedure may also have reduced pancreatic input from sensory neurons, which were shown to increase the growth of Kras -mutant spheres and stimulate PDAC initiation and progression –. Thus, although it has been proposed that noradrenergic signaling of pancreatic sympathetic nerves contributes to PDAC growth, this has yet to be formally demonstrated. This is particularly important because conflicting results from a study based on selective chemical sympathectomy proposed an opposite role for sympathetic nerve activity in mediating the antitumor effect of positive stress induced by enriched housing conditions in murine pancreatic cancer.

### What is the role of β-adrenergic signaling in heart failure? [^112VfGpC]. Circulation Research (2003). Low credibility.

This review addresses open questions about the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac function and failure. Cardiomyocytes express all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes-beta1, beta2, and, at least in some species, beta3. The beta1 subtype is the most prominent one and is mainly responsible for positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines. The beta2 subtype also increases cardiac function, but its ability to activate nonclassical signaling pathways suggests a function distinct from the beta1 subtype. In heart failure, the sympathetic system is activated, cardiac beta-receptor number and function are decreased, and downstream mechanisms are altered. However, in spite of a wealth of data, we still do not know whether and to what extent these alterations are adaptive/protective or detrimental, or both. Clinically, beta-adrenergic antagonists represent the most important advance in heart failure therapy, but it is still debated whether they act by blocking or by resensitizing the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Newer experimental therapeutic strategies aim at the receptor desensitization machinery and at downstream signaling steps.

### Dysregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α in the sympathetic nervous system accelerates diabetic cardiomyopathy [^116pwTTC]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart function is tightly controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is comprised of parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons. The cardiac sympathetic nervous system uses the catecholamine norepinephrine as a neurotransmitter, and modulates heart rate, conduction velocity, myocardial contractility, cardiomyocyte size and structure. The sympathetic nervous system is composed of preganglionic neurons, residing in the spinal cord forming the preganglionic motor column, and of postganglionic neurons, forming the sympathetic ganglion chain. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons innervating the heart are located primarily in the stellate ganglion, with minor contributions from the middle cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. Cardiac sympathetic neurons extend axons across the epicardium along large-diameter coronary vessels into the myocardium. These axons branch out and form varicosities along their length with synaptic vesicles that contain norepinephrine. Cardiac sympathetic innervation is most dense in the central conduction system, including the His bundle, and the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and in the subepicardium. The sympathetic innervation density gradually decreases from the atria to the ventricles and from the base to the apex of the heart. These regional differences in the sympathetic innervation pattern are necessary to effectively control heart performance. Changes in the innervation pattern and activity of the sympathetic nervous system are implicated in many cardiac pathologies, including hypertension, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and heart failure.

Stimuli that are interpreted by the brain as extreme or threatening, regardless of their modality, elicit an immediate stereotypic response characterized by enhanced cognition, affective immobility, vigilance, autonomic arousal and a global catabolic state. The brain's ability to mobilize this so-called stress response is paralleled by activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in several nuclei, including the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus ceruleus, and stimulation of the locus ceruleus norepinephrine (LC/NE) system in the brain stem. These systems perpetuate one another, interact with several other transmitter systems in the brain and directly activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the three components of the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympatho-adrenal, the cranio-sacral parasympathetic and the enteric nervous systems. The widespread body system responses to stress are discussed, and the implications of aberrant stress system activity on physical and mental health are outlined. Moreover, the promise of nonpeptide CRH type-1 receptor antagonists to directly target the stress system in the brain is highlighted.

### More efficient adaptation of cardiovascular response to repeated restraint in spontaneously hypertensive rats: the role of autonomic nervous system [^114FFKmG]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physiological responses to stressor exposure are mediated primarily by the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. The regulation of autonomic nervous system and HPA axis is complex and their appropriate interplay triggers a physiological response, which is adequate to the nature and intensity of the stressful stimulus. The principal signaling molecules during stressful conditions are catecholamines (noradrenaline and adrenaline) released by the sympathetic nerve endings and adrenal medulla as well as glucocorticoids produced by adrenal cortex. Although the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines exerts temporary beneficial effects, their actions can be counterproductive or even deleterious under the conditions of prolonged or repeated stress. The progressive attenuation of the magnitude of cardiovascular, endocrine and behavioral responses elicited by repeated exposures to the same (homotypic) stressor is called adaptation or habituation. This important mechanism limits the maladaptive consequences of chronic stress and decreases the risk of pathophysiological changes by damping the responses to aversive stimuli that are not life-threatening.

Autonomic dysregulation

Acute stress results in immediate activation of sympathetic nerves and reduction of parasympathetic nerves in order to prepare the body for a fight or flight response. An indication of autonomic activity can be obtained from looking at catecholamine levels. Indeed, some older studies indicate a tendency for the urinary excretion of noradrenaline and its metabolites to be diminished, whereas other reports document elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline. A more direct way of measuring autonomic tone is by measuring noradrenaline spillover to plasma in patients with MDD. A recent noradrenaline spillover study among MDD patients by Barton et al. found sympathetic nervous activity to be high, including the sympathetic outflow to the heart, but this was restricted to only a subgroup of MDD patients.

Such invasive spillover studies are unfortunately not easily implementable in large psychiatric cohorts, restricting our insights into generalizability of results and the role of potential underlying confounding factors. That is why many researchers have used non-invasive, but more indirect indicators of autonomic tone, for example, obtained from electrical and impedance cardiography assessments. A non-invasive method for autonomic dysregulation assessment is heart rate variability (HRV), particularly in the respiratory frequency range, as an indicator of cardiac vagal control. HRV reflects an individual's capacity for parasympathetic inhibition of autonomic arousal in emotional expression and regulation, and is an important predictor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Depression is hypothesized to involve an autonomic nervous system that is in a relative state of more sympathetic and less parasympathetic activation. According to the polyvagal theory, this is partly due to the fact that impairments of low vagal tone are associated with reduced social engagement and a less flexible behavioral response to environmental changes.

### Role of the autonomic nervous system in atrial fibrillation: pathophysiology and therapy [^113s8ye4]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Autonomic nervous system activation can induce significant and heterogeneous changes of atrial electrophysiology and induce atrial tachyarrhythmias, including atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF). The importance of the autonomic nervous system in atrial arrhythmogenesis is also supported by circadian variation in the incidence of symptomatic AF in humans. Methods that reduce autonomic innervation or outflow have been shown to reduce the incidence of spontaneous or induced atrial arrhythmias, suggesting that neuromodulation may be helpful in controlling AF. In this review, we focus on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the pathophysiology of AF and the potential benefit and limitations of neuromodulation in the management of this arrhythmia. We conclude that autonomic nerve activity plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of AF, and modulating autonomic nerve function may contribute to AF control. Potential therapeutic applications include ganglionated plexus ablation, renal sympathetic denervation, cervical vagal nerve stimulation, baroreflex stimulation, cutaneous stimulation, novel drug approaches, and biological therapies. Although the role of the autonomic nervous system has long been recognized, new science and new technologies promise exciting prospects for the future.

Innervation is key to organ growth, function, and repair

In more recent decades, the role of the nervous system in the involuntary regulation of internal organs has been expanded to virtually all other systems in the body, as contained in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The ANS consists of sympathetic ("fight-or-flight") and parasympathetic ("rest") fibers that emanate from the central nervous system (CNS) and innervate organs through various pathways. Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic division emerge from paravertebral ganglia at the thoracic and mid-lumbar spinal cord and synapse at the sympathetic chain or the prevertebral ganglia with postganglionic fibers that ultimately innervate the effector organ. In contrast, parasympathetic preganglionic fibers originate from the brainstem or the sacral spinal cord and typically interact with the postganglionic component close to the target organ. Moreover, while acetylcholine (ACh) is the principal neurotransmitter between preganglionic and postganglionic fibers of any type, postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves mainly employ norepinephrine (NE) and ACh, respectively, to communicate with and influence organs. The interaction between these efferent fibers (signal propagation towards effector organ/tissue, "motor") and organs relies on afferent (sensory propagation towards CNS) inputs to the brain that provide information on environmental and physiological conditions in the organs (e.g. stretch receptors in the urinary bladder, baroreceptors for central blood pressure, thermoreceptors for skin blood flow). This is relayed to the autonomic nerves to regulate functions such as skin and muscle vasoconstriction, pancreatic secretions, urination, gut motility, and saliva production –. Variations in the density, sensitivity, and phenotypes of efferent and afferent inputs have also been related to various pathologies (e.g. gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular diseases). Furthermore, although not extensively studied, innervation is increasingly being recognized as an essential component of organ development and regeneration –. For example, autonomic nerves contribute to organogenesis, wound healing, and tissue regrowthby preserving phenotypes and function in stem cell niches and presenting growth and transcription factors necessary for the maintenance of migrating cells in wounds. In many instances, blood vessels and nerves follow the same paths, and their interactions are essential in pathfinding during development –. As a result, innervation is a crucial component of tissues and organs due to its role in development, functional regulation, modulation, and disease.

### Breast cancer and neurotransmitters: emerging insights on mechanisms and therapeutic directions [^111XQzP2]. Oncogene (2023). Medium credibility.

Adrenergic activation

Epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) are endogenous catecholamines or monoamine neurotransmitters. Release of these hormones mediates the fight-or-flight response as they bind to adrenergic receptors. Breast cancer tissue has been found to overexpress β-adrenergic receptors.

Stress induced neuroendocrine activation or pharmacologic activation of adrenergic receptors has been found in mouse models to result in substantial increases to proliferation and distant metastasis. This phenomenon of adrenergic receptors activated by stress neurotransmitters worsening cancer state is not fully understood, but studies are proceeding rapidly. It has also been shown in mice that local mammary tumor sympathetic innervation responds to stress with increased norepinephrine turnover and this is of greater significance to tumor growth than circulating norepinephrine. There are several proposed mechanisms underlying the pro-tumor roles of epinephrine and norepinephrine. One is that activation of β2-adrenoceptor (AR) promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis through increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), metalloproteases 2 (MMP2), and MMP9. This further potentiates the angiogenic and metastatic evolution of breast cancer. ß 2 AR signaling may also stimulate tumor growth by promoting DNA damage and p53-associated apoptosis suppression.

Chances of recurrence appear to be increased by stress. Perego et al. proposed, and supported with murine evidence for lung and ovarian cancer, a mechanism for the awakening of dormant cancer cells. They proposed that pro-inflammatory S100A8/A9 complexes are released by polymorphonuclear neutrophils via β2-adrenergic receptors, in response to stress hormones, and the complexes cause oxidized lipids to accumulate. The release of S100A8/A9 proteins and modified lipids upregulates a fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway, activating dormant cancer cells.

In metastatic breast cancer, the skeleton is a frequent site of spread. Sympathetic nerves densely network across bones. It has been shown that activation of β2-adrenergic receptors, as in sympathetic nerve activation, in osteoblasts leads to increased bone vascular density and a more favorable bone microenvironment for breast cancer cells.

ANS-Related Pathophysiology of HF

Background

Neural remodeling in HF

The ANS controls cardiovascular homeostasis. Dysregulation of cardiac autonomic transmission is a hallmark of HF, which is characterized by sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal (Figure 2). Neural remodeling occurs in parallel with cardiac remodeling and contributes to dysfunction. In canines with pacing-induced HF, increased circulating catecholamines are associated with a loss of noradrenergic nerve terminals in the failing ventricles. On the other hand, HF induced by MI may be associated with nerve sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation. The coordination of NE synthesis, release, and removal becomes disrupted, with elevated release and suppressed reuptake leading to high extracellular NE that is detrimental to the heart. As the disease progresses, acetylcholine (Ach) replaces NE in some sympathetic neurons, and NPY synthesis and release increase, potentially contributing to pathology. It is now recognized that neural remodeling occurs throughout the nervous system in HF. In addition to neurochemical plasticity, morphologic changes include remodeling of axon arbors in the heart — both degeneration and regrowth — as well as increased size of cell bodies and dendritic arbors within stellate and intracardiac ganglia. Electrical remodeling includes enhanced excitability in stellate ganglia, altered firing frequencies of sensory afferents and parasympathetic efferents, as well as remodeling of connections within intracardiac ganglia. These neural changes influence the heart, causing down-regulation of β1, up-regulation of β2 adrenergic receptors, and modulating cardiac electrophysiology. A recent clinical trial showed that propranolol, which blocks both β1 and β2 receptors, is much more effective than metoprolol in managing patients with electrical storm. β2 switching takes place, not only on myocytes, but also on human and rat stellate neurons in models of sympathetic hyperactivity. The neurotransmitter switching may enhance epinephrine release and lead to greater postsynaptic excitability in disease. Some of the mechanisms controlling neurochemical plasticity and beta receptor signaling are well-described, but little is known about the molecular basis for morphologic or electrical remodeling of the nervous system in HF.

ANS regulation of physiology

The autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS), consisting of the sympathetic (SNS), parasympathetic (PNS), and enteric nervous systems (ENS), encompasses an unconscious neural network that links the central nervous system (CNS) to nearly all anatomic locations and physiologic functions (Fig. 1). This review will focus on the SNS and PNS, as the ENS predominantly acts to regulate gastrointestinal processes outside the intended scope. In brief, the SNS and PNS represent largely parallel webs of two-neuron pathways (termed pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic neurons) originating from the central nervous system and ending at target tissues throughout the body. The SNS and PNS are controlled by centers within the brainstem and hypothalamus and act both together and independently to dynamically allocate resources and adapt responses to the needs dictated by the body's interpretation of stimuli.

### The sympathetic nervous system in hypertension: roadmap update of a long journey [^112Wj1SX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The present paper will provide an update on the role of sympathetic neural factors in the development and progression of essential hypertension by reviewing data collected in the past 10 years. This will be done by discussing the results of the published studies in which sympathetic neural function in essential hypertension and related disease has been investigated via sophisticated and highly sensitive techniques, such as microneurographic recording of sympathetic nerve traffic and regional norepinephrine spillover. First, the relevance of the pathophysiological background of the neurogenic alterations will be discussed. It will be then examined the behavior of the sympathetic neural function in specific clinical phenotypes, such as resistant hypertension, pseudoresistant hypertension, and hypertensive states displaying elevated resting heart values. This will be followed by a discussion of the main results of the meta-analytic studies examining the behavior of sympathetic nerve traffic in essential hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic renal failure. The sympathetic effects of renal denervation and carotid baroreceptor stimulation as well as the possible involvement of sympathetic neural factors in the determination of the so-called "residual risk" of the treated hypertensive patients will be finally discussed.

### The role of the autonomic nervous system in sudden cardiac death [^113BWYAF]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system exerts a modulating effect on the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the setting of ischemic heart disease. The mechanism by which sympathetic tone increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias is not known, though regional sympathetic denervation at and apical to the site of transmural infarction may result in regional supersensitivity to circulating catecholamines and play a role in ventricular arrhythmogenesis. [(123)I]MIBG scintigraphy enables noninvasive determination of regional cardiac denervation and may be a useful tool for probing the role of sympathetic nervous system in SCD. Increased vagal tone is generally protective against SCD. Newer tests such as baroreflex slope testing and various techniques for determination of heart rate variability, which provide indices of vagal tone, may have greater predictive value and are powerful tools in assessing the role of autonomic nervous system in SCD.

### Role of β-adrenergic signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome in chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced murine lung cancer progression [^112B6KtZ]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The sympathetic-adrenomedullary axis is an important neuroendocrine system that plays an essential role in chronic stress. Increased efferent sympathetic nerve activity is one of the pathological mechanisms in patients with OSA. Interestingly, OSA causes chronic elevations in plasma catecholamines concentrations in adults and children, and these findings have been demonstrated in animals exposed to CIH. Catecholamine, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI), undergo a conversion process. DA is transformed into NE by dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), and NE generates EPI through phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase transmethylation. DA primarily affects the central nervous system, while NE and EPI, known for their role in the "fight-or-flight" response, act through α-adrenergic receptors (α-AR) and β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR).

### Overnutrition causes insulin resistance and metabolic disorder through increased sympathetic nervous system activity [^112uYceR]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying obesity-induced insulin resistance remain incompletely understood, as impaired cellular insulin signaling, traditionally considered the primary driver of insulin resistance, does not always accompany impaired insulin action. Overnutrition rapidly increases plasma norepinephrine (NE), suggesting overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, the role of the SNS in obesity is controversial, as both increased and decreased SNS activity (SNA) have been reported. Here, we show that reducing catecholamine (CA) release from the SNS protects against overnutrition-induced insulin resistance as well as hyperglucagonemia, adipose tissue dysfunction, and fatty liver disease, as we demonstrate utilizing a mouse model of inducible and peripherally restricted deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase (th; THΔper). A key mechanism through which heightened SNA induces insulin resistance is by triggering adipose tissue lipolysis. Increased SNA emerges as a critical driver in the pathogenesis of overnutrition-induced insulin resistance and metabolic disease independent of cellular insulin signaling.
