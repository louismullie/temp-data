## Question

elevated hypertension (126/70) monitoring after kidney transplant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg in a kidney transplant recipient, including whether this constitutes hypertension, what targets to use, how to measure BP accurately, and what to do next clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this BP value against guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify the recommended BP targets for adult kidney transplant recipients. Next, I will review the evidence quality behind those targets. After that, I need to check the best measurement strategy, including out-of-office monitoring, to avoid misclassification. Then, I will consider medication choices and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized plan and monitoring cadence, while double-checking for any exceptions or caveats that might change management in this specific patient.

> Let me first confirm the classification of 126/70 mmHg. By KDIGO 2021 and KDOQI 2022, the target for adult kidney transplant recipients with hypertension is less than 130/80 mmHg using standardized office BP, so 126/70 mmHg is below that target and would not be classified as hypertension in this context, although I should verify that this reading was obtained with standardized technique before concluding anything definitive [^116VGoFE] [^116RYBbK].

> Wait, let me verify the target itself so I don't overstate it. KDIGO 2021 explicitly recommends a BP target of less than 130/80 mmHg in adult kidney transplant recipients with hypertension, and the ESH 2023 guideline aligns with the same target, which reinforces consistency across major societies. Importantly, this applies to recipients with established hypertension, not necessarily to normotensive recipients, so I need to ensure we are not extrapolating treatment thresholds to those without hypertension [^116VGoFE] [^111CgJvF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about evidence strength. I should confirm how strong the evidence is for this target. KDOQI notes that the < 130/80 mmHg goal for transplant recipients is largely based on expert opinion and extrapolation rather than transplant-specific randomized trials, so while it is reasonable and widely adopted, it warrants individualized judgment and shared decision-making, especially when balancing polypharmacy and drug interactions common in transplant recipients [^116RYBbK] [^1136wBUW].

> Next, I should review how this BP was measured because misclassification is common. I need to ensure standardized office BP technique was used (rest 5 minutes, calibrated device, appropriate cuff, arm at heart level, no caffeine/tobacco/exercise 30 minutes prior), and if there is any doubt about representativeness, I should obtain out-of-office measurements. ABPM is the gold standard and reveals high rates of masked hypertension in transplant recipients, while home BP monitoring is a practical alternative that tracks closer to ABPM than routine office readings [^111U1yHr] [^1154BG9o] [^113TM9PQ] [^115riHez].

> Let me consider the clinical implications of 126/70 mmHg. If this reflects true BP control, it suggests good control relative to the < 130/80 mmHg target and would generally not prompt intensification. However, I should double-check for white-coat normotension or masked hypertension, because a normal office BP can conceal elevated out-of-office pressures in up to roughly one-third of transplant recipients, which would change management entirely if uncovered [^113TM9PQ] [^111jMopy].

> I will now examine medication choices and interactions, even though no new drug is indicated at 126/70 mmHg if this is accurate. If treatment is ever needed, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are favored early because they mitigate calcineurin inhibitor–induced vasoconstriction and have signals for improved graft outcomes, whereas nondihydropyridine CCBs can inhibit CYP3A4 and raise calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor levels, requiring closer immunosuppressant monitoring. RAAS blockade can be considered, particularly with proteinuria, but early post-transplant use warrants caution due to hemodynamic effects and hyperkalemia risk, so timing and lab surveillance matter [^111qhPAt] [^111TNGTx] [^112ekMzh] [^1173ckfT].

> But wait, what if proteinuria is present or the patient is very early post-transplant. I should confirm proteinuria status because some guidance suggests a lower BP threshold, for example around 125/75 mmHg when protein excretion exceeds 1 g/day, and in the first 3–6 months many clinicians prefer CCBs over RAAS blockade to avoid confounding creatinine kinetics and hyperkalemia; after that window, RAAS inhibition becomes more attractive if proteinuria persists, with close monitoring of potassium and creatinine [^114Gbbip] [^1173ckfT].

> Next, I should review a monitoring plan. I need to ensure BP is recorded at every clinic visit, and if there is any discordance between symptoms, home readings, or clinic values, I should arrange ABPM or home BP monitoring. Routine labs including creatinine/eGFR, electrolytes, and urine protein should be trended, and any upward drift in BP toward 130/80 mmHg should trigger reassessment of volume status, immunosuppression, and adherence before escalating therapy [^117WnsVj] [^114ZeBZY] [^1154BG9o].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. A standardized office BP of 126/70 mmHg in an adult kidney transplant recipient with hypertension is at goal and not considered hypertensive by KDIGO and ESH criteria. If this reading is accurate and confirmed, no treatment intensification is indicated, though I should verify with out-of-office monitoring when feasible to exclude masked hypertension and continue routine surveillance for changes over time [^116VGoFE] [^111CgJvF] [^113TM9PQ].

A blood pressure of 126/70 mmHg in a kidney transplant recipient is **not considered elevated** and is within the recommended target range of < 130/80 mmHg [^116VGoFE] [^111CgJvF]. This level is acceptable for ongoing monitoring, but **out-of-office BP measurement** (home or ambulatory) should be used to detect masked hypertension or white-coat effects, which are common in transplant recipients [^1154BG9o] [^113TM9PQ]. Continue routine clinic BP checks at each visit, reinforce lifestyle measures, and adjust therapy only if BP rises or if proteinuria or other risk factors emerge [^117WnsVj] [^117NcuD9].

## Blood pressure targets in kidney transplant recipients

Current guidelines recommend a **target BP < 130/80 mmHg** for adult kidney transplant recipients with hypertension [^116VGoFE] [^111CgJvF]. This target balances cardiovascular risk reduction with graft protection, although evidence is largely extrapolated from CKD and general populations [^116ikg13] [^1163dw2S].

---

## Clinical significance of 126/70 mmHg

A BP of 126/70 mmHg is **within the recommended target** and not considered elevated for a kidney transplant recipient. It reflects good control and a lower risk of cardiovascular events and graft complications compared with higher BP levels [^1173ckfT].

---

## Recommended monitoring strategies

### Office blood pressure measurement

- **Frequency**: Measure at every clinic visit [^115ub3Cn].
- **Technique**: Use standardized office BP measurement (rest 5 minutes, appropriate cuff, arm at heart level) [^111U1yHr].
- **Documentation**: Record consistently to track trends [^115ub3Cn].

---

### Out-of-office blood pressure monitoring

- **Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM)**: Gold standard to detect masked hypertension or white-coat effects, which are common in transplant recipients [^113TM9PQ] [^114cNkrk].
- **Home BP monitoring (HBPM)**: Practical alternative to ABPM; use validated devices and standardized technique [^115riHez].
- **Frequency**: Consider periodic ABPM or HBPM, especially if office BP is borderline or there is suspected masked hypertension [^116vFQGa].

## Clinical implications of elevated blood pressure in transplant recipients

Elevated BP is associated with **increased cardiovascular risk** — including higher rates of cardiovascular events, the leading cause of death in transplant recipients [^115MhcPd] — and with **graft complications**, including increased risk of graft dysfunction and loss [^1173ckfT].

---

## Management of blood pressure in kidney transplant recipients

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day.
- **Weight management**: Aim for BMI 20–25 kg/m².
- **Regular physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **First-line agents**: Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine) or ARBs [^111qhPAt] [^111TNGTx].
- **Second-line agents**: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or thiazide diuretics, individualized to comorbidities and drug interactions [^114KYp4A] [^1131i33s].
- **Drug interactions**: Monitor for interactions with immunosuppressants, especially CYP3A4 inhibitors [^112ekMzh].

---

## Frequency of blood pressure monitoring

- **Office visits**: Every 4–8 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months once stable [^114ZeBZY].
- **Home monitoring**: Daily or several times weekly during medication changes or instability.
- **Ambulatory monitoring**: Annually or when masked hypertension is suspected [^114AA6sT].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A BP of 126/70 mmHg in a kidney transplant recipient is **within the recommended target** and not considered elevated. Continue routine monitoring at each visit, consider periodic out-of-office BP measurement to detect masked hypertension, and maintain lifestyle measures. Adjust therapy only if BP rises or if proteinuria or other risk factors emerge.

Background

Hypertension in renal transplant recipients

In kidney transplant recipients, hypertension (HTN) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), death and graft malfunction independent of death, and its prevalence is 50–90%. However, there are no randomized control trials to define target BP levels in renal transplant recipients. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations are to target clinic BP of kidney transplant recipients to levels lower than 130/80 mmHg (a 2C-grade recommendation according to KDIGO). Yet, the recommendations of the National Kidney Foundation are to adjust individually BP levels due to lack in evidence based recommendations, while the recent European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines suggest that the target BP range for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be 130–139 mmHg, and the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) recommended values of less than 140/90 mmHg in all CKD patients, not excluding transplant recipients.

### Optimising the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring in chronic kidney disease: the utility of BpTRU [^116VVoXy]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 15% of the adult population and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is present in up to 90% of people with CKD and is the most important modifiable risk factor in the clinical management of people with CKD. Accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring is therefore a critical component of the management of people with CKD both for risk stratification and for the appropriate use of anti-hypertensive therapy and lifestyle modification to manage BP to recommended levels.

Patients at highest risk from CKD are managed in secondary care renal clinics; however, the management changes that clinicians recommend in this setting are often based on a single clinic BP reading. Use of a single clinic measurement may over-diagnose hypertension in up to 30% of the general population; in many patients identified by conventional criteria as having hypertension, this increase in BP is confined to the clinic setting and described as 'white-coat hypertension'. If 'white-coat hypertension' is not correctly identified, patients may subsequently receive unnecessary antihypertensive treatment. Conversely, some patients with a normal clinic BP reading have a high awake ambulatory BP, described as 'masked hypertension'; the prevalence of this varies, but a meta-analysis carried out by Bangash & Agarwal reported a prevalence of 33% in CKD patients; therefore use of a single clinic BP measurement may also lead to under-treatment in high-risk patients.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease [^11727Ntj]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease for patients not receiving dialysis represents an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline on this topic. Development of this guideline update followed a rigorous process of evidence review and appraisal. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence. The strength of recommendations is based on the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, such as optimal blood pressure targets, lifestyle interventions, antihypertensive medications, and specific management in kidney transplant recipients and children. Some aspects of general and cardiovascular health, such as lipid and smoking management, are excluded. This guideline also introduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressure measurement since all large randomized trials targeting blood pressure with pivotal outcomes used standardized preparation and measurement protocols adhered to by patients and clinicians. Based on previous and new evidence, in particular the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) results, we propose a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg using standardized office reading for most people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, the exception being children and kidney transplant recipients. The goal of this guideline is to provide clinicians and patients a useful resource with actionable recommendations supplemented with practice points. The burden of the recommendations on patients and resources, public policy implications, and limitations of the evidence are taken into consideration. Lastly, knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are provided.

### Antihypertensive treatment for kidney transplant recipients [^114KYp4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The comparative effects of specific blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on patient-important outcomes following kidney transplantation are uncertain. Our 2009 Cochrane review found that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) improved graft function and prevented graft loss, while the evidence for other BP-lowering treatments was limited. This is an update of the 2009 Cochrane review.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different classes and combinations of antihypertensive drugs in kidney transplant recipients.

Search Methods

We contacted the Information Specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 3 July 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating any BP-lowering agent in recipients of a functioning kidney transplant for at least two weeks were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risks of bias and extracted data. Treatment estimates were summarised using the random-effects model and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) processes. The primary outcomes included all-cause death, graft loss, and kidney function.

Main Results

Ninety-seven studies (8706 participants) were included. One study evaluated treatment in children. The overall risk of bias was unclear to high across all domains. Compared to placebo or standard care alone, CCBs probably reduce all-cause death (23 studies, 3327 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) and graft loss (24 studies, 3577 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may make little or no difference to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (11 studies, 2250 participants: MD 1.89 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI −0.70 to 4.48; I² = 48%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (13 studies, 906 participants: RR 10.8, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.35; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). CCBs may reduce systolic BP (SBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD -5.83 mm Hg, 95% CI -10.24 to -1.42; I² = 13%; low certainty evidence) and diastolic BP (DBP) (3 studies, 329 participants: MD -3.98 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.98 to -1.99; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). CCBs have uncertain effects on proteinuria. Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) may make little or no difference to all-cause death (7 studies, 702 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.21; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), graft loss (6 studies, 718 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.13; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGFR (4 studies, 509 participants: MD −2.46 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI −7.66 to 2.73; I² = 64%; low certainty evidence) and acute rejection (4 studies, 388 participants: RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.04; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). ACEi may reduce proteinuria (5 studies, 441 participants: MD -0.33 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.01; I² = 67%; low certainty evidence) but had uncertain effects on SBP and DBP. Compared to placebo or standard care alone, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may make little or no difference to all-cause death (6 studies, 1041 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.31; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), eGRF (5 studies, 300 participants: MD −1.91 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI −6.20 to 2.38; I² = 57%; low certainty evidence), and acute rejection (4 studies, 323 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.29; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). ARBs may reduce graft loss (6 studies, 892 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), SBP (10 studies, 1239 participants: MD -3.73 mm Hg, 95% CI -7.02 to -0.44; I² = 63%; moderate certainty evidence) and DBP (9 studies, 1086 participants: MD -2.75 mm Hg, 95% CI -4.32 to -1.18; I² = 47%; moderate certainty evidence), but has uncertain effects on proteinuria. The effects of CCBs, ACEi or ARB compared to placebo or standard care alone on cardiovascular outcomes (including fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke) or other adverse events were uncertain. The comparative effects of ACEi plus ARB dual therapy, alpha-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone were rarely evaluated. Head-to-head comparisons of ACEi, ARB or thiazide versus CCB, ACEi versus ARB, CCB or ACEi versus alpha- or beta-blockers, or ACEi plus CCB dual therapy versus ACEi or CCB monotherapy were scarce. No studies reported outcome data for cancer or life participation.

Authors' Conclusions

For kidney transplant recipients, the use of CCB therapy to reduce BP probably reduces death and graft loss compared to placebo or standard care alone, while ARB may reduce graft loss. The effects of ACEi and ARB compared to placebo or standard care on other patient-centred outcomes were uncertain. The effects of dual therapy, alpha-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists compared to placebo or standard care alone and the comparative effects of different treatments were uncertain.

### A paradigm shift from office to home-based blood pressure measurement approaches in kidney transplant recipients [^115riHez]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The unattended blood pressure (BP) readings from home blood pressure (HBP) monitoring should provide more accurate BP readings than attended BP obtained from office blood pressure (OBP). Here, we review evidence supporting the clinical utility of HBP and automatic remote monitoring of blood pressure (ARM-BP) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR).

Recent Findings

BP from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM) is higher than but better associated with kidney and cardiovascular outcomes compared to OBP and HBP. While there is discordance of BP readings across different BP measurement methods causing BP misclassification, HBP provides BP readings closer to the readings from the 24-h ABPM than those from OBP. Systolic and diastolic BP is better controlled within 30days after utilizing ARM-BP.

Summary

Compared to OBP, HBP minimizes the attended effect of OBP, and its readings are closer to the gold standard 24-h ABPM. ARM-BP improves BP control in the short term and trials of longer follow-up duration are required to evaluate sustained clinical benefits in KTR. The paradigm of BP monitoring may shift toward HBP, while OBP may be utilized primarily for KTR who cannot perform HBP for hypertension diagnosis and management.

### Ambulatory blood pressure after renal transplantation [^111f6GbH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Renal transplantation has been a usual medical practice in developed countries for several decades. A large number of studies report the excellent results obtained with such a practice. The survival of the graft, although able to be improved, is excellent and gives a great deal of hope to patients with renal insufficiency. The high level of investigation into immunosuppressor drugs offers, almost continuously, more efficient and better tolerated products. Paradoxically, the usual problems of patients with a renal transplant are not immunological but cardiovascular. Elevated serum cholesterol levels, obesity, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are usual in these patients, arterial hypertension (AHT) being the most frequent. Nephrologists are increasingly using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on a daily basis. In the last 10 years, we have obtained highly valuable and interesting results with this technique which have allowed us to study and understand with greater precision the relationship of AHT to the kidney. Here we analyse and review the most relevant aspects of ABPM in the different stages of kidney disease, with special emphasis on renal transplantation.

KDIGO 2012 — kidney transplant recipients (CKD T) blood pressure recommendations state: We suggest that adult kidney transplant recipients whose office blood pressure (BP) is consistently > 130 mm Hg during systole or > 80 mm Hg during diastole be treated to maintain a BP that is consistently ≤ 130 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 80 mm Hg diastolic, irrespective of the level of urine albumin excretion (2D). In adult kidney transplant recipients, choose a BP-lowering agent after taking into account the time after transplantation, use of calcineurin inhibitors, presence or absence of persistent albuminuria, and other co-morbid conditions (Not Graded), and the document notes, "The first recommendation receives a grade of 2D, while the second recommendation is not graded".

### European best practice guidelines for renal transplantation. section IV: long-term management of the transplant recipient. IV.2.3 chronic graft dysfunction. non-alloimmune factors [^116KXEmg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

GUIDELINES. A. Whereas immunological mechanisms dominate in the initiation and propagation of the injury that leads to chronic allograft dysfunction and nephropathy, there is circumstantial evidence that non-immunological factors, such as advanced donor age, hyperfiltration, overweight, delayed graft function, heavy proteinuria, smoking, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, play a role as aggravating or progression factors. It is recommended to prevent or, if possible, treat all these factors. B. As arterial hypertension is very frequent among renal transplant patients and associated with increased graft (and patient) loss, it is recommended to aim at a blood pressure less than 130/85 mmHg in renal transplant patients and < 125/75 mmHg in recipients with proteinuria > 1 g/day.

HYPERTENSION IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

The 2023 ESH Guidelines also discuss in considerable length the management of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The guidelines discuss that kidney transplantation per se is associated with significant improvements in BP (8/5 mmHg in ambulatory BP) in the short- and mid-term post-transplant periods along with reduction in antihypertensive agents; as such, ambulatory BP in KTRs is significantly lower than that in carefully matched hemodialysis patients and similar to patients with CKD with matched kidney function. Despite these improvements, hypertension represents the most prevalent comorbidity post transplantation, with ABPM studies estimating hypertension prevalence in > 95% of KTRs. Elevated BP is associated with kidney function decline, target-organ damage, CV events and reduced graft and patient survival. As such, hypertension may play an important role towards the significantly higher residual CV risk in KTRs than in general population.

The Guidelines report evidence on commonly encountered misclassification of hypertension status by office BP in KTRs, mostly due to a particularly high proportion of masked hypertension (20%–40%). This is associated with frequently impaired dipping status (around 50%) and high rates of nocturnal hypertension (up to 70%–80%). As ambulatory BP is a much stronger predictor of kidney function decline and target organ damage than office BP in KTRs, the guidelines advocated increasing the use of ABPM in KTRs for diagnosis and management of hypertension. With regards to the pathogenesis of hypertension in KTRs, the Guidelines highlight its multifactorial nature, involving traditional risk factors, factors related to CKD (most commonly, impaired sodium handling and activation of RAS and sympathetic nervous system and factors related to transplantation and its treatment. Among major immunosuppressive classes, purine pathway inhibitors (mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus) do not affect BP control. The association of corticosteroid treatment with increased BP is emphasized, and partial activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol causing sodium retention is suggested as a main mechanism, while glucocorticoid avoidance or withdrawal protocols in KTRs are associated with better BP profile. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) are also associated with BP elevations, through increased sodium reabsorption via the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule and upregulation of vasoconstrictive substances leading to increased total peripheral resistance and vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles. The effects of tacrolimus on BP appear less pronounced compared with cyclosporine.

Cardiac and vascular complications — risk assessment and routine surveillance are outlined as follows: Evaluate cardiovascular risk on personal/family history, treatment exposures, and immunosuppression, noting that further surveillance, prevention and treatment should be tailored according to those individual risks. Measurement of blood pressure, weight, and BMI is advised at each survivorship visit. For patients with or at very high risk for cardiovascular disease, consultation with a cardiologist is listed, and patients with abnormal imaging studies or concerning symptoms should be referred for cardiology consultation.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^1139xS8B]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤ 140mmHg systolic and ≤ 90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤ 130mmHg systolic and ≤ 80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with end-stage renal disease treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, hypertension is very common and often poorly controlled. Blood pressure (BP) recordings obtained before or after hemodialysis display a J-shaped or U-shaped association with cardiovascular events and survival, but this most likely reflects the low accuracy of these measurements and the peculiar hemodynamic setting related with dialysis treatment. Elevated BP by home or ambulatory BP monitoring is clearly associated with shorter survival. Sodium and volume excess is the prominent mechanism of hypertension in dialysis patients, but other pathways, such as arterial stiffness, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, endothelial dysfunction, sleep apnea and the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents may also be involved. Nonpharmacologic interventions targeting sodium and volume excess are fundamental for hypertension control in this population. If BP remains elevated after appropriate treatment of sodium-volume excess, the use of antihypertensive agents is necessary. Drug treatment in the dialysis population should take into consideration the patient's comorbidities and specific characteristics of each agent, such as dialysability. This document is an overview of the diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension in patients on dialysis, aiming to offer the renal physician practical recommendations based on current knowledge and expert opinion and to highlight areas for future research.

### Pathogenesis and management of hypertension after kidney transplantation [^1163dw2S]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Arterial hypertension is frequently encountered after renal transplantation and is associated not only with increased cardiovascular complications but also with decreased allograft survival. Adequate blood pressure control is, thus, as essential as immunologic surveillance for the long-term transplant care. Nevertheless, randomized control trials assessing treatment targets in these patients are not available and most of the evidence comes from studies in patients with native chronic kidney disease or the general population. In this regard, the renal transplant recipient is treated according to recommendations that are applicable to nontransplanted individuals at high cardiovascular risk. However, the accepted treatment targets for the nontransplanted population are recently being disputed and this makes the management of posttransplant hypertension even more challenging.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension after kidney transplantation — epidemiology and evidence summary: Hypertension is common after kidney transplantation because of pre-existing kidney disease, effects of immunosuppressive medications, and presence of allograft pathology, and calcineurin inhibitor–based immunosuppression regimens are associated with a high (70% to 90%) prevalence of hypertension. A systematic review did not find that any BP-lowering medication class reduced the risk of graft loss, withdrawal because of adverse events, death, cardiovascular outcomes, or kidney outcomes compared with placebo or other drug classes. One trial of 188 kidney transplant recipients randomized patients to spironolactone versus placebo for 3 years and found no difference in kidney function or proteinuria, and overall, there is insufficient evidence to support specific recommendations on BP targets or recommended agents for kidney transplant recipients.

### Assessment and management of hypertension in transplant patients [^112xUzed]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension in renal transplant recipients is common and ranges from 50% to 80% in adult recipients and from 47% to 82% in pediatric recipients. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and shortened allograft survival are important consequences of inadequate control of hypertension. In this review, we examine the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management considerations of post-transplant hypertension. Donor and recipient factors, acute and chronic allograft injury, and immunosuppressive medications may each explain some of the pathophysiology of post-transplant hypertension. As observed in other patient cohorts, renal artery stenosis and adrenal causes of hypertension may be important contributing factors. Notably, BP treatment goals for renal transplant recipients remain an enigma because there are no adequate randomized controlled trials to support a benefit from targeting lower BP levels on graft and patient survival. The potential for drug-drug interactions and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the different antihypertensive medications need to be carefully considered. To date, no specific antihypertensive medications have been shown to be more effective than others at improving either patient or graft survival. Identifying the underlying pathophysiology and subsequent individualization of treatment goals are important for improving long-term patient and graft outcomes in these patients.

### Management of hypertension in renal transplant patients: a comprehensive review of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment strategies [^112Q7rBj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the guidelines and literature for the treatment of hypertension in renal transplant patients and to provide guidance to practitioners in the selection of appropriate nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options.

Data Sources

A PubMed search (January 1948-March 2010) was performed using the search terms hypertension, antihypertensive agents, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease, in combination with renal transplant and kidney transplant. The search was limited to articles published in English. All relevant peer-reviewed original studies, meta-analyses, guidelines, consensus statements, and review articles were examined. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All literature found was evaluated for inclusion. Review articles as well as prospective and retrospective original research articles were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Hypertension after solid organ transplantation is a problem commonly encountered in patients during their posttransplantation clinic visits. Effective management of these patients' hypertension is crucial, as hypertension left untreated may lead to increased morbidity and mortality as well as graft loss. The unique, multifactorial etiology of hypertension in this population makes treatment choices more challenging compared to treatment of a nontransplant patient. Therefore, to guide practitioners in this process, we developed a hypertension management protocol, taking into account the unique considerations faced in the adult renal transplant population. The review guides practitioners from the initial assessment of patients' hypertension through the evaluation and selection of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options and provides information about the discontinuation of certain antihypertensive medications. It also provides a concise, but comprehensive review of the major antihypertensive drug classes and economic considerations.

Conclusions

The management of hypertension in posttransplantation patients is challenging and complicated, yet necessary to prevent morbidity, mortality, and graft loss for these patients. Therapy should be individualized based on patient assessment, response to previous therapy, and economic considerations.

Kidney transplantation — implementation issues: Achieving a BP goal in patients after kidney transplantation is often challenging due to the hypertensive effects of calcineurin inhibitors and steroids and the presence of reduced eGFR, diseased native kidneys, and weight gain. CCBs help counteract the arteriolar vasoconstriction of calcineurin inhibitors and are a first-line therapy; however, they may need to be used with caution due to some drug-drug interactions with immunosuppression agents. For example, Moes et al performed a brief crossover trial and noted similar BP control for chlorthalidone and amlodipine, with slightly lower eGFRs but less proteinuria with chlorthalidone and more lower-extremity edema with amlodipine.

Guideline 6.1– KTR: hypertension

We suggest that the management of hypertension take into account that:

Clinic blood pressure should be < 140/90 mmHg in clinic (130/80 mmHg if PCR > 50 or ACR > 35) (2C)
Home blood pressure recordings and 24-h ambulatory recordings may be helpful in some instances but lower BP targets should then be set (home and or ambulatory daytime measures < 135/80 mmHg) (2D)
There is no evidence that any antihypertensive agent is better than any other and effort should be focused on achieving absolute levels rather than the use of individual agents (2D)
Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may be more effective in the minimisation of proteinuria but they should be used with caution in the first 3 months post transplant (2C)
Resistant hypertension may be due to transplant renal artery stenosis and should be investigated according to local practice (2D)

### Cardiovascular functional reserve before and after kidney transplant… [^115epbUN]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

P value for comparison among the 3 groups at 1-year follow-up with time × group interaction using analysis of variance. Question How is kidney transplant associated with cardiovascular functional reserve. Findings In this cohort study of 166 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease and 87 patients with hypertension only to assess change to cardiovascular functional reserve after improving the uremic milieu through a kidney transplant using state-of-the-art cardiopulmonary exercise testing, improved cardiovascular functional reserve was seen 1 year after kidney transplant in the absence of significant alterations in left ventricular morphologic findings. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that kidney transplant is associated with improved cardiovascular functional reserve after 1 year. In addition, cardiopulmonary exercise testing was sensitive enough to detect a decline in cardiovascular functional reserve in wait-listed patients with CKD.

Improved V̇O₂max may in part be independent from structural alterations of the heart and depend more on ultrastructural changes after reversal of uremia. We hypothesized that kidney transplant is significantly associated with improvement in cardiovascular functional reserve. We conducted the prospective Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Renal Failure and After Kidney Transplantation study to characterize changes in cardiovascular reserve using state-of-the-art CPET technology before and after kidney transplant in patients with ESRD who underwent kidney transplant compared with control individuals with ESRD who have not undergone kidney transplant and controls with hypertension and preserved kidney function. Patients were assessed at baseline, 2 months, and 1 year.

Patients with ESRD who were aged 18 years or older and undergoing kidney transplant at the University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom, were enrolled within the 4 weeks preceding transplant. Patients were included in the HTC group because of the near-ubiquitous presence of hypertension in patients with advanced CKD. 12 Patients in the HTC group were recruited through a primary care database. Patients with preexisting chronic lung disease were excluded. Taken together, the marked changes in measures of functional cardiovascular reserve and the subtle difference in LVEF in the absence of other significant structural echocardiographic changes reported here suggest that the reduction in cardiovascular mortality associated with kidney transplant may be explained by improved cardiovascular functional reserve.

5, 7 In addition, these results provide evidence that CPET-derived measures of cardiovascular functional reserve are more sensitive than left ventricular geometric measures for detecting cardiovascular improvement or decline or for risk determination in patients with CKD with shifting GFRs.

Clinical and laboratory outpatient monitoring is an important tool in the prevention and management of complications associated with kidney transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy. In the absence of standard protocols for outpatient surveillance of kidney transplant recipients, recommendations for frequency and type of monitoring are determined by the likelihood of problems that are unique to the individual transplant recipient and the particular posttransplantation period. In addition, it is imperative to maintain the transplant recipient's overall health by screening for conditions or diseases that can be linked to prior renal disease, immunosuppressive therapies, and general health maintenance.

### Usefulness of ambulatory blood pressure measurement for hypertension management in India: the India ABPM study [^1112j1kk]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Masked hypertension

In 2011, NICE in the UK implemented the use of ABPM in their guidelines "Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management". The recommendation applies to cases where OBPM is 140/90 mmHg or higher as this could help to filter out cases of WCH and, therefore, reduce healthcare costs because of reduction in unnecessary treatment. Unfortunately, this recommendation does not cover cases of MH. However, in contradiction to what is often believed it cannot be assumed that OBPM is lower than ABPM so that patients with normal OBPM may benefit from additional ABPM. Standard ABPM performance in all subjects might seem costly and a logistically inconvenient procedure. However, as patients with MH have similar risks as those with hypertension, their treatment may lead to an overall reduction of cardiovascular events and thus in reduced burden for healthcare.

ABPM for clinical healthcare

The present study also reveals that over 80% of treated patients have uncontrolled hypertension based on ABPM (Supplement 4), and thus emphasises the importance of proper BP measurement after hypertension has been diagnosed. The fact that 31% of the OBPM results in the present study differ from ABPM for diagnosing hypertension, together with the overwhelming evidence of ABPM's superiority over OBPM as a cardiovascular risk predictor, pleads for the use of ABPM in standard hypertension management. This statement is supported in the latest guidelines from both the European and American cardiovascular authorities.

The use of ABPM in hypertension management has proven its value in India not only for adults but also showed to be beneficial for use among children. In a paediatric clinic in India, ABPM was performed in children with incidental high OBPM, chronic kidney disease, renal transplant, solitary kidney, renal transplant or post-op for co-arction of the aorta. This resulted in the finding of WCH and MH in 27% and 21% of cases, respectively. In addition, ABPM resulted in change of management in 26% of cases, which supports the use of ABPM in paediatric care.

### Hypertension and cardiomyopathy associated with chronic kidney disease: epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment considerations [^1168LakM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure target in chronic kidney disease

Prior to publication of the SPRINT trial results, most societies and guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg with some suggesting higher thresholds for the elderly and lower thresholds for those at higher high risk including patients with diabetic mellitus and patients with CKD. It is now recognised that more intensive blood pressure reduction strategies are effective and safe. The SPRINT investigators reported a 25% lower risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke and 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality when treating to a target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mmHg compared to the standard target of 140 mmHg. This was associated with an increase in complications such as lower serum potassium, sodium, and syncopal episodes, but no increased risk of falls. Treatment of hypertension in those with CKD, which formed 28% of the SPRINT cohort, was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality, with no adverse effects on kidney function or increased risk of dialysis. Elderly patients aged over 75 years old also sustained benefit from more intensive blood pressure control.

These data have resulted in lowering of both American and European blood pressure targets in their respective 2017 and 2018 hypertension guidelines. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 guideline on the management of blood pressure in CKD also recommends an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mmHg or less in patients with CKD (excluding those with a functioning kidney transplant) with an emphasis on standardised office blood pressure measurement and lifestyle interventions such as salt restriction and moderate-intensity exercise (Fig. 7).

In response to the 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for blood pressure management in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in hypertension and transplant nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The overriding message was the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations. For patients with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria, goal blood pressure has been relaxed to ≤ 140/90 mm Hg for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In contrast, KDIGO continues to recommend goal blood pressure ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for patients with chronic kidney disease with moderately or severely increased albuminuria and for all renal transplant recipients regardless of the presence of proteinuria, without supporting data. The expert panel thought the KDIGO recommendations were generally reasonable but lacking in sufficient evidence support and that additional studies are greatly needed.

### Diagnostic performance of office versus ambulatory blood pressure in kidney transplant recipients [^113TM9PQ]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most prominent risk factor in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). No study so far assessed in parallel the prevalence, control, and phenotypes of blood pressure (BP) or the accuracy of currently recommended office BP diagnostic thresholds in diagnosing elevated ambulatory BP in KTRs.

Methods

205 stable KTRs underwent office BP measurements and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Hypertension was defined as follows: (1) office BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive agents following the current European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines, (2) office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive agents following the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, (3) ABPM ≥ 130/80 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive agents, and (4) ABPM ≥ 125/75 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive agents.

Results

Hypertension prevalence by office BP was 88.3% with ESC/ESH and 92.7% with ACC/AHA definitions compared to 94.1 and 98.5% at relevant ABPM thresholds. Control rates among hypertensive patients were 69.6 and 43.7% with office BP compared to 38.3 and 21.3% with ABPM, respectively. Both for prevalence (κ-statistics = 0.52, p < 0.001 and 0.32, and p < 0.001) and control rates (κ-statistics = 0.21, p < 0.001 and 0.22, and p < 0.001, respectively), there was moderate or fair agreement of the 2 techniques. White-coat and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 6.7 and 39.5% of patients at the 140/90 threshold and 5.9 and 31.7% of patients at the 130/80 threshold. An office BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg had 35.3% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity for the diagnosis of 24-h BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. An office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg had 59.7% sensitivity and 73.9% specificity for the diagnosis of 24-h BP ≥ 125/75 mm Hg. Receiver operating curve analyses confirmed this poor diagnostic performance.

Conclusions

At both corresponding thresholds studied, ABPM revealed particularly high hypertension prevalence and poor BP control in KTRs. Misclassification of KTRs by office BP is substantial, due to particularly high rates of masked hypertension. The diagnostic accuracy of office BP for identifying elevated ambulatory BP is poor. These findings call for a wider use of ABPM in KTRs.

Target blood pressure in patients with CKD with dialysis

The 2021 KDIGO Guideline recommends a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg for kidney transplant recipients. This recommendation is based on expert opinion, as no clinical trials have investigated the relationship between this BP target and adverse clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, it has been reported that lower BP has been associated with eGFR decline, CKD progression, and acute kidney injury events in kidney transplant recipients. A more conservative target is suggested, as kidney transplant recipients with a single kidney may be more vulnerable to these adverse effects. This recommendation aligns with the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline on hypertension, which also proposes a BP target of ≤ 130/80 mmHg for kidney transplant recipients.

Considering the context of Mexico and Latin America, the following strategies for BP goals in patients with CKD are proposed:
Adopt standardized BP measurement according to KDIGO guidelines: This strategy is based on ensuring accurate and consistent BP readings for patients living with CKD, considering factors such as resting, avoiding caffeine, exercising, and smoking before BP measurement.
Address challenges in performing standardized BP measurements in clinical practice: Due to time constraints and institution-specific clinical policies, it may be difficult to perform standardized BP measurements; however, it is essential to prioritize accurate BP readings for patients living with CKD.
Recognize the white coat effect on office BP readings: Non-standardized office BP readings can be significantly higher than standardized BP measurements, which can affect treatment decisions for patients living with CKD. In this context, home BP monitoring can help to eliminate the "white coat" effect by providing a more accurate assessment of BP levels.
Be cautious when applying SBP targets to non-standardized BP measurements: As previously discussed, applying an SBP target of < 120 mmHg can lead to overtreatment and increased adverse events in patients living with CKD. Therefore, most patients living with CKD should achieve and maintain BP levels < 130/80 mmHg as this target ensures a well-tolerated BP for most patients.
Implement improved BP measurement methods in clinical settings: Creating specialized areas for standardized BP measurement and employing trained nursing staff can ensure accurate BP readings for patients with CKD in clinical settings.
Involve health authorities in promoting health goals and continuous training: Health authorities should support the achievement of health goals, reduce long-term expenditure, and provide continuous training for medical professionals to ensure the best possible care for patients living with CKD.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in CKD [^1154mcBH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 13 of the 21 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that nonpharmacological interventions should play a significant role in the management of hypertension in patients with CKD. We also agreed that the approach to the management of hypertension in elderly patients with CKD should be individualized and take into account comorbid conditions to avoid adverse outcomes from excessive BP lowering. In contrast to KDIGO, the CSN Work Group believes there is insufficient evidence to target a lower BP for nondiabetic CKD patients based on the presence and severity of albuminuria. The CSN Work Group concurs with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) recommendation of a target BP for all non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients without diabetes of ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic. Similarly, it is our position that in diabetic patients with CKD and normal urinary albumin excretion, raising the threshold for treatment from < 130 mmHg systolic BP to < 140 mm Hg systolic BP could increase stroke risk and the risk of worsening kidney disease. The CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP and the Canadian Diabetic Association recommendation for diabetic patients with CKD with or without albuminuria to continue to be treated to a BP target similar to that of the overall diabetes population, aiming for BP levels < 130/80 mm Hg. Consistent with this, the CSN Work Group endorses a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients with a kidney transplant. Finally, in the absence of evidence for a lower BP target, the CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP recommendation to target BP < 140/90 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients with a kidney transplant.

Kidney transplant recipients — intensive blood pressure lowering and target considerations: There is no strong evidence from observational studies or clinical trials to suggest that intensive lowering of BP improves graft outcomes, and prescribing additional drugs to achieve a target BP of < 130/80 mm Hg should be balanced with considerations surrounding adherence, side effects, and drug-drug interactions.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^116ikg13]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The goal of treatment of hypertension in KTR is to reduce the risk of the cardiovascular complications of hypertension (stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmia) and to preserve or minimise the rate of long term decline in graft function. Blood pressure targets and strategies for treatment should be tailored to the individual patient taking into account proteinuria, the presence of end organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, potential side effect profile of antihypertensive therapy, immunosuppression, and any other relevant lifestyle factors such as safety in pregnancy in female KTRs of childbearing age.

Hypertension is common following kidney transplantation and is associated with reduced graft and patient survival. Many patients require treatment with more than one antihypertensive agent and despite therapy many patients fail to meet treatment targets. Hypertension is a side effect of immunosuppressive therapy, in particular corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, and may also be a consequence of poor graft function leading to salt and water retention. Defining the target optimal target blood pressure in KTRs is challenging and is mainly based on observations made from retrospective registry studies. When office/clinic blood pressure is felt to be unrepresentative of actually blood pressure (such as suspected 'white coat' hypertension, resistant hypertension), home recordings or ambulatory monitoring can be useful, but most studies demonstrate lower measures with these methods and revised targets should be set. Resistant hypertension, often defined in the general population as clinic BP > 160/90 mmHg on 3 or more antihypertensive agents is common in KTR and suggests that further work up is required to exclude transplant renal artery stensosis, non-compliance, or rarer causes of secondary hypertension e.g. primary aldosteronism or phaeochromocytoma. In the general population, there has been a move towards more frequent use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure measurements for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. This is a reasonable strategy for KTRs with the proviso that KTRs are known to be at higher risk of the complications of hypertension and there should be a low threshold for therapeutic intervention when blood pressure targets are exceeded. Where resistant hypertension is suspected, target end organ damage should be assessed using echocardiography to look for the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Strategies to reduce clinical inertia in hypertensive kidney transplant recipients [^115AhsQa]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have shown that higher blood pressures are associated with reduced kidney allograft and patient survival. For every 10 mmHg higher systolic pressure graft loss is increased by 12–15%. The guidelines recommend blood pressure targets of < 130/85 mmHg. Despite these guidelines many patients have blood pressures above this level.

Blood pressure is difficult to control in kidney transplant recipients in part because of the associated immunosuppressive medication, impaired graft function, older age, obesity and diabetes mellitus. Many studies however report that clinicians under treat patients. The literature describes the phenomena of clinical inertia when physicians fail to initiate or intensify therapy when warranted. There is a growing literature on clinical inertia and hypertension in the general population but less is known in the kidney transplant population.

In a recent American Heart Association scientific statement, the authors point out the shortcomings of auscultatory office blood pressures in the clinical practice despite their long standing importance in clinical research. Patients commonly report that their blood pressures are better at home and are aware of the white coat phenomena. Many clinics are not performing research quality blood pressure measurements. For these reasons clinicians may doubt the precision or certainty of the measurement and a therapeutic change will be deferred. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are one strategy to increase diagnostic accuracy and may better predict outcomes. Unfortunately 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not convenient, especially for patients traveling great distances. One automated device that meets hypertension standards and that can be used in the office is the BpTRU automated device. The mean difference between the reference standard systolic and BpTRU systolic measurement in one study was 0.47 ± 5.4 mmHg with 89.2% of the measurements within 5 mmHg. The BpTRU was also a better estimate of ambulatory blood pressures than routine office measurements We introduced the BpTRU device in our clinic on the recommendation of our hospital hypertension experts. In this report we describe our experience with the device and explore the impact on therapeutic changes in hypertensive kidney transplant recipients.

The 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline on the monitoring, management, and treatment of kidney transplant recipients is intended to assist the practitioner caring for adults and children after kidney transplantation. The guideline development process followed an evidence-based approach, and management recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant treatment trials. Critical appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The guideline makes recommendations for immunosuppression and graft monitoring, as well as prevention and treatment of infection, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and other complications that are common in kidney transplant recipients, including hematological and bone disorders. Limitations of the evidence, especially the lack of definitive clinical outcome trials, are discussed and suggestions are provided for future research. This summary includes a brief description of methodology and the complete guideline recommendations but does not include the rationale and references for each recommendation, which are published elsewhere.

### Recent insights from studies using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in patients with renal disease [^113VDm6P]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To identify and evaluate recent (2000–2003) published studies employing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in patients with chronic renal failure, on dialysis, and after renal transplantation.

Recent Findings

We discuss several studies that have employed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to refine the analysis of the link between blood pressure levels, and diurnal alterations, and end-organ damage or patient survival. There is now some evidence that an abnormal diurnal blood pressure profile, although intrinsically not a very reproducible label, has predictive value for patient survival, and that the non-dipping phenomenon is linked to a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and autonomic dysfunction.

Summary

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring remains an important adjunct to the comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation of patients with chronic, end-stage renal failure or after renal transplantation.

### Hypertension after kidney transplant [^1115B9ta]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension in kidney transplant recipients is a major "traditional" risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death and a major factor in death-censored graft failure in transplant recipients. The blood pressure achieved after transplant is related inversely to postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with many patients experiencing a significant improvement in blood pressure control with fewer medications within months of surgery. However, the benefits of improved GFR and fluid status may be affected by the immunosuppression regimen. Immunosuppressive agents affect hypertension through a variety of mechanisms, including catechol- and endothelin-induced vasoconstriction, abrogation of nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation, and sodium retention. Most notable is the role of calcineurin inhibitors in promoting hypertension, cyclosporine more so than tacrolimus. Additionally, the combination of calcineurin- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitor therapy is synergistically nephrotoxic and promotes hypertension, whereas steroid withdrawal and minimization strategies seem to have little or no impact on hypertension. Other important causes of hypertension after transplant, beyond a progressive decrease in GFR, include transplant renal artery stenosis and sequelae of antibody-mediated rejection. Calcium channel blockers may be the most useful medication for mitigating calcineurin inhibitor-induced vasoconstriction, and use of such agents may be associated with improvements in GFR. Use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, remains an attractive strategy for many transplant recipients, although some recipients may have significant adverse effects associated with these medications, including decreased GFR, hyperkalemia, and anemia. In conclusion, hypertension control affects both patient and long-term transplant survival, and its best management requires careful analysis of causes and close monitoring of therapies.

### Hypertension in dialysis patients: a consensus document by the European renal and cardiovascular medicine (EURECA-M) working group of the European renal association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the hypertension and the kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1144Y8KL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, hypertension is common and often poorly controlled. Blood pressure (BP) recordings obtained before or after haemodialysis display a J- or U-shaped association with cardiovascular events and survival, but this most likely reflects the low accuracy of these measurements and the peculiar haemodynamic setting related to dialysis treatment. Elevated BP detected by home or ambulatory BP monitoring is clearly associated with shorter survival. Sodium and volume excess is the prominent mechanism of hypertension in dialysis patients, but other pathways, such as arterial stiffness, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, endothelial dysfunction, sleep apnoea and the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents may also be involved. Non-pharmacologic interventions targeting sodium and volume excess are fundamental for hypertension control in this population. If BP remains elevated after appropriate treatment of sodium and volume excess, the use of antihypertensive agents is necessary. Drug treatment in the dialysis population should take into consideration the patient's comorbidities and specific characteristics of each agent, such as dialysability. This document is an overview of the diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension in patients on dialysis, aiming to offer the renal physician practical recommendations based on current knowledge and expert opinion and to highlight areas for future research.

### Strategies to reduce clinical inertia in hypertensive kidney transplant recipients [^112hH3St]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although there are no randomized control trials in the kidney transplant population there is a wealth of cohort data and considerable evidence in the general population supporting blood pressure control to preserve kidney function and reduce mortality. It is not clear from this small single center retrospective review whether an automated device or other strategies to increase measurement certainty will reduce clinical inertia over the long run and improve overall patient outcomes. This degree of evidence would require a large randomized trial. Nonetheless we hope this study encourages others to scrutinize their practice and consider the necessary steps to ensure that blood pressure targets are achieved with the ultimate goal of increasing patient and allograft survival.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^115L5kxh]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 6.1 – KTR: hypertension

We suggest that the management of hypertension take into account that:
Blood pressure should be recorded at each clinic visit (1C)
Clinic blood pressure should be < 140/90 mmHg in clinic (130/80 mmHg if PCR > 50 or ACR > 35) (2C)
Home blood pressure recordings and 24-h ambulatory recordings may be helpful in some instances but lower BP targets should then be set (home and or ambulatory daytime measures < 135/80 mmHg) (2D)
There is no evidence that any antihypertensive agent is better than any other and effort should be focused on achieving absolute blood pressure control rather than the use of individual agents (2D)
Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may be more effective in the minimisation of proteinuria but should be used with caution in the first 3 months post-transplant (2C)
Resistant hypertension may be due to transplant renal artery stenosis and should be investigated according to local practice (2D)

Guideline 6.2 – KTR: dyslipidaemia

We suggest that the management of dyslipidaemia take into account that:
Fasting lipid levels should be measured on an annual basis in renal transplant recipients (2C)
Treatment targets should be the same as in the general population (2C)
KTRs at increased primary or secondary cardiovascular risk receive statin therapy to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (2C)
The choice and dose of statin should take into account concurrent immunosuppression. High dose simvastatin (≥ 40 mg daily) should be avoided in conjunction with ciclosporin and/calcium channel antagonists (2D)

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113Bznor]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension after kidney transplantation — evidence summary: Hypertension is common after kidney transplantation because of pre-existing kidney disease, effects of immunosuppressive medications, and presence of allograft pathology. Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression regimens are associated with a high (70% to 90%) prevalence of hypertension. There are no robust trials in post-transplant patients comparing different BP targets or drug choices. A systematic review did not find that any BP-lowering medication class reduced the risk of graft loss, withdrawal because of adverse events, death, cardiovascular outcomes, or kidney outcomes compared with placebo/other drug classes. One trial of 188 kidney transplant recipients randomized patients to spironolactone versus placebo for 3 years and found no difference in kidney function or proteinuria. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support specific recommendations on BP targets or recommended agents for kidney transplant recipients.

### Elevated blood pressure and risk of end-stage renal disease in subjects without baseline kidney disease… [^113JTnvF]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

During 8 210 431 person-years of follow-up, 1149 cases of ESRD occurred. We defined ESRD as receipt of renal transplantation or maintenance dialysis. We identified cases of ESRD by matching our cohort against the nationally comprehensive US Renal Data System registry data. 5 Matching was performed blinded to exposure status using subjects' Social Security number, first and last names, sex, and date of birth. We chose as our outcome all-cause ESRD rather than only ESRD ascribed to hypertension, because previous studies9, 13 have shown that the diagnosis of "ESRD due to hypertension" is highly unreliable. Compared with subjects with a blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg, the adjusted relative risk of developing ESRD increased 1. 6-fold for subjects with blood pressures of 120 to 129/80 to 84 mm Hg,
2. 0-fold for subjects with blood pressures of 130 to 139.

Our study had sufficient power to demonstrate that the risk of ESRD is increased even with relatively modest elevations of blood pressure. Specifically, we found that compared with those with blood pressures less than 120/80 mm Hg, individuals with blood pressure of 120 to 129/80 to 84 mm Hg were 62% more likely and those with blood pressure of 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg were 98% more likely to develop ESRD. Hence, proof that elevated blood pressure is a causal risk factor of ESRD by observing the effect of interrupting this risk factor cannot be easily accomplished using a randomized trial approach. Intriguingly, in randomized trials, antihypertensive therapy did not appear to reduce the incidence of less severe cases of renal dysfunction.

14, 15 Second, because of the large differences between the absolute risk of ESRD and absolute risk of cardiovascular disease, in a competing mortality paradigm, modest absolute reductions in cardiovascular mortality through implementation of available cardiovascular therapies may contribute to significant relative increases in ESRD incidence because patients survive longer and therefore develop kidney failure. This study provides the strongest epidemiologic evidence to date that nonmalignant hypertension is indeed an independent risk factor for ESRD. Risk is increased even with relatively modest elevations in blood pressure. Notably, the observed relationship does not appear to be due to confounding by clinically evident baseline kidney disease. Improved control of blood pressure and better understanding of other contributors to the worsening epidemic of ESRD are needed to reduce the worldwide burden of kidney disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^113n4Snd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO blood pressure management in chronic kidney disease emphasizes evidence gaps and debated targets. The evidence base is limited, with "no 1A recommendations" and a "serious paucity of evidence". For patients with CKD without diabetes, KDIGO "Recommendations 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2" state to treat to "a systolic blood pressure ≤ 130 mm Hg (2C and 2D)", which "may result in less albuminuria than a less stringent goal of < 140 mm Hg", but it is "hard to show the benefit at the 130-mm Hg systolic goal". The commentary notes "it makes intuitive sense to recommend measures to reduce body mass index in obese patients (Recommendation 2.3.1)", yet "the better survival of dialysis patients with higher body mass index gives one pause about a blanket implementation of this recommendation", and "while sodium restriction is beneficial for most, it may worsen renal function after renal transplantation or with salt-losing tubulopathies". Evidence from trials remains limited; "Lower systolic blood pressure goals did not protect kidney function in diabetic patients in the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) Study", and ongoing research is highlighted: "SPRINT is > 90% through recruitment and should address the 140- versus 120-mm Hg systolic pressure treatment goal in nondiabetic patients with CKD, including the elderly".

### Treatment of hypertension in renal transplant recipients [^115Z5Pgg]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension is very common in renal transplant recipients and is a significant risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular diseases and for development of graft dysfunction.

Recent Findings

Recent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension (Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure VI Report and World Health Organization Guidelines) do not directly address post-transplant hypertension. Specific recommendations for the drug treatment of hypertension in renal allograft recipients have not been given in the Clinical Practice Guidelines of the American Society of Transplantation or those of the European Renal Association.

Summary

The present paper summarizes some important aspects of post-transplant hypertension and discusses potential treatment strategies aimed at reducing blood pressure and thus improving patient and allograft survival.

### Management of kidney transplant recipients for primary care practitioners [^1173ckfT]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Improved Graft Outcome: Patients whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) was initially above 140 mmHg one year after transplantation but then lowered to ≤ 140 mmHg by three years had significantly better long-term graft survival compared to those who maintained high SBP levels.
Long-Term Graft Survival: Lowering SBP after the third-year post transplantation was linked to improved 10-year graft survival.
Temporary Increase in SBP: Even a temporary increase in SBP at three years post-transplantation was associated with worse graft survival.
Cardiovascular Death: Changes in SBP were linked to changes in cardiovascular death rates, particularly among recipients under 50 years old, but this pattern was not observed among older recipients.

The desired target for blood pressure following a kidney transplant during the later post-transplant period (typically after 2–3 weeks) remains uncertain due to a lack of randomized controlled studies. For long-term management, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend targeting blood pressure below < 130/80 mmHg. Effectively managing uncontrolled hypertension in transplant recipients requires a comprehensive approach that involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods used in the general population.

For most kidney transplant recipients, the initial recommended treatment consists of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine or nifedipine. These medications have demonstrated their ability to reduce the risk of graft loss and minimize the vasoconstriction caused by CNIs. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with a calcium channel blocker, additional antihypertensive drugs can be added as necessary. The choice of a second-line treatment is generally influenced by the patient's existing health conditions and the time elapsed since the transplant.

In patients with proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) may offer potential benefits. However, caution is advised, and these medications should be avoided during the early stages after transplantation (within the first three to six months). This is due to the potential combination of ACEi and calcineurin inhibitor-induced vasoconstriction, which could lead to a decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potential risk of hyperkalemia. Furthermore, during the initial post-transplant period, the increase in serum creatinine levels could complicate the accurate detection of acute rejection.

### Blood pressure measurement: a KDOQI perspective [^113ghkYQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevated blood pressure (BP). In patients with CKD, hypertension is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, progression of CKD, and all-cause mortality. New guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend new thresholds and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in patients with and without CKD. A new aspect of the guidelines is the recommendation for measurement of out-of-office BP to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and guide therapy. In this KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) perspective, we review the recommendations for accurate BP measurement in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring. Regardless of location, validated devices and appropriate cuff sizes should be used. In the clinic and at home, proper patient preparation and positioning are critical. Patients should receive information about the importance of BP measurement techniques and be encouraged to advocate for adherence to guideline recommendations. Implementing appropriate BP measurement in routine practice is feasible and should be incorporated in system-wide efforts to improve the care of patients with hypertension. Hypertension is the number 1 chronic disease risk factor in the world; BP measurements in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring should adhere to recommendations from the AHA.

### Role of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients [^115MhcPd]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular events are one of the leading causes of mortality in kidney transplant recipients. Hypertension is the most common comorbidity accompanying chronic kidney disease, with prevalence remaining as high as 90% even after kidney transplantation. It is often poorly controlled. Abnormal blood pressure profiles, such as masked or white-coat hypertension, are also extremely common in these patients. The pathophysiology of blood pressure elevation in kidney transplant recipients is complex and includes transplantation-specific risk factors, which are added to the traditional or chronic kidney disease-related factors. Despite these observations, hypertension management has been an under-researched area in kidney transplantation. Thus, relevant evidence derives either from studies in the general population or from small trials in kidney transplant recipients. Based on the relevant guidelines in the general population, lifestyle modifications should probably be applied as the first step of hypertension management in kidney transplant recipients. The optimal pharmacological management of hypertension in kidney transplant recipients is also not clear. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are commonly used as first line agents because of their lack of adverse effects on the kidney, while other antihypertensive drug classes are under-utilised due to fear of the possible haemodynamic consequences on renal function. This review summarizes the existing data on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognostic significance and management of hypertension in kidney transplantation.

### Hypertension in kidney transplantation: a consensus statement of the 'hypertension and the kidney' working group of the European Society of Hypertension [^115syDJD]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is common in kidney transplantation recipients and may be difficult to treat. Factors present before kidney transplantation, related to the transplantation procedure itself and factors developing after transplantation may contribute to blood pressure (BP) elevation in kidney transplant recipients. The present consensus is based on the results of three recent systematic reviews, the latest guidelines and the current literature. The current transplant guidelines, which recommend only office BP assessments for risk stratification in kidney transplant patients should be reconsidered, given the presence of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension in this population and the better prediction of adverse outcomes by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring as indicated in recent systematic reviews. Hypertension is associated with adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes and decreased survival in kidney transplant recipients. Current evidence suggests calcium channel blockers could be the preferred first-step antihypertensive agents in kidney transplant patients, as they improve graft function and reduce graft loss, whereas no clear benefit is documented for renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use over conventional treatment in the current literature. Randomized control trials demonstrating the clinical benefits of BP lowering on kidney and major cardiovascular events and recording patient-related outcomes are still needed. These trials should define optimal BP targets for kidney transplant recipients. In the absence of kidney transplant-specific evidence, BP targets in kidney transplant recipients should be similar to those in the wider chronic kidney disease population.

### Implementation of guidelines for metabolic syndrome control in kidney transplant recipients: results at a single center [^1153CYJC]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Of patients in group II who had HbA1C measurements, 46.2% had HbA1C > 7%. As HbA1C was tested primarily for monitoring pre-diagnosed diabetic patients, higher values were expected.

More patients with high fasting glucose levels were treated with medications through 2008–2011 than during the earlier period (Fig. 1 d). Still, success of DM control was lower in group II patients, maybe reflecting the higher percentage of patients undergoing transplantation because of DM. When comparing glucose levels of patients not treated for diabetes, no significant difference was found between the two FU periods (Fig. 1 e).

Blood pressure

During the late 90's, BP target was 140/90, but adherence to the target was less strict. In addition, the emphasis was primarily on diastolic blood pressure, and treatment for isolated systolic hypertension was recommended only when above 160 mmHg. KDIGO guidelines recommend target blood-pressure in kidney recipients of < 130 mmHg systolic and < 80 mmHg diastolic. Blood pressure was assessed as a categorical variable, in order to differentiate controlled vs. uncontrolled hypertension (controlled ≤ 130/80 mmHg, uncontrolled > 130/80 mmHg). Both systolic and diastolic BP were better controlled in group II (Fig. 2 a, b). Factors associated in univariable analysis with higher systolic BP were ESRD etiology (with hypertensive nephropathy, glomerular disease and diabetic nephropathy APCKD increasing likelihood for higher systolic BP, p = 0.03), treatment with cyclosporine (p = 0.007), higher weight (p = 0.003), deterioration of kidney function (reflected by increase in creatinine as a continuous variable, p = 0.005) and older age at beginning of follow-up (as a continuous variable, p = 0.046). Multivariate logistic regression model using the stepwise forward method indicated only age at beginning of follow-up (p = 0.01 with OR = 1.03 per year) and increase in creatinine (p = 0.004 with OR = 1.006) as statistically significant. As patients in the second period were older, the age could not account for the better blood pressure control found in the second group. Adding treatment or no treatment for blood pressure as a variable in the multivariate analysis indicated a good correlation between having hypertension and being treated with antihypertensive drugs, but not with hypertension control.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^116wha3y]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — kidney transplant recipient blood pressure targets and agents explains that the suggestion of a ≤ 130/80 mm Hg goal is not based on clinical evidence, that no RCTs have shown that achieved BP affects graft or patient survival, and that evidence for benefit of reducing BP to < 140/90 mm Hg is limited except when protein excretion is > 1 g/d; therefore, individualization is prudent given that achieving < 130/80 mm Hg often demands more therapy, many patients take 10 or more medications, and drug–drug interactions can alter immunosuppressant levels. The guideline provides ungraded recommendations that calcium channel blockers and drugs that block the RAS are preferred; ACEIs and ARBs can lower BP and proteinuria but may cause hyperkalemia, a 10%-15% reduction in hemoglobin, and renal function changes due to hemodynamics, while calcium channel blockers work effectively yet some may alter the metabolism of calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors, warranting cautious initiation and adjustment.

Section 4: strategies to achieve BP Targets in patients living with CKD

In patients living with CKD, systemic arterial hypertension prevalence increases with KD progression, reaching 90% prevalence in patients classified with CKD stage 5. The key mechanisms related to systemic arterial hypertension in patients living with CKD include volume overload, sympathetic hyperactivity, salt retention, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in BP-regulating hormone systems. Moreover, in kidney transplant recipients, systemic arterial hypertension etiology is multifactorial, depending on the recipient and donor characteristics and transplant-specific causes (e.g. immunosuppressive medications, allograft dysfunction, and surgical complications like transplant artery stenosis). High BP is an independent risk factor for CVD morbidity-mortality and adverse KD outcomes, making BP control a crucial goal for adequate clinical management. However, optimal BP goals in hypertensive CKD patients, specifically kidney transplant recipients, remain controversial.

Question 4.1: what are the risks/benefits of key-strategies in patients living with CKD who survive stage 3 KDIGO?

Target BP in patients with CKD without dialysis

The ideal BP targets in patients with CKD without dialysis vary widely across systemic arterial hypertension guidelines. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommends a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg for stage 5 CKD patients. This goes in line with threshold recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH), which also suggest a BP target < 130–139 mmHg for the same population. Conversely, the updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend a BP target of < 140/90 mmHg for patients with ACR < 70 mmol/mol and systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mmHg and BP < 130/80 mmHg (considering lower SBP of 120 mmHg) for those with CKD and ACR > 70 mmol/mol.

### Management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease not receiving dialysis: synopsis of the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline [^117CkTEd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis is an update of the KDIGO 2012 guideline on the same topic and reflects new evidence on the risks and benefits of BP-lowering therapy among patients with CKD. It is intended to support shared decision making by health care professionals working with patients with CKD worldwide. This article is a synopsis of the full guideline.

Methods

The KDIGO leadership commissioned 2 co-chairs to convene an international Work Group of researchers and clinicians. After a Controversies Conference in September 2017, the Work Group defined the scope of the evidence review, which was undertaken by an evidence review team between October 2017 and April 2020. Evidence reviews were done according to the Cochrane Handbook. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to guide the development of the recommendations and rate the strength and quality of the evidence. Practice points were included to provide guidance when evidence was insufficient to make a graded recommendation. The guideline was revised after public consultation between January and March 2020.

Recommendations

The updated guideline comprises 11 recommendations and 20 practice points. This synopsis summarizes key recommendations pertinent to the diagnosis and management of high BP in adults with CKD, excluding those receiving kidney replacement therapy. In particular, the synopsis focuses on recommendations for standardized BP measurement and a target systolic BP of less than 120 mm Hg, because these recommendations differ from some other guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^114AA6sT]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and the posttransplant patient — HTN is common in children after solid-organ transplants, with prevalence rates ranging from 50% to 90%. HTN rates are higher by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) compared with clinic BP measurements because these populations commonly have MH and nocturnal HTN. Control of HTN in renal-transplant patients has been improved with the use of annual ABPM; therefore, ABPM should be used to identify and monitor nocturnal BP abnormalities and MH in pediatric kidney and heart-transplant recipients, and the use of home BP assessment may provide a comparable alternative to ABPM for BP assessment after transplant as well. Rates of control of HTN in renal-transplant patients generally range from 33% to 55%, and children who achieved normotension had stable graft function, whereas those who remained hypertensive at 2 years had a progression of renal disease. There is limited evidence that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be superior to other agents in achieving BP control and improving long-term graft survival in renal-transplant patients; however, the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in renal-transplant patients has been associated with acidosis and hyperkalemia and is not recommended.

Guidelines

A. Arterial hypertension is often present after renal transplantation and is of multifactorial origin. Pre-transplant arterial hypertension, chronic allograft nephropathy and immunosuppressive therapy are the most frequent causes of post-transplant arterial hypertension. Careful monitoring and treatment of high blood pressure are recommended following transplantation. B. Post-transplant arterial hypertension is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in renal transplant patients and is an independent risk factor for graft failure. Therefore, blood pressure control (< 130/85 mmHg for renal transplant recipients without proteinuria, and < 125/75 mmHg for proteinuric patients) is mandatory in these patients. General measures and pharmacological intervention are necessary in many cases. In proteinuric patients, anti-hypertensive and anti-proteinuric agents could be used, and stricter blood pressure control is recommended. C. In patients with uncontrolled arterial hypertension and/or renal function deterioration, underlying causes should be excluded, especially transplant renal artery stenosis.

Conclusions — there is a "lack of high-quality evidence based on prospective clinical trials in the CKD population", and "CKD was often an exclusion criterion in early blood pressure treatment trials". For CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria, "blood pressure goals have been relaxed to ≤ 140/90 mm Hg for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients". In contrast, KDIGO "continues to recommend blood pressure goals ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for all renal transplant patients regardless of the presence of albuminuria", while guidance is "vague and individualized for the elderly".

### Current strategies for management of hypertensive renal disease… [^111BpJe6]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of hypertensive end-stage renal disease continues to increase annually. To reduce this incidence, it is necessary to control systolic and diastolic hypertension. Reversible causes should always be sought in any hypertensive patient who develops renal insufficiency. Blood pressure should be reduced to 130/85 mm Hg, and in African Americans with hypertensive renal failure, reducing the blood pressure to 120/75 mm Hg may be beneficial. This increased efferent arteriolar resistance reduces flow to the vasa recta, producing renal tubular ischemia leading to additional nephron loss. 5, 9, 10 The remaining nephrons increase in size in an attempt to accommodate the increased filtration load per nephron. Initial examination of patients with renal insufficiency should include urinalysis to detect proteinuria and/or hematuria and a renal sonogram to exclude lower urinary tract obstruction and to determine the size of the kidneys. Blood pressure should be controlled to 130/85 mm Hg with whatever antihypertensive therapy is necessary. 8 Controlling systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure is important in slowing progression of renal failure. 8, 25 Lowering blood pressure to 120/75 mm Hg may be beneficial for African Americans with renal insufficiency or in patients with renal disease and proteinuria in excess of 1 g/d. 8, 26, 27. The most important action to slow progressive renal failure is to control hypertension by whatever means necessary. Controlling hypertension with any antihypertensive agent slows the progression of renal insufficiency. All classes of antihypertensive drugs are effective in controlling blood pressure in patients with renal insufficiency. Hypertension in such patients may be resistant to control, and multiple antihypertensive drugs may be needed.

8, 24 Hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency should receive an ACEI, unless contraindicated, since these drugs have been shown to be renoprotective beyond their antihypertensive effects. With advanced renal failure, patients are at increased risk of hyperkalemia, which ACEIs can worsen. Repeated serum creatinine and electrolyte measurements should be obtained soon after an ACEI is begun in any patient with renal insufficiency to detect any decrease in renal function or hyperkalemia.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in implementing hypertension management after kidney transplantation [^114cNkrk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Evidence for blood pressure (BP) measurement and hypertension management in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) remains lacking.

Recent Findings

Accurate BP measurement technique is a critical component of hypertension management, and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring remains the gold standard for diagnosis of hypertension in KTR. BP target at different periods posttransplant is uncertain, but likely higher than that in nontransplant patients given factors related to long-standing uremic milieu and kidney transplantation such as vascular calcification altering transplant renal hemodynamic and allograft perfusion and immunosuppression. Dividing BP target into immediate, early, and late posttransplant periods can guide differential diagnoses of hypertension and BP control with a target SBP less than 160mmHg in general and BP 115–135/65–85mmHg for adult KTR receiving pediatric kidneys during the immediate posttransplant period, 130/80mmHg during early and late posttransplant periods. Calcium channel blockers were shown to have favorable graft outcomes. Novel antihypertensive medications for resistant and refractory hypertension and device-based therapies are limited due to KTR's ineligibility for participating in clinical trials.

Summary

In KTR, BP measurement and monitoring practice should follow the standard clinical practice guideline for nontransplant patients by considering posttransplant factors and immunosuppressive state. Novel treatment options required further studies.

Hypertension after kidney transplantation — evidence and gaps: Hypertension is common after kidney transplantation because of pre-existing kidney disease, effects of immunosuppressive medications, and presence of allograft pathology, and calcineurin inhibitor–based immunosuppression regimens are associated with a high (70% to 90%) prevalence of hypertension. There are no robust trials in post-transplant patients comparing different BP targets or drug choices, and a systematic review did not find that any BP-lowering medication class reduced the risk of graft loss, withdrawal because of adverse events, death, cardiovascular outcomes, or kidney outcomes compared with placebo or other drug classes. One trial of 188 kidney transplant recipients randomized patients to spironolactone versus placebo for 3 years and found no difference in kidney function or proteinuria, and overall, there is insufficient evidence to support specific recommendations on BP targets or recommended agents for kidney transplant recipients.

### Implementation of guidelines for metabolic syndrome control in kidney transplant recipients: results at a single center [^115My6oU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Background

For kidney transplanted patients, graft failure is defined either as a need for a new renal replacement therapy or as patient's death. Nowadays, about 50% of graft losses are due to recipient's death, a major cause for that being cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Many of the risk factors for CVD are included in the metabolic syndrome, which was first described as a combination of central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and fasting hyperglycemia. It has been shown that presence of metabolic syndrome in post-transplantation patients increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, these patients have lower graft survival and a higher rate of chronic transplant dysfunction. The defining criteria most widely accepted today in post-transplantation patients is the one proposed by the International Diabetes Federation. Aside from traditional risk factors for CVD, transplant-associated risk factors such as various immunosuppressive medications, chronic renal dysfunction and anemia are also acknowledged.

Understanding the importance of a balanced metabolic state for the general population has led to wide screening tests as well as early and aggressive interventions.

During the mid-90's formal guidelines were not as common as they have become in the last 2 decades, more so in special populations such as kidney transplant recipients. Instead, there were recommended treatment targets that were accepted as common practice. 'Kidney Disease — Improving Global Outcomes' (KDIGO) was established in 2003 and has since published guidelines for management of patients with kidney diseases. The 2009 KDIGO guidelines provide recommendations for the management of kidney transplant recipients, including screening and treatment goals.

Few large-scale studies have looked at the kidney transplant recipients population, and though most suggested significant benefit in treating hyperlipidemia, diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN), evidence levels are not as strong as for the general population. Encouragingly, early reports describing reduced incidence of cardiovascular deaths in transplanted patients recently appeared, and suggest improvement in management of risk factors. Unfortunately, treatment is still believed to be suboptimal.

Here we aimed to elucidate the impact of changes in guidelines on our clinical management of post-transplantation patients, and to test if improvement in controlling the metabolic syndrome evolved as reflected by patients' blood pressure, fasting glucose levels, serum cholesterol and weights. We therefore compared patient's monitoring frequency, treatments and treatment outcomes and graft function from 2 different periods representing patients treated under two different follow-up guidelines: 1994–1997 and 2008–2011. Indeed, we found that patient monitoring has changed markedly between the two periods, more patients achieved treatments goals, and graft function was more stable during the latter follow-up period.
