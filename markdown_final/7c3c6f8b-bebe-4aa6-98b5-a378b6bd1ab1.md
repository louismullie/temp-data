## Question

Pmeumoperitoneum and mesenteric venous gas of unknown etiology on exam- differential, surgical plan, diagnostics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pneumoperitoneum with mesenteric venous gas of unknown etiology, including differential, surgical plan, and diagnostics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether the exam suggests peritonitis or instability. Then, I should construct a differential that distinguishes surgical emergencies from potentially benign causes. Next, I'll define the diagnostic workup with emphasis on CT features and adjunct imaging. After that, I need to decide between urgent surgery and conservative management using clinical–radiologic correlation. Finally, I will outline operative strategies if ischemia or perforation is suspected, postoperative care, and special population considerations, while keeping an eye on common pitfalls and verifying key assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm priorities for immediate assessment and stabilization because missing peritonitis or shock would be catastrophic. Airway, breathing, and circulation come first, with rapid IV access and fluid resuscitation as needed; any hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs with pneumoperitoneum warrants emergent surgical evaluation without delay, as per acute mesenteric ischemia guidance and emergency surgery principles, and importantly, PVG alone does not mandate surgery absent correlating clinical signs, so I need to correlate the exam with imaging before deciding on the knife [^115F6mra] [^114hUp2k] [^112G48BE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should structure the differential into life-threatening causes first. Bowel ischemia or necrosis is the most common cause of PVG, often due to mesenteric arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, nonocclusive ischemia, or strangulated obstruction, and frequently requires urgent operative management when paired with peritoneal signs or systemic instability; perforated viscus from peptic ulcer, diverticulitis, malignancy, appendicitis, or trauma also sits high on the list, and I must remember tension pneumoperitoneum as a rare but life-threatening entity that demands immediate decompression before definitive therapy [^114hUp2k] [^11499gfR] [^115VYqCB] [^117D6ECc] [^111rqGRk].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not overcalling surgery in stable patients; several conditions can be managed conservatively when carefully selected. Postoperative pneumoperitoneum is common and often benign in the first days to weeks after surgery, particularly when decreasing on serial imaging and without sepsis; endoscopy-related microperforation may be observed if there are no peritoneal signs; pneumatosis intestinalis and PVG can be benign in immunosuppressed states or chronic lung disease if the clinical picture is reassuring; and PVG unrelated to ischemia is described in diverse settings, so I should ensure the global clinical context justifies intervention [^112Zuotj] [^1116Qt4G] [^1138sW5P] [^1138sW5P] [^112P3hBf] [^112b2c8x] [^1149tEdd] [^112P3hBf].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. I need baseline labs including CBC, chemistries, and especially lactate as a marker of ischemia, while remembering no lab alone can rule in or out ischemia; CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the cornerstone, and I should examine the precise distribution of gas including portal and mesenteric venous systems and within the bowel wall, bowel wall enhancement, free fluid, fat stranding, and vessel patency; thin slices and multiplanar reformats improve perforation site detection compared with 5 mm axial alone; when ischemia is suspected, CTA is key; point-of-care ultrasound can rapidly detect PVG at the bedside and prompt expedited CT and surgical evaluation; if CT is unavailable, left lateral decubitus radiographs have high sensitivity for free air [^114hUp2k] [^112F2cf6] [^113wBmFQ] [^116ZvnDm] [^113HKMhN] [^115F6mra].

> I will now examine how CT details inform prognosis and decisions, but I should double-check that I'm not overinterpreting one sign. Gas tracking to the mesenteric arcade vessels strongly correlates with ischemic etiology and higher mortality and should heighten urgency; conversely, isolated PVG without pneumatosis or bowel wall changes in a stable, non-peritonitic patient may permit observation with close monitoring, serial exams, and lactate trends; still, high lactate plus CT evidence of ischemia should push toward emergent exploration, and any deterioration mandates escalation [^112F2cf6] [^115F6mra] [^113qD1vW] [^112b2c8x].

> But wait, what if the patient is a blunt trauma victim with scant free air and no other findings; I should confirm whether observation can be safe. In blunt trauma, CT-detected free air alone can be a false siren; the presence of free fluid, direct bowel injury signs, or concerning clinical evolution is more predictive of a true hollow viscus injury necessitating surgery, and in carefully selected benign presentations, observation is acceptable, though vigilance for progression remains crucial [^1176yaKD].

> Hold on, I should verify I'm not missing tension physiology; rapid recognition and decompression can be lifesaving. Tension pneumoperitoneum presents with abdominal distension, respiratory compromise, and hemodynamic instability from intra-abdominal hypertension; immediate percutaneous needle decompression with a large-bore catheter (for example, 18G) can temporize physiology prior to definitive management, and this step should not be delayed when clinical features are convincing, including iatrogenic or endoscopic etiologies [^117D6ECc] [^111rqGRk] [^117B65tB].

> Let me think about the operative plan when ischemia is likely or peritonitis is present. In unstable patients or those with clear peritoneal signs, exploratory laparotomy is indicated; intraoperatively, I should inspect the entire bowel, assess viability using clinical judgment augmented by Doppler for distal SMA flow, re-establish inflow when feasible, resect nonviable segments, and consider a planned second-look for borderline segments; the decision for primary anastomosis versus stoma hinges on physiology, contamination, and residual length, while etiology-specific maneuvers such as embolectomy or postoperative anticoagulation are applied as indicated; diagnostic laparoscopy can be considered in stable patients with equivocal findings but a low threshold for conversion should be maintained [^115F6mra] [^112wxYrb] [^116ni8gB] [^11537XUJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I referenced "evaluate entire bowel length ~400 cm" earlier, but I should correct myself. That "400 cm" figure came from a case report describing the length of small bowel that was infarcted and resected, not the normal entire small bowel length; I need to ensure I don't misstate normative anatomy and keep the case-specific number in context to avoid confusion during operative planning [^112wxYrb].

> Next, I should review postoperative care and surveillance because missed ischemia and anastomotic failure are high-stakes complications. ICU-level monitoring with serial abdominal examinations, hemodynamic optimization, lactate trends, and early re-imaging if deterioration occurs is essential; nutrition planning, including parenteral support in extensive resections, and vigilance for short bowel syndrome need to be anticipated; timely recognition and reoperation for evolving ischemia can be lifesaving [^115F6mra].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances so I do not overgeneralize. In very low birth weight neonates with NEC or spontaneous intestinal perforation, peritoneal drainage may be a temporizing or even definitive step for selected unstable infants, with base deficit and FiO2 after drainage helping stratify need for laparotomy; elderly patients with PVG have higher mortality and often warrant a lower threshold for operative management; in patients with recurrent symptoms or atypical benign-appearing pneumatosis, I should reconsider chronic mesenteric ischemia as an underlying driver [^113PayyS] [^114hUp2k] [^1158zr4A].

> I should double-check my documentation and follow-up strategy to ensure continuity and learning. Document preoperative CT details including gas distribution and bowel wall findings, intraoperative assessments of viability and vascular patency, and the extent and location of resection; in conservative pathways, ensure daily exams, trend lactate, and repeat CT in 48–72 hours if no improvement or earlier if deterioration, escalating to surgery if the clinical picture worsens; aligning imaging evolution with bedside findings remains the anchor of safe nonoperative care [^11499gfR] [^112G48BE].

> Finally, let me reconsider the central principle so I don't get misled by radiology alone. PVG and pneumoperitoneum are signs, not diagnoses; management hinges on correlating hemodynamics, exam, biomarkers, and CT pattern recognition, with emergent surgery for peritonitis or clear ischemia and carefully selected observation for stable patients without peritoneal signs or ominous CT features, always ready to pivot if the patient evolves adversely [^11499gfR] [^114hUp2k] [^112G48BE].

Pneumoperitoneum with mesenteric venous gas [^112wxYrb] is most often due to **bowel ischemia/infarction** [^112F2cf6] or **hollow viscus perforation** [^112xVn1L], but can also arise from obstruction, infection, trauma, or iatrogenic causes [^112G48BE] [^115VYqCB]. Immediate management hinges on clinical stability: unstable patients or those with peritonitis require **urgent laparotomy** [^115F6mra], while stable patients without peritonitis may be observed with serial exams and imaging [^1176yaKD]. Contrast-enhanced CT is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^114hUp2k] to identify the cause and guide intervention [^112xVn1L].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Ischemic | - Mesenteric ischemia (arterial or venous) [^115F6mra] [^11499gfR] |
| Perforation | - Peptic ulcer <br/> - Diverticulitis <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Iatrogenic (endoscopy, surgery) [^113wBmFQ] [^112xVn1L] |
| Obstruction | - Small bowel obstruction <br/> - Volvulus <br/> - Hernia [^111zJkYx] [^112xVn1L] |
| Infectious | - Gas-forming bacterial infections (e.g. Clostridium species) [^11499gfR] [^113DGdxW] |
| Trauma | - Blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma [^11499gfR] [^1176yaKD] |
| Iatrogenic | - Recent abdominal surgery <br/> - Laparoscopy <br/> - Endoscopic procedures [^1116Qt4G] [^117AruNT] [^11499gfR] |

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, and systemic signs of sepsis [^113r368L].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, lactate, arterial blood gas, coagulation profile [^115F6mra].
- **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT is the gold standard [^113wBmFQ], identifying perforation, ischemia, obstruction, or infection [^112xVn1L].
- **Endoscopy**: Consider if upper or lower GI perforation is suspected and patient is stable [^113QfNg7].

---

## Surgical management plan

The surgical plan depends on clinical stability and imaging findings. Unstable patients or those with peritonitis require **immediate exploratory laparotomy** [^115F6mra] to identify and treat the underlying cause (e.g. resection of necrotic bowel or repair of perforation), whereas **stable patients without peritonitis** may be managed conservatively with close monitoring, serial exams, and repeat imaging [^1177mfpp]; surgery is indicated if clinical deterioration occurs.

---

## Prognostic implications

The presence of pneumoperitoneum and mesenteric venous gas indicates severe pathology with **high mortality**, particularly when ischemia or perforation is present [^112F2cf6] [^111pzgVp]. Early diagnosis and intervention are **critical** for improving outcomes [^113r368L].

---

Pneumoperitoneum and mesenteric venous gas most often reflect **ischemia or perforation**, but can also result from obstruction, infection, trauma, or iatrogenic causes [^115VYqCB]. Management is guided by clinical stability and imaging, with urgent surgery for unstable patients or peritonitis [^115F6mra], and conservative care with close monitoring for stable patients without peritonitis.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^11499gfR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Portal vein gas is an ominous radiological sign indicating a serious gastrointestinal problem in most patients. Many causes have been identified, with bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular accident being the most significant. Patient presentation varies, and diagnosis of the underlying problem depends primarily on radiological findings and clinical signs. The aim of this article is to highlight the clinical importance of portal vein gas and its management in emergency surgery.
- **Methods**: A computerized search was conducted of Medline for publications discussing portal vein gas through March 2008. Sixty articles were identified and selected for review due to their relevance, covering the period from 1975 to 2008.
- **Results**: A total of 275 patients with gas in the portal venous system were reported. The most common cause was bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular pathology (61.44%). This was followed by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (16.26%), obstruction and dilatation (9.03%), sepsis (6.6%), iatrogenic injury and trauma (3.01%), and cancer (1.8%). Idiopathic portal vein gas was also reported (1.8%).
- **Conclusion**: Portal vein gas is a diagnostic sign that indicates serious intra-abdominal pathology requiring emergency surgery in the majority of patients. Portal vein gas due to simple and benign causes can be treated conservatively. Correlation between clinical and diagnostic findings is important for setting the management plan.

### Portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to mesenteric ischaemia [^112wxYrb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department with severe periumbilical pain associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, there was gross distension with generalized tenderness, more prominent in the left iliac fossa. The patient was afebrile and parameters were stable.

Coronal and axial CT images showed extensive branching radiolucency extending to within 2 cm of the liver capsule, which is characteristic of portal venous gas (PVG) and differentiates it from pneumobilia (Figure 1). Gas was also present throughout the superior mesenteric vein and its tributaries (closed arrow, Figure 2B). A large portion of the small bowel wall showed band-like intramural gas (open arrow, Figure 2A), consistent with pneumatosis intestinalis (PI).
- **Figure 1**: (A) Coronal reconstruction showing portal venous gas and dilated small bowel loops with band-like pneumatosis intestinalis; (B and C) showing extensive portal venous gas as well as gas within the stomach wall.
- **Figure 2**: (A) Showing dilated bowel loops with fluid levels and extensive pneumatosis intestinalis. The open arrow highlights the band-like distribution of gas within the bowel wall. The closed arrow in (B) shows gas within the tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein.

A laparotomy was performed, and approximately 400 cm of infarcted small bowel was resected with formation of a jejunostomy and mucous fistula. Intraoperatively, all arteries were found to be patent on palpation. Intestinal integrity was restored 2 months after the first surgery, and after 5 months of inpatient care, the patient showed significant recovery.

### Gastrointestinal perforation: Clinical and MDCT clues for identification of aetiology [^112xVn1L]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) perforation manifests with extraluminal gas, wall discontinuity or thickening, and fat stranding. Pneumoperitoneum and extraluminal oral contrast can range from abundant to absent. Ancillary findings include foreign bodies, masses, excessive wall thickening, ischemia, and fecal impaction. Supramesocolic pneumoperitoneum and hyperenhancing gastroduodenal wall suggest perforated peptic ulcer disease. Persistent or increasing free air and/or ascites postoperatively indicates iatrogenic perforation.

### Peritoneal changes due to laparoscopic surgery [^112raQPq]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

In addition to morphological alterations, laparoscopic surgery may induce metabolic changes in the peritoneum. The creation of pneumoperitoneum may affect local peritoneal oxygen levels, which may induce metabolic changes, including acidosis.

In 2003, Wildbrett et al. showed that a pneumoperitoneum, created with either CO₂ or helium, decreased the partial oxygen pressure in the rat abdominal wall, as measured with an implanted microcatheter. In contrast, insufflation with a nonhypoxic gas mixture consisting of 80% CO₂ and 20% oxygen did not affect the oxygen pressure. Based on their study and additional in vitro experiments, these authors concluded that insufflation with either CO₂ or helium affects the intra- and extracellular parameters regulating essential cell functions, such as oxidative phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cell proliferation, and onset of apoptosis.

The role of local oxygen pressure was further studied by Bourdel et al. in a mouse laparoscopic model with controlled respiratory support. They found that the peritoneal tissue–oxygen tension levels in non-injured peritoneum during a low-pressure CO₂ pneumoperitoneum were higher than during a laparotomy in ventilated mice. After CO₂ insufflation, the peritoneal tissue–oxygen tension immediately increased and remained at a higher level. A similar effect was not found when normal air was used as the insufflation gas.

In two experimental studies, Molinas et al. showed that peritoneal hypoxia is relevant in the occurrence of post-surgical adhesions.

### Impact of pneumoperitoneum pressure on cardiac output in laparoscopic surgery [^115v6qi7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Previous research suggested that longer operation time and higher pneumoperitoneum pressure may contribute to an increased risk of carbon dioxide gas embolism. However, this study did not observe any cases of gas embolism. Xie et al. assessed the effect of the duration of CO2 pneumoperitoneum on intraoperative blood gas analysis and recovery quality in elderly patients undergoing radical resection of colorectal cancer. Chen et al. concentrated on the application of intermittent low airway pressure combined with low central venous pressure technique in laparoscopic hepatectomy.

While some studies suggest that hepatic vein injury in laparoscopic colorectal surgery may not be closely related to low central venous pressure, the role of high carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in carbon dioxide embolism remains a topic of investigation. This study did not directly assess this relationship. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been reported to effectively monitor real-time hemodynamic changes and detect carbon dioxide gas embolism in surgical settings. In this study, TEE was used to monitor cardiac function, and no gas embolism was detected. In addition, the inflow and outflow tract of the right ventricle in the middle esophagus were assessed in all cases, and no gas embolism was detected.

A limitation of this study is the absence of central venous pressure, stroke volume variation, and systemic vascular resistance measurements. The lack of these parameters limits our ability to distinguish whether the observed reductions in cardiac output were primarily due to decreased preload or other hemodynamic factors. Future studies in this area should address these limitations to provide a clearer understanding of the hemodynamic impacts of pneumoperitoneum pressure.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^114hUp2k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Two hundred seventy-five patients with gas in the portal venous system were reported. The most common cause of portal vein gas was bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular pathology (61.44%), followed by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (16.26%), obstruction and dilatation (9.03%), sepsis (6.6%), iatrogenic injury and trauma (3.01%), and cancer (1.8%). Idiopathic portal vein gas was also reported in 1.8%. Men and women were equally affected. A majority of the patients were elderly and affected by the most serious cause, mesenteric vascular pathology. The diagnostic approach is based on clinical suspicion and investigations such as CT scans, which represent the standard test. Management depends on the underlying cause, and better outcomes are reported because of advances in diagnostic facilities, intensive care settings, and less invasive operative techniques such as laparoscopy.
- **Aetiology**: The most important cause of PVG is bowel ischemia, followed by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), obstruction and dilatation, gastrointestinal leak, infection, diffuse peritonitis, and sepsis. It may follow GIT cancer, gastric ulcer, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, cystic fibrosis, and acute appendicitis. PVG is also reported following perforated and non-perforated diverticulitis, oesophageal and colonic carcinoma. Inflammation of the GIT, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, is also reported in literature. It is also noted following surgical procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy.

### Case report: Portal and systemic venous gas in a patient with perforated duodenal ulcer: CT findings [^116qYvVF]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Gas within the portal circulation has been known to be associated with a number of conditions, most commonly mesenteric ischemia and necrosis. Systemic venous gas is described in a few conditions and is mostly iatrogenic in nature. We describe a case of combined portal and systemic venous gas, detected by computed tomography, in a patient with a perforated duodenal ulcer.

### Direct visualization of perforation sites in patients with a non-traumatic free pneumoperitoneum: Added diagnostic value of thin transverse slices and coronal and sagittal reformations for multi-detector CT [^113wBmFQ]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The incremental diagnostic value of adding 1.25-mm slices and coronal and sagittal reformatting to 5-mm axial reconstructions for direct visualization of the perforation site in patients with non-traumatic free pneumoperitoneum was assessed. Forty patients with non-traumatic bowel perforation and free pneumoperitoneum underwent computed tomography (CT). The perforation was gastroduodenal in 18 patients and involved the small or large bowel in 22 patients. Transverse scans were reconstructed with 5-mm thick sections at 5-mm intervals and 1.25-mm-thick sections at 1.25-mm intervals. The second data set was reformatted coronally and sagittaly with 3-mm-thick sections at 3-mm intervals.

Three independent blinded readers interpreted 5-mm transverse scans, then combined 1.25-mm and 5-mm transverse scans, and then combined transverse, coronal, and sagittal scans. The rate of identification of the perforation site ranged from 43% to 53% with the combined axial, sagittal, and coronal scans, from 28% to 48% with the 1.25- and 5-mm transverse scans, and from 5% to 20% only with the 5-mm thick transverse scans. The agreement between readers was significantly higher with thin slices and reformatting. The use of 1.25-mm axial slices and reformations intrinsically contained more useful diagnostic information than 5-mm axial slices alone for diagnosis of the perforation site in patients with pneumoperitoneum.

### Portal venous gas — case report and review of the literature [^115QQpeA]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old man with chronic renal failure was admitted to the renal unit with non-specific symptoms and positive blood cultures. He later deteriorated and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with septic shock, respiratory failure, and deranged liver function. Initial improvement was followed by abdominal distension and discomfort. Portal venous gas (PVG) and thrombosis were diagnosed on computed tomography. A conservative line of management was adopted. Improvement was soon followed by deterioration with septic shock. Extensive portal venous gas and free intra-abdominal gas were now evident on repeat computed tomography. The patient was too unwell to withstand surgery, and a decision was made not to escalate therapy. He died on day 16.

Portal venous gas is not a disease; it is a diagnostic clue in patients who may be harboring an intra-abdominal catastrophe. Successful management of these cases requires early identification of the underlying pathology and can range from simple observation to extensive surgical intervention.

### Microsphere intestinal blood flow analysis during pneumoperitoneum using carbon dioxide and helium [^111Tssxr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum has been associated with a decreased flow in the superior mesenteric artery and portal venous system. In this study, intestinal blood flow was examined during a 2-hour pneumoperitoneum using carbon dioxide (CO2) or helium in a porcine model with the help of colored microspheres.

- **Methods**: Twelve pigs were divided into two groups (6 CO2 and 6 helium). Different colored microspheres were injected directly into the left ventricle before, and at 40, 80, and 120 minutes after insufflation with either gas at a pressure of 15 mmHg. Microsphere concentration was then measured in the mucosa and muscularis/serosa layers of the jejunum, cecum, and sigmoid colon to calculate blood flow.
- **Results**: Intestinal perfusion initially increases with insufflation and returns to near baseline levels during a pneumoperitoneum of 2 hours. The effect of helium on tissue perfusion is similar to that of carbon dioxide.
- **Conclusions**: Intestinal perfusion does not change significantly during prolonged pneumoperitoneum at a pressure of 15 mmHg with either CO2 or helium.

### Echography of the portal vein in a patient with shock [^113tjbLS]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The study explores the utility of abdominal ultrasonography in identifying portal venous gas in patients with shock as an indicator of acute mesenteric ischemia. It illustrates how portal venous gas appears on ultrasonography. The data includes clinical observations of a patient, images from abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography, and a video of portal venous gas.

We report a case of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in a 76-year-old patient following cardiac surgery. Diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia was proposed based on evidence of portal venous gas on abdominal ultrasonography and confirmed by computed tomography, which showed transverse colonic ischemia and the presence of gas in the mesenteric veins but not in the portal vein. Urgent laparotomy confirmed extensive nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, and the patient rapidly died of multiple organ failure.

Intensive care physicians should be aware of the ultrasound characteristics of portal venous gas. In patients with shock, in addition to cardiac and thoracic echography, investigating portal venous gas using bedside ultrasonography may help clinicians identify patients in whom acute mesenteric ischemia develops.

### Severe portal and systemic acidosis during CO-laparoscopy compared to helium or gasless laparoscopy and laparotomy in a rodent model: an experimental study [^113SvSpF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

This study's findings support our hypothesis that the portal vein directs acidic blood from the splanchnic circulation towards the liver during experimental CO₂-LS, as CO₂ pneumoperitoneum caused significant portal-venous acidosis. This tends to aggravate under increased insufflation pressure and over time. Considering the cited systemic effect of CO₂ pneumoperitoneum, similar pH alterations were observed in the other examined vessels, correlating to the insufflation pressure. During He-LS in spontaneously breathing animals, there was a tendency towards falling pH values in all vessels, but pH changes only reached significance at a high insufflation pressure. This suggests a direct mechanical effect of the insufflation pressure by mechanical ventilatory restriction, affecting portal and systemic blood gases. This could relativize the gas-quality-dependent pH drop during CO₂-LS and the pressure-dependent mechanical disturbance of spontaneous ventilation, peritoneal micro-circulation, or portal-venous flow, as described by Junghans et al. as a reasonable explanation for this effect.

Hence, we postulate a marginal impact of the insufflation pressure on the portal pH, as acidic pH alteration turned significant only during CO₂-LS at 6 mmHg and not during He-LS at 6 mmHg, indicating the possibly higher impact of gas quality over insufflation pressure. However, this study did not investigate the portal-venous flow nor the reversibility of pH change through hyperventilation.

An important question remains whether portal acidosis is subject to hyperventilatory compensation.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If a patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy.

The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas after CPR [^114vEf5N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas are usually associated with severe intra-abdominal pathologies. As diagnostic technologies have advanced, a number of variant etiologies have been identified. We report two cases in which pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas developed after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The pathogenic mechanism was most probably bowel infarction caused by poor mesenteric perfusion during and after CPR. Limited cardiac output during prolonged resuscitation and severe vasoconstriction after large doses of epinephrine and vasopressors might both contribute to the compromised mesenteric perfusion. The risk seems especially high for older patients with severe atherosclerosis. Once it occurs, the prognosis is extremely poor. In patients of cardiac arrest receiving prolonged CPR, catastrophic complications like this should be considered in the post-resuscitation phase, especially those with multiple risk factors like old age, severe atherosclerosis, and the use of large doses of vasoconstrictors.

### Is there still a role for peritoneal drains in neonatal pneumoperitoneum? A single-center experience [^113PayyS]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

Although pneumoperitoneum resulting from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation is a surgical emergency, risk stratification to determine which neonates benefit from initial peritoneal drainage (PD) is lacking.
- **Methods**: Using a single-center retrospective review of very low birth weight neonates under 1500 g who underwent PD for pneumoperitoneum from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation (January 2015 to December 2023), two cohorts were created: drain "responders" (patients managed definitively with PD; includes placement of a second drain) and "nonresponders" (patients who underwent subsequent laparotomy or died after PD). Antenatal/postnatal characteristics, periprocedural clinical data, and hospital outcomes were compared between responders and nonresponders using Student's t-test, chi-squared test, or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate, with P < 0.05 considered significant.
- **Results**: Fifty-six neonates were included: 31 (55%) drain responders and 25 (45%) nonresponders. Birth weight, gestational age, sex, ethnicity, use of postnatal steroids, and enteral feeds were similar between the cohorts. Nonresponders had higher base deficits (-3.4 versus -5.0, P = 0.032) and FiO2 (0.25 versus 0.52, P = 0.001) after drain placement. Drain responders had significantly shorter lengths of stay (89 versus 148 days, P = 0.014) and lower mortality (6.4% versus 56%, P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis of the nonresponders showed no differences in birth weight, vasopressor requirement, FiO2, or postdrain base deficit between nonresponders.

### Pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis: a case report [^113qD1vW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum (PP), or air within the abdominal cavity, is often a sign of serious abdominal pathology and frequently indicates visceral perforation. Most cases of PP ultimately require surgical exploration and intervention. However, cases of nonsurgical PP have also been described in the literature, suggesting that such cases can be managed conservatively.

This report documents the incidental finding of PP. It is unclear how often PP is found incidentally, and more importantly, how to manage a patient with clinically unsuspected PP without peritoneal signs. Future research could help determine the incidence of unsuspected PP and validate the various diagnostic and treatment algorithms in the literature.

### Occult child abuse presenting as pneumatosis intestinalis and portomesenteric venous gas - a case report [^114CLWQH]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The patient in this case report initially presented with pneumatosis intestinalis, portomesenteric venous gas, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock. The clinical presentation and imaging findings initially suggested septic shock with acute ischemic bowel. However, physical abuse was less likely because there was no evidence of retinal hemorrhage, bruising, bone fractures, or subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage in computed tomography. After two weeks of treatment in the pediatric intensive care unit, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed subdural hemorrhage of different stages over bilateral fronto-parietal convexities and diffuse axonal injury. Abusive head trauma and abdominal trauma were then diagnosed.

According to his parents, he had developed the symptoms suddenly without initial signs of fever, feeding intolerance, abdominal distension, or bloody stools. Sepsis could not explain the clinical course. In cases where the clinical course is unusual with no reasonable explanation, other etiologies of acute ischemic bowel, such as abusive abdominal trauma, should be considered as a differential diagnosis.

Abusive abdominal trauma is the second leading cause of death in physically abused children, most of which are caused by blunt abdominal trauma. The liver and small bowel are the most commonly injured organs. Bruising on the abdomen has been reported in 20% of cases of abusive abdominal trauma, and it is usually accompanied by fractures, burns, and head injury. Maguire et al. reviewed 88 studies and concluded that small bowel trauma in a

### Liquid nitrogen ingestion leading to massive pneumoperitoneum without identifiable gastrointestinal perforation [^114WmeBW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Liquid nitrogen (LN) ingestion is unusual but may be encountered by poison centers, emergency physicians, and general surgeons. Unique properties of LN produce a characteristic pattern of injury.
- **Case report**: A 19-year-old male college student presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain and "bloating" after drinking LN. His presentation vital signs were remarkable only for mild tachypnea and tachycardia. On physical examination, he had mild respiratory difficulty due to abdominal distention. His abdomen was tense and distended. Abdominal X-ray studies revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum. At laparotomy, he was found to have a large amount of peritoneal gas. No perforation was identified. After surgery, the patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged 5 days later. At a 2-week clinic follow-up, he was doing well without complications.
- **Discussion**: Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless gas at room temperature. Due to its low boiling point (-195 degrees C), LN rapidly evaporates when in contact with body surface temperatures. Therefore, ingested LN causes damage by two mechanisms: rapid freezing injury upon mucosal contact and rapid volume expansion as nitrogen gas is formed. Patients who ingest LN may develop gastrointestinal perforation and massive pneumoperitoneum. Because rapid gas formation may allow large volumes to escape from tiny perforations, the exact site of perforation may never be identified.
- **Conclusion**: In cases of LN ingestion, mucosal injury and rapid gas formation can cause massive pneumoperitoneum.

### The anatomical compartments and their connections as demonstrated by ectopic air [^116PexsB]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Retroperitoneal causes of ectopic air are hardly ever life-threatening in themselves, as no vital structures are of concern. Thus, treatment will mainly depend on the type of lesion or injury and the patient's clinical presentation. As a general rule, small perforations that are expected to spontaneously close may be conservatively managed by implementing "nothing by mouth", intravenous hydration, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and serial imaging studies. Large perforations warrant surgical treatment.

Surgical procedures frequently cause sparse air bubbles, usually in the proximity of the intervention site. The complete absorption of ectopic gas often occurs within 48–72 hours. Therefore, conservative-expectant management is the option if the patient is otherwise asymptomatic. Serial imaging studies are performed when patients are suspected to have any early postoperative complication; evidence of increased ectopic gas or air is worrisome and may be related to an anastomotic leak or infectious complication. In the era of laparoscopic surgery, one should be aware that insufflated gas (usually carbon dioxide) is sometimes temporarily retained within the abdomen and may cause transient upper abdominal and shoulder pain, which may persist for about three days.

Gas-forming infections are a special matter of concern; clinical outcome will largely depend on a prompt diagnosis and treatment. Thus, imaging plays an important role in achieving the correct diagnosis and understanding the extent of the disease. Generally, successful treatment requires aggressive management of the infection.

### Metastatic gas gangrene and colonic perforation: a case report [^113DGdxW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The condition described here as gas gangrene is referred to as non-traumatic, yet literature suggests that minor trauma can act as a focus for infection in susceptible individuals. Cases have been documented at venous cannula sites, central venous catheter sites, and sites of intramuscular injections, indicating that additional cases may be attributed to trivial trauma.

Given the observed relationship between colorectal cancer and myonecrosis, we recommend extensive investigation in any patient presenting with Clostridium septicum myonecrosis or who has positive cultures. Our review indicates a higher prevalence of right-sided cancers; therefore, thorough visualization or radiological imaging of the entire lower gastrointestinal tract is advised. Additionally, all patients should be screened for diabetes and hematological malignancies.

There is no convincing evidence for hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the acute treatment of this form of gas gangrene. However, some reports have extrapolated its potential effectiveness from its use in Clostridium perfringens infection, suggesting it could be a crucial part of the triad treatment approach, which includes antibiotics, surgical debridement, and oxygen.

### Secondary peritonitis: Principles of diagnosis and intervention [^113r368L]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary peritonitis accounts for 1% of urgent or emergent hospital admissions and is the second leading cause of sepsis in patients in intensive care units globally. Overall mortality is 6%, but mortality rises to 35% in patients who develop severe sepsis. Despite the dramatic growth in the availability and use of imaging and laboratory tests, the rapid diagnosis and early management of peritonitis remains a challenge for physicians in emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care.

In this article, we review the pathophysiology of peritonitis and its potential progression to sepsis, discuss the utility and limitations of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests, and present a paradigm for the management of secondary peritonitis.

### Gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^117MJsbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and last updated in 2017. Laparoscopic surgery is now widely performed to treat various abdominal diseases. Currently, carbon dioxide is the most frequently used gas for insufflation of the abdominal cavity (pneumoperitoneum). Although carbon dioxide meets most of the requirements for pneumoperitoneum, its absorption may be associated with adverse events. Therefore, other gases have been introduced as alternatives to carbon dioxide for establishing pneumoperitoneum.
- **Objectives**: To assess the safety, benefits, and harms of different gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air) used for establishing pneumoperitoneum in participants undergoing laparoscopic abdominal or gynecological pelvic surgery.
- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, four other databases, and three trial registers on 15 October 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.
- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum in participants (irrespective of age, sex, or race) undergoing laparoscopic abdominal or gynecological pelvic surgery under general anesthesia.
- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
- **Main results**: We included 10 RCTs, randomizing 583 participants, comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum: nitrous.

### Portal venous gas on point-of-care ultrasound in a case of cecal ischemia [^116ZvnDm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Portal venous gas has mainly been studied in pediatrics and is commonly seen in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis. It is a rare finding in adults and is typically associated with underlying intestinal ischemia or other malignant intra-abdominal pathology. Portal venous gas is more readily detected on ultrasound compared to radiographs in both pediatric and adult patients. Findings include lucencies extending to the periphery of the liver, echogenic bubbles flowing centrifugally throughout the portal venous system, and bidirectional spikes interrupting the monophasic portal venous waveform on spectral analysis.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 36-year-old female who arrived with abdominal pain. She had findings consistent with portal venous gas on point-of-care ultrasound, prompting a computed tomography of her abdomen and surgical consultation. She was ultimately found to have cecal ischemia due to cecal volvulus, underwent surgical resection and anastomosis, and was discharged from the hospital following recovery.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** With the ever-increasing use of point-of-care ultrasound, emergency physicians should be aware of the findings consistent with portal venous gas and its implications. Portal venous gas is associated with intestinal ischemia and other malignant pathologies and should prompt more advanced imaging or surgical consultation when observed. Emergency physicians should also understand the distinctions between portal venous gas and pneumobilia on point-of-care ultrasound.

### Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^117AruNT]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are performed for several reasons. The overuse of endoscopy negatively impacts the quality of healthcare and places pressure on endoscopy services, resulting in complications. These complications include pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous pneumomediastinum. It is important to note that these complications rarely occur during endoscopy of the upper GI tract. When they do occur, they indicate perforation of the retroperitoneal space or the peritoneal cavity. This article discusses a case of pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema following upper GI endoscopy.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^115JBpj7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Portal vein gas (PVG) is a critical condition often associated with severe gastrointestinal tract (GIT) illnesses. It is typically identified through imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US).
- **Clinical significance**: The presence of PVG is indicative of severe underlying pathology, often necessitating emergency surgical intervention. Awareness of this condition is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment to improve patient outcomes.
- **Diagnosis and management**: Enhancements in imaging technology have made it easier to diagnose PVG, greatly aiding in emergency surgical settings. CT scans are the most effective in identifying PVG due to their detailed imagery of the abdominal area. Ultrasound can also be used as a complementary technique but is generally considered less effective than CT scans.

Understanding the implications of PVG is crucial for clinicians working in emergency settings to ensure prompt and adequate patient care.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: Guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^115F6mra]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Prompt laparotomy should be performed for patients with overt peritonitis. When physical findings suggestive of an acute intraabdominal catastrophe are present, bowel infarction has already occurred, and the chance of survival in this patient population with significant associated comorbidity is dramatically reduced. There is overwhelming evidence in the literature that peritonitis secondary to bowel necrosis mandates surgery without delay.
- **The goal of surgical intervention for AMI includes**: Re-establishment of blood supply to the ischemic bowel, resection of all non-viable regions, and the preservation of all viable bowel.

Intestinal viability is the most important factor influencing outcomes in patients with AMI. Non-viable intestine, if unrecognized, results in multi-system organ dysfunction and ultimately death. Prompt laparotomy allows for direct assessment of bowel viability.

After initial resuscitation, midline laparotomy should be performed, followed by assessment of all areas of the intestine with decisions for resection of all clearly necrotic areas. In cases of uncertainty, intraoperative Doppler may be helpful, as the presence of Doppler signals over distal branches of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) facilitates bowel conservation, avoiding long-term disability. The SMA is easily palpated by placing fingers behind the root of the mesentery. It is identified as a firm tubular structure, which may or may not have a palpable pulse. Alternatively, the SMA can also be reached by following the middle colic artery where it enters the SMA at the mesentery. Direct sharp dissection, exposing the artery, is recommended.

### Asymptomatic pneumoperitoneum in the setting of pneumatosis intestinalis: A benign entity or surgical emergency [^112b2c8x]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis is a potential cause of asymptomatic pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis. The disease can be managed conservatively and presents a clinical scenario where pneumoperitoneum does not necessitate surgical management. This case illustrates the importance of acknowledging the condition and its variable presentation, allowing for increased awareness and avoidance of invasive procedures when not indicated.

### Severe portal and systemic acidosis during CO-laparoscopy compared to helium or gasless laparoscopy and laparotomy in a rodent model: an experimental study [^115pai5A]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

This experimental study reports that CO2 pneumoperitoneum led to significant acidosis in the portal vein, vena cava, and common femoral artery compared to laparotomy (LT), helium, or gasless laparoscopy (LS) in spontaneously breathing rats. The tendency to aggravate under increased insufflation pressure and over time was noted. The observed influence of insufflation pressure compared to gas quality on the portal and systemic pH drop was minimal. Furthermore, there was no correction of the portal and central-venous acidosis using mechanical ventilation.
- **Ethical considerations**: The number of experimented animals was limited in all groups. Consequently, the results of the present study provide indications rather than definitive conclusions regarding the influence of CO2 on portal and systemic blood gases.
- **Future directions**: Larger and more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the presented findings.

A summary of the main findings and their context with the existing literature is available in Tables 5 and 6. Due to space constraints, these tables are omitted from this excerpt. The literature is cited in the reference list at the end of the article.

### Radiographic look-alikes: Distinguishing between pneumoperitoneum and pseudopneumoperitoneum [^1133vTvF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Air under the diaphragm seen on a plain radiograph usually signifies a perforated viscus, representing a surgical emergency and requiring an immediate consult with a surgeon. However, not all instances of air under the diaphragm on a plain radiograph indicate a surgical emergency.
- **Objectives**: This article presents two cases of air under the diaphragm with varying diagnoses and management. The first case illustrates pneumoperitoneum from a perforated viscus, while the second involves pseudopneumoperitoneum due to Chilaiditi syndrome, which will be discussed.
- **Case reports**: The first case involves a 45-year-old woman presenting with bloating, nausea, and vomiting after being diagnosed with diverticulitis four days prior. She was noted to be febrile and tachycardic. A chest radiograph revealed air under the diaphragm. A surgical consult led to a laparotomy, diagnosing her with a perforated viscus from sigmoid diverticulitis. The second case involves a 68-year-old woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, cough, nausea, and vomiting. A chest radiograph indicated possible free air under the diaphragm. A CT scan of the abdomen showed Chilaiditi syndrome, with the large bowel transposed between the liver and the diaphragm, but no free air. The patient was treated symptomatically and discharged home.
- **Conclusion**: It is crucial for physicians to distinguish between pneumoperitoneum and pseudopneumoperitoneum to facilitate proper diagnosis and treatment.

### Spontaneous gall bladder perforation with ischaemic bowel disease: A rare cause of acute abdomen with pneumoperitoneum in elderly [^1138egHC]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Perforation of the gall bladder can occur as a complication of acute (in 3%-10%) or chronic cholecystitis, presenting with or without gallstones. Other causes include trauma, neoplasms, steroid therapy, or vascular compromise. In 1934, Niemeier classified the condition into three types: Type I, acute perforation into the free peritoneal cavity; Type II, subacute perforation with abscess formation; and Type III, chronic perforation with fistula formation between the gall bladder and another viscus, with Type I experiencing the highest mortality rate. In particular, there are very few cases of gall bladder perforation associated with ischaemic bowel disease.

We present a case of Type I gall bladder perforation in a 70-year-old woman, without any apparent comorbidities, presenting with acute abdomen consistent with perforated duodenal ulcer with pneumoperitoneum on a plain abdominal radiograph and contrast-enhanced CT, with the eventual discovery of fundal perforation and ischaemic small bowel at laparotomy.

### Tension pneumoperitoneum attributable to COVID-19 [^111rqGRk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

An 84-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). His medical history included mild hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He was febrile, but his other vital signs were stable. On admission, computed tomography (CT) revealed multifocal and peripheral ground-glass opacities with predominant consolidation in the mid to lower lung (Figure 1). Three days after admission, he reported sudden severe dyspnea, nausea, and abdominal distension. His temperature was 37.4°C, blood pressure was 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate was 35 breaths/minute, pulse was 118/minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% with 4-liter nasal prongs (84% with room air). Physical findings revealed progressive abdominal discomfort without pain, guarding, or rebound tenderness. A chest radiograph showed free subdiaphragmatic air bilaterally (Figure 2). Repeat enhanced CT demonstrated a large amount of free air in the abdomen without intra-abdominal fluid collection, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum (Figure 3). Emergency percutaneous needle decompression with an 18-G venous catheter was performed. His dyspnea improved immediately without remission after the procedure. Subsequently, laboratory examinations showed no significant changes suggestive of intestinal perforation. Based on the clinical and laboratory findings, we diagnosed COVID-19 with tension pneumoperitoneum. Because there were no abdominal symptoms or radiologic findings of visceral perforation, conservative management was continued. His respiratory symptoms improved gradually. He was discharged after 7 days.

### Two similar cases of elderly women with moderate abdominal pain and pneumoperitoneum of unknown origin: A surgeon's successful conservative management [^1177mfpp]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with abdominal pain and pneumoperitoneum in radiological examination usually require emergency explorative laparoscopy or laparotomy. Pneumoperitoneum is mostly associated with gastrointestinal perforation. There are very few cases where surgery can be avoided. We present two cases of pneumoperitoneum with unknown origin and successful conservative treatment. Both patients were elderly women presenting to our emergency unit with moderate abdominal pain. There was neither medical intervention nor trauma in their medical history. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness, but no clinical signs of peritonitis. Cardiopulmonary examination remained unremarkable. Blood studies showed only slight abnormalities; in particular, inflammation parameters were not significantly increased. Finally, obtained CTs showed free abdominal gas of unknown origin in both cases. We performed conservative management with nil per os, nasogastric tube, total parenteral nutrition, and prophylactic antibiotics. After two weeks, both were discharged home.

### Peritonitis: Laparoscopic approach [^11537XUJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Laparoscopy has become the preferred surgical approach for a number of various diseases because it allows both a correct diagnosis and treatment simultaneously. In abdominal emergencies, both exploration to identify the causative pathology and the performance of an appropriate operation can often be accomplished via laparoscopy. There is still debate about whether peritonitis is a contraindication to this approach. The aim of the present work is to illustrate retrospectively the results of a case-control experience of laparoscopic versus open surgery for abdominal peritonitis emergencies carried out at our institution.
- **Methods**: From January 1992 to January 2002, a total of 935 patients (mean age 42.3 ± 17.2 years) underwent emergent and/or urgent surgery. Among them, 602 (64.3%) were operated on laparoscopically (of whom 112 or 18.7% had peritonitis), depending on the presence of a surgical team trained in laparoscopy. Patients with a history of malignancy, more than two previous major abdominal surgeries, or massive bowel distension were not treated laparoscopically. Peritonitis was not considered a contraindication to laparoscopy.
- **Results**: The conversion rate was 23.2% in patients with peritonitis and was mainly due to the presence of dense intra-abdominal adhesions. Major complications occurred in up to 5.3% of cases, with a postoperative mortality of 1.7%. A definitive diagnosis was accomplished in 85.7% (96 patients) of cases, and 90.6% (87) of these patients were successfully treated by laparoscopy.
- **Conclusion**: Even though limited by its retrospective nature, this study suggests that laparoscopy can be effectively utilized in the management of abdominal peritonitis emergencies.

### Portal venous gas detected on computed tomography in emergency situations: Surgery is still necessary [^111pzgVp]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Portal venous gas (PVG) has been reported to be associated with lethal surgical diagnoses. Recent studies tend to confirm the clinical significance of gas in the portal vein; however, some patients are managed without surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess both the diagnoses and the treatment of patients with PVG in an emergency surgical setting.
- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of 15 patients with PVG in the emergency setting detected by computed tomography (CT) between July 1999 and July 2004. Characteristics assessed included age, sex, clinical presentation, first CT diagnosis of both PVG and the underlying pathology, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, surgical findings, final clinical diagnosis, duration of hospitalization, and evolution of the illness/mortality. All patients were examined one month after operation.
- **Results**: This series of 5 women and 10 men ranged in age from 38 to 90 years at the time they underwent emergency surgical treatment. The mean preoperative ASA score was 4.20. Computed tomography diagnosed the underlying pathology in all cases: bowel obstruction (4 cases), bowel necrosis (9 cases), and diffuse peritonitis (2 cases). The mean length of hospital stay was 12.4 days. The mortality rate was 46.6% (7 patients).
- **Conclusions**: A wide range of pathologies can generate PVG. Computed tomography can detect both the presence of gas and the underlying pathology. In emergency situations, all the diagnosed causal pathologies required a surgical procedure without delay.

### An incidental finding? Pneumatosis intestinalis after minor trauma [^1149tEdd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) refers to the identification of air within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. This finding often marks serious underlying pathology, which can be potentially surgical in nature. However, this process may also occur within a benign context, for example, in patients who are chronically immunosuppressed. The prevalence of benign PI may be greater than previously anticipated because its discovery is facilitated by the increasingly widespread use of computed tomography (CT) scanning.
- **Objectives**: We will illustrate how widespread use of CT scanning after trauma leads to incidental findings, some of which are difficult to distinguish from acute pathologic findings. We will also discuss the differential diagnosis for PI and the associated clinical significance.
- **Case report**: A female patient with two autoimmune disorders requiring immunosuppression presented after minor trauma. Her clinical stability and benign examination led us to refrain from ordering a full radiographic evaluation, including an abdominal CT scan. She was safely discharged; however, per CT several days later, the incidental finding was made of PI with free intraperitoneal air. These findings after trauma commonly prompt an exploratory laparotomy, but given her persistent stability, we attributed this to immunosuppression rather than to recent trauma.
- **Conclusion**: The indications for ordering CT scans after minor trauma must be carefully considered, and incidental findings must be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical scenario.

### Updates on the causes, diagnosis, and management of peritoneal abscesses: A systematic review [^1149vufM]. Cureus (2023). High credibility.

The disease intra-abdominal abscess can be associated with a variety of conditions, such as acute appendicitis, abdominal trauma, and pneumoperitoneum. Symptoms and clinical findings often include tachypnea, an increased white blood cell (WBC) count, echinococcosis, and abdominal pain. Other common signs are decreased platelet count, fever, a positive blood bacterial culture, hypotension, and loss of appetite. Additional complications can be abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acute cholangitis, altered mental status, and sepsis.

Some gynecological issues, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, can also occur alongside symptoms like dehydration and Kehr's sign. Physical examination may reveal abdominal tenderness, free intraperitoneal fluid, and other peritoneal findings. Clinical signs of oliguria, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), acute diverticulitis, and recent abdominal surgery can be crucial indicators. Blood tests might show increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated serum transaminases.

- **Other symptoms include**
- Palpable abdominal mass
- Tachycardia
- Atelectasis
- Respiratory alkalosis
- Ileus
- Hiccups
- Acute cholecystitis

This comprehensive association of symptoms aids in the timely diagnosis and management of peritoneal abscesses.

### Tension pneumoperitoneum: A comprehensive review of etiologies, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117D6ECc]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Tension pneumoperitoneum (TPP) is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by free intraperitoneal air causing intra-abdominal hypertension and hemodynamic compromise. It shares physiologic features with abdominal compartment syndrome and requires timely recognition and intervention. This systematic clinical review evaluates the presentation, diagnostic strategies, management approaches, and outcomes associated with TPP.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Search terms included "tension pneumoperitoneum", "acute pneumoperitoneum", "surgery", and "needle decompression". Eligible studies included human case reports, case series, and narrative reviews addressing the pathophysiology, diagnosis, or management of TPP. Duplicates were removed, and a two-step screening process was employed to identify studies for inclusion. A total of 78 studies were selected, including 57 patient cases for subanalysis.

- **Results**: Of the 57 cases identified, 40 involved adults and 17 involved pediatric patients. The overall survival rate was 84.2%, with higher survival observed in the pediatric population (94.1% vs. 80%). Iatrogenic causes were the most common etiology, accounting for 56.1% of cases, followed by medical (24.6%), traumatic (14%), and idiopathic (5.3%) inciting events. Management strategies included percutaneous decompression alone (26.3%), operative intervention alone (29.8%), combined decompression and surgery (28.1%), and endoscopic management (7%).

### Imaging the postoperative patient: Long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^111zJkYx]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

A patient with bowel ischemia secondary to a strangulated obstruction exhibits gas inside the mesenteric veins (arrowheads) originating from a bowel segment that also presents intramural gas (curved arrows) after perforation of a gangrenous bowel wall. Portal venous gas (arrows) and pneumoperitoneum (stars) are also evident.

Clinical and laboratory differentiation between simple obstruction and incarceration/strangulation is very difficult, and treatment delay is a major prognostic factor for increased morbidity and poor survival. CT is extremely useful in discriminating between these two entities, and it plays an instrumental role in determining appropriate patient treatment (medical versus surgical). Findings of closed-loop obstruction should result in close monitoring, and if clinical symptoms persist, early surgery is suggested. In patients in whom signs of strangulation are already evident, emergency surgery is mandatory.
- **External hernias**: An incisional hernia is a type of external hernia caused by an incompletely healed surgical wound. Typically, peritoneal fat, with or without incorporation of bowel loops, protrudes through the hernial defect. A patient with an incisional external hernia shows a cluster of fluid and air-filled dilated bowel loops inside the hernial sac on the right flank (stars). Narrowing of the afferent and efferent ends of the closed loop at the site of the hernial neck can also be appreciated — the beak sign (arrows). Stretching of the mesenteric vessels is seen on the coronal re.

### The etiology of pneumoperitoneum in the 21st century [^115VYqCB]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the origin of free intraperitoneal air in this era of diminishing prevalence of peptic ulcer disease and imaging studies. In addition, we attempted to stratify the origin of free air by the size of the air collection.
- **Methods**: We queried our hospital database for "pneumoperitoneum" from 2005 to 2007 and for proven gastrointestinal perforation from 2000 to 2007. A massive amount of free air was defined as any air pocket greater than 10.0 cm.
- **Results**: Among patients with free air, the predominant causes were perforated viscus (41%) and postoperative (< 8 days) residual air (37%). For patients with visceral perforation, only 45% had free air on imaging studies; for these patients, the predominant causes were peptic ulcer (16%), diverticulitis (16%), trauma (14%), malignancy (14%), bowel ischemia (10%), appendicitis (6%), and endoscopy (4%). The likelihood that free air was identified on an imaging study by lesion was 72% for perforated peptic ulcer, 57% for perforated diverticulitis, but only 8% for perforated appendicitis. The origin of massive free air was equally likely to be gastroduodenal, small bowel, or colonic perforation.
- **Conclusion**: The cause of free air when surgical pathology is the source has substantially changed from previous reports.
- **Level of evidence**: Epidemiologic study, Level IV.

### Reappraisal of radiographic signs of pneumoperitoneum at emergency department [^113HKMhN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivities of the reported free air signs on supine chest and abdominal radiographs of hollow organ perforation. We also verified the value of supine radiographic images as compared with erect chest and decubitus abdominal radiographs in the detection of pneumoperitoneum.

Two hundred fifty cases with surgically proven hollow organ perforation were included. Five hundred twenty-seven radiographs were retrospectively reviewed on the picture archiving and communication system. Medical charts were reviewed for operative findings of upper gastrointestinal tract, small bowel, or colon perforations. The variable free air signs on both supine abdominal radiographs (KUB) and supine chest radiographs (CXR) were evaluated and determined by consensus without knowledge of initial radiographic reports or final diagnosis. Erect CXR and left decubitus abdominal radiographs were evaluated for subphrenic free air or air over the nondependent part of the right abdomen.

Upper gastrointestinal tract perforation was proven in 91.2%, small bowel perforation in 6.8%, and colon perforation in 2.0%. The positive rate of free air was 80.4% on supine KUB, 78.7% on supine CXR, 85.1% on erect CXR, and 98.0% on left decubitus abdominal radiograph. The anterior superior oval sign was the most common radiographic sign on supine KUB (44.0%) and supine CXR (34.0%). Other free air signs ranged from 0% to 30.4%.

Most free air signs on supine radiographs are located over the right upper abdomen. Familiarity with free air signs on supine radiographs can therefore improve diagnostic accuracy in emergency settings.

### Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^113ubYmY]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are performed for several reasons. The overuse of endoscopy has negative effects on the quality of healthcare and pressurizes endoscopy services. It can also result in complications such as pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous pneumomediastinum. However, it is worth noting that these complications rarely occur during endoscopy of the upper GI tract. When they do occur, they indicate perforation of the retroperitoneal space or peritoneal cavity. In this case report, we discuss an instance of pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema following an upper GI endoscopy.

### Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^1138sW5P]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

While eating, the patient felt that the meat was stuck somewhere in their chest. Doctors performed an endoscopy to remove it, but during the operation, the patient experienced shortness of breath and noticed facial swelling. The medical team explained that the patient had developed air entrapment in the body and took action to resolve the issue. The patient expressed appreciation for the efforts of the doctors and nurses in saving their life.
- **Learning points**:
	- Oesophageal perforation should be a suspected complication of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and can lead to subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum.
	- Point-of-care ultrasound is the first essential tool for detecting pneumothorax.
	- When undergoing evaluation for pneumomediastinum, conservative management should be applied. Oral administration is not appropriate at this time; instead, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and gastric aspiration may serve the purpose.
	- Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumomediastinum following endoscopy may rightly be described as self-limiting, benign, and without the need for radiological or surgical intervention.

### Portal-venous gas unrelated to mesenteric ischemia [^112P3hBf]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to report on eight patients with different non-ischemic etiologies for portal-venous gas and to discuss this rare entity and its potentially misleading CT findings in the context of a literature review. The CT examinations of eight patients who presented with intrahepatic portal-venous gas, unrelated to bowel ischemia or infarction, were reviewed and compared with their medical records, with special emphasis on the pathogenesis and clinical impact of portal-venous gas caused by non-ischemic conditions. The etiologies for portal-venous gas included:

- **Abdominal trauma**: (n = 1)
- **Large gastric cancer**: (n = 1)
- **Prior gastroscopic biopsy**: (n = 1)
- **Prior hemicolectomy**: (n = 1)
- **Graft-vs-host reaction**: (n = 1)
- **Large paracolic abscess**: (n = 1)
- **Mesenteric recurrence of ovarian cancer superinfected with Clostridium septicum**: (n = 1)
- **Sepsis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: (n = 1)

The clinical outcome of all patients was determined by their underlying disease and was not negatively influenced by the presence of portal-venous gas. Although the presence of portal-venous gas usually raises the suspicion of bowel ischemia and/or intestinal necrosis, this CT finding may also be related to a variety of non-ischemic etiologies and pathogeneses. Knowledge about these conditions may help to avoid misinterpretation of CT findings, inappropriate clinical uncertainty, and unnecessary surgery in certain cases.

### Peritoneal and systemic pH during pneumoperitoneum with CO2 and helium in a pig model [^1168htUx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Local peritoneal effects of laparoscopic gases might be important in peritoneal biology during and after laparoscopic surgery. The most commonly used gas, CO(2), is known to be well tolerated but also causes changes in acid-base balance. Helium is an alternative gas for laparoscopy. Although safe, it is not widely used. In this study, a method for monitoring peritoneal pH during laparoscopy was evaluated. Peritoneal pH during CO(2) and helium pneumoperitoneum was studied, as well as its systemic reflection in arterial pH.
- **Methods**: For these experiments, 20 pigs were used, with ten exposed to pneumoperitoneum with CO(2) and ten to helium. Peritoneal and sub-peritoneal pH were continuously measured before and during gas insufflation, during a 30-minute period with pneumoperitoneum and during a 30-minute recovery period. Arterial blood-gases were collected immediately before gas insufflation, at its completion, at 30 minutes of pneumoperitoneum, and after the recovery period.
- **Results**: Peritoneal pH before gas insufflation was 7.4 in all animals. An immediate local drop in pH (6.6) occurred in the peritoneum with CO(2) insufflation. During pneumoperitoneum, pH declined further, stabilizing at 6.4, but was restored after the recovery period (7.3). With helium, tissue pH increased slightly (7.5) during insufflation, followed by a continuous decrease during pneumoperitoneum and recovery, reaching 7.2. Systemic pH decreased significantly with CO(2) insufflation and increased slightly during helium insufflation. Systemic pH showed co-variation with intra-peritoneal levels.

### CT scan-detected pneumoperitoneum: An unreliable predictor of intra-abdominal injury in blunt trauma [^1176yaKD]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Free intra-peritoneal air in blunt trauma is a classic sign associated with hollow viscus injury, traditionally mandating laparotomy. In blunt abdominal trauma, the CT scan has become the diagnostic modality of choice. The increased sensitivity of CT scans may lead to detection of free intra-peritoneal air that is not clinically significant.
- **Objective**: To characterize conditions and findings that allow for the safe observation of blunt trauma patients with free air and to propose a patient management algorithm to decrease rates of non-therapeutic laparotomy.
- **Design**: A retrospective review of 5,877 blunt trauma patients who had an abdominal CT scan upon admission to our hospital from 2003 to 2011. A secondary CT review was performed by a single radiologist to further characterize the CT findings in the 74 patients with free air reported on the initial scan. Management and hospital course were reviewed in these patients.
- **Results**: Of the 74 patients with intra-abdominal free air, 36 patients with a benign clinical picture were observed, and 38 patients underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy. Eleven patients received a non-therapeutic laparotomy. The majority (61%) of patients, 45 of 74, had free air and no significant injury, suggesting the presence of benign free air. Patients who had intra-abdominal injury also typically had other clinical or radiologic signs of injury. Findings that were highly predictive of intra-abdominal injury in the setting of free air were free fluid (P < 0.001) and radiographic signs of bowel trauma (P < 0.001), as well as clinical and/or radiographic signs of injury.

### Elevated intrahepatic pressures and decreased hepatic tissue blood flow prevent gas embolus during limited laparoscopic liver resections [^111rTVd1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

As new techniques are emerging for laparoscopic liver resections, concerns have been raised about the development of gas embolus related to the CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. We hypothesized that elevated intrahepatic vascular pressures and decreased hepatic tissue blood flow (LQB) would prevent gas embolus during laparoscopic liver resections under conventional pneumoperitoneum.
- **Methods**: Intrahepatic vascular pressures and LQB were measured in nine pigs with varying CO(2) pneumoperitoneum. Gas embolus was determined after hepatic incision by monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), hepatic venous PCO(2), systemic blood pressure (SBP), and suprahepatic vena cava ultrasound.
- **Results**: As the pneumoperitoneum was increased from 0 to 15 mmHg, intrahepatic vascular pressures increased significantly (p < 0.05), while LQB decreased significantly (p < 0.05). A 2.0-cm hepatic incision at 4, 8, 15, and 20 mmHg produced no ultrasound evidence of gas embolus and no changes in PAP, SBP, or hepatic venous PCO(2) (p = NS).
- **Conclusion**: These data suggest that the risk of significant embolus under conventional pneumoperitoneum is minimal during laparoscopic liver resections.

### Peritonitis - the Eastern experience [^114NQ2Wa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Despite a better understanding of pathophysiology and advances in diagnosis, surgery, antimicrobial therapy, and intensive care support, peritonitis remains a potentially fatal affliction. Based on the source and nature of microbial contamination, peritonitis can be classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary peritonitis is an infection, often monomicrobial, of the peritoneal fluid without visceral perforation. Secondary peritonitis arises subsequent to the loss of integrity of a hollow viscus and is the most common form of peritonitis encountered. Tertiary peritonitis develops following treatment of secondary peritonitis, either due to failure of the host inflammatory response or due to superinfection. Thus, the contamination of the peritoneal cavity can lead to a cascade of infection, sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), and death if not treated in a timely manner.

This paper aims to present the experience of the East in terms of the spectrum of secondary peritonitis seen, its common causes, and outcomes.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^115qTvHj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Portal vein gas is a diagnostic sign indicating a serious intra-abdominal pathology that requires emergency surgery in most patients. Benign hepatic portal vein gas, resulting from less dangerous diseases, can be treated conservatively after excluding intra-abdominal catastrophes. The correlation between clinical and diagnostic findings is important for setting the management plan.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^113QfNg7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Management is largely applied to the underlying cause. However, there are cases where a surgeon will proceed to abdominal exploration in the presence of borderline abdominal signs. Gas in the portal vein is a good predictive factor for diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Traditionally, it is taught to operate once radiological evidence of portal vein gas (PVG) is obtained. However, with advances in diagnostic radiology, endoscopy, baseline support, and intensive care settings, a less invasive approach is suggested, especially for benign cases. This reduces the rate of negative laparotomies. Endoscopy can be very helpful in assessing or excluding upper and lower gastrointestinal pathology in the presence of PVG when a CT scan provides no diagnosis. More sensible decisions can be made in such situations. Patients diagnosed via CT scan with obstruction, infarction, or vascular problems need no further endoscopic confirmation and are candidates for emergency exploration.

Therefore, patients who present with PVG can be divided into three categories:

- **Firstly**: Those who have acute abdominal features and positive diagnostic criteria will need immediate exploration by laparoscopy or laparotomy.
- **Secondly**: Patients who have a positive diagnosis of PVG but without abdominal signs, are relatively stable, and have no mesenteric ischemia will be good candidates for a conservative approach.
- **Thirdly**: Patients who have borderline features of acute abdomen and less dense diagnostic signs of PVG may need endoscopic examination.

### Portomesenteric venous gas: Is gas distribution linked to etiology and outcome [^112F2cf6]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

To investigate various anatomical locations of portomesenteric venous gas detected by computed tomography (CT) and their relationship with the underlying etiology and outcome, a study was conducted with a cohort of 47 cases. These cases showed evidence of portomesenteric venous gas on abdominal CT examinations. Of these, 12 cases were identified through a retrospective PACS search, while 35 were prospectively included.
- **Methods**:
	- The presence of gas at specific anatomical locations in the portomesenteric venous vasculature was assessed according to a predefined classification. This included the arcade vessels close to the bowel segments, followed by segmental vessels, the superior mesenteric vein, and the extra- and intrahepatic portal vein.
	- The etiology of portomesenteric venous gas and its prognosis were determined by reviewing surgical reports, histopathology, and medical records.
	- Surgical intervention was performed on 30 patients.
- **Results**:
	- Ischemic etiology accounted for 68.1% of cases. Gas present in the arcade vessels was found to be the best indicator for ischemia (sensitivity 93.8%; specificity 70.0%; positive predictive value 90.9%; negative predictive value 77.8%) when compared to other locations and the mere presence of portomesenteric gas unrelated to location.
	- The overall mortality rate was reported at 53.2%. Gas in the arcade and segmental vessels was associated with considerably higher mortality rates (65.8% and 75.0%, respectively) and acceptable frequency of occurrence (80.9% and 59.6%, respectively).

The study results indicate that the presence of gas at specific anatomical locations in the portomesenteric venous system is linked to the underlying etiology and outcome, highlighting important prognostic markers for clinical assessment.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis presenting with a pneumoperitoneum in a patient with chronic bronchiectasis: a delayed diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery ischaemia [^1158zr4A]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a case of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) in a 69-year-old woman presenting to the surgical department with non-specific abdominal pain and a pneumoperitoneum. PI complicated by pneumoperitoneum was diagnosed based on characteristic clinical and abdominal CT findings, which demonstrated a cystic gas pattern within the small bowel wall. In the context of resolving clinical findings, a non-peritonitic abdomen, and with no evidence of portal venous gas or perforation, the patient was managed conservatively. The findings were considered benign and attributed to her chronic acquired bronchiectasis. Following recurrence of symptoms after several months, further imaging confirmed chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI) involving the superior mesenteric artery. Angioplasty was performed and symptoms resolved. PI is one of the few imaging signs to occur in CMI. PI presenting as a pneumoperitoneum is rare and may often lead to avoidable surgical intervention; however, no clear algorithm exists to guide surgical management.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^112G48BE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Portal vein gas is an ominous radiological sign, which indicates a serious gastrointestinal problem in the majority of patients. Many causes have been identified, with the most important being bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular accidents. The presentation of patients is varied, and the diagnosis of the underlying problem depends mainly on the radiological findings and clinical signs. The aim of this article is to show the clinical importance of portal vein gas and its management in emergency surgery.
- **Methods**: A computerized search was made of the Medline for publications discussing portal vein gas through March 2008. Sixty articles were identified and selected for this review because of their relevance. These articles cover a period from 1975 to 2008.
- **Results**: Two hundred seventy-five patients with gas in the portal venous system were reported. The most common cause for portal vein gas was bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular pathology (61.44%). This was followed by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (16.26%), obstruction and dilatation (9.03%), sepsis (6.6%), iatrogenic injury and trauma (3.01%), and cancer (1.8%). Idiopathic portal vein gas was also reported (1.8%).
- **Conclusion**: Portal vein gas is a diagnostic sign, which indicates a serious intra-abdominal pathology requiring emergency surgery in the majority of patients. Portal vein gas due to a simple and benign cause can be treated conservatively. Correlation between clinical and diagnostic findings is important to set the management plan.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^111tfZtw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is due to arterial occlusion (approximately 50% of cases), venous occlusion (15%), and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (35%). Clinical diagnosis is usually confirmed by the use of selective mesenteric angiography or CT scanning. One of the most important factors determining the prognosis of these patients is early and prompt diagnosis. Depending on the duration and extent of ischemia, treatment consists of embolectomy or laparotomy with resection of infarcted bowel segments in cases where the patient develops signs of peritonitis. The potential role of emergency laparoscopy in this condition relates more to its diagnostic rather than therapeutic opportunities.

Certain benefits of diagnostic laparoscopy are suggested. These patients are frequently severely dehydrated and acidotic, with significant co-morbidity, and are therefore at significant risk from contrast-dependent angiography. Conversely, diagnostic laparoscopy is relatively quick and well tolerated, and if necessary, can be performed at the bedside in the Intensive Care Unit or Emergency Room. During laparoscopy, the small and large bowel can be visualized, and other conditions causing an acute abdomen may be diagnosed, enabling correct management. However, the rate of mesenteric ischemia among patients with an acute abdomen is only 1%, and laparoscopy does not guarantee correct recognition of mesenteric ischemia, particularly in early cases. Nor does it allow palpation of the small bowel mesentery to detect arterial pulsation, despite a few published case reports.

### Gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^114fSfSE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

This is an update of the review published in 2013. Laparoscopic surgery is now widely performed to treat various abdominal diseases. Currently, carbon dioxide is the most frequently used gas for insufflation of the abdominal cavity (pneumoperitoneum). Although carbon dioxide meets most of the requirements for pneumoperitoneum, the absorption of carbon dioxide may be associated with adverse events. People with high anaesthetic risk are more likely to experience cardiopulmonary complications and adverse events, for example, hypercapnia and acidosis, which must be avoided by hyperventilation. Therefore, other gases have been introduced as alternatives to carbon dioxide for establishing pneumoperitoneum.
- **Objectives**: To assess the safety, benefits, and harms of different gases (i.e. carbon dioxide, helium, argon, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, and room air) used for establishing pneumoperitoneum in participants undergoing laparoscopic general abdominal or gynaecological pelvic surgery.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to September 2016), Ovid Embase (1974 to September 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to September 2016), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to September 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (September 2016), and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (September 2016).
- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum.

### Pneumoscrotum after jejunal perforation: A case report [^115rZeB8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pneumoscrotum is a rare disease entity characterized by the presence of gas in the scrotum. It has been observed following diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as in association with various disease states. The condition itself is benign but is linked to both incidental and potentially life-threatening conditions.
- **Objectives**: We discuss the pathophysiology and associated conditions of pneumoscrotum.
- **Case report**: We report a case of pneumoscrotum following jejunal perforation.
- **Conclusion**: Even though pneumoscrotum is a benign, rare condition, its presence should indicate the potential for a severe, life-threatening disease process within the peritoneum or retroperitoneum.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^111FnDTd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Portal vein gas (PVG) represents a challenge for the diagnosis and management of the underlying surgical cause in emergency surgery. PVG is not a disease; it is a diagnostic clue in patients who may be harboring an intra-abdominal catastrophe. Mortality could reach 75%; however, an increasing number of cases associated with benign conditions suitable for conservative treatment are being reported.

The majority of patients present acutely to the Accident and Emergency department. Following assessment, surgeons will be alarmed immediately by the patients' critical and unstable condition. A significant number of patients with PVG are misdiagnosed and admitted to the medical ward because they are elderly and unwell, and are subsequently not subjected to the specific diagnostic tools.

The most common underlying pathologies include bowel ischemia, alteration of the gastrointestinal lining, inflammation, and sepsis. However, PVG has recently been recognized as a rare complication of endoscopic and radiological procedures.

### Tension pneumoperitoneum during routine colonoscopy [^117B65tB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy is generally a safe and effective means to detect, diagnose, and treat colonic abnormalities. Although the overall complication rate is low, the morbidity and mortality following perforation approach 50%. Here we present a case of a 49-year-old woman undergoing routine colonoscopy when she suffered bowel perforation and tension pneumoperitoneum. This is a seldom occurrence and may result following bowel perforation with the rapid accumulation of free air into the peritoneal cavity. It is a life-threatening complication and a surgical emergency.

### Natural history of pneumoperitoneum after laparotomy: Findings on multidetector-row computed tomography [^112Zuotj]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative pneumoperitoneum after abdominal surgery represents a diagnostic challenge. This study was designed to analyze the appearance of pneumoperitoneum on computed tomography after uncomplicated abdominal surgery through laparotomy.
- **Methods**: The database of the department of digestive surgery was retrospectively queried to identify all patients who underwent abdominal surgery through laparotomy during a 13-month period. This initial search retrieved a total of 384 consecutive patients. Criteria for inclusion in this study were: (a) the operation was performed in our institution, (b) the patient had computed tomography examination postoperatively, and (c) the patient had no postoperative grade ≥ 3 complication.
- **Results**: Postoperative pneumoperitoneum was visible in 38/80 patients (47.5%), with a mean volume of 15 ± 22.8 (SD) cm³ and multiple locations in 32/38 patients (84%). Postoperative pneumoperitoneum was observed in 22/26 patients (85%) until day 5 postoperative, 14/34 patients (41%) between day 6 and day 15 postoperative, and in 2/21 patients (9.5%) after day 15 postoperative. Its volume decreased when the time interval between surgery and computed tomography increased. Results of multivariate analysis showed that the time interval between surgery and computed tomography was the single independent variable that was associated with the presence of postoperative pneumoperitoneum.
- **Conclusions**: Postoperative pneumoperitoneum is a frequent finding on computed tomography in the early period following abdominal surgery and commonly with multiple locations.

### Postoperative pneumoperitoneum: Is it normal or pathologic [^1116Qt4G]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum on computed tomography (CT) after abdominal surgery is common, but its incidence, duration, and clinical significance are widely debated.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent abdominal CT within 30 days of abdominal surgery was conducted.
- **Results**: Among 344 patients, pneumoperitoneum was found in 39% (135/344) of patients. It was observed on postoperative days 0–6 in 53%, 7–13 in 41%, 14–20 in 23%, 21–27 in 13%, and 28–30 in 0% of patients. Pneumoperitoneum was associated with the presence of a drain (P = 0.014) but not with age, gender, body mass index, smoking history, lung disease, or open versus laparoscopic surgery (P > 0.05 for all variables). Eight patients (6%) required intervention, most commonly for an anastomotic leak (4 patients, 50%).
- **Conclusions**: Postoperative pneumoperitoneum on abdominal CT can be seen in up to 23% of patients three weeks postoperatively. However, only 6% of the patients required intervention, emphasizing the typically benign consequences of postoperative free air.
