## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 15-year-old boy with fever, cough, diarrhea, macular rash, and acute limb weakness, with preserved reflexes and no meningeal signs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and timeline to anchor the syndrome. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and explicitly test each option against the data. Next, I will outline the immediate diagnostic workup, including CSF, MRI, and electrophysiology, and justify why each test is necessary. Finally, I will propose an initial management plan, monitoring priorities, and prognostic considerations, while verifying that each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical picture and timeline to avoid premature anchoring: a previously healthy adolescent with a 4-day prodrome of fever, cough, and diarrhea, followed by a macular rash on hands and legs and then acute, predominantly proximal limb weakness with preserved reflexes and no meningeal irritation, plus a respiratory count-to-10 impairment suggesting mild ventilatory compromise, which together point toward a post-infectious immune-mediated process rather than a primary CNS infection or compressive lesion [^115oqJ8F] [^114R7iKT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should generate a prioritized differential and then stress-test it. The leading considerations are Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) given the post-infectious timing and weakness, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) due to the acute flaccid pattern and prodrome, and immune-mediated myopathy or myositis because of proximal weakness and rash, with transverse myelitis and enteroviral infections like hand-foot-and-mouth disease as additional possibilities to exclude based on distribution of rash, reflex status, and imaging findings [^115oqJ8F] [^1176tyz6] [^1162nKxD] [^112WPuZn].

> I will now examine GBS as the top diagnosis. The antecedent respiratory and gastrointestinal illness fits the typical trigger profile, and the relatively symmetric proximal and distal weakness is consistent with GBS variants; however, wait, let me verify the reflex issue because classic GBS features areflexia or hyporeflexia, whereas here reflexes are preserved or even brisk, which is atypical but not incompatible with early or variant presentations, and the preserved sphincters and sensory modalities support a peripheral process rather than myelopathy, so I should not exclude GBS solely on reflexes [^115oqJ8F] [^115fRqzX] [^115KWqxX].

> Next, I should review AFM carefully. The acute flaccid limb weakness with a recent febrile prodrome is classic, and AFM often shows anterior horn gray matter involvement on MRI with longitudinally extensive lesions; hmm, wait a minute, the preserved reflexes could still be seen early or in partial forms, but I would expect more distal flaccidity and a sensory level if myelitis were present, so MRI of the spine is critical to distinguish AFM from GBS and to look for gray matter–predominant lesions spanning one or more segments, which would confirm AFM if present [^1176tyz6] [^112GyM1w] [^114R7iKT].

> Let me consider immune-mediated myopathy or myositis. The proximal pattern of weakness with rash could fit viral-triggered inflammatory myopathy, and the CK would likely be markedly elevated; I should double-check that we do not have myalgia-predominant symptoms or dysphagia here, which would further support myositis, and I need to ensure we order CK, aldolase, and autoimmune myositis panels if myopathy remains likely after initial testing [^1162nKxD].

> But wait, what if this is transverse myelitis or an enteroviral syndrome like HFMD with neurologic complications. Transverse myelitis would more often show a sensory level, sphincter involvement, and MRI evidence of longitudinally extensive cord lesions, which are not described here, making it less likely; HFMD can cause vesicular lesions and, rarely, brainstem encephalitis, but the macular rash and lack of oral lesions or cranial neuropathies make that less consistent, though I should still keep enteroviruses in mind given their link to AFM [^115Vfa27] [^112WPuZn] [^116WM611].

> I need to ensure the immediate workup is comprehensive and time-sensitive. I should confirm admission to a monitored setting given the risk of respiratory deterioration, obtain urgent CSF analysis to look for albuminocytologic dissociation supporting GBS versus pleocytosis favoring AFM or myelitis, and arrange MRI brain and whole spine with contrast to assess for nerve root enhancement in GBS versus anterior horn gray matter lesions in AFM; concurrently, I should order nerve conduction studies and electromyography to distinguish demyelinating neuropathy from axonal forms and to evaluate for anterior horn cell involvement, and I should add CK, comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC, and infectious serologies including enterovirus and SARS-CoV-2 given reported associations with AFM and GBS-like syndromes [^115KWqxX] [^114R7iKT] [^115oqJ8F] [^116WM611] [^1177AKjc].

> Hold on, I should verify the respiratory assessment and monitoring plan. The inability to count to 10 in one breath suggests reduced vital capacity and warrants frequent bedside respiratory monitoring, spirometry if cooperative, and a low threshold for ICU transfer for impending respiratory failure; I should also apply prognostic tools such as EGOS or mEGOS once sufficient data are available to estimate the likelihood of independent ambulation at 3 to 6 months, while acknowledging that early rapid progression can be ominous but is not perfectly predictive of long-term disability [^113Pp5gD] [^117P3yWs] [^114kjf3x].

> Next, I should review initial management contingent on the most likely diagnosis. If GBS is suspected, I should initiate intravenous immunoglobulin 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days or plasma exchange within the first 2 weeks of weakness onset, avoid corticosteroids which are not beneficial in GBS, and provide multidisciplinary care including pain control and thromboprophylaxis; if AFM is confirmed, supportive care remains the mainstay with early rehabilitation, though some centers consider IVIG or steroids despite limited evidence, and I should involve infectious disease and neurology early and report to public health given surveillance implications [^115KWqxX] [^115oqJ8F] [^1176tyz6] [^112GyM1w].

> I should double-check that I am not missing red flags that would change management. Autonomic instability, rapidly progressive bulbar weakness, or signs of spinal cord compression would alter priorities; the absence of meningeal signs and the preserved sphincter function reduce the likelihood of bacterial meningitis or compressive myelopathy, but I will keep a high index of suspicion and escalate imaging and supportive measures if the clinical course deviates from expectations [^115oqJ8F].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic pathway remains dynamic as new data arrive. The most likely diagnosis is GBS given the post-infectious timing and symmetric weakness, but AFM must be actively excluded with MRI and CSF because management and prognosis differ substantially; immune-mediated myopathy remains a consideration if CK is markedly elevated or if myopathic features emerge, and the respiratory status must be monitored closely with early ICU involvement if deterioration occurs [^115oqJ8F] [^1176tyz6] [^115KWqxX].

The most likely diagnosis is **Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)** [^115oqJ8F], given the acute, symmetric, ascending weakness with areflexia/hyporeflexia [^112E8A7i] following a recent febrile illness with cough and diarrhea, and the absence of sensory loss or sphincter involvement. The macular rash is likely a post-infectious or drug-related eruption and not specific to GBS. Key differentials to exclude are acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) [^112GyM1w], transverse myelitis [^114XqWVX], and myasthenia gravis [^114RCZJW]. Immediate workup should include **CSF analysis** [^115KWqxX], **nerve conduction studies** [^113v2jka], and **MRI of the brain and spine** [^114R7iKT] to confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics. Early **IVIG or plasma exchange** [^115KWqxX] is indicated to reduce severity and hasten recovery [^111KpKRt].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale** | **Supporting features** | **Refuting features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) | - Immune-mediated polyneuropathy <br/> - Often post-infectious <br/> - Ascending symmetric weakness with areflexia/hyporeflexia | - Recent febrile illness <br/> - Symmetric weakness <br/> - Areflexia/hyporeflexia <br/> - Preserved sensation | - Macular rash is atypical but not exclusionary [^1177AKjc] |
| Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) | - Poliomyelitis-like illness with acute flaccid paralysis <br/> - Often post-viral | - Acute flaccid weakness <br/> - Recent viral prodrome | - Sensory loss is uncommon <br/> - MRI shows gray matter lesions [^1176tyz6] |
| Transverse myelitis | - Inflammatory spinal cord disorder with sensory level and sphincter involvement | - Acute weakness <br/> - Sensory level <br/> - Sphincter dysfunction | - No sensory level <br/> - No sphincter involvement [^114XqWVX] |
| Myasthenia gravis | - Autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder with fluctuating weakness | - Fluctuating weakness <br/> - Fatigability | - No ocular or bulbar involvement <br/> - No fluctuation [^notfound] |
| Infectious myositis | - Viral or bacterial myositis with muscle pain and elevated CK | - Myalgia <br/> - Elevated CK | - No myalgia <br/> - No CK elevation reported [^notfound] |

## Diagnostic workup

- **CSF analysis**: Albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal cell count) supports GBS [^113c6kx9] [^115fRqzX].

- **Nerve conduction studies**: Demyelinating features (conduction block, temporal dispersion) confirm GBS [^113v2jka].

- **MRI brain and spine**: Exclude AFM, transverse myelitis, or other CNS pathology [^111EjMn9] [^115Vfa27].

- **Autoimmune serology**: ANA, anti-AChR antibodies to exclude autoimmune mimics [^notfound].

---

## Management

- **Supportive care**: Monitor respiratory function, autonomic status, and complications [^115KWqxX].

- **Immunotherapy**: IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day × 5 days) or plasma exchange within 2 weeks of onset [^115KWqxX].

- **Rehabilitation**: Early physiotherapy to preserve function and prevent complications [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Most patients recover significantly over months, though **20% have residual disability** and about **5% experience mortality** [^115oqJ8F] [^111KpKRt]. Early immunotherapy and supportive care improve outcomes [^113v2jka].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **GBS**; confirm with CSF and nerve studies, exclude AFM and transverse myelitis with MRI, and start IVIG or plasma exchange promptly [^115KWqxX].

Case Presentation

A 27-year-old accountant came to the ED with difficulty walking and progressive weakness of both lower limbs for 4 days' duration. He did not report a history of trauma or fall. He demonstrated no vertigo, headache, neck or back pain, disturbed vision, loss of weight, or weakness in upper limbs. He also reported difficulty breathing, fever, severe abdominal pain, and loose stools of 1 day's duration. His recorded maximum temperature at home was 38.3 °C. The fever subsided with oral paracetamol 500 mg. He did not report having weakness in any limb before the current presentation. He did not have comorbid diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Thirty days before presentation, he experienced fever, cough, and rhinorrhea and received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. At that time, symptoms had been minimal, vitals signs and chest radiography findings were normal, and he had undergone home isolation. He had maintained an oxygen saturation of 98% to 99% as measured on pulse oximetry. He had not received any treatment at that time. His symptoms had lasted for 7 days, and he remained asymptomatic up to the current presentation with paraparesis.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

Case presentation

We report the case of a Georgian construction worker in his 30s who presented to the emergency department having developed numbness in his hands the day before, and now with hand weakness, making it difficult to squeeze a lemon, followed by subjective leg weakness. On examination, power was Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4/5 in his dominant left hand and was felt to be normal in both legs with downgoing plantar responses. Deep tendon reflexes were not recorded. He was reviewed by the acute medical team and CT head was normal. He was discharged home, to return if needed.

He returned the following day, now with pain in his forearms and calves, and increased weakness and numbness in his feet. Review by the orthopaedic team found power to be of MRC grade 4/5 in bilateral wrist flexors and normal in his legs, although he had difficulty standing from sitting. Deep tendon reflexes were not recorded. Cervical and lumbar spine X-rays were normal. Urgent MRI of the cervical spine could not be performed due to a bullet in his left hand, confirmed on X-ray. He was discharged home with advice to return if required.

He came for the third time to the emergency department 2 days later, day 5 of weakness, this time with cough and fever starting on day 4, unable fully to lift his arms and with difficulty standing. He was normally fit and well and was taking no medications. He had no history of recent illness, no spinal pain and no sphincter disturbance. He had experienced regular epistaxis for over 2–3 weeks which had not occurred since childhood. He lived with his partner, was an ex-smoker and had travelled to Latvia for Christmas 3 months before and to Prague 4 weeks before, with a brief change in bowel habit. There had been no insect bites. He had already decided to stop work on the day the weakness started as he was worried there was insufficient social distancing on-site to protect against COVID-19. He was worried that the weakness was due to thyroid dysfunction, of which he had a family history.

### Case report: diagnosis of COVID-19 versus tropical diseases in Pakistan [^116aC98e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

A 25-year-old medical student presented in Multan, Pakistan with a high fever, cough, myalgia, and diarrhea consistent with the typical signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient had traveled to high COVID-19–risk areas within Pakistan and had no significant medical and surgical history. Based on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing, the patient was found to be negative for COVID-19. He subsequently developed a diffuse rash and had serology consistent with dengue and measles. The patient was treated symptomatically, and his condition gradually improved over 7 days. This case highlights the high prevalence of many tropical diseases in low-income countries and the need for clinicians to consider alternate diagnoses in addition to testing for COVID-19 during the pandemic.

We present a case of a 4-year-old who presented to the emergency department with an unsteady gait for 2 days. Ataxia is a rare but known manifestation of cerebellar involvement in Lyme disease. A 4-year-old (17 kg) boy with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with history of nonbloody emesis for 2 weeks and an unsteady gait for 2 days. Over the past 2 days, his gait had gotten progressively worse until he was unable to walk without assistance. The vomiting would usually occur 1 hour after eating meals. He had also complained of a single headache, which occurred approximately 10 days before admission. The headache did not occur in the early morning hours or wake him up from his sleep. His appetite for the weeks before admission had progressively decreased, and he had also become more irritable, especially when stimulated. He had increased fatigue for the week before presentation. His parents denied any fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, rash, bruising, bleeding, or hematuria. The patient denied any abdominal pain or headache while in the ED.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old male was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P. R. China, on June 30, 2014 with a history of fever, skin rash over hand and feet, headache, and weakness in lower limbs over the past 4 days. The patient also had intraoral and throat pain, and non-projectile vomiting 3 days prior to admission. Two days prior to admission, the patient developed drowsiness, startle, hand tremor, urinary incontinence, and progressive deterioration in consciousness. He reported recent contact with a HFMD. Medications were limited to recent use of over-the-counter analgesics. The patient's body temperature was 36.8 °C, respiratory rate was 25/min, pulse rate 98 beats/min, and blood pressure was 124/76 mmHg. Vesicular lesions and ulcers were present in the oral mucosa, and macular and vesicular lesions were present on palms and soles.

The patient was drowsy and non-verbal, but was responding to painful stimuli. He showed left-sided facial paralysis. The left nasolabial fold was flat and there was drooping of the mouth to the left side. The pupils were equal in size (diameter: 4 mm) and the pupillary light reflex was bilaterally symmetrical. Neck resistance was normal. The left upper and lower limbs showed reduced muscle strength (grade III–IV). The muscle strength in right limb was normal. Abdominal reflex and cremasteric reflex were normal. Pathological reflexes (e.g. Babinski, Chaddock, Oppenheim, Gordon) were negative. The rest of the physical findings were unremarkable.

Results of blood test were as follows: White blood cell count, 10.82 × 10 9; neutrophils, 92%; C-reactive protein, 80 mg/L, and blood glucose, 7 mmol/L.

### Dengue infection triggered immune mediated necrotizing myopathy in children: a case report and literature review [^1162nKxD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key message

- IMNM in children can be categorized as "acute onset" of weakness following a viral infection.

- Testing for relevant myositis autoantibodies may help improve diagnostic accuracy and allow for timely treatment with highly effective immunotherapies.

Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a recently recognized category of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies manifesting as symmetric proximal muscle weakness and high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, along with specific histopathological findings. There is a current paucity of data on the clinical phenotype of IMNM in the paediatric population. In this report, we described a boy with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR)-positive necrotizing myopathy who presented with acute onset of weakness after recent dengue infection.

This case involves a 9-year-old Thai boy who was previously healthy before developing high grade fever with myalgia for 4 consecutive days. During the resolution of the fever, erythematous itchy rashes on lower limbs resembling convalescent rashes in dengue infection were observed. He was diagnosed with dengue fever 11 weeks before referral to our hospital. He had positive serology with dengue IgM and IgG. A test for SAR-COV2 infection was not completed at that time because all of his symptoms developed in March 2019 prior to the pandemic. Five days after the fever subsided, he had proximal muscle weakness in the bilateral lower extremities so that he could no longer stand from a squatting position. He needed assistance to stand first before being able to walk. He denied any weakness in his upper extremities. He denied having any muscle pain or difficulty swallowing. The family also denied any use of herbal medicines or other toxic exposures. His family did not have any significant history of conditions such as neuromuscular and autoimmune disease. His physical examination revealed normal mental status and cranial nerve II-XII function. Motor power measured by the medical research council classification of bilateral proximal and distal upper extremities was grade 4/5 and 5/5, respectively. The proximal and distal muscle strength of his lower extremities were grade 3/5 and 4/5, respectively. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ all. Serum creatine kinase level (CK) was significantly elevated at 30,833 mg/dL (normal 55–324 mg/dL).

### Proximal muscle weakness [^1128NTy8]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman gave a 1-year history of difficulties climbing stairs and walking long distances, needing a wheelchair at times. More recently, she had also experienced weakness of her arms with difficulties doing her hair or lifting light weights. She reported shortness of breath on mild exertion and had lost 12 pounds in weight because of muscle loss. She had no muscle pain, episodes of dark urine, muscle twitching, visual disturbances, hearing loss, speech difficulties, dysphagia, numbness or tingling, bladder or bowel difficulties, fevers, rash or joint pain. She had met all milestones at a normal age and had normal development.

Her medical history was unremarkable. She had not taken any lipid-lowering agents and there was no illicit drug use or toxic exposure. There was no relevant family history and no consanguinity.

On examination, she showed bilateral and symmetric scapular winging. There was no percussion or action myotonia or paramyotonia, and no fasciculations. Her muscle bulk and tone were normal. Cranial nerves were all normal. Manual muscle strength testing showed the following Medical Research Council (MRC) grades (right/left where applicable): neck flexion 4–, neck extension 5, shoulder abduction 4/4, external rotation of elbow 4/4, elbow flexion 4/4, elbow extension 4+/4+, wrist flexion 5/5, wrist extension 5/5, finger flexion 5/5, finger extension 5/5, hip flexion 4/4, hip extension 3/3, hip abduction 3/3, knee extension 4+/4+, knee flexion 4/4, ankle dorsiflexion 5/5 and ankle plantar flexion 5/5.

A 30-year-old man attended the emergency department with a 4-day history of progressive, bilateral upper limb weakness. He had mild shortness of breath and occasional swallowing difficulties. One month prior to presentation, he had flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea. Examination revealed upper limb hypotonia, symmetrical distal arm weakness and hyporeflexia. Power and reflexes in the lower limbs were normal. Nerve conduction studies and lumbar puncture demonstrated features consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The patient was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulins. He improved significantly over the next 2weeks. Breathing and swallow function did not deteriorate and required no further intervention. He had a sustained improvement, and remained at baseline 1year later. Work-up for underlying structural, infectious, inflammatory and paraneoplastic aetiologies were negative. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were positive for the anti-GT1a IgG isotype supporting the clinical diagnosis of the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS.

### Pearls and oy-sters: tuberculous meningitis: not a diagnosis of exclusion [^114pfenv]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to his local emergency department with 5 days of headache, which was dull, occipital, bilateral, nonthrobbing, and progressively worsening. It was associated with mild fever, photophobia, and neck pain and stiffness. He had no history of headache, chronic illness, recent vaccinations, cutaneous rash, cough, diarrhea, arthralgia, or myalgia. He was from Ecuador and had been living in the United States for less than 1 year. He had been incarcerated while in Ecuador. Sublingual temperature on admission was 102.6°F. Other vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, he appeared thin but not cachectic. He had meningismus and photophobia, but no papilledema and his mental status was alert and attentive. There were no focal neurologic deficits. CSF contained red blood cells: 24 × 10(3)/μL; white blood cells: 85/μL (lymphocytic predominant); protein: 128 mg/dL; and glucose: 48 mg/dL (CSF/serum glucose ratio = 0.53). CSF Gram stain and cultures, PPD test, and blood and urine cultures were all negative. CT scan of the head on day of admission was entirely normal. MRI without gadolinium contrast showed a single punctate T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal periventricular white matter. Chest radiograph was clear. He received empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Corticosteroids were not given. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and continued to be intermittently febrile. On day 5, he became abruptly more somnolent, then comatose, opening eyes only to pain, his pupils were 5 mm and reactive, he had intact brainstem reflexes, withdrawing both arms and legs. Emergent head CT showed development of hydrocephalus and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was emergently placed. The neurologic examination did not improve after shunt placement, and repeat head CT showed increased hydrocephalus with bilateral cerebral infarcts. On day 11, he was transferred to Columbia University Medical Center for intensive care. He was febrile and comatose. He did not open his eyes to pain, pupils were 7 mm minimally reactive, brainstem reflexes were intact, and he exhibited extensor posturing to pain. Mannitol was given, corticosteroid therapy was started, and an extraventricular drain was placed. The next day, his right pupil was 8 mm and nonreactive. MRI showed diffuse contrast enhancement of the arachnoid, extensive infarction of basal ganglia, midbrain, and pons, and small ring-enhancing lesions in the cerebellum (figure 1, A-D). Repeat lumbar puncture showed red blood cells: 550 × 10(3)/μL; white blood cells: 250/μL (14% neutrophils, 80% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes); protein: 65 mg/dL; and glucose: < 10 mg/dL (CSF/serum glucose ratio = 0.08). CSF testing for Cryptococcus and toxoplasmosis was negative. CSF acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative ×2, and CSF nucleic acid amplification test was also negative for tuberculosis. Serum HIV test was negative. Not until 14 days after initial presentation and 3 days after transfer to the intensive care unit was antituberculosis therapy finally started, because the pattern of infarcts on the MRI suggested basilar meningitis and he had not improved on broad-spectrum antibiotics. That same day, the first sputum AFB smear was positive, as were all succeeding daily sputum AFB smears. Tuberculosis nucleic acid amplification was positive from the sputum, but persistently negative from the CSF. Daily portable chest radiographs had been normal (read as likely atelectasis), but chest CT showed dense consolidations in the left lung and diffuse micronodular opacities throughout both lungs. Two days later, only 21 days after the onset of his headache, the patient died of cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to transtentorial cerebral herniation. Thirteen days later, the CSF culture became positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to streptomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

### Differentiating familial neuropathies from Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^112aLDGE]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Differentiating Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) from inherited neuropathies and other acquired peripheral neuropathies requires understanding the atypical presentations of GBS and its variant forms, as well as historical and physical features suggestive of inherited neuropathies. GBS is typically characterized by the acute onset of ascending flaccid paralysis, areflexia, and dysesthesia secondary to peripheral nerve fiber demyelination. The disorder usually arises following a benign gastrointestinal or respiratory illness, is monophasic, reaches a nadir with several weeks, and responds to immunomodulatory therapy. Inherited neuropathies with onset before adulthood, whose presentation may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome, are reviewed.

### Acute human immunodeficiency virus syndrome in an adolescent [^115HoDfT]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion illness is a difficult diagnosis to make because of its nonspecific and protean manifestations. We present such a case in an adolescent. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 5-day history of fever, sore throat, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient also reported a nonproductive cough, coryza, and fatigue. The patient's only risk factor for HIV infection was a history of unprotected intercourse with 5 girls. Physical examination was significant for fever, exudative tonsillopharyngitis, shotty cervical lymphadenopathy, and palpable purpura on both feet. Laboratory studies demonstrated lymphopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and urinalysis were normal. The following day, the patient remained febrile. Physical examination revealed oral ulcerations, conjunctivitis, and erythematous papules on the thorax; the purpura was unchanged. Serologies for hepatitis B, syphilis, HIV, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Bacterial cultures of blood and stool and viral cultures of throat and conjunctiva showed no pathogens. Coagulation profile and liver enzymes were normal. Within 1 week, all symptoms had resolved. The platelet count normalized. Repeat HIV serology was positive, as was HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction. Subsequent HIV viral load was 350 000, and the CD4 lymphocyte count was 351/mm3. HIV is the seventh leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24 in the United States, and up to half of all new infections occur in adolescents. Our patient presented with many of the typical signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection: fever, fatigue, rash, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, emesis, and diarrhea. Other symptoms commonly reported include headache, myalgias, arthralgias, aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy, thrush, weight loss, night sweats, and genital ulcers. Common seroconversion laboratory findings include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. The suspicion of acute HIV illness should prompt virologic and serologic analysis. Initial serology is usually negative. Diagnosis therefore depends on direct detection of the virus, by assay of viral load (HIV RNA), DNA polymerase chain reaction, or p24 antigen. Both false-positive and false-negative results for these tests have been reported, further complicating early diagnosis. Pediatricians should play an active role in identifying HIV-infected patients. Our case, the first report of acute HIV illness in an adolescent, emphasizes that clinicians should consider acute HIV seroconversion in the appropriate setting. Recognition of acute HIV syndrome is especially important for improving prognosis and limiting transmission. It is imperative that we maintain a high index of suspicion as primary care physicians for adolescents who present with a viral syndrome and appropriate risk factors.

### Increase in acute flaccid myelitis-United States, 2018 [^112bzrcr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In August 2018, CDC noted an increased number of reports of patients having symptoms clinically compatible with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare condition characterized by rapid onset of flaccid weakness in one or more limbs and spinal cord gray matter lesions, compared with August 2017. Since 2014, CDC has conducted surveillance for AFM using a standardized case definition. An Epi-X* notice was issued on August 23, 2018, to increase clinician awareness and provide guidance for case reporting.

Patients who meet the clinical case criteria for AFM, defined as acute flaccid limb weakness, are classified using the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definitions of "confirmed" (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter and spanning ≥ 1 spinal segments), "probable" (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] pleocytosis [> 5 white blood cells per mm 3]), or "not a case".

Among 106 patients with acute flaccid limb weakness classified during January 1–November 2, 2018, 80 cases of AFM were classified as confirmed (from 25 states) (Figure), 6 as probable, and 20 as noncases. This represents a threefold increase in confirmed cases compared with the same period in 2017. Among confirmed cases, the median patient age was 4 years (range = 7 months–32 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 2.4–7.6 years), 47 (59%) were male, and, among 65 patients with information on race available, 56 (86%) were white. During the 4 weeks preceding the onset of limb weakness, signs and symptoms consistent with a viral illness were reported for 79 (99%), including fever for 65 (81%), respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion) for 62 (78%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. vomiting and diarrhea) for 30 (38%) patients with confirmed AFM. Upper limb only involvement was reported by 38 (47.5%) patients, lower limb only by 7 (8.8%), two to three upper and lower limbs by 12 (15.0%), and all four limbs by 23 (28.8%). All patients with confirmed AFM were hospitalized, and 47 (59%) were admitted to intensive care units; no deaths have been reported.

CASE

A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department of Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan with a 3-day history of high fever, chills, dry cough, myalgias, and diarrhea. He reported a sudden onset of symptoms. The patient is a medical student with no prior medical history. He reported recent travel with his family to Islamabad and Karachi, regions with known novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission, but family members denied similar complaints. The patient's childhood and adult immunization records showed that all immunizations were up to date.

Considering the emergence of COVID-19 and the patient's travel history, he was admitted to the hospital. Droplet and contact precautions were initiated. The staff caring for the patient were provided appropriate personal protective equipment.

In the ward, the patient was continuously shivering, with a temperature of 39.5°C, pulse 140 per minute, blood pressure 95/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18 per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were equal and clear in both lung fields. Chest radiographs showed no abnormalities.

Initial laboratory tests were mostly unremarkable but showed mild elevation of liver function tests (Table 1). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 by reverse transcriptase–Polymerase chain reaction, and both tests were negative. Therefore, we decided to steer the patient's management toward other infectious diseases within our differential diagnosis.

Table 1
Clinical laboratory results

The patient was treated with intravenous hydration, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and paracetamol. Initially, he experienced relapsing high fevers, productive cough, severe myalgias, and worsening diarrhea. On the third day of hospital admission, the patient developed a maculopapular rash on the face and trunk, which gradually spread to the extremities over 2 days. To evaluate the rash, measles and varicella antibody tests were also conducted.

Microscopy of thick and thin smears for malaria, serology and surface antigen markers for viral hepatitis, and bacterial blood and stool cultures were negative. Testing for dengue showed positive IgM titers (1.6 U/L) and borderline NS1 antigen (0.8 µg/mL) results. Further serologic investigation revealed elevated IgM (137 U/L) against measles virus and negative serology for varicella. The same treatment measures were continued. By day 7, the patient's fever, rash, and diarrhea had subsided; intravenous access was removed; and he was discharged.

### Extensive longitudinal acute transverse myelitis complicated by pulseless ventricular tachycardia and recent shingles vaccination [^115Vfa27]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This case describes a 50-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of ascending bilateral lower extremity paresthesia one week following a shingles vaccine. MRI of the patient's spine was significant for longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintensity involving the lower cervical spine with extension into the upper thoracic spine suggestive of acute transverse myelitis (ATM). The patient's hospital course was complicated by a self-limiting episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness. Initial treatment included IV solumedrol, however due to lack of clinical improvement after a 5-day steroid treatment, plasmapheresis was initiated. The patient's condition improved with plasmapheresis and he was subsequently discharged to a rehab facility with a diagnosis of ATM of unclear etiology. Extensive serology, cardiac and CSF studies failed to determine the cause of this patient's myelitis or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The following case report explores the potential factors that may have contributed to this patient's symptoms.

Case Presentation

A 62-year-old woman with no medical history was admitted to the ED for fever, acute respiratory failure, and pain in the right lower limb. Three months prior to presentation, she had spent 45 days travelling through India and Thailand. She presented with no signs of traveler's disease such as fever or diarrhea during that trip. Two weeks following her return to France, the patient presented with an episode of bronchitis and received 5 days of treatment with cefixime (a third-generation cephalosporin). Despite this antibiotic treatment, her symptoms worsened and she developed, over the following 3 weeks, general weakness and arthralgia/myalgia. Due to the severity of hypoxemia, the patient was immediately transferred to the ICU.

### Very early and early neurophysiological abnormalities in Guillain-Barrésyndrome: a 4-year retrospective study [^113v2jka]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants are the most commonly acquired acute polyneuropathies and the leading cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. GBS more often affects males and adults between 50 and 70 years of age (incidence = 0.81–1.89/100,000). There are several clinical presentations but the more common features are progressive bilateral weakness of the lower limbs often ascending to the arms and bulbar muscles, associated with absent or reduced tendon reflexes. Diagnosis is based on findings from clinical history and neurological examination. Electrophysiological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations can corroborate the diagnosis. Abnormal findings in both are necessary to meet Brighton criteria Level 1 (highest level of certainty) or 2. Early detection and early initiation of treatment can limit disease severity, obviating the need for mechanical ventilation and improving the chances of early recovery.

Moreover, electrophysiological studies are key to diagnosis, subtype classification, and prognosis. Serial studies may be necessary for the diagnosis of subtypes, and a second study is recommended in patients lacking demyelinating features or with conduction blocks (CBs) without temporal dispersion. Early neurophysiological examinations can reveal anomalies that are not specific for primary demyelinating neuropathy and may not meet neurophysiological criteria for GBS. With the present study, we wanted to identify the most common electrophysiological abnormalities within 15 days from symptom onset in patients with GBS.

### Pediatric acute flaccid paralysis: enterovirus D68-associated anterior myelitis [^111x4Gp7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Enteroviral infections can cause acute flaccid paralysis secondary to anterior myelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important in the diagnosis of this potentially devastating pediatric disease. Before the 2014 outbreak of Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), the virus was considered a relatively benign disease.

Case Report

A fully immunized 8-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department complaining of a cough, headache, neck pain, and right arm pain and weakness. Deep tendon reflexes in the weak arm could not be elicited. MRI of the brain and cervical spine revealed anterior myelitis of the cervical spine. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone with no initial improvement. He was then given intravenous immunoglobulin over 3 days with improvement in symptoms. Nasal swab polymerase chain reaction revealed EV-D68. Despite medical management, the child was left with long-term motor disability in the effected extremity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Acute flaccid paralysis is a potential devastating complication of enteroviral infections. Extremity complaints in the clinical setting of central nervous system infection should raise concern for encephalomyelitis. MRI is extremely helpful in establishing this diagnosis. Prevalence of non-polio enteroviral paralytic events is increasing in the United States. Potential EV-D68 cases should be reported to local health departments. Emergency medicine providers should consider this complication in the child with acute, unexplained significant respiratory illness with new neurologic complaints.

A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2years. A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'. Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old Ethiopian man, with no significant past medical history, presented to our hospital, 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, with both bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. He initially developed a sudden-onset bilateral lower limb swelling on day 7 post-vaccine. Following on from that, he developed dyspnea on exertion and scrotal swelling over a time span of 2 weeks. He denied fever, chills, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, joint pain, change in the color or amount of urine, hematuria or dysuria. The patient did not report any recent viral infection, and he did not travel or come in contact with any sick people. Furthermore, he denied taking any herbals or over the counter medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient also denied having a similar episode in the past or having a family history of kidney diseases. He is married and works in an office. He occasionally drinks alcohol, but he does not smoke cigarettes.

Upon presentation, his temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg, heart rate was 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. On physical examination, he had a decreased air entry at both lung bases, and massive bilateral lower limb pitting edema extending to above the knees and scrotal swelling. The rest of the exam was unremarkable with no palpable lymph nodes. The initial laboratory investigations (Table 1) revealed serum creatinine of 80 μmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 3.9 mmol/L and albumin of 8 g/L. His urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 2+ blood. He only had 4 red blood cells per high power field on urine microscopy, while his 24-h urine protein was 15 g. His immunologic workup, including complements (C3, C4), antinuclear and anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies, was normal. Additionally, HIV, hepatitis B, C and nasopharyngeal COVID-19 polymerase chain reactions were all negative. Chest x-ray revealed prominent vascular markings and mild bilateral pleural effusion, while abdominal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys with normal echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation. The patient did not have previous lab results or imaging prior to this hospitalization.

Clinical data

A 13-year-old female was admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University with persistent pain in her left ankle, elbow, and knee joints for over six months. The patient had been experiencing progressive difficulty in walking, multiple episodes of electric shock-like pain in both lower limbs, as well as urinary and fecal incontinence for the past two weeks. The patient had no history of fever, trauma, vomiting, diarrhea, or gastric surgery. There were no identifiable illnesses, vaccinations, or physiological stressors before the onset of symptoms. The patient denied any use of recreational drugs, including nitrous oxide, and there was no family history of consanguinity or neurological disorders. Weakness and numbness in both lower limbs had been reported for about a year. The patient had experienced repetitive megaloblastic anemia in the past two years and was treated with oral VitB 12, which was stopped after the symptoms improved. Additionally, the patient had a history of intermittent abdominal pain, and gastroscopy revealed non-atrophic gastritis. The patient appeared anemic after a physical examination. Notably, the patient was a vegan. Neurological assessment indicated normal muscle tension and strength in the upper limbs, while strength in the lower limbs was decreased (power grade 2/5). Furthermore, kinesthesia, tactile sense, position senses were absent in the distal ends of the lower limbs. Swelling and pain were noted in the left ankle, knee, and elbow joints. The patient had lower extremity tremors and increased pain sensitivity. Bilateral knee reflexes were active, with positive findings for bilateral ankle clonus and Babinski's sign. The patient could not complete the heel-knee-tibia test. Besides, the examination of cranial nerves yielded normal results.

Case presentation

Medical history

A 55-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of dizziness, headache and bilateral eye pain, followed by 4 days of bilateral blurred vision, bilateral ptosis, and difficulty moving the eyes. He denied any other neurological symptoms. Seventeen days prior, the patient experienced a 2-day episode of cough and joint pain that resolved without treatment. His medical history included hypertension, which was managed with nifedipine and valsartan. The patient denied any history of glaucoma or prior intraocular pressure abnormalities.

Physical examination

The patient was alert but exhibited slurred speech, ataxia, and an unsteady gait. He also had inaccurate finger-to-nose test, a positive Romberg's sign, and the absence of deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Otherwise, the neurological examination revealed symmetrical nasolabial folds, a centered tongue, an intact gag reflex, an intact sensation of pain, and normal muscle strength and tone in the upper and lower extremities. Meningeal irritation signs and Babinski's sign were negative.

Ophthalmological examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/30 in the right eye (OD) and 20/100 in the left eye (OS). The patient's intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated at 35 mmHg OD and 46 mmHg OS. Moderate ptosis (MRD1 1 mm OU, Fig. 1) and fixed globes were observed bilaterally. The pupils were moderately dilated (approximately 4.5 mm in diameter OU, Fig. 1) with sluggish light reflexes. The conjunctiva and cornea were normal bilaterally. Gonioscopy revealed predominantly wide-open angles (Scheie classification: grade I temporally OD and grade I nasally OS; Spaeth classification: D28r OD, D26r OS). The lens cortex exhibited mild opacity with clear vitreous bilaterally. The optic disc margins were sharp, with a cup-to-disc ratio (C/D) of 0.8 OD and 0.9 OS. No retinal hemorrhages, exudates, or macular abnormalities were noted.

Case study

A 9-year-old, fully immunized girl presented with 7 days of fever; anorexia; nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting; and diarrhea. She had a widespread, nonpruritic eruption over her trunk and limbs. The patient had oral ulcers and complained of significant muscle and joint pain. Her review of systems was otherwise negative. Her mother reported no sick contacts or recent travel. Her medical history was significant for attention deficit hyperactive disorder and cognitive and speech delays, for which she was taking sertraline, guanfacine, melatonin, vitamin C, and omega-3. Family history was negative for inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune or rheumatologic diseases.

Her vital signs on presentation were notable for a fever of 39.3°C, tachycardia (heart rate, 123 beats/min), normal blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Examination found an ill-appearing, irritable, obese girl with widespread papules and pustules on erythematous bases located over her palms, soles, face, trunk (Fig 1, A), and upper and lower extremities (Fig 1, B and C). There were 2 small, shallow, oval ulcers on her tongue and buccal mucosa. She had no swelling, warmth, or erythema over any joint or muscle group but was unable to walk because of lower extremity pain. The rest of her examination was unremarkable.

### European Academy of Neurology / Peripheral Nerve Society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115KWqxX]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy. Symptoms may vary greatly in presentation and severity. Besides weakness and sensory disturbances, patients may have cranial nerve involvement, respiratory insufficiency, autonomic dysfunction and pain. To develop an evidence-based guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of GBS, using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology a Task Force (TF) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) and the Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) constructed 14 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome questions (PICOs) covering diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of GBS, which guided the literature search. Data were extracted and summarised in GRADE Summaries of Findings (for treatment PICOs) or Evidence Tables (for diagnostic and prognostic PICOs). Statements were prepared according to GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks. For the six intervention PICOs, evidence-based recommendations are made. For other PICOs, good practice points (GPPs) are formulated. For diagnosis, the principal GPPs are: GBS is more likely if there is a history of recent diarrhoea or respiratory infection; CSF examination is valuable, particularly when the diagnosis is less certain; electrodiagnostic testing is advised to support the diagnosis; testing for anti-ganglioside antibodies is of limited clinical value in most patients with typical motor-sensory GBS, but anti-GQ1b antibody testing should be considered when Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is suspected; nodal-paranodal antibodies should be tested when autoimmune nodopathy is suspected; MRI or ultrasound imaging should be considered in atypical cases; and changing the diagnosis to acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (A-CIDP) should be considered if progression continues after 8weeks from onset, which occurs in around 5% of patients initially diagnosed with GBS. For treatment, the TF recommends intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 0.4g/kg for 5days, in patients within 2weeks (GPP also within 2–4weeks) after onset of weakness if unable to walk unaided, or a course of plasma exchange (PE) 12–15L in four to five exchanges over 1–2weeks, in patients within 4weeks after onset of weakness if unable to walk unaided. The TF recommends against a second IVIg course in GBS patients with a poor prognosis; recommends against using oral corticosteroids, and weakly recommends against using IV corticosteroids; does not recommend PE followed immediately by IVIg; weakly recommends gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants or carbamazepine for treatment of pain; does not recommend a specific treatment for fatigue. To estimate the prognosis of individual patients, the TF advises using the modified Erasmus GBS outcome score (mEGOS) to assess outcome, and the modified Erasmus GBS Respiratory Insufficiency Score (mEGRIS) to assess the risk of requiring artificial ventilation. Based on the PICOs, available literature and additional discussions, we provide flow charts to assist making clinical decisions on diagnosis, treatment and the need for intensive care unit admission.

PRESENTING FEATURES: A 53-year-old man who had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a 3-month history of increasing dysphagia, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and an episode of syncope. His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10(3)/microL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/microL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD4 count of 8 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, and a PO2 of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Induced sputum was negative for Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, or acid-fast bacilli. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. What is the diagnosis?

Case Report

A 7-year-old boy presented to our outpatient department with a history of pain and swelling in multiple joints for 6 months and refusal to walk and sit for 1 month. The child was apparently normal 6 months before, when he had fever for few days documented at 101°F to 102°F, which responded to antipyretics. Subsequently, his parents first noticed swelling of the right ankle followed by bilateral knee swelling associated with minimal pain. The child had lower back pain and bilateral hip pain after few days with painful limping followed by difficulty to sit from a lying position. He was diagnosed to have juvenile spondyloarthropathy and was started on antirheumatic medications. After 6 weeks of using the medications, pain and swellings persisted. He was confined to bed over the past 1 month. The child had recurrent abdominal pain with loss of appetite, which the parents attributed to the effect of medications. He was mainly feeding on milk, juice, and biscuits.

There was no history of trauma, fever, morning stiffness, and small joints involvement. There was no history of skin rash or bleeding manifestations. There was no history of recurrent infections. Birth and vaccination history was insignificant. No behavioral changes were observed. He is a student in the second year of elementary school. There was no family history of similar complaints or any chronic diseases.

On general examination, the child was alert and oriented. Face, hair, and eyes were normal. Mild gingivitis was noted along the upper incisors. No lymphadenopathy and no skin lesions were observed. The body mass index was calculated to be 27.8 kg/m 2. Respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examination findings are normal.

The child was lying on the bed with lower limbs in frog-like position and semiflexed at hips and knees. Both knee joints were swollen, warm, and tender. Overlying skin was normal, and thigh muscle wasting was noted. The child was apprehensive and resisted examination of movements at hip and knee joints.

### Myoedema: a forgotten sign in acute colchicine myopathy [^116ugBwv]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Colchicine myopathy typically presents acutely to subacutely with progressive limb weakness. The patients may not be on high doses of colchicine but almost always have acute kidney injury. Dehydration from colchicine-induced diarrhoea is often a precipitating factor. The concomitant neurotoxicity may produce mild sensory complaints. This combination of acute neurological symptoms preceded by diarrhoea prompts the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The absence of cranial nerve deficits, raised creatine kinase and myotonic discharges on electromyogram may help in differentiating this condition from GBS. We describe a clinical sign, myoedema — a mounding phenomenon of muscle that is elicited by percussion and resolves when the patient recovers. It aids in the bedside diagnosis of acute colchicine myopathy as well as distinguish it from other more common causes of acute flaccid paralysis. We also discuss the possible mechanism of colchicine toxicity and the mounding phenomenon.

### A possible Guillain-Barrésyndrome / transverse myelitis overlap syndrome after recent COVID-19 [^112Mk9Ns]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Neurological manifestations are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including life-threatening acute muscle weakness, due to neuromuscular disorders such as acute transverse myelitis (TM) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). These syndromes can rarely coexist and present as an overlap syndrome. Here, we report a patient who developed acute symmetrical proximal lower limb weakness 5days after diagnosis of COVID-19. GBS was diagnosed due to the presence of motor signs, albumin-cytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid examination and axonal damage according to nerve condition tests. However, abnormal areas on MRI of the thoracic spine and lack of improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin supported a diagnosis of TM. Therefore, a possible overlap between GBS and TM was established. To our knowledge, this is the third case report of GBS/TM overlap syndrome after COVID-19. The patient's full and rapid recovery with intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis supports our diagnosis.

### Notes from the field: six cases of acute flaccid myelitis in children-Minnesota, 2018 [^116aAC7r]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

During September 14–October 1, 2018, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified of six children hospitalized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region with symptoms consistent with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). A confirmed case of AFM is defined as acute onset of flaccid limb weakness with magnetic resonance image indicating spinal cord lesions largely restricted to gray matter and spanning one or more vertebral segments. All six cases were confirmed by CDC. After a cluster of three cases occurred in 2014, an average of fewer than one AFM case per year had been reported to MDH.

Among the six patients, the median patient age was 6.0 years (range = 1.3–9.2 years). All children resided in different Minnesota counties, and all experienced fever and upper respiratory signs and symptoms (e.g. rhinorrhea and cough) beginning a median of 8 days (range = 5–11 days) before weakness onset; none had a history of being immunocompromised. In addition, four patients experienced neck pain or headache, and two experienced diarrhea before weakness onset. Four patients had marked weakness of proximal muscle groups in one arm, although distal motor function was largely preserved. The other two patients initially had weakness in one leg, which became bilateral and rapidly ascended during hospitalization; both of these patients required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. In all six patients, limb weakness was first noted after waking in the morning. No epidemiologic links among patients were identified.

All six patients were hospitalized. Three patients were discharged home, and two were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. One patient remains hospitalized with complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm, at the time of this report. All discharged patients had residual weakness at time of discharge; among these patients, the median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (range = 1–14 days).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated spinal cord gray matter involvement in all six patients, largely in the anterior horns. The extent of gray matter involvement did not always correlate with deficits seen on physical exam; in three patients with only single limb weakness, multisegment gray matter involvement was apparent. Among all patients, three had anterior nerve root and facial nerve enhancement, and two had basilar and brainstem involvement. Three patients had normal MRI findings early in the illness course, but demonstrated extensive gray matter involvement on a subsequent MRI.

Abstract

Since 2014, biennial rises in acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) have brought attention to this rare but debilitating condition. Children with AFM typically present with acute onset, flaccid weakness accompanied by longitudinally extensive gray matter injury demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging. A clearer understanding of the epidemiology and suspected pathogenesis of AFM may result in increased recognition. The purpose of this review article is to guide emergency physicians in recognizing key clinical features, initiating diagnostic evaluation and providing appropriate interventions for children with suspected AFM.

Introduction: HSP is a vasculitis of small vessels involving multiple organs. Viral infections are known triggers of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. There have been multiple reports in literature about different presentations of COVID-19 in children. There is a spectrum of dermatological and vascular presentations which may range from mild skin rashes to severe arterial strokes.

Objectives: To describes a 3-year-old boy who presented with purpuric rashes following a completely asymptomatic COVID-19 infection,

Methods: case report

Results: 3-year-old Libyan boy child, previously healthy, presented to pediatric Rheumatology with a history of skin rashes on both lower &upper extremities of one month duration. His family medical history was positive for autoimmune disease and renal disease (one sibling has nephrotic syndrome). The rash started on his lower legs which spread to his upper limbs, his both ears and face over time. The rash was petechial and purpuric in nature. It was palpable and non-pruritic. There was history of abdominal pain, fever, joint pain. A significant medical history included fever, URTI infection around 4 weeks prior to the onset of rashes. On physical examination, growth parameters were normal. He was afebrile and his blood pressure was 80/45 mm Hg. His respiratory rate was 16/min. His skin examination revealed rashes involving the dorsal feet and lower extremities. There were scattered non-blanching round dark red palpable petechiae and macular skin rashes, Initial examination revealed a purpuric rash more prominent on the lower extremities than the upper extremities with mild tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Laboratory values revealed CRP was negative < 1 mg/L, (WBC) 10,2 x 103\mm 3 (neutrophils 38.4%, lymphocytes 52.3%), hemoglobin 13 g/dL, platelet count 340x103\mm 3, ESR 20mm\hr, blood urea 10 mg/dL, creatinine 0.29 mg/dL. Normal UPC > 0.2 mg/mg. Urine microscopy was nile. Serum complement levels demonstrated normal level of C3 (123 mg/dL, normal range 80–160 mg/dL) and low level of C4 (14.7mg/dL, normal range 16–48 mg/dL), His ANA screen was negative, ANCAp, c were negative. COVID-19 IgG was positive with high titter 79.52, COVID-19 IgM was negative. Chest X-ray, ECG and echo were normal, skin biopsy was not undertaken, but based on the features of his clinical presentation, Diagnosis of HSP was made it. The child was given a course of oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks followed by gradual tapering over the next 4 weeks. The patient's persistent lesions regardless of oral prednisone. Therefore, we suggest that our patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction and vasculitis secondary to COVID-19. His symptoms improved significantly with colchicine 0.5mg once per day treatment and the rash continued to fade and finally healed with hyperpigmentation within few days.

### Primary hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: case report and review of the literature [^114x5ns9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-yr-old man presented with a 1-wk history of fever, chills, weakness, headaches, and a significant 20-lb weight loss over the preceding 2 months. His past medical history was relevant for liver amebiasis during childhood. Two days before admission, the patient noticed jaundice. He denied abdominal pain or other GI symptoms, and there was no history of alcohol intake, medications, or illicit drugs. His physical examination revealed generalized jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral leg edema. Neurologically, the patient was agitated, with periods of disorientation, and he had bilateral flapping. His blood tests revealed pancytopenia, renal failure, liver failure, and coagulopathy. Because the patient had a fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia, a further workup also included a bone marrow and liver biopsy. No conclusive diagnosis could be made from the above tests, and the patient died 5 days after admission. Postmortem evaluation, including flow cytometry and gene rearrangement in the tissue obtained from the liver, revealed large B cell lymphoma. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current information regarding this entity is scant, mainly owing to its rarity. We present a review of the literature, including the incidence, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of primary hepatic lymphoma.

Number of confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States, August 1, 2014–June 30, 2020. Data as of July 31, 2020.

Identifying the cause of the recent change in AFM epidemiology and understanding how it leads to this specific neurologic disease are critical for developing effective interventions to prevent and treat AFM. The clinical manifestations and epidemiology of confirmed AFM cases strongly suggests an infectious etiology, probably viral. Most AFM cases are in patients with prodromal symptoms consistent with a viral illness before onset of limb weakness, and AFM patients in peak years are significantly more likely to have prodromal respiratory illness or fever than those in nonpeak years. In addition, the increase in AFM noted in 2014 coincided with an unusual increase in severe respiratory illness caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the United States; 11 (20%) of 56 AFM patients whose respiratory specimens were tested at CDC in 2014 were positive for EV-D68. However, because virus detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other sterile site specimens of AFM patients is rare and not consistent by type, definitively establishing a classic causal relationship between viral infection and AFM is challenging.

A novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes Coronavirus disease 2019 typically presented with fever, myalgia and cough, but central and peripheral nervous system manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis and Guillain-Barre-Syndrome are being increasingly reported. Acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barre-Syndrome) mostly occurs after viral or bacterial infections, presenting with ascending flaccid tetraparesis, dysautonomia and respiratory failure. We reported a patient with COVID-19 (confirmed with Lung HRCT scan and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR) who developed acute progressive flaccid tetraparesis and maculopapular pigmented plaques on the limbs, 2 weeks after respiratory symptoms. He was treated with IVIg as the Electrophysiologic study showed sensorimotor polyradiculoneuropathy with demyelinating features and skin biopsy showed interface dermatitis and vasculopathic reaction. The causal association between Guillen-Barre-Syndrome and COVID-19 is uncertain yet, but neurologists should be aware of early diagnosis and treatment of acute polyradiculoneuropathy which may cause fatal dysautonomia and respiratory failure in the context of COVID19 pandemic.

### A 28-year-old man with diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules [^115Nkx7F]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 28-year-old man with a history of congenital HIV sought treatment at the ED with a chief symptom of generalized malaise and confusion of 3 days' duration. He had mild dyspnea, but no respiratory distress, and he reported no fever, chest pain, or headache. We were unable to obtain past medical, family, or social history because of encephalopathy and we had no available contact person. Review of the patient's medical record revealed he made an initial clinic visit to the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease 5 years previously. At the time of that visit, CD4 count was 250 cells/mm 3 and no known complications of HIV were documented. He was prescribed Stribild (elvitegravir-cobicistat-emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and darunavir; however, pharmacy records revealed he did not fill the prescriptions. He underwent no further clinic follow-up examinations. He grew up in California and moved to upstate New York 5 years previously.

### Diagnosis of Guillain-Barrésyndrome and validation of brighton criteria [^115fRqzX]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy with a variable clinical presentation. Accurate diagnostic criteria are essential for patient care and research, including clinical trials and vaccine safety studies. Several diagnostic criteria for Guillain-Barré syndrome have been proposed, including the recent set by the Brighton Collaboration. In the present study we describe in detail the key diagnostic features required to meet these Brighton criteria in a study population of 494 adult patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, previously included in therapeutic and observational studies. The patients had a median age of 53 years (interquartile range 36–66 years) and males slightly predominated (56%). All patients developed bilateral limb weakness which generally involved both upper and lower extremities. The weakness remained restricted to the legs in 6% and to the arms in 1% of the patients. Decreased reflexes in paretic arms or legs were found initially in 91% of patients and in all patients during follow-up. Ten (2%) patients however showed persistence of normal reflexes in paretic arms. Disease nadir was reached within 2 weeks in 80%, within 4 weeks in 97% and within 6 weeks in all patients. A monophasic disease course occurred in 95% of patients, of whom 10% had a treatment-related fluctuation. A clinical deterioration after 8 weeks of onset of weakness occurred in 23 (5%) patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined in 474 (96%) patients. A mild pleocytosis (5 to 50 cells/μl) was found in 15%, and none had more than 50 cells/μl. An increased cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration was found only in 64% of patients, highly dependent on the timing of the lumbar puncture after onset of weakness (49% at the first day to 88% after 2 weeks). Nerve electrophysiology was compatible with the presence of a neuropathy in 99% of patients, but only 59% fulfilled the current criteria for a distinct subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Patients with a complete data set (335) were classified according to the Brighton criteria, ranging from a high to a low level of diagnostic certainty, as level 1 in 61%, level 2 in 33%, level 3 in none, and level 4 in 6% of patients. Patients categorized in these levels did not differ with respect to proportion of patients with preceding events, initial clinical manifestations or outcome. The observed variability in the key diagnostic features of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the current cohort study, can be used to improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria.

PRESENTING FEATURES: An 18-year-old white man was admitted to the Osler Medical Service with the chief complaint of back pain. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed diffuse and aching upper back pain. Over the next couple of days, he also developed severe anterior chest pain that was somewhat pleuritic in nature but diffuse and extending bilaterally into the shoulders. One week prior to admission, he developed intermittent fevers and night sweats. The patient denied any lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, sick contacts, shortness of breath, rash, or bleeding. He was seen by a physician and told that he had thrombocytopenia. There was no history of recent or remote unusual bleeding episodes. His medical history was unremarkable except for a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He was not taking any medications and had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Physical examination showed that he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. He was a well-appearing man who was lying still because of pain. HEENT examination was unremarkable. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudates. His lungs were clear. His neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. Examination of his back and chest revealed no focal tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and his skin was without petechiae or rashes. Examination of the patient's joints showed pain on passive and active movement of his shoulders bilaterally, but no frank arthritis. There was no rash, petechiae, or echymoses. Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. On admission, the laboratory examination was notable for a hematocrit level of 32.5%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 79 fL, and white blood cell count of 2.8 x 10(3)/microL. Platelet count was 75 x 10(3)/microL. A white blood cell differential revealed 7% bands, 53% polys, 34% lymphs, 5% atypical lymphocytes, 2% nucleated red cells, and a few young unidentified cells. His chemistry studies were unremarkable. What is the diagnosis?

### Vital signs: clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed acute flaccid myelitis, United States, 2018 [^111EjMn9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Regardless of etiology, patients generally sought medical attention soon after onset of limb weakness; 76% of those with onset as an outpatient sought medical care within 1 day of onset of weakness, and most were initially evaluated in an emergency department. Because AFM can progress rapidly and lead to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, patients with suspected AFM should be immediately hospitalized and monitored for respiratory deterioration. Hospitalization also facilitates evaluation, including consultation with specialists and MRI of the brain and spine. Most patients were hospitalized within 1 day of onset of weakness, but 10% were not hospitalized until ≥ 4 days after onset of limb weakness, perhaps indicating delays in recognition and an opportunity for improvement.

The findings in the report are subject to at least two limitations. First, this study was restricted to cases reported to CDC, which likely underestimate the actual number of AFM cases owing to underascertainment of AFM and underreporting of cases to health departments. Second, the analysis was limited to medical record abstraction data and, in many cases, to data from the early course of hospitalization. Although data on long-term outcomes were not available for this analysis, these data are now being collected and will be the subject of future reports.

Despite these limitations, the data in this report further elucidate the clinical characteristics of AFM and should aid recognition of signs and symptoms, subsequent evaluation, and referral to care. Early recognition of AFM is important for clinical management and for specimen collection and detection of the underlying etiology. AFM should be suspected in any child with acute flaccid limb weakness. Onset during the months of August–November of peak years, history of recent febrile respiratory illness, and presence of neck or back pain or any neurologic symptom should raise suspicion for AFM.

Based on recent trends, another peak AFM year is anticipated in 2020. It is not known whether or how the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended social distancing measures will affect enterovirus circulation or trends in AFM. COVID-19's impact on the health care system and health care–seeking behaviors will likely present additional challenges to the recognition and evaluation of patients with AFM. Non-COVID-19 emergency department visits declined in 2020, and the pandemic could possibly contribute to delays in care or to an increased proportion of clinical evaluations taking place via telephone or telemedicine. During this time, it will be critical for parents and clinicians to be aware of signs and symptoms suggestive of AFM and maintain vigilance for this condition during 2020.

### Vital signs: clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed acute flaccid myelitis, United States, 2018 [^1176tyz6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a serious neurologic syndrome that affects mostly children and is characterized by the acute onset of limb weakness or paralysis. Since U.S. surveillance for AFM began in 2014, reported cases have peaked biennially. This report describes the clinical characteristics of AFM patients during 2018, the most recent peak year.

Methods

Medical records from persons meeting AFM clinical criterion (acute onset of flaccid limb weakness) were submitted to CDC. Patients with confirmed AFM met the clinical criterion and had magnetic resonance imaging indicating spinal cord lesions largely restricted to gray matter and spanning one or more vertebral segments. Symptoms, physical findings, test and imaging results, and hospitalization data were abstracted and described.

Results

Among 238 patients with confirmed AFM during 2018, median age was 5.3 years. Among the 238 patients, 205 (86%) had onset during August-November. Most (92%) had prodromal fever, respiratory illness, or both beginning a median of 6 days before weakness onset. In addition to weakness, common symptoms at clinical evaluation were gait difficulty (52%), neck or back pain (47%), fever (35%), and limb pain (34%). Among 211 who were outpatients when weakness began, most (76%) sought medical care within 1 day, and 64% first sought treatment at an emergency department. Overall, 98% of patients were hospitalized, 54% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 23% required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Conclusion

Clinicians should suspect AFM in children with acute flaccid limb weakness, especially during August-November and when accompanied by neck or back pain and a recent history of febrile respiratory illness. Increasing awareness in frontline settings such as emergency departments should aid rapid recognition and hospitalization for AFM.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111UX7cz]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus diseases — clinical manifestations in adults with HIV: Varicella rash evolves rapidly during the initial 8 to 12 hours after onset, with new vesicle formation continuing for 2 to 4 days. Herpes zoster presents as a painful dermatomal eruption; the most common sites are thoracic dermatomes (40% to 50% of cases), followed by cranial nerve (20% to 25%), cervical (15% to 20%), lumbar (15%), and sacral (5%) dermatomes. In zoster, new vesicle formation typically continues for 3 to 5 days and crusts typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks. About 20% to 30% of people with HIV have one or more subsequent episodes of herpes zoster; the probability of a recurrence within 1 year is approximately 10%. Approximately 10% to 15% of people with HIV report post-herpetic neuralgia as a complication following herpes zoster.

### Varicella caused by airborne transmission of a localised herpes zoster infection in a family [^111whvi8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 15-year-old adolescent boy without a previous medical history. He lives with his parents and his 8-year-old brother. His mother developed varicella in her childhood, and the patient's brother had been vaccinated against VZV. However, the patient was never vaccinated against VZV, as confirmed in his vaccination record book, because the vaccine programme was voluntary when he was a child. A fever and sore throat started and continued for 4 days before the patient came to our hospital. His fever was over 38°C, and he experienced chills. Two days later, he visited a clinic with his father because his stomachache had not improved for the past 2 weeks. His father was diagnosed with a localised herpes zoster in his left abdomen. The patient also had rashes and blisters all over his body. Varicella was suspected, and acetaminophen and valaciclovir hydrochloride were prescribed. However, he developed a headache and nausea and was subsequently referred to our hospital for a more detailed examination. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 102/67 mm Hg, heart rate of 71/min, respiratory rate of 12/min, body temperature of 36.7°C, SpO 2 of 99% (on ambient air). Although the patient appeared to be sick, his Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15, and his cognition was clear. On physical examination, both pupils were 5 mm with a normal light reflex. No papilloedema was observed. There were no signs of a rash on his eye conjunctiva and in his mouth. His neck was easily movable and nuchal rigidity was negative. There were rashes and blisters around his forehead (figure 1), body (figure 2) and four limbs. Part of his rashes became crusty.

### Pyogenic spondylitis and paravertebral abscess caused by Salmonella saintpaul in an immunocompetent 13-year-old child: a case report [^111EDjD2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 13-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to our outpatient clinic due to back pain with fever. He had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when he occasionally had high fever. He started to complain of the lower back pain during 3 months before admission, but he thought it was caused by his daily training of track and field. 4 days before admission, high fever developed. His back pain became so severe 3 days ago that he was seen by his family doctor. His symptoms did not improve in spite of acetaminophen administration.

His past medical history was unremarkable, without any trauma, surgical history, or recurrent bacterial infections. He was a junior high school student, and a track and field athlete. He always trained by himself around the corner of zoo, and had no contact history with animal. The patient had raw poultry eggs which were directly purchased from a neighborhood farm just a few weeks before he started complaining of occasional high fever.

On admission, the patient was conscious complaining of severe lumbar pain which was exacerbated according to any movement, and it was hard for him to walk without support due to the severe pain. On physical examination his vital signs were normal except a body temperature of 38 °C. Neurological examination demonstrated no motor or sensory deficits, and other physical findings were nonspecific, and any gastrointestinal signs were not identified.

Laboratory exams showed a slight increase in white blood cell count (WBC 10,100 /μL; neutrophils 61%, lymphocytes 29%) and elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP 7.27 mg/dL). Initial blood cultures were negative. His immunoglobulin G, A, M level were within normal range. Interferon-γ based release assay (QuantiFERON-TB GOLD) was negative. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormal findings. The lumbar lateral radiologic findings showed inhomogeneous appearance of the inferior wall of the L4 and anterior wall of the L5 vertebral bodies (Fig. 1). Thoracic and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal high signal of the vertebral bodies of L4–5 in sequences of T2-weighted images and paravertebral low diffusion in sequences of T1-weighted images. The interior of the vertebral canal was intact (Fig. 2).

### Mild severe acute respiratory syndrome [^1113J9YM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Case 2 was in a 13-year-old boy whose mother had been confirmed to have SARS on February 4, 2003. Fever developed in the boy 20 days after his mother's onset of the disease. He did not come into contact with other confirmed SARS patients during this period. He had a mild headache and diarrhea with a fever from 37.2°C to 37.8°C for 3 days. No other symptoms and signs developed, and a chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. He completely recovered after 5 days. After 12 weeks, his serum was positive for IgG against SARS-CoV, detected with an ELISA.

In both case-patients, SARS had been initially excluded in spite of their close contacts with SARS patients because their symptoms could be explained as a common cold, and no specific diagnostic approaches were considered when they were sick since the causative agent of SARS was not identified until March 2003. However, their serum specimens were positive for IgG against SARS-CoV by ELISA. Those results strongly indicate that both patients had been infected with SARS-CoV, although their signs and symptoms did not meet the criteria for the SARS case definition. Mild SARS-CoV infection may not easily be defined clinically, and such patients may potentially spread the disease if they are not isolated.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) neuroprognostication — independent ambulation at 3 months or later: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the progression of motor weakness assessed during the acute presentation alone not be considered a reliable predictor of the inability to ambulate independently at 3 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Definitions of speed of progression varied in the limited evidence base, including rapid onset of weakness in ≤ 4 days and progression to bedbound state within 2 days, and establishing a specific time frame for the definition of "rapid progression of motor weakness" was not deemed feasible based on the available data.

A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Case 3

A 50-year–old man with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia and anxiety disorder presented with a worsening rash associated with pruritus for 4 days. The patient reported that he experienced changes in his voice, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, fatigue, a fever that improved with ibuprofen, and an episode of chest pain on the previous evening. He had been exposed to his son, who had tested positive for COVID-19 11 days previously, but multiple COVID-19 tests in the interim were negative. He had received the second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine 5 days before the onset of symptoms.

Physical examination was significant for erythematous targetoid plaques on the trunk and extremities, bullae on the palmoplantar skin, and hemorrhagic crusts on the oral mucosa (Fig 4). Llaboratory findings were significant for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, negative HSV and varicella zoster virus polymerase chain reaction, and negative M ycoplasma immunoglobulin M. Serologic antibody tests were consistent with previous Epstein-Barr virus and HSV infections.

Fig 4
Erythematous targetoid plaques on the trunk.

The patient received a diagnosis of EM secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine, given the recent exposure to the vaccine and no evidence of other etiologies. He was advised to start using a topical corticosteroid in addition to a prednisone taper that had been started 2 days earlier in the emergency department. His symptoms and rash subsequently resolved.

Case 4

A 53-year–old woman with a past medical history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and multinodular goiter presented with a 3-week history of a rash associated with pruritus on her hands, arms, and legs. She had no history of recent illness or new medications. She denied having a previous history of herpes infection. However, she had received the second dose of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine 2 days before the onset of symptoms.

Physical examination revealed erythematous targetoid plaques on the dorsum of the hands and extremities (Fig 5). There was no mucosal involvement. Laboratory findings were significant for previous HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. Histopathologic analysis revealed interface dermatitis.

Fig 5
Erythematous targetoid plaques on the dorsum of the bilateral hands.

Based on the clinical and histologic findings and the temporal association with the vaccine, the patient received a diagnosis of EM secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was advised to start using a topical corticosteroid, and her rash and symptoms improved.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^111KpKRt]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an important cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis. Molecular mimicry and a cross-reactive immune response play a crucial part in its pathogenesis, at least in those cases with a preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection and with antibodies to gangliosides. The type of preceding infection and patient-related host factors seem to determine the form and severity of the disease. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange are effective treatments in GBS; mainly for practical reasons, IVIg is the preferred treatment. Whether mildly affected patients or patients with Miller Fisher syndrome also benefit from IVIg is unclear. Despite medical treatment, GBS often remains a severe disease; 3–10% of patients die and 20% are still unable to walk after 6 months. In addition, many patients have pain and fatigue that can persist for months or years. Advances in prognostic modelling have resulted in the development of a new and simple prognostic outcome scale that might also help to guide new treatment options, particularly in patients with GBS who have a poor prognosis.

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in ten steps [^114RCZJW]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, but potentially fatal, immune-mediated disease of the peripheral nerves and nerve roots that is usually triggered by infections. The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. Diagnosis and management of GBS can be complicated as its clinical presentation and disease course are heterogeneous, and no international clinical guidelines are currently available. To support clinicians, especially in the context of an outbreak, we have developed a globally applicable guideline for the diagnosis and management of GBS. The guideline is based on current literature and expert consensus, and has a ten-step structure to facilitate its use in clinical practice. We first provide an introduction to the diagnostic criteria, clinical variants and differential diagnoses of GBS. The ten steps then cover early recognition and diagnosis of GBS, admission to the intensive care unit, treatment indication and selection, monitoring and treatment of disease progression, prediction of clinical course and outcome, and management of complications and sequelae.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old man was referred for evaluation of recurrent respiratory infections requiring antibiotics and chronic cough over 3 years. Two months prior to presentation, he started to develop blood-tinged sputum but not frank hemoptysis. He otherwise denied any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. He had dyspnea during the respiratory infections but not otherwise. His medical history was significant for chronic rhinitis without sinusitis and a low serum IgM level. He was a never smoker and a farmer but otherwise had no significant or specific exposures or travel history. His family history was significant for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in his mother.

### Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a child with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis and familial mediterranean fever [^116gye4H]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 14 year old boy was referred to hospital with 2 days history of back and calf pain. He had developed sudden onset of palpable purpuric rash on his extensor surfaces of lower extremities especially bilateral ankles on admission. There was no history of recent drug exposure, immunization, or upper respiratory tract infection. He denied recurrent attacks of abdominal pain and fever. Family history for FMF was negative. Physical examination showed a temperature of 38.3°C, respiratory rate of 48/min, pulse rate 128/min. He was hypertensive at 140/100 mmHg. In auscultation, lungs were clear and the heart sounds were normal. Abdominal palpation was normal. There were symmetric palpable purpuric rash on his lower extremities.

Laboratory tests showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 45 mm/h (normal: < 20 mm/h), C-reactive protein of 3.74 mg/dl (normal: < 0.3 mg/dl), hemoglobin 10.7 g/dl, hematocrit 32.3%, white blood cell count (WBC) 11900/mm3 with normal differential count, platelet count 340000/mm3, serum urea 66 mg/dl, serum creatinine 1.8 mg/dl, albumine 3.5 g/dl, total cholesterol 106 mg/dl, triglycerides 57 mg/dl, calcium 8.7 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L, alanine aminotransferase 23 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 16 U/l. Serum complement-3 (C3) and complement-4 (C4) were decreased (85.4 mg/dl, 6.6 mg/dl, respectively). Serum immunglobulin (Ig) levels were normal. The anti-streptolysin – O titer was 100 Todd unit and throat culture was negative for group A B -hemolytic streptococcus. Antinuclear antibody, anti ds DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anticardiolipine antibodies were negative. Urinalysis revealed macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria with a 24-h urinary protein excretion of 55 mg/m2/h. The fecal occult blood testing was positive. Renal ultrasonography (US) showed increased echogenicity (grade 2) in bilateral kidneys. A skin biopsy showed a leucytoclastic vasculitis and deposition of IgA. Renal doppler US was normal. Renal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to rule out PAN revealed normal results. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as having HSV with renal, skin and probable gastrointestinal tract involvement. A diagnosis of FMF was suspected because of the absence of occult blood in the stool and normal mesenteric MRA. Since there are reports of increase frequency of MEFV mutation in patients with HSV, we performed DNA analysis in our patient and found that he was compound heterozygote, carrying M694V/E148Q.

### Constipation in transverse myelitis [^114XqWVX]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Given the sudden onset, cerebrovascular accident was first ruled out by MRI of the brain and CT angiography of the head and neck. Further working diagnoses included Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and bacterial meningitis, which were ruled out clinically due to bowel and bladder involvement as well as by CSF studies. Then, the patient underwent MRI of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine to evaluate for post-viral autoimmune or inflammatory process and compressive myelopathy, which showed multilevel T2 hyperintense lesions in the thoracic spine with no evidence of compression.

Thus, the presence of motor, sensory as well as autonomic dysfunction, bilateral involvement, reaching a nadir in 4 days with clearly delineated sensory level at T4, CSF pleocytosis and the MRI finding without evidence of compression lead us to the diagnosis of transverse myelitis.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) neurologic disease in HIV — clinical syndromes and diagnostic features include dementia, ventriculoencephalitis, and polyradiculomyelopathies with dementia presenting as lethargy, confusion, and fever; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically demonstrates lymphocytic pleocytosis with low-to-normal glucose and normal-to-elevated protein levels. Ventriculoencephalitis has a more acute course with focal neurologic signs, often including cranial nerve palsies or nystagmus, and rapid progression to death, and periventricular enhancement on computed tomography or magnetic resonance images is highly suggestive of CMV ventriculoencephalitis rather than HIV-related neurologic disease. CMV polyradiculomyelopathy causes a Guillain-Barre–like syndrome with urinary retention and progressive bilateral leg weakness, symptoms usually progress over several weeks to loss of bowel and bladder control and flaccid paraplegia, and CSF in CMV polyradiculopathy usually demonstrates neutrophilic pleocytosis (usually 100–200 neutrophils/μL and some erythrocytes) accompanied by hypoglycorrhachia and elevated protein levels.

### A 49-year-old man presents with fever of unknown origin and cough [^1159wGem]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 49-year-old man presented with 3 months of persistent fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. He had no response to treatment with antibiotics. He had been treated with an empiric 2-week course of steroids approximately 2 months before presentation, with mild and transient improvement. He did not use tobacco and had not experienced any weight loss, hemoptysis, arthralgia, or myalgia, and was otherwise in good health. He denied contact with anyone with pulmonary TB or other respiratory illnesses.

### Haemorrhagic conversion of infectious myelitis in an immunocompromised patient [^115SNzzz]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man recently diagnosed with HIV (CD4 19 cells/mm 3, viral load 3.6million copies/mL, not on highly active antiretroviral therapy on initial diagnosis at outside hospital), disseminated histoplasmosis, shingles and syphilis presented with paraplegia developing over 3 days. Spine MRI demonstrated a longitudinally extensive cord lesion extending from C3 to the tip of the conus. Brain MRI was consistent with meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were notable for positive varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCRs as well as a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory titre of 1:2. Patient was started on treatment for VZV and CMV meningoencephalitis, neurosyphilis and high-dose steroids for infectious myelitis. Repeat spine MRI demonstrated subacute intramedullary haemorrhage of the cervical cord. He was ultimately discharged to a skilled nursing facility for long-term intravenous antiviral therapy and rehabilitation. After 59 days in the hospital, his neurological exam remained grossly unchanged, with flaccid paraplegia and lack of sensation to fine touch in his lower extremities.

### Progress in Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115ySNjE]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

This editorial review summarizes and critically analyses reports published in the preceding 18 months on the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome, with particular emphasis on the role of ganglioside antibodies, antecedent infections, and the concept of molecular mimicry. It concludes with an appraisal of currently available and proposed therapies.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome [^115oqJ8F]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy. Patients typically develop rapidly progressive weakness and sensory deficits that can result in complete paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. GBS is usually a monophasic disease in which an aberrant immune response to an infection or other trigger damages the peripheral nerves. For example, in patients with preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection, molecular mimicry causes a cross-reactive antibody response to nerve gangliosides. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve conduction studies. Effective treatments include plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins. However, ~20% of patients who received treatment are unable to walk after 6 months and ~5% die as a consequence of GBS. Important knowledge gaps in GBS include its pathogenesis, especially after viral infections. In addition, there is a lack of specific biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, monitor the disease activity, and predict the clinical course and outcome of GBS. Major challenges for the future include finding more effective and personalized treatments, which are affordable in low-income and middle-income countries, and preparation for outbreaks of infections as potential triggers for GBS.

### A rare case of recurrent Guillain-Barrésyndrome without albuminocytological dissociation [^113c6kx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy, often preceded by an illness. It is a self-limiting illness in most of the cases, but recurrence is rare and can be seen in about 1%-6% of patients. GBS is characterised by progressive, symmetrical, proximal and distal weakness. Areflexia and sensory disturbances are also common. Patients with GBS usually have albuminocytological dissociation on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. This is a case of a 69-year-old woman with recurrent GBS and normal CSF findings.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^114kjf3x]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) neuroprognostication — independent ambulation at 3 months or later: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the patient's age at presentation alone not be considered a reliable predictor of the inability to ambulate independently at 3 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Acute flaccid myelitis and Guillain-Barrésyndrome in children: a comparative study with evaluation of diagnostic criteria [^114R7iKT]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A child with acute onset flaccid weakness may pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, with both AFM and GBS included in the differential diagnosis. We provide distinguishing features and recommendations, which may help clinicians in making the right diagnosis.

Diagnostic criteria for AFM and GBS usually perform well in children. However, in cases of atypical GBS, the diagnosis of AFM needs to be excluded early in the disease course, as AFM may fulfill the current clinical, CSF, and NCS diagnostic criteria for GBS.

### Diffuse erythema with… [^117WjRbe]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In some patients, the typical prodrome of cough, headache, sore throat, nausea and vomiting may be of short duration. Patients with acute meningococcemia appear ill and usually present with a characteristic petechial rash, a high, spiking fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and mild hypotension. In the early stages of disease, the rash may be maculopapular. 14 Signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation may be helpful, given that up to 88 percent 1 of patients with meningococcemia develop meningitis. 1, 13–15. Chronic meningococcemia is a rare condition. Patients may present with intermittent rash, fever, arthritis and arthralgias occurring over a period of weeks to several months. In some patients, the chronic form advances to acute meningococcemia. 1 The rash may be polymorphous, with maculopapular lesions usually located around a painful joint or pressure point, nodules on the lower extremities and petechiae of variable size. 1, 4, 7, 13–15.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER The prodrome may include malaise, chills, a feverish feeling, anorexia and irritability. The onset of symptoms may be abrupt, with the predominant features being fever, severe headache, generalized myalgia, shaking rigor, photophobia, prostration and nausea. The diagnosis can be difficult when the onset is gradual and no rash is present, as is the case in up to 20 percent of adults and 5 percent of children with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The rash appears within three days of the onset of fever and can vary in character. Frequently, the rash is scarlatiniform on the trunk and erythematous on the palms and soles, with subsequent distal desquamation. Mucous membrane involvement is common and includes hyperemic bulbar conjunctiva, injected oropharynx, dry, cracked lips and a strawberry tongue. The rash begins as an erythematous maculopapular eruption that rapidly evolves to a vesicular rash.

21 In about 5 percent of patients, the rash may be accompanied by headache, malaise and fever. 1 Drying of the lesions with crust formation generally occurs in seven to 10 days, and the lesions usually resolve in 14 to 21 days. 20.

### Diagnoses for consideration in a returning traveler with fever… [^111nfzBu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Early infection: headache, fevers, malaise, arthralgias, lymphadenitis; trypanosomal chancre;
- Late infection: progressive meningoencephalitis and other CNS involvement
- Diagnosis: trypanosome visualization on serum, CSF, chancre or lymph node aspirate.
- Management:

- All patients with concern for trypanosomiasis should undergo CSF evaluation to rule out CNS involvement which can be subclinical
- Infectious diseases clinical consult recommended to guide choice of antitrypanosomal therapy, which differs by species of trypanosome. Drugs include suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine, and others under investigation.
- See Travelers' Health Trypanosomiasis, African Plague Back to Table
- Three forms:

- Bubonic: rapid onset of fever, painful, tender lymphadenopathy
- Pneumonic: fever, hemoptysis
- Septicemic: fever, prostration, disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Diagnosis: culture from blood, sputum, CSF or lymph nodes is preferred
- Management: Droplet precautions if pneumonic; streptomycin or gentamicin preferred.
