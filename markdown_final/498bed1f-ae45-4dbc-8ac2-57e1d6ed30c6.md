## Question

increasing amylase and A1c despite excellent diet and no signs of pancreatitis. Should I be concerned about pancreatic cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rising amylase and A1c without pancreatitis symptoms should raise concern for pancreatic cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of isolated amylase elevation. Then, I should verify what rising A1c means in the context of pancreatic cancer risk. Next, I will integrate these two findings to estimate risk and decide whether to pursue imaging. After that, I need to check guideline-based screening indications and thresholds. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise workup and monitoring plan, including when to stop and when to escalate, with attention to pitfalls and special contexts like GLP-1 therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of an isolated amylase rise. Amylase can be elevated from salivary sources, macroamylasemia, renal dysfunction, or nonpancreatic abdominal pathology, and it lacks specificity for pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer; lipase is preferred diagnostically and remains elevated longer, so I should not overcall amylase by itself, especially without symptoms or imaging support [^114uD1hq] [^111wfzKF]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold for pancreatitis: diagnosis requires at least two of three — typical pain, enzymes greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic imaging — so a mild amylase bump without pain or imaging does not equal pancreatitis, and it certainly does not equal cancer by itself [^111wfzKF]. I should also remember that in immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, asymptomatic lipase or amylase elevations are common and do not mandate stopping therapy without clinical correlation, reinforcing that enzyme elevation alone is insufficient for a pancreatitis or cancer diagnosis [^113nFfV5] [^115n8N4g].

> Next, I should review what rising A1c implies for pancreatic cancer risk. New-onset diabetes after age 50 carries a modest but real near-term risk of underlying pancreatic cancer, with estimates around 0.25–1% over three years, and the signal is stronger when hyperglycemia is defined by glycemic thresholds rather than clinician diagnosis codes, though risk varies by race/ethnicity and the number needed to screen is high in general populations [^113emM85] [^114NDBdi] [^1166MAs8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: most people with new hyperglycemia have typical type 2 diabetes, so the absolute risk remains low; nonetheless, in the right context — especially rapid A1c rise with weight loss — pancreatic cancer should be considered and, in some programs, triggers enhanced evaluation or imaging in high-risk individuals [^113emM85] [^116tK1is].

> I will now examine the combination of rising A1c and amylase. At first glance, I thought both together might create a "two-hit" risk signal for pancreatic cancer, but wait, I should verify whether that's supported by evidence. I do not see data that isolated amylase elevation adds independent predictive value for PDAC, whereas rising A1c does carry a population-level signal for new-onset diabetes associated with PDAC, particularly in older adults and in some racial/ethnic subgroups, so the A1c change is the meaningful clue here, not the amylase bump [^113emM85] [^114NDBdi]. I should confirm that this does not mean ignore the amylase; rather, I should treat amylase as nonspecific and prioritize the A1c trajectory and clinical features when deciding on imaging or further workup [^114uD1hq].

> Now, I need to check guideline indications for pancreatic cancer screening and whether this scenario fits. The USPSTF gives a D recommendation against screening average-risk adults, so population screening by A1c alone is not advised; screening is reserved for high-risk groups such as those with strong family history, hereditary syndromes, or pancreatic cysts, and even there, benefits and harms must be weighed carefully [^116bYnua] [^111ij6Zd]. Let me consider: if this patient is older than 50 with new-onset hyperglycemia and additional red flags (unintentional weight loss, lack of other diabetes risk factors, rapid A1c rise), some programs and expert groups support considering targeted evaluation, but this remains outside universal screening recommendations and should be individualized and, ideally, embedded in research or experienced-center pathways [^1163i8h7] [^116X7ZLo] [^111XzbUn].

> Next, I should review what imaging to order if I decide to investigate. Pancreas-protocol contrast-enhanced CT is the first-line modality when pancreatic cancer is suspected, offering high sensitivity for masses and vascular involvement; MRI/MRCP and EUS are complementary, with EUS particularly helpful for small lesions, cyst characterization, and tissue sampling if needed [^112NYjCw] [^1111mUqw]. Hold on, I should verify the threshold for action: given the low absolute risk in general new-onset diabetes, imaging is not automatic; it is reasonable when clinical features heighten suspicion or when enzyme elevations persist without alternative explanation, recognizing that many asymptomatic patients with mild enzyme bumps will not warrant immediate imaging if the A1c rise is explainable by common type 2 diabetes risk factors [^113emM85] [^116bYnua].

> I should double-check for alternative explanations for the amylase before labeling this as pancreatic. Let me think about salivary sources, renal clearance, and macroamylasemia; repeating a lipase, reviewing renal function, and assessing for nonpancreatic abdominal processes are sensible, and if lipase is normal, the likelihood of true pancreatic inflammation or cancer is lower, though not zero [^114uD1hq]. But wait, what if the patient is on a GLP-1 receptor agonist? Trials show occasional mild enzyme elevations without pancreatitis, and while mechanistic concerns exist, robust causal links to pancreatitis or cancer have not been established in RCTs; thus, enzyme changes on GLP-1 therapy still require clinical correlation rather than reflex imaging or cessation of therapy [^1168EVu4] [^111LJyi9]. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause asymptomatic lipase/amylase rises; in the absence of symptoms or imaging findings, management is observation with close follow-up rather than steroids or stopping therapy by default [^113nFfV5] [^115n8N4g].

> Let me outline a pragmatic, stepwise plan. First, repeat a fasting lipase and A1c, check renal function, review symptoms, weight trajectory, and risk factors, and reassess whether the A1c rise fits a typical type 2 diabetes pattern. If lipase is normal and there are no red flags, continued clinical monitoring is reasonable rather than immediate imaging [^111wfzKF] [^113emM85]. Second, if lipase is more than three times the upper limit of normal or symptoms develop, obtain abdominal imaging and proceed along pancreatitis or malignancy pathways as indicated; if the A1c rise is rapid, unexplained, or accompanied by weight loss or lack of typical diabetes phenotype, consider pancreas-protocol CT or referral to a center experienced in pancreatic evaluation [^111wfzKF] [^112NYjCw]. Third, if the patient belongs to a high-risk group for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer, discuss surveillance with MRI/MRCP and/or EUS at an experienced center, recognizing potential benefits and harms, including the risks of surgery and false positives [^116X7ZLo] [^113hAAnc].

> Finally, I should confirm what not to do. Do not order routine CA 19–9 as a screening test in this context; it is not sensitive or specific enough for early detection and is mainly useful as a baseline tumor marker after a diagnosis is established or for treatment monitoring, not for screening asymptomatic patients with isolated lab changes [^1112bkcA] [^116bYnua]. Hold on, I should verify one more point: if symptoms emerge — painless jaundice, persistent epigastric pain radiating to the back, new steatorrhea, or significant weight loss — then imaging becomes appropriate regardless of enzyme levels, as these are concerning features for pancreatic pathology that warrant prompt evaluation [^112NYjCw] [^111wfzKF].

> In summary, isolated amylase elevation is nonspecific and not a cancer signal. Rising A1c after age 50 warrants attention because new-onset diabetes can rarely herald pancreatic cancer, but the absolute risk is low and screening is not recommended for average-risk adults. The prudent course is to contextualize the A1c trajectory, repeat and complement enzymes, look for red flags, and consider pancreas-protocol imaging selectively when clinical suspicion is nontrivial or the patient is in a higher-risk category, ideally within experienced-center pathways [^113emM85] [^116bYnua] [^112NYjCw].

Not necessarily. Isolated **amylase elevation** without pancreatitis symptoms is nonspecific and may reflect salivary, intestinal, or renal sources, or be due to medications or macroamylasemia. New-onset or worsening **hyperglycemia** (rising A1c) modestly increases pancreatic cancer risk, especially in older adults, but the absolute risk remains low (about 1% over 3 years) [^114NDBdi]. Routine screening is not recommended for average-risk patients [^116bYnua]; consider evaluation only if there are red flags such as age ≥ 50, unintentional weight loss, jaundice, or a strong family history. If concerned, use pancreas-protocol CT [^112NYjCw] or MRI/MRCP and CA 19–9 [^1112bkcA], but interpret results cautiously [^116bYnua].

## Clinical significance of elevated amylase without pancreatitis

Elevated amylase without pancreatitis is common and often reflects **non-pancreatic sources** or benign conditions:

- **Salivary glands**: Parotitis, mumps, or salivary obstruction.
- **Intestinal sources**: Ischemia, obstruction, or perforation.
- **Renal insufficiency**: Reduced clearance of amylase.
- **Macroamylasemia**: Amylase bound to immunoglobulins, causing persistent elevation.
- **Medications**: GLP-1 receptor agonists and other drugs can raise amylase without pancreatitis [^111LJyi9].

In these settings, **isolated amylase elevation is not specific** for pancreatic cancer.

---

## Relationship between elevated A1c and pancreatic cancer

Diabetes and **hyperglycemia** are linked to pancreatic cancer, but the relationship is complex:

- **Bidirectional association**: Diabetes increases pancreatic cancer risk, and pancreatic cancer can cause diabetes (paraneoplastic diabetes).
- **New-onset diabetes**: Particularly after age 50, is a recognized risk factor, with about 1% developing pancreatic cancer within 3 years [^114NDBdi].
- **A1c as a marker**: Rising A1c may reflect paraneoplastic diabetes, but it is not specific for pancreatic cancer.

Thus, **A1c elevation alone is insufficient** to diagnose pancreatic cancer.

---

## Risk stratification and clinical guidelines

Current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk patients, even with elevated A1c or amylase. Screening is reserved for **high-risk individuals** — those with a strong family history, genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA2, PALB2), or hereditary pancreatitis [^114nJzPN] [^1151SV4H].

For average-risk patients, **clinical judgment should consider**:

- **Age**: ≥ 50 years.
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional.
- **Jaundice**: New-onset.
- **Family history**: Strong.

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

If clinical suspicion for pancreatic cancer is present, the following steps are recommended:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Indication** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pancreas-protocol CT | First-line imaging for suspected pancreatic cancer | Radiation exposure; contrast risks |
| MRI/MRCP | Alternative to CT; useful for cystic lesions | Cost; availability |
| Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | High sensitivity for small lesions; allows biopsy | Invasive; operator-dependent |
| CA 19–9 | Tumor marker; adjunct to imaging | - Nonspecific <br/> - False positives/negatives |

---

Routine **CA 19–9 testing** is not recommended in asymptomatic patients; it may be used as an adjunct when imaging reveals a lesion [^1163i8h7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Isolated **amylase elevation** without pancreatitis is nonspecific and does not indicate pancreatic cancer. Rising A1c modestly increases risk, but the absolute risk remains low. Routine screening is not recommended for average-risk patients; reserve evaluation for those with additional risk factors or symptoms. If suspicion arises, use pancreas-protocol CT or MRI/MRCP and consider CA 19–9, interpreting results within the clinical context.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of elevated glycated hemoglobin levels with the risk of pancreatic cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study with 851 402 participants, risk of pancreatic cancer varied in association with prior diabetes status as well as glycated hemoglobin level; however, this risk was not consistently observed across racial/ethnic groups. The number of patients who need to undergo further investigation to identify a single pancreatic cancer ranged from 206 to 600.

Meaning

In this study, the risk of pancreatic cancer associated with a newly identified elevation in blood glucose varied by race/ethnicity and did not reach a level sufficient to justify potential widespread screening.

3. Assembling a Prospective High-Risk Cohort for Sporadic PDAC

It is well recognized that it is not cost-effective to screen for PDAC in the general population; thus, screening will initially have to be confined to HRGs with significantly higher-than-average risk of PDAC. An HRG for PDAC could be defined as a cohort in which subjects are at 6 to 8 times higher risk of having PDAC compared with age-matched controls. This is similar to the risk of PDAC in subjects with 2 first-degree relatives with PDAC, which is currently the cohort that is screened for familial PDAC. Currently, new-onset diabetes in subjects older than 50 years (NoD cohort) is the only established HRG for sporadic PDAC. Although there are a number of lifestyle factors (eg, smoking), demographic features (eg, age > 50 years), and comorbidities (eg, obesity, long-standing diabetes) that modestly (1.5-fold to 2-fold) increase the risk of developing PDAC, only NoD reaches the risk threshold for the HRG noted above. In contrast to long-standing DM, which is a modest risk factor for PDAC, NoD is actually a biomarker for an occult asymptomatic cancer that has not yet manifested clinically.

Compared with the age-matched general population, subjects older than 50 years who newly develop diabetes have 6-fold to 8-fold higher probability of being diagnosed with PDAC within 3 years of meeting criteria for diabetes. This group is estimated to be approximately 1 million people per yearand accounts for approximately 25% of those diagnosed with PDAC. Assembling a cohort of 10,000 subjects with NoD will identify approximately 100 subjects with PDAC. This is an important and urgent initiative that requires immediate implementation. A consortium of approximately 10 to 15 centers, including large Health Maintenance Organization and community networks is required to assemble a HR cohort in which samples from presymptomatic early-stage PDAC can be collected. The current NCI-National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases consortium to study chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer is an ideal opportunity to assemble such a cohort and collect prospective samples from a cohort at high risk for sporadic PDAC.

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^1175uypT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrated an association between elevated HbA1c, age and the presence of pancreatic cysts on initial surveillance imaging in HRIs.

The presence of IPMNs and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) indicates a risk of ductal cancer not only in the lesion itself but within the entire pancreas. A majority of patients with cysts in our study had sub-centimeter branch duct IPMNs, which is consistent with prior reports in HRIs. Pancreatic cancer surveillance programs have shown that up to 34% of HRIs ages 50–59 have pancreatic lesions, and this proportion increased to 54% in those ages 60–69. The majority of these lesions are small (< 1 cm) branch duct IPMNs or PanINs, and are more commonly detected in HRIs than in the general population. Our study supports these data, demonstrating that pancreatic cysts are more commonly identified in older HRIs.

Prior studies have reported an association between older age and increased HbA1c levels in nondiabetic populations (HbA1c < 5.7%). While our analyses do not argue against an association between increasing HbA1c and age, we focused on individuals at increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We have additionally sought to focus on whether impaired glucose metabolism, evidenced here by HbA1c levels above the prediabetic cutoff, are associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a unique cohort of individuals at high-risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

In HRIs, neoplastic progression has been described to occur more commonly in germline mutation carriers and individuals with multifocal cysts. In our study, 22 (29.7%) patients had multifocal cysts and 24 (32.4%) carried P/LP germline variants associated with pancreatic cancer. Mean surveillance in this study was 2.6 years. Therefore, our analyses focused on initial surveillance imaging studies; with a longer surveillance period, we will be able to determine if these factors and HbA1c levels predict neoplastic progression.

### Association of glycated hemoglobin levels with risk of pancreatic cancer [^117LTNS8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The observed rates of pancreatic cancer among patients with hyperglycemia were lower than prior estimates based on patients with new-onset diabetes. Population-based estimates of pancreatic cancer incidence among individuals with new-onset diabetes have focused on the first 3 years after diagnosis. These estimates have varied from 0.4% to 1.0%. An explanation for the discrepancy has been that studies incorporating diabetes diagnosed based on glycemic parameters tended to report increased rates of pancreatic cancer compared with reliance on diagnosis codes, potentially because of a delay in clinical diagnosis despite abnormal glucose or HbA 1c values. Although we used glycemic criteria in the present study, estimates for 3-year risk of pancreatic cancer were closer to 0.4% among patients with confirmed incident diabetes using a threshold of 6.5% for HbA 1c level. There are several potential explanations for the lower estimate observed in the present study. First, we focused exclusively on HbA 1c levels as the glycemic parameter of interest, rather than on fasting glucose, which was the predominant measure used in previous studies reporting higher rates of pancreatic cancer. We focused on HbA 1c level as a measure of hyperglycemia because of the increased use of this parameter in the KPSC health system following the 2010 guideline from the American Diabetes Association, which included elevation in HbA 1c level as part of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Second, the current study population was substantially more racially/ethnically diverse compared with those in prior studies.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of selective pancreatic cancer surveillance with survival?

Findings

In this cohort study comparing 26 individuals with a genetic or familial predisposition undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance and 1504 matched control patients, surveillance led to a significantly higher proportion of stage I cancers (31% vs 10%), longer 5-year survival rate (50% vs 9%), and lower pancreatic cancer–specific mortality rate (43% vs 86%).

Meaning

These findings suggest that selective surveillance of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer may improve clinical outcomes.

### Screening for pancreatic neoplasia in high-risk individuals: who, what, when, how? [^116acp6m]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease. Most symptomatic, clinically detected PCs are advanced and not curable. Indeed, the estimated 5-year survival rate is 4%, which is attributable to late diagnosis and low resection rate. Screening of high-risk individuals and early detection of small PCs and precursor lesions might improve the outcome if curative therapy could be offered in the presymptomatic stage. This article summarizes the available published data and preliminary results and discusses the different approaches to screening for pancreatic neoplasia at 2 university-based programs in the United States.

Methods

Cohort recruitment

From May 2013 to March 2019 subjects were enrolled in a high-risk registry at a tertiary academic medical center with a comprehensive multidisciplinary pancreas program. The registry and this study are institutional review board approved, and all subjects provided informed written consent. HRIs were included if they met International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) criteria or American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guidelines for hereditary gastrointestinal cancer (Table 1). HRIs were referred to the registry via physicians, genetic counselors, and/or self-referral. After providing informed consent, all patients completed a survey that included questions relating to personal medical history, family history, known genetic mutations, social history and environmental exposures such as tobacco and alcohol use history.

Candidates for Pancreatic Cancer Surveillance

FDR first-degree relative, FPC Familial Pancreatic Cancer, defined as kindreds with 2 affected FDRs, SDR second-degree relative

Surveillance protocol

HRIs were offered initial surveillance via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at least annually, in accordance with existing guidelines. Patients who met criteria for pancreatic cancer surveillance (Table 1), had abdominal imaging with either EUS or MRCP, and HbA1c levels in medical record within one year of office visit were included in this analysis. If patients had multiple HbA1c levels within one year of an office visit, we used the value collected closest to the office visit date.

MRCP was conducted using a GE Signa HDxt 1.5T machine. EUS was conducted and interpreted by one experienced therapeutic endoscopist using an Olympus GF-UCT180 Curvilinear Array Ultrasound Echoendoscope. Five patients had their imaging conducted at an outside institution; however, all relevant medical records were available for review. Imaging data were extracted directly from the electronic medical record. Only findings from initial surveillance imaging were included in our analysis (Fig. 1).

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^116pJLMD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with approximately 56,770 people projected to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 45,750 deaths expected in 2019, and is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer death after 2020. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains low at approximately 9%. An international consortium of experts recommended pancreatic surveillance for high-risk individuals (HRIs) with an estimated lifetime risk of > 5%. Recent studies have found a benefit to high-risk pancreatic surveillance programs, with 3-year survival rates of 85% and a higher proportion of resectable malignant lesions.

Approximately one-third of HRIs have small, sub-centimeter pancreatic cysts on surveillance imaging. The majority of these lesions remain stable during surveillance; however, features such as the presence of multifocal cysts, cyst growth, and the presence of a deleterious germline mutation have been associated with neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.

New-onset diabetes mellitus has been established as a prelude to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Approximately 85% of patients at pancreatic cancer diagnosis have impaired fasting blood glucose or diabetes mellitus, suggesting this may be a near universal marker for progression to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and can aid in its diagnosis during the disease's earlier stages. Furthermore, elevations in fasting blood glucose may be seen up to 36 months prior to pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis.

The aim of our study is to identify whether there is an association between elevated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program.

Identification of Study Cohorts

We first identified patients aged 50 to 84 years who had at least 1 measure of HbA 1c between 2010 and 2014 in a KPSC medical facility (referred to as the base cohort). This age range was selected to identify a study cohort that would be representative of a potentially suitable population to undergo screening for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Blood samples collected in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings were included. Point-of-care testing for HbA 1c levels was rarely performed during the study period and not included in the analysis. For each patient, the first laboratory test that met the entry criteria was referred to as the index HbA 1c test, and the date of the test was referred to as the index date. For the purpose of comparison, the following 12 contemporaneous cohorts were created. Patients with an HbA 1c level at or above prespecified thresholds (ie, 6.1%, 6.3%, 6.5% and 6.7% of total hemoglobin [to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01]) during the study period, irrespective of previous values or diabetes status, were included in 4 separate elevated HbA 1c (EGH) cohorts, referred to as EGH 6.1%, EGH 6.3%, EGH 6.5%, and EGH 6.7%. These thresholds for HbA 1c level were selected a priori to provide a range of values across the spectrum of patients likely to be experiencing prediabetes or recent-onset diabetes. We created 4 diabetes-excluded cohorts (DECs), which included patients from each EGH cohort with no history of diabetes (extending back to 2000, when data were first available) before the index date based on a previously validated algorithm for identification of patients with diabetes. This algorithm defined diabetes based on diagnosis codes, use of diabetes medication, or elevated glycemic laboratory values. We used the following logic to identify and exclude patients with history of diabetes: any hospital discharge code for diabetes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD - 9] code 250.XX), any KPSC internal code for diabetes (ie, 200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1839, 3141, 3186, 3639, 4124, or 5782), any prior HbA 1c level greater than 7.0%, or any dispensing record for insulin or an oral hypoglycemic medication (not including metformin). These cohorts were designated DEC 6.1%, DEC 6.3%, DEC 6.5%, and DEC 6.7%. Finally, we created confirmed index hyperglycemia cohorts (IHCs). To evaluate a potential increase in positive predictive value by adopting more stringent criteria defining patients with new-onset hyperglycemia, we established an additional series of patient cohorts including only patients with a confirmed finding of newly elevated HbA 1c. Confirmation of newly elevated HbA 1c level was performed by requiring a test below the respective threshold in the 18 months before the index date. The criteria defining IHCs were selected to reflect those of an ongoing prospective cohort study. These cohorts were designated IHC 6.1%, IHC 6.3%, IHC 6.5%, and IHC 6.7%. For all study cohorts, patients with history of pancreatic cancer before the index date either based on diagnosis code (ICD-9 code 157.x or ICD - 10 code C25.x) or KPSC Cancer Registryand patients not enrolled in the health plan on the index date were excluded.

### Pancreatic cancer: changing epidemiology and new approaches to risk assessment, early detection, and prevention [^1111QEvW]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer usually results in poor survival with limited options for treatment, as most affected individuals present with advanced disease. Early detection of preinvasive pancreatic neoplasia and identifying molecular therapeutic targets provide opportunities for extending survival. Although screening for pancreatic cancer is currently not recommended for the general population, emerging evidence indicates that pancreatic surveillance can improve outcomes for individuals in certain high-risk groups. Changes in the epidemiology of pancreatic cancer, experience from pancreatic surveillance, and discovery of novel biomarkers provide a roadmap for new strategies for pancreatic cancer risk assessment, early detection, and prevention.

Discussion

In this large retrospective comparative cohort study, the risk of pancreatic cancer in persons aged 50 to 84 years varied according to both the degree of elevation in HbA 1c level as well as timing with respect to onset of diabetes. Adoption of specific thresholds for elevation in HbA 1c level while applying the broadest set of cohort entry criteria without exclusion based on prior diabetes status provided the greatest sensitivity (range, 62%-80%) for detection of pancreatic cancer while still affording a 1.4- to 1.8-fold increase in cancer incidence from the base cohort. Using the same thresholds for HbA 1c level but applying a much more stringent definition for incident hyperglycemia yielded a 1.7- to 4.0-fold increase in cancer incidence at the expense of sensitivity (range, 6%-9%).

A major contributing factor to poor survival in pancreatic cancer is the late stage at diagnosis. Based on the relatively low incidence, it is unlikely that widespread, population-based screening would prove beneficial. However, a targeted approach to screening patients at increased risk offers the potential for early detection, thereby improving survival. While efforts to apply screening in patients at increased risk based on family history or genetic predisposition appear promising, these inherited forms account for a very small percentage (ie, 3% to 5%) of pancreatic cancer cases. Therefore, attention has turned to evaluating a broader segment of the population. In particular, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that patients aged 50 years or older with incident diabetes constitute an additional high-risk population for pancreatic cancer. While previous attempts have focused on identifying a high-risk subgroup based on the identification of new-onset diabetes, the present study expands on previous research by providing estimates of pancreatic cancer incidence across a range of newly established hyperglycemia, including levels that would qualify as prediabetes. The present study also highlighted potential differences in the association of new-onset hyperglycemia and the risk of pancreatic cancer based on race/ethnicity that have not been reflected in recent attempts to develop risk-prediction models to further identify high-risk subgroups. Accounting for these differences in future approaches to risk stratification is an important step to avoid potentially exacerbating existing disparities in pancreatic cancer.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^114Xhztm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Key concepts — diagnosis, etiology, and natural history in chronic pancreatitis: pancreatic function testing is an important means of diagnosing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; however, its role in establishing the diagnosis of CP is complementary; in patients with clinical features of CP, a comprehensive review of all risk factors should be performed, which provides information on mechanisms, identifies fixed and modifiable risk factors, potential targets for therapies, and prognostic information; identification of the disorder(s) underlying pancreatic inflammation is important in predicting progression to CP; the development of DM in CP is most likely related to duration of disease, although other etiologic factors such as BMI and smoking status may incur an increased risk; there is a lack of evidence to suggest that performing screening examinations on patients with CP to detect pancreatic malignancy is beneficial.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals: where Do we Go from here? [^113s8Y2E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is commonly diagnosed at a late stage. Screening asymptomatic patients is necessary for early detection, but this is not currently recommended in the general population. As demonstrated in the current study, an important number of patients at increased risk can be diagnosed using either MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasound. Further collaborative efforts are needed to define the ideal population for testing and refine the current approach to pancreatic cancer surveillance.

Identifying and Curating Biosamples Collected From PDAC Patients Before Onset of Symptoms

Currently, biomarker studies are hampered by lack of samples from presymptomatic patients. In a number of cohorts already assembled for other purposes, incident PDACs have occurred on follow-up; such PDAC subjects often have presymptomatic biosamples collected in the 5 years before PDAC diagnosis. Examples of such cohorts in the United States include the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial; The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study of Diet and Cancer; and the Women's Health Initiative. In Europe, The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening cohorts have also been established. Overall, between the 6 cohorts, approximately 1500 prediagnostic samples are available. However, it is very likely that the sample collection procedures (ie, at ambient temperature or on ice), type of samples (serum, plasma, or other), age of the sample (interval between date of sample collection and date of study), subject's prandial state at collection, history of freeze-thaws, etc. could vary widely between these cohorts. These variances need to be properly understood and catalogued to determine their suitability for study and choice of controls. Efforts to improve these procedures, which are valuable and worthy, will require investment of time and money.

In addition, committed investments of time and effort will have to be made to ascertain PDAC diagnosis, diabetes status, and risk assessment in these cohorts that were originally assembled for other purposes. In addition, appropriate age-matched and sex-matched controls, healthy and diseased (eg, type 2 DM, chronic pancreatitis), need to be identified whose samples have been similarly vetted and processed. The samples should also be stratified by duration from date of sample collection to date of PDAC diagnosis (< 6 months, 6 months to 1 year, 1–2, 2–3, and 3–5 years) for assessing biomarker performance.

Validating Promising Existing and Novel Biomarkers in Retrospective Samples: Timeline: 1 to 3 Years

Promising biomarkers identified in action item #1 and any novel markers that meet the predetermined criteria should be tested in presymptomatic samples from various cohorts (from no. 2a). A "biomarker bakeoff" in the presymptomatic cohort will help identify a panel of 3 to 5 biomarkers that consistently demonstrate the ability to accurately identify PDAC in prediagnostic cohorts.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer [^111RsTfH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and with a dismal 5-year survival of 10%. Poor survival of pancreatic cancer is mostly due to its presentation and diagnosis at a late stage. The present article aims to update clinicians with recent progress in the field of early detection of pancreatic cancer.

Recent Findings

Pancreatic cancer screening is not recommended in the general population due to its low prevalence. In this review, we discuss high-risk groups for pancreatic cancer, including inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer, new-onset diabetes, mucinous pancreatic cyst, and chronic pancreatitis. We discuss methods of enrichment of high-risk groups with clinical models using electronic health records and biomarkers. We also discuss improvements in imaging modalities and emerging role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of imaging and biomarker to aid in early identification of pancreatic cancer.

Summary

There are still vast challenges in the field of early detection of pancreatic cancer. We need to develop noninvasive prediagnostic validated biomarkers for longitudinal surveillance of high-risk individuals and imaging modalities that can identify pancreatic cancer early.

Identifying High-Risk Populations for Screening and Monitoring

To address the challenges outlined previously, screening for early PDAC requires identification of groups of patients with increased risk to maximize the identification of cases with the disease and decrease the number of false-positives that lead to invasive procedures for definitive diagnosis resulting in risks to the patient. Epidemiological studies indicate that susceptibility to PDAC is a complex interplay of modifiable risk factors and genetics that must be considered in developing models for risk prediction.

In a major effort to developing tests (liquid biopsy and imaging), the US Consortium on Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer has initiated a longitudinal cohort study, the New-Onset Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Cohort, to discover and validate high-sensitive and specificity biomarkers to identify patients with a high probability of having early PDAC. This study enrolls patients with the onset of hyperglycemia or diabetes after age 50 years. Of note, epidemiological studies support that this group of patients has about 1% probability of diagnosis for 3 years after the onset of diabetes. The study will recruit 10,000 patients, which will yield approximately 100 cases of pancreatic cancer. Developing liquid biopsy and imaging tests that distinguish between those who develop PDAC and those who do not with high sensitivity and specificity is the key goal of this cohort study. Of note, several studies show that the probability PDAC development can be further increased by including additional factors such as weight change, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors that are commonly contained in electronic medical records. –

### New-onset type 2 diabetes, elevated HbA1c, anti-diabetic medications, and risk of pancreatic cancer [^117GUpRk]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, these data suggest that new-onset diabetes or elevated HbA1c levels after diabetes confers an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Specific anti-diabetic medications carry different risks of pancreatic cancer, with a particularly increased risk among insulin users, and gradually less increased risks among users of combination of oral anti-diabetic medications, sulphonylurea and metformin, although these associations warrant further research.

### New-onset diabetes: an early sign of pancreatic cancer?-NCI… [^116tK1is]. NCI (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the last several years, evidence has mounted to support a link between new-onset diabetes and pancreatic cancer. And the Aronson family's hope has been inching closer to reality: Several large NCI-supported studies are testing ways to pick out those people whose diabetes might be a sign of a much deadlier problem. The research is part of larger ongoing efforts aimed at finding ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, when treatments may be more effective. And living with diabetes for a long time "is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer, " said V. Wendy Setiawan, Ph. D., of the University of Southern California, who's led long-term studies of pancreatic cancer risk in diverse populations. The reasons why aren't totally clear, but some of the proposed mechanisms include higher-than-normal levels of insulin circulating in the blood, high blood sugar, and long-term inflammation caused by type 2 diabetes, she explained.

While frightening, this last scenario is rare — the estimates are that fewer than 1 in 100 cases of new-onset diabetes are caused by cancer. And about 1 in 4 people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were first diagnosed with diabetes. "So how do we pick out that small, small subset of people with pancreatogenic diabetes, which in some cases may be caused by cancer. " asked Dr. Maitra. The second is that blood sugar levels tend to rise more rapidly in people whose diabetes is driven by a tumor. "And the third is weight loss, " Dr. Maitra explained. "Normally with type 2 diabetes, people gain weight when they become diabetic. " People whose diabetes is caused by pancreatic cancer can instead experience unexpected weight loss around the time of a diabetes diagnosis. If people with new-onset diabetes who have a high ENDPAC score are indeed more likely to have pancreatic cancer, said Lynn Matrisian, Ph. D., chief science officer at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, "as an advocacy group, our interest is: Can we help these people now". There's already some evidence to support that possibility. Recent work on a related project found that changes in levels of a protein called CA19–9, which is commonly used to track responses to pancreatic cancer treatment, can be found before diagnosis in blood samples from people who later developed pancreatic cancer. However, on its own, CA19–9 was not sensitive enough to identify everyone who went on to develop pancreatic cancer. His team is now looking for other markers in the blood that show similar changes before a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^116CbZd2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Models to distinguish between pancreatic cancer-induced hyperglycemia and the prediabetes of type 2 diabetes mellitus have found that variables typically associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, including elevated BMI, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, were associated with lower pancreatic adenocarcinoma risk. Others have noted that new-onset diabetes prior to pancreatic cancer development is associated with paradoxical weight loss. Multiple analyses have also demonstrated that obesity is associated with the development of pancreatic cancer. In our study, we were not able to draw conclusions between BMI and cyst development in HRIs since the majority (86%) of our patients were found to be healthy or overweight. Future studies should address longitudinal changes in BMI and glycemic profiles in HRIs.

Other studies have evaluated the association between treatment for diabetes and overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For example, one study found that metformin, a biguanide oral hypoglycemic commonly used as first-line therapy in patients with diabetes, is associated with increased survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Since only four of our subjects were found to be in the diabetic range (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%), we were unable to evaluate the impact of diabetes treatment in HRIs.

There are a number of strengths and limitations to this study. Although we assessed the presence of pancreatic cysts in HRIs, the presence of cysts does not suggest that these lesions will eventually progress into cancer. Additionally, as this study was retrospective in nature, we were not able to collect HbA1c and BMI values at the exact date of surveillance imaging. Patients were only included if they had HbA1c testing within one year of a clinical visit. However, one strength of this approach is that HbA1c data did not alter clinical decisions and prompt earlier investigations. We were not able to conduct a subgroup analysis in patients with worrisome features due to the small number of patients that fell into this category. Additionally, we do not have any information regarding differentiation of IPMN subtypes except for one patient who had a surgical resection. Since this study was conducted only in patients with a high risk of developing pancreatic cancer, the results are not generalizable to the general population.

### Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may serve as a potential marker for pancreatic cancer [^1136DjcS]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer has an extremely highly case fatality. Diabetes is a well-established strong risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Compared with a nondiabetic population, we previously reported a 15- and 14-fold greater risk for detecting pancreatic cancer during the first year after diagnosing diabetes in adult women and men, respectively, which dropped during the second year to 5.4-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, and stabilized around 3-fold for the rest of the 11-year follow-up in our historical cohort. The population attributable risk during the 11-year period was 13.3% and 14.1% in prevalent diabetic women and men, respectively. This means that one out of about every 8 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer has been previously diagnosed with diabetes. The globally high prevalence of diabetes and the aggravating implications of a delayed pancreatic cancer diagnosis call for newly-onset diabetes to be considered a potential marker for an underlying pancreatic cancer and addressed accordingly.

In patients with clinical symptoms of pancreatitis, workup for acute pancreatitis should include amylase, lipase, CBC, CMP, triglycerides, and abdominal CT scan. ICI therapy should be held if acute pancreatitis is confirmed until resolution of symptoms and CT findings.
Patients with persistent (> 4 weeks) or recurrent symptoms of acute pancreatitis should receive repeat abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate for possible consequences of acute pancreatitis. These patients should also be evaluated for non-pancreatic etiologies of lipase or amylase elevation.
Patients with elevated lipase or amylase but no other symptoms of acute pancreatitis should be monitored closely for the development of acute pancreatitis but should continue on immunotherapy.
Prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) or equivalent may be considered in patients with acute pancreatitis if no improvement of symptoms occurs within 3–5 days of supportive treatment (IV fluids and analgesics). These patients should also be referred to a GI specialist.

### Sequential intensification of metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes with liraglutide followed by randomized addition of basal insulin prompted by A1c targets [^11227K1F]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

It remains unknown whether an association exists between incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis, but acute pancreatitis is known to be about three times more common in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population. In the present trial, two cases of pancreatitis were reported (one acute and one chronic) and neither case of pancreatitis was preceded by elevated lipase levels. Reports of pancreatitis were similarly uncommon in other liraglutide studies, although imbalances in pancreatitis are noted for liraglutide and other incretin-based therapies. An initial small increase in median serum lipase below the upper limit of normal was observed across groups in the current study, and substantial fluctuations occurred over time. Interpreting these changes is difficult in the absence of an active comparator or a placebo group (i.e. a group not receiving liraglutide). Elevated lipase (or amylase) levels by themselves are insufficient to make a diagnosis of pancreatitis without the presence of abdominal pain and ideally confirmation with imaging studies. Most commonly, no gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with fluctuations in lipase observed during this trial.

At this time, HRIs with cysts in the setting of elevated HbA1c should continue surveillance under published guidelines. In newly established guidelines, there was expert consensus around the need for glucose testing (fasting glucose or HbA1c) to detect new-onset diabetes in HRIs. Additionally, there was consensus that the new emergence of diabetes in HRIs should prompt additional investigation. Further prospective surveillance data are required to evaluate risk factors for neoplastic progression in HRIs with cysts and elevated HbA1c.

### AGA clinical practice update on pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals: expert review [^116X7ZLo]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — screening modalities, intervals, and management — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) should be used in combination as the preferred screening modalities in individuals undergoing pancreas cancer screening. Screening intervals of 12 months should be considered when there are no concerning pancreas lesions, with shortened intervals and/or the performance of EUS in 6–12 months directed towards lesions determined to be low risk (by a multidisciplinary team), and EUS evaluation should be performed within 3–6 month for indeterminate lesions and within 3 months for high-risk lesions, if surgical resection is not planned. New-onset diabetes in a high-risk individual should lead to additional diagnostic studies or change in surveillance interval. Decisions regarding therapy directed towards abnormal findings detected during screening should be made by a dedicated multidisciplinary team together with the high-risk individual and their family. Surgical resection should be performed at high-volume centers. Clinicians should consider discontinuing pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals when they are more likely to die of non-pancreas cancer–related causes due to comorbidity and/or are not candidates for pancreas resection, and the limitations and potential risks of pancreas cancer screening should be discussed with patients before initiating a screening program.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer: why, how, and who? [^116fTtHQ]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15% to 20%. However, most patients presenting with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection. Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcome. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115TvbmM]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — diabetes, prediabetes, glycemia, and antidiabetic medications relate to risk and survival outcomes. Approximately 1% of patients with diabetes aged ≤ 50 years are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 3 years, and prediabetes may also be associated with increased risk; a dose–response meta-analysis including nine prospective studies (N = 2,408) reported that every 0.56 mmol/L increase in fasting blood glucose is associated with a 14% increase in pancreatic cancer incidence. In established pancreatic cancer, meta-analysis data show significantly lower overall survival (OS) in those with diabetes versus without (11.4 vs. 21.7 months; P < .001), and in the PLCO cohort, mortality was higher with diabetes (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14–2.04; P < .01). Long-term diabetes has been linked to pancreatic cancer with diabetes of 2- to 8-year duration, and a meta-analysis including 44 studies found the association decreases with duration. The use of insulin and sulfonylureas is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, whereas metformin may be associated with a reduced risk for pancreatic and other cancers; nevertheless, a retrospective cohort (N = 980) found metformin did not significantly improve survival, while a single-institution study in 302 patients with pancreatic cancer and diabetes found metformin use increased 2-year survival (30.1% vs. 15.4%; p = 0.004) and OS (15.2 months vs. 11.1 months; p = 0.009), with significance only in patients without distant metastases and persisting when insulin users were excluded.

A workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on "Pancreatitis-Diabetes-Pancreatic Cancer" focused on the risk factors of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and diabetes mellitus (DM) on the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Sessions were held on (a) an overview of the problem of PDAC; (b) CP as a risk factor of PDAC; (c) DM as a risk factor of PDAC; (d) pancreatogenic, or type 3c, DM; (e) genomic associations of CP, DM, and PDAC; (f) surveillance of high-risk populations and early detection of PDAC; and (g) effects of DM treatment on PDAC. Recent data and current understandings of the mechanisms of CP- and DM-associated factors on PDAC development were discussed, and a detailed review of the possible risks of DM treatment on the development of PDAC was provided by representatives from academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration. The current status of possible biomarkers of PDAC and surveillance strategies for high-risk populations were discussed, and the gaps in knowledge and opportunities for further research were elucidated. A broad spectrum of expertise of the speakers and the discussants provided an unusually productive workshop, the highlights of which are summarized in the accompanying article.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^1163i8h7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cysts — concerning symptoms and laboratory/clinical triggers for evaluation: Obstructive jaundice due to the cyst is concerning for cancer and such patients "should be urgently referred" for multidisciplinary evaluation and consideration of surgery. An elevated CA19–9 in IPMNs has pooled sensitivity 40%, specificity 89%, and OR 4.34 (95% CI, 2.65–7.10); if no benign cause is found, patients "should be referred" to a multidisciplinary clinic. Acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst has been associated with increased cancer risk in several studies. New-onset diabetes in older adults carries population-level risk — "Approximately 1% of adults over than 50 years with new-onset diabetes will develop pancreatic cancer within 3 years", and in IPMNs, new or worsening diabetes is linked to higher risk; therefore, the guideline states, "We recommend careful evaluation… with consideration of EUS or MRI".

### Do GLP-1-based therapies increase cancer risk? [^111Pj5pY]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Additional animal studies have also described histological alterations within the exocrine pancreatic tissue — this time with exendin-4 treatment. Exendin-4 is a peptide used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; the synthetic form is known as exenatide. Nachnani et al. found higher degrees of exocrine pancreatic inflammation after treatment with exendin-4, with a significantly increased number of pyknotic nuclei, but just a trend toward more fibrosis.

Other animal studies tested the hypothesis that the presence of exenatide treatment will affect the outcome of experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in ob/ob and high-fat diet streptozocin diabetic mice. In these studies, the administration of exenatide before the induction of experimental acute pancreatitis using cerulein reduced the increments in amylase or lipase activity. Based on these findings, even a protective effect of GLP-1 receptor stimulation could be hypothesized.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated acute pancreatitis — follow-up and treatment recommendations specify that patients with persistent (> 4 weeks) or recurrent symptoms of acute pancreatitis should receive repeat abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate for possible consequences and should also be evaluated for non-pancreatic etiologies of lipase or amylase elevation. Patients with elevated lipase or amylase but no other symptoms of acute pancreatitis should be monitored closely for the development of acute pancreatitis but should continue on immunotherapy. Prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) or equivalent may be considered if no improvement of symptoms occurs within 3–5 days of supportive treatment, and these patients should also be referred to a GI specialist.

### Evaluation of a mixed meal test for diagnosis and characterization of pancrEaTogEniC diabeTes secondary to pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis: rationale and methodology for the DETECT study from the consortium for the study of chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer [^112aQEww]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus is most commonly the result of chronic pancreatitis but can also occur secondary to pancreatic cancer. The early identification of pancreatogenic diabetes and distinction from the more prevalent type 2 diabetes are clinically significant; however, currently, there is no validated method to differentiate these diabetes subtypes. We describe a study, "Evaluation of a Mixed Meal Test for Diagnosis and Characterization of PancrEaTogEniC DiabeTes Secondary to Pancreatic Cancer and Chronic Pancreatitis: the DETECT study", that seeks to address this knowledge gap. The DETECT study is a multicenter study that will examine differences in hormone and glucose excursions after a mixed meal test. The study will also create a biorepository that will be used to evaluate novel diagnostic biomarkers for differentiating these diabetes subtypes.

### Glycaemic control is a modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer development in patients with diabetes: a population-based cohort study [^1127YkMR]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Effect of glycaemic control on pancreatic cancer (PC) development in patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear.

Objective

To investigate effects of glycaemic control on PC development in patients with T2D.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

Adults from a territory-wide healthcare registry were followed from T2D diagnosis until PC, death, pancreatectomy or end of study (December 2020). Exclusions were PC within 3 years after T2D diagnosis (addressing reverse causality), prior PC, immunoglobulin G 4 disease and pancreatectomy. The primary outcome was PC and secondary outcomes included PC-related and all-cause mortality. Optimal glycaemic control throughout follow-up was defined as time-weighted mean haemoglobin A1c (A1c) < 7%; with time-weighted mean fasting glucose (FG) ≤ 7mmol/L as secondary analysis. Adjusted HR (aHR) was estimated using Cox models with propensity score adjustment for covariates including demographics, diabetes complications, comorbidities and medications.

Results

Among 458331 patients (median age: 59.8 (P25-P75: 51.8–68.5) years; 51.2% male), there were 1382 (0.3%; 2.8 per 10000 person-years) PC, 922 (0.2%; 1.9 per 10000 person-years) PC-related deaths, and 70936 (15.5%; 142.9 per 10000 person-years) deaths over a median follow-up of 9.9 (P25-P75: 7.4–14.1) years. Optimal glycaemic control was associated with lower PC risk-A1c < 7%(aHR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.37 to 0.48) and FG ≤ 7mmol/L (aHR: 0.71; 95%CI: 0.63 to 0.80). Optimal control of both A1c and FG conferred lowest PC risk (aHR: 0.39; 95%CI: 0.33 to 0.46). PC risk increased stepwise with A1c (P trend < 0.001), with aHRs from 1.85 (A1c 7.0–7.5%) to 4.61 (A1c ≥ 9.0%). Every 1% rise in A1c and 1mmol/L rise in FG increased PC risk by 46% and 14%, respectively. Optimal control is also associated with lower PC-related mortality (aHR: 0.35; 95%CI: 0.30 to 0.41) and all-cause mortality (aHR: 0.83; 95%CI: 0.82 to 0.85).

Conclusion

Optimal glycaemic control was associated with lower PC risk in T2D. Further multicentre cohort studies are warranted to confirm its oncopreventive strategy.

2.3 Study Quality and Risk of Bias

The risk of bias (RoB) and study quality was assessed utilising the Cochrane RoB tool, given that all included studies were RCTs. Two independent authors assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality, and any disagreements were resolved via rigorous re‐review until consensus was achieved. The Cochrane tool contains seven domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Each domain is evaluated as high, low, or unclear RoB. Two independent authors analysed each article, and any discrepancies were resolved via rigorous re‐review or by consulting a third reviewer until agreement was reached.

2.4 Data Extraction and Analysis

The study variables extracted and analysed included title, author, study year, number of patients, GLP‐1 RA agent and dosages, mean age, mean follow‐up time, pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer rates, related lab values (amylase/lipase), and those taking background anti‐diabetic drugs. Notably, the diagnostic criteria were not consistently reported across the studies and were reported as investigator or an independent committee–determined AE. The data was compiled using Google Sheets (Google Drive; Google, Mountain View, CA). The mean, median, percentages, ranges, and standard deviations were reported if available and applicable.

Meta‐analysis was conducted using the fixed effects model to evaluate the risk ratio (RR) of developing acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis was not specified for pooling, and pancreatic cancer was an exploratory outcome, given that trial durations were not expected to be long enough to assess the risks for these two conditions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with RCTs that had at least 24 weeks of follow‐up to test for differences in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer findings. Heterogeneity was calculated with the I ‐squared statistic, with p ‐values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Forest plots were generated using Cochrane's Review Manager application (RevMan, version 5.4; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Studies with double‐zero events (treatment arms that had zero events) were included in the forest plot for transparency.

USPSTF pancreatic cancer screening recommendation — general population: For "Asymptomatic adults (not known to be at high risk of pancreatic cancer)", the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues "Grade: D" and "Do not screen". Persons with "certain inherited genetic syndromes or a history of familial pancreatic cancer are at high risk of pancreatic cancer. This recommendation does not apply to these high-risk populations", while "asymptomatic persons who have" risk factors such as "new-onset diabetes, preexisting diabetes, older age, cigarette smoking, obesity, or a history of chronic pancreatitis" are included. "The USPSTF does not recommend screening for pancreatic cancer in the general population using any method"; imaging methods (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography) have been studied mainly in high-risk trials, and "There are currently no accurate, validated biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer". For treatment context, "Surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy [known as the Whipple procedure] or total or distal pancreatectomy) is the generally recommended treatment for pancreatic cancer that is deemed to be resectable at the time of diagnosis", with "Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended, depending on the stage of cancer and other factors".

### Association of glycated hemoglobin levels with risk of pancreatic cancer [^114NDBdi]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with a 5-year survival rate below 10%. A contributor to poor survival for individuals who develop pancreatic cancer is the advanced stage of disease at the time of clinical presentation. The ability to detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage represents an important opportunity to potentially improve outcomes. However, because of the relatively low prevalence of pancreatic cancer (12.9 per 100 000 person-years [PYs]), the United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend population-based screening. As a result, targeted screening for patients from high-risk population subgroups has emerged as the most promising approach for early detection.

Hyperglycemia has been identified in patients with pancreatic cancer up to 36 months before cancer diagnosis. Newly diagnosed (ie, incident) diabetes after the age of 50 years has received increasing attention as a potential marker of undiagnosed pancreatic cancer, with 3-year cancer rates ranging from 0.25% to 1.0%, and the highest incidence reported in studies that have relied on glycemic criteria, rather than physician diagnosis. However, it remains unclear to what extent glycemic parameters, particularly glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) levels, are associated with overall risk of pancreatic cancer.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association of glycemic abnormality and risk of pancreatic cancer. We hypothesized that applying criteria other than those traditionally used in the definition of diabetes could lead to improved sensitivity for early detection of patients with pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we sought to characterize the performance of various thresholds of HbA 1c level, the most common test used to diagnosis diabetes, in a series of comparative cohort studies.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1168EVu4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) hormone is released in response to nutrient ingestion, enhancing insulin secretion, reducing glucagon release, and delaying gastric emptying. Agonists of this hormone were identified as providing potential therapeutic benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including improved glycaemic control and weight reduction. In addition to glucose control, GLP‐1 receptor agonist (RA) therapy has evolved to address cardiovascular benefits, weight management, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

Despite these advantages, concerns were raised in preclinical models and case reports highlighting pancreatic changes and acute pancreatitis, respectively. Although the total number of cases was low, these initial findings led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings in 2007 on the potential increased risk of pancreatitis. GLP‐1 RAs, such as exenatide, have been shown to induce pancreatic duct gland expansion and exacerbate chronic pancreatitis, potentially accelerating the formation of dysplastic lesions, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), by increasing ductal cell proliferation and promoting acinar‐to‐ductal metaplasia.

Findings of pancreatitis in these trials have been inconsistent, and subsequent studies have disputed the link between GLP‐1 RAs and pancreatitis. Clinical trials have monitored serum amylase and lipase, common markers of pancreatic health, and utilised independent adjudication committees to diagnose instances of pancreatitis to address these concerns. This study aims to evaluate available clinical trials of different GLP‐1 RAs to identify the rates of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer associated with their use. We hypothesise that GLP‐1 RAs will not significantly increase the risk of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatitis

ICI therapy may cause elevated levels of lipase or amylase. However, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis as an ICI-related irAE is rare. The clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis requires at least two of three features to be present: elevated lipase to more than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), epigastric pain consistent with pancreatitis, and characteristic radiographic imaging. Because patients with elevated amylase or lipase are often otherwise asymptomatic for pancreatitis, few cases of ICI-related acute pancreatitis have been documented. Additionally, no association has been demonstrated between the degree of lipase elevation and the severity or prognosis of pancreatitis.

In a retrospective analysis of 2,279 patients monitored for lipase elevation, patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1, anti-CTLA-4, or combination ICI therapies exhibited grade ≥ 3 lipase elevation (ie, > 2–5 times ULN with symptoms or > 5 times ULN without symptoms) at rates of 4%, 2%, and 8%, respectively. Of the patients with grade ≥ 3 lipase elevation, 61% exhibited no other symptoms of pancreatitis, while 39% exhibited at least one other typical symptom of acute pancreatitis. The median time from ICI therapy initiation to peak measured lipase elevation was 146 days in patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, 69 days in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and 110 days for patients treated with combination ICI therapy (p = 0.03). In these cases, symptoms typically resolved to grade ≤ 1 within roughly 50 days, regardless of steroid usage. Risk factors for adverse outcomes resulting from acute pancreatitis (eg, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes) included longer duration of ICI therapy, history of smoking, and history of hyperlipidemia. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids during acute pancreatitis was associated with better long-term outcomes, but for patients with grade 3 or 4 acute pancreatitis, the use of corticosteroids does not appear to improve outcomes and management should include consultation with a GI specialist.

GI toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any GI-specific exceptions or additional considerations to the general toxicity management principles are noted in the recommendations below.

### Association of glycated hemoglobin levels with risk of pancreatic cancer [^115UtExe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, elevated HbA 1c level among individuals aged 50 to 85 years was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the risk varied by race/ethnicity, with the highest risk noted among non-Hispanic white patients with confirmed evidence of incident hyperglycemia in the absence of prior diabetes or elevated HbA 1c value. An increased risk of pancreatic cancer based on more stringent definitions of new-onset hyperglycemia was not observed among other racial/ethnic groups. Ultimately, the number of patients needing to undergo testing based solely on elevation in HbA 1c level exceeded reasonable limits based on available testing strategies and resources. Alternative approaches to risk stratification are still needed to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

### Screening of patients at risk for familial pancreatic cancer: what is bene ﬁ cial? [^116sXwm6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Family history is a significant risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer and this hereditary risk can be secondary to familial cancer predisposition syndromes, hereditary pancreatitis, or familial pancreatic cancer. Certain high-risk individuals are recommended to undergo screening for pancreatic cancer with endoscopic ultrasound or MRI/magnetic resonance retrograde cholangiopancreatography because of the potential to identify and curatively resect precursor lesions. The management of suspicious lesions identified on screening high-risk individuals is also discussed.

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^116Np9cz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that elevated HbA1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts on initial surveillance imaging in HRIs in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program. Identification of pancreatic abnormalities and other risk factors that predict neoplastic progression to adenocarcinoma or high-grade precursor neoplasms may improve surveillance programs and guide management of detected lesions in the future. Future studies evaluating longitudinal changes in the glycemic and metabolic profiles in HRIs should be pursued.

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^112SBDtu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Emerging evidence demonstrates that surveillance of individuals at high-risk (HRIs) of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma allows for identification and treatment of resectable tumors with improved survival. Population-based data suggest that hyperglycemia may be present up to three years before the development of pancreatic cancer. We investigated whether elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is associated with the development of pancreatic cysts in a pancreatic surveillance program.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of HRIs who underwent pancreatic surveillance at a single institution between May 2013 and March 2019, according to published criteria. We collected demographic information, clinical data including HbA1c, and imaging results. We compared data using univariable and multivariable analyses. Our primary outcome was the presence of pancreatic cysts on initial surveillance in patients with elevated HbA1c.

Results

Ninety-eight patients underwent surveillance imaging via EUS or MRCP and seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria. Thirty patients were found to have cysts on initial imaging. Older age (p < 0.01) and HbA1c in the prediabetic range or higher (p = 0.01) were associated with the presence of cysts or solid lesions on univariable analysis. After controlling for confounders, age (aOR 9.08, 95% CI 2.29–36.10), and HbA1c > 5.7% (aOR 5.82, 95% CI 1.50–22.54) remained associated with presence of cysts and solid lesions in HRIs. In patients with cysts or solid lesions there was a strong association between increased age and elevated HbA1c (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

HRIs with elevated HbA1c were more likely to have pancreatic cysts compared to individuals with lower HbA1c on initial imaging in a pancreatic surveillance program. These findings may help tailor the surveillance protocols for those at increased risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^115arR4f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, pancreatic cancer is the 3 rd leading cause of cancer-related death. Approximately 80% of patients present with advanced disease, which is difficult to cure and is associated with short survival times. Although earlier detection is a critical priority, average-risk general population screening is difficult due to the relatively low disease incidence (39 per 100,000 person-years for women and 50 per 100,000 person-years for men among those ≥ 50 years of age). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), after weighing the potential benefits and harms, recently reaffirmed a recommendation against screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults. Identifying high-risk subsets who might benefit from surveillance is critical to pancreatic cancer early detection, but currently is pursued only among those with high familial or genetic risk and individuals with pancreatic cystic lesions. Defining additional patient features for inclusion in multi-factor models that identify individuals at near-term high risk for pancreatic cancer is important to expanding the population appropriate for pancreatic cancer early detection.

### Pancreatic cancer risk in prediabetes: a systematic meta-analysis approach [^114aSjYr]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pancreatic cancer and prediabetes pose significant public health challenges. Given the lack of strong evidence we performed a meta-analysis to assess the risk of pancreatic cancer in prediabetes.

Materials and Methods

We performed a thorough search of the major databases over the last 10 years to identify relevant articles. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were combined to calculate the effect size (ES).

Results

We analyzed 5 studies including 5,425,111 prediabetic individuals and 16,096,467 normoglycemic population across 5 countries with a median follow-up of 8.5 years. We identified a noteworthy association between prediabetes and pancreatic cancer, reporting an unadjusted ES of 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.77, P = 0.02) and an adjusted ES of 1.40 (1.23–1.59, P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses by age revealed variations in risk, with studies involving participants aged 60 and above exhibiting a higher ES (ES 1.83, 95% CI 1.28–2.62, P < 0.01). Geographical differences were also observed, with Japanese studies reporting a higher risk (ES 1.89, 95% CI 1.15–3.10, P < 0.01) compared with those from the United States (ES 1.32, 95% CI 1.13–1.53, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

We identified 40% higher risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with prediabetes than those with normal blood glucose necessitating urgent attention for further research and policy change.

HbA1c and risk of pancreatic cancer

Non-significant associations with pancreatic cancer were found among participants with higher HbA1c levels (⩾48 compared with < 42 mmol mol −1) measured close to the diabetes diagnosis (OR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.51, 2.03), and HbA1c measured close to the index date (OR 1.85, 95% CI, 0.91, 3.73) (Table 2). The change of HbA1c between the aforementioned two measurements (the last measurement minus the first measurement with a difference ⩾4 mmol mol −1 compared with < 0 mmol mol −1) was associated with an increased OR of pancreatic cancer (OR 5.06, 95% CI, 1.52, 16.86) (Table 2).

### Can our experience with surveillance for inherited pancreatic cancer help to identify early pancreatic cancer in the general population? [^117VoXt3]. Familial Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening of the general population for cancer is a matter of primary prevention reducing the burden of disease. Whilst this is successful for several cancers including breast, colon and prostate, the situation to screen and hence prevent pancreatic cancer is different. The organ is not as accessible to simple physical exam or biological samples (fecal or blood test). Neither exists a blood test such as PSA that is cost-effective. Reviewing the evidence from screening risk groups for pancreatic cancer, one must conclude that there is no rational at present to screen the general population, for a lack of appropriate tests.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115wqda9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — risk factors: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and diet are associated with risk and mortality. Elevated BMI is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, with higher BMI during early adulthood associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality. A meta-analysis including 22 cohort studies of 8,091 patients with pancreatic cancer showed that those who engage in low levels of physical activity have a higher risk for pancreatic cancer relative to those with high activity (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88–0.98). Additionally, there is some evidence that increased consumption of red/processed meat and dairy products is associated with an elevated pancreatic cancer risk, although other studies have not identified dietary risk factors for the disease.

### Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer: an overview [^111jKbQm]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer, although infrequent, has an exceptionally high mortality rate, making it one of the four or five most common causes of cancer mortality in developed countries. The incidence of pancreatic cancer varies greatly across regions, which suggests roles for lifestyle factors, such as diet, or environmental factors, such as vitamin D exposure. Smoking is the most common known risk factor, and is the cause of 20–25% of all pancreatic tumors. Alcohol does not seem to be a risk factor, unless it leads to chronic pancreatitis, which is a probable risk factor. Long-standing diabetes increases the risk of pancreatic cancer, but can also be an early manifestation of pancreatic tumors. 5–10% of patients with pancreatic cancer have an underlying germline disorder, while the remaining percentage of cancer cases is thought to be caused by somatic mutations. Some individual studies suggest that mutations in various polymorphic genes can lead to small increases in the risk of pancreatic cancer, but these findings need to be replicated. Rising prevalence of smoking in developing countries, improved diagnosis and increasing population longevity are all likely to increase the global burden of pancreatic cancer in the coming decades.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112p6Q1N]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Limitations

However, these findings must be understood within the context of their limitations. First, as mentioned earlier, there was heterogeneity in the included studies in terms of GLP‐1 RA dosage/type, study design, age (range of 14.4 to 68 years), follow‐up time (range of 1 to 198 weeks), and background medication usage. Most importantly, this heterogeneity was seen in the definition of pancreatitis, which was not consistently reported and was determined through investigator or independent committees. Second, we included only RCTs, which provide high‐quality evidence but generally have a shorter duration, which may not be long enough to fully capture the risk of pancreatic cancer. In contrast, databases and pharmacovigilance, such as FAERS, suggest increased pancreatic cancer risk, but these data are subject to reporting bias, preventing the determination of causality. Thus, the discrepancy between FAERS and the findings of this study highlights the need for long‐term observational studies to further clarify this risk. Third, a key limitation of the meta‐analysis is the exclusion of studies with zero events in both arms from the pooled risk ratio calculations. This was done due to the risk ratio becoming undefined if no events occur in either arm; these studies would not provide data to the pooled estimate and were excluded. However, this limits the comprehensiveness of the pooled values and can overestimate the overall relative risk as the excluded trials likely could dilute the observed risk ratio. RevMan software prevented smaller decimal precision of very small effect sizes, as we originally intended to use risk difference calculation, which could better capture the low incidence across all included studies. Fourth, despite the high quality of RCTs, patients typically enrolled in RCTs are highly selected and may not be representative of the general T2DM or obese population, possibly limiting the external validation of these findings. Fifth, although we included trials with at least a 1‐week follow‐up to maximise the capture of acute events of pancreatitis, this would limit the detection of longer‐term outcomes such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Long‐term observational studies, real‐world evidence, or pharmacovigilance are needed to reliably test these outcomes. To test this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with trials that had at least 12 weeks of follow‐up to assess for differences in pancreatitis. Sixth, patients with a history of pancreatitis or risk factors for pancreatitis are usually excluded during the screening phase. It is important to note that acute pancreatitis secondary to drugs is a diagnosis of exclusion. Thus, cases that are deemed idiopathic may very well be due to drug exposure as well. Additionally, a lack of classic symptoms or a lack of evolution of symptoms may lead to further underdiagnosis.

### Don't test for amylase in cases of suspected acute pancreatitis… [^114uD1hq]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Amylase and lipase are digestive enzymes normally released from the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas into the duodenum. Following injury to the pancreas, these enzymes are released into the circulation. While amylase is cleared in the urine, lipase is reabsorbed back into the circulation. In cases of acute pancreatitis, serum activity for both enzymes is greatly increased. Serum lipase is now the preferred test due to its improved sensitivity, particularly in alcohol-induced pancreatitis. Its prolonged elevation creates a wider diagnostic window than amylase. In acute pancreatitis, amylase can rise rapidly within three to six hours of the onset of symptoms and may remain elevated for up to five days. Lipase, however, usually peaks at 24 hours with serum concentrations remaining elevated for eight to 14 days. This means it is far more useful than amylase when the clinical presentation or testing has been delayed for more than 24 hours.

Current guidelines and recommendations indicate that lipase should be preferred over total and pancreatic amylase for the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and that the assessment should not be repeated over time to monitor disease prognosis. Repeat testing should be considered only when the patient has signs and symptoms of persisting pancreatic or peripancreatic inflammation, blockage of the pancreatic duct, or development of a pseudocyst. Testing both amylase and lipase is generally discouraged because it increases costs while only marginally improving diagnostic efficiency compared to either marker alone.

### Elevated hemoglobin A1c is associated with the presence of pancreatic cysts in a high-risk pancreatic surveillance program [^1152DSz2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tobacco is a known independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer. A recent study of HRIs has described an association between increased age and smoking history with the development of pre-malignant lesions or early pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Similar to their study, we found that increased age is associated with the development of cysts; however, we did not find that smoking was associated with precursor lesions such as IPMNs and PanINs. However, it is possible that among patients that smoke, pack-year tobacco exposure differed between the European and US-based studies. Further studies on the impact of tobacco exposure in HRIs are needed.

Two major causes of diabetes are pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance. However, type 3c diabetes is another form of diabetes caused by a variety of pancreatic diseases with varying mechanisms of hyperglycemia. Up to 80% of individuals with pancreatic cancer have evidence of impaired glycemic metabolism, and a diagnosis of new-onset diabetes has been associated with up to an 8-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Elevations in fasting blood glucose may be apparent up to 36 months prior to a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Recent reports suggested that FPC kindreds have a similar abnormalities in their glycemic profile prior to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer compared to those with sporadic pancreatic cancer. In this study, one patient with multifocal cysts went on to progress to adenocarcinoma associated with hyperglycemia. Our study provides additional support for further evaluation of glycemic profiles in HRIs to improve risk stratification.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer: opportunities and challenges [^1176Re8D]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with symptomatic, surgically unresectable disease. Although the goal of early detection of PDAC is laudable and likely to result in significant improvement in overall survival, the relatively low prevalence of PDAC renders general population screening infeasible. The challenges of early detection include identification of at-risk individuals in the general population who would benefit from longitudinal surveillance programs and appropriate biomarker and imaging-based modalities used for PDAC surveillance in such cohorts. In recent years, various subgroups at higher-than-average risk for PDAC have been identified, including those with familial risk due to germline mutations, a history of pancreatitis, patients with mucinous pancreatic cysts, and elderly patients with new-onset diabetes. The last 2 categories are discussed at length in terms of the opportunities and challenges they present for PDAC early detection. We also discuss current and emerging imaging modalities that are critical to identifying early, potentially curable PDAC in high-risk cohorts on surveillance.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer [^115UpzKy]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer (PC) and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are emerging as intertwined pathways. As the operative morbidity and mortality of pancreatectomy has improved, incidence has increased and survival has remained mostly unchanged. The diagnosis of DM2 suggests pancreatic dysfunction and possible early carcinogenesis. DM2 is a significant comorbidity predicting worse outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatic resection as part of the treatment of PC. This article examines this phenomena and suggests possible approaches to screening and diagnosis.

### Early detection of pancreatic cancer [^115vadnx]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is most frequently detected at an advanced stage. Such late detection restricts treatment options and contributes to a dismal 5-year survival rate of 3–15%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is relatively uncommon and screening of the asymptomatic adult population is not feasible or recommended with current modalities. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended. Here, we review groups at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including individuals with inherited predisposition and patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. We discuss studies aimed at finding ways of identifying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in high-risk groups, such as among individuals with new-onset diabetes mellitus and people attending primary and secondary care practices with symptoms that suggest this cancer. We review early detection biomarkers, explore the potential of using social media for detection, appraise prediction models developed using electronic health records and research data, and examine the application of artificial intelligence to medical imaging for the purposes of early detection.

### Epidemiologic and etiologic factors of pancreatic cancer [^111EM9CA]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Ranking fourth as a cause of death from cancer for men and women in the United States, pancreatic cancer represents a significant challenge for physicians and surgeons. In addition to the elderly, high-risk groups include blacks, men, smokers, and patients with certain preexisting diseases such as pancreatitis and long-standing diabetes. Various inherited genetic disorders cause approximately 5% to 10% of the total cases of pancreatic cancer. Smoking doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer. Control of smoking offers the best available strategy for reducing the incidence of this disease. Dietary measures to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer include maintenance of normal body weight and consumption of a well balanced diet with adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables. Chronic pancreatitis caused by heavy alcohol consumption or, rarely, by an underlying inherited disorder is another strong risk factor, but because this benign disease is uncommon, elimination of this underlying cause would have minimal impact on the frequency of pancreatic cancer.

### Understanding the contribution of insulin resistance to the risk of pancreatic cancer [^117KDwjZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a known risk factor for the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanisms behind this epidemiological association remain unclear. Whether it is hyperglycemia or insulin resistance that increases the risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a question that has yet to be settled. A new study by Kim et al published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology shows that the presence of insulin resistance independently increases pancreatic cancer mortality even in individuals without diabetes and hyperglycemia. The study's findings and implications to our understanding of pancreatic cancer risk are discussed.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111LJyi9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Number of pancreatic events in patients with background medications.

The studies reviewed in this systematic analysis focused on patients classified as overweight or obese, with inclusion criteria encompassing individuals with a BMI ranging from 25 to 45. Amylase and lipase levels were also measured in some of the studies, with many patients showing elevated levels of these enzymes at the latest follow‐up. However, in some cases, despite the elevated levels, the increases were insufficient to meet the researchers' diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis.

This variation within the included studies limits the generalizability and validity of the pooled estimates. The low I 2 heterogeneity is also likely due to the fixed‐effects model and the sparse number of events, rather than true homogeneity across the studies. Concomitant background medication usage may influence the observed risk of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, either through confounding or diluting the risk attributable to GLP‐1 RAs. For pancreatic cancer, subgroup analysis with background medications showed an association with pancreatic cancer. However, it is important to note that only studies with events were included in the pooled risk ratio estimate, as the other RCTs had zero events in both arms. This may overestimate the risk as the double‐zero studies would likely have diluted the RR, indicating that the true risk is lower than expected. Nevertheless, these zero‐event studies highlight the overall rare incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in both arms. All studies were retained in the forest plots for transparency but were not included in the meta‐analysis.

### The human GLP-1 analog liraglutide and the pancreas: evidence for the absence of structural pancreatic changes in three species [^117A2qn2]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The current studies were conducted before the potential association between GLP-1 agonists and pancreatitis in humans was described; therefore, we do not have data on plasma markers of pancreatitis. However, a recent article on exenatide, reporting on data in numerous diabetic animal models with up to 4 weeks of dosing, shows no increases in amylase, lipase, or triglyceride plasma levels. One additional study has been quoted as showing evidence of GLP-1–induced pancreatitis in rodents. The actual study uses the human islet amyloid polypeptide transgenic rat and reports pancreatitis in one of eight animals dosed with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, as well as an increase in ductal metaplasia and proliferation. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit degradation of endogenous GLP-1 in humans, the data from animals are much less clear, and the study does not include measurements of GLP-1 levels following sitagliptin dosing, nor does it include data on a GLP-1 analog. The commentary that accompanied the publication of the article suggested a concern that long-term, asymptomatic pancreatitis may lead to pancreatic cancer. Although such a concern is valid, because of the lack of long-term human studies, our studies do not support a direct link between pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 receptor activation, even with continuous exposure to high levels of a human GLP-1 analog.

### Association of glycated hemoglobin levels with risk of pancreatic cancer [^113emM85]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

New-onset diabetes after the age of 50 years is a potential indicator of pancreatic cancer. Understanding the associations between hyperglycemia, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, is key to developing an approach to early detection.

Objective

To assess the association of elevation in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted using data collected from an integrated health care system in California. A total of 851 402 patients aged 50 to 84 years who had HbA1c measurements taken between 2010 and 2014 were identified as the base cohort, with 12 contemporaneous cohorts created based on varying HbA1c thresholds (ie, 6.1%, 6.3%, 6.5%, and 6.7%) and prior diabetes status. Data analysis was conducted from August 2018 to September 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

New cases of pancreatic cancer identified through cancer registry and California death files during a 3-year period. Three-year risk, incidence rate, sensitivity, number of patients needed to screen to detect 1 case, timing, and stage at diagnosis were determined.

Results

Among 851 402 patients in the base cohort, 447 502 (52.5%) were women, 255 441 (30.0%) were Hispanic participants, 383 685 (45.1%) were non-Hispanic white participants, 100 477 (11.8%) were Asian participants, and 88 969 (10.4%) were non-Hispanic black participants, with a median (interquartile range) age of 62 (56–69) years and a median (interquartile range) HbA1c level of 6.0% (5.7%-6.6%). The incidence rate of pancreatic cancer was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.43–0.49) per 1000 person-years. After excluding prior diabetes as well as confirmation of new-onset hyperglycemia based on an HbA1c level of 6.5%, a total of 20 012 patients remained, with 74 of 1041 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases (7.1%) from the base cohort included. The rate of pancreatic cancer was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.32–1.42) per 1000 person-years among Asian patients, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.35–1.71) per 1000 person-years among non-Hispanic black patients, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.48–1.37) per 1000 person-years among Hispanic patients, and 2.37 (95% CI, 1.75–3.14) per 1000 person-years among non-Hispanic white patients. Overall, 42 of 74 cancers (56.8%) were diagnosed within 1 year of the index laboratory test. Among 1041 total cases, 708 (68.0%) had staging information available, of whom 465 (65.7%) had stage III or IV disease at diagnosis. In the base cohort, the number needed to undergo evaluation to identify a single case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was 818 (95% CI, 770–869), with estimates ranging from 206 (95% CI, 160–264) to 600 (95% CI, 540–666) in the subcohorts.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that screening patients for pancreatic cancer based solely on elevation in HbA1c level is unlikely to represent an effective strategy. Future efforts to identify a high-risk population based on changes in glycemic parameters should account for racial/ethnic differences.

### Targeting early diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer among the diabetic population: a comprehensive review of biomarker screening strategies [^114oKe8p]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, affects approximately 537 million individuals globally, with approximately 6.7 million deaths attributable to diabetes in 2021, predominantly occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer has attracted significant research attention due to their intricate, bidirectional pathogenic interactions, which remain incompletely understood. The primary objective of this review is to systematically analyze and synthesize existing evidence regarding the association between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the review aims to evaluate and highlight promising early biomarker-based screening strategies tailored for diabetic populations. By addressing these points, we seek to identify novel and practical approaches for the early detection and clinical management of pancreatic cancer, ultimately improving survival outcomes among this high-risk patient group.

Chronic pancreatitis — screening for pancreatic malignancy: "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that performing screening examinations on patients with CP to detect pancreatic malignancy is beneficial", and despite increased prevalence, "there are no RCTs, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses to support screening this patient population for pancreatic malignancy". The practical approach concludes, "At this time, there is no definitive benefit to screen patients with CP for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma".
