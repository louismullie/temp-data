## Question

vitamin D and breast cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, including prevention, prognosis after diagnosis, recurrence, dosing patterns, and practical guidance for care teams. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether vitamin D supplementation prevents incident breast cancer in the general population. Then, I should verify whether vitamin D affects total cancer mortality. Next, I will review prognostic data in women already diagnosed with breast cancer, including recurrence and survival. After that, I need to check subgroup and health equity considerations, such as effects in Black women and by tumor subtype. I will then examine dosing patterns, targets, and safety. Finally, I will synthesize clinical recommendations and highlight where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me consider biological plausibility versus causal evidence. Vitamin D receptor signaling is present in mammary tissue and can modulate proliferation and differentiation in preclinical models, which is biologically plausible for cancer control, but mechanistic plausibility alone is not sufficient for clinical recommendations, so I should confirm with randomized trials and Mendelian randomization studies that test causality in humans [^112coxLd] [^111W9PYo] [^113t7XGo] [^111fcKYB].

> Next, I will examine prevention of incident breast cancer. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from observational studies. Randomized evidence to date does not show that vitamin D supplementation reduces breast cancer incidence, and large trials and meta-analyses also show no reduction in total cancer incidence, although one older trial combining calcium and vitamin D suggested lower total cancer risk in a small cohort, which may not generalize to breast cancer specifically or to broader populations [^1122BpPp] [^1111wEaK] [^113mTi9c] [^111ed6Fr].

> Wait, I should double-check dosing patterns because regimen seems to matter. Daily vitamin D appears more favorable for cancer mortality than intermittent bolus, whereas large monthly bolus dosing did not reduce cancer incidence in a general adult population, reinforcing that if vitamin D is used, steady physiologic replacement rather than sporadic high-dose boluses may be preferable from an oncologic outcomes perspective, although this still does not translate to lower breast cancer incidence specifically [^1122BpPp] [^117Prmbk].

> I need to ensure we address causality for breast cancer risk specifically. Mendelian randomization analyses leveraging genetic instruments for 25-hydroxyvitamin D show no evidence that higher lifelong vitamin D levels causally reduce breast cancer risk, which aligns with prospective cohort data showing overall null associations and suggests that observational inverse associations may reflect confounding or reverse causation rather than causality [^113t7XGo] [^113Xpedf].

> Let me verify cancer mortality signals. Meta-analysis of randomized trials indicates no effect on total cancer incidence but a modest reduction in total cancer mortality, especially with daily dosing, and VITAL observed lower cancer mortality after excluding early follow-up, suggesting a potential lagged benefit on death rather than incidence; however, this is not breast cancer–specific and should be interpreted cautiously for breast oncology counseling [^1122BpPp] [^1111wEaK].

> Now, prognosis after diagnosis. I will now examine whether vitamin D status at diagnosis relates to outcomes. Several prospective cohorts suggest that lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D at or near diagnosis is associated with worse outcomes, including higher risks of recurrence and death, though confounding remains a concern; for example, early breast cancer cohorts showed deficient levels associated with higher distant recurrence and mortality, and broader meta-analyses across cancers report better survival with higher vitamin D status, but these are observational and not definitive for causality [^111XNZQw] [^112Fdzuf] [^115fFbNL].

> But wait, what if the recurrence signal is inconsistent. The WHEL cohort did not find an association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and breast cancer recurrence overall, although there was a suggestion that higher dietary vitamin D intake related to lower recurrence in premenopausal women, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to avoid overgeneralization from single studies [^115L38f7].

> Hold on, I should review disparities and subtype-specific considerations. Subgroup findings suggest possible benefit signals among Black participants in VITAL for overall cancer incidence and inverse associations between moderate supplemental vitamin D intake and risk of certain subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancer, in observational analyses among Black women; nevertheless, these findings are hypothesis-generating, may be confounded, and require replication in adequately powered randomized designs focused on breast cancer endpoints [^111Vn9Se] [^111HNEZg].

> I need to check treatment-phase data. A recent randomized trial during neoadjuvant chemotherapy reported that weekly 50,000 IU cholecalciferol improved pathologic complete response, which is clinically intriguing but needs validation and external replication; additionally, because bisphosphonate therapy can precipitate hypocalcemia in patients with occult vitamin D deficiency, routine assessment and correction of vitamin D status prior to and during such therapy is prudent [^113TWC6X] [^112hyfi6].

> Let me think about targets, dosing, and safety in practice. Deficiency is common among breast cancer survivors and can persist during chemotherapy with low-dose supplementation, supporting active monitoring and appropriately dosed repletion; daily regimens in the 800 to 2000 IU range are commonly used to achieve sufficiency, with trials achieving mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels around 120 nmol/L on 3200 IU/day while noting the IOM upper physiologic range of approximately 125–150 nmol/L, and current Endocrine Society guidance recommends considering empiric supplementation in adults 75 years and older to lower mortality risk, not specifically to prevent breast cancer [^114rBP1s] [^113J3MM9] [^1111wEaK] [^113h9V6a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the Women's Health Initiative calcium plus vitamin D trial supported a protective effect for breast cancer, but hold on, I should verify the breast-specific outcome. The WHI CaD trial did not reduce invasive breast cancer incidence, reinforcing that calcium plus low-dose vitamin D did not prevent breast cancer in that large trial, so I should not overstate any prevention benefit for breast cancer specifically [^113mTi9c].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise. For primary prevention of breast cancer, vitamin D supplementation should not be recommended as an anticancer strategy, although maintaining sufficiency is important for skeletal health and possibly for reducing total cancer mortality; for patients with breast cancer, it is reasonable to check and correct deficiency for bone and general health and to support therapies that rely on mineral homeostasis, while acknowledging that evidence for reducing recurrence or improving survival via supplementation remains mixed and largely observational; daily dosing to achieve sufficiency is preferred over intermittent bolus, and counseling should be individualized with particular attention to at-risk groups for deficiency, including those with darker skin pigmentation, higher adiposity, limited sun exposure, or ongoing cancer therapies affecting bone [^1122BpPp] [^112hyfi6] [^113h9V6a].

---

Vitamin D status is linked to breast cancer outcomes, but **RCTs show no reduction in incidence** and only modest mortality signals [^1111wEaK] [^1122BpPp]. Observational data suggest **deficiency worsens prognosis** and is common in breast cancer patients [^111XNZQw] [^114rBP1s]. Supplementation is reasonable to correct deficiency and support bone health, but **not as a primary prevention strategy** [^116qCZ25] [^112hyfi6].

## Biological mechanisms linking vitamin D and breast cancer

Vitamin D signals through the VDR to regulate genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune modulation; **VDR is expressed in most breast tumors** [^1135ptuy]. Preclinical data indicate that vitamin D can inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, and reduce invasion and metastasis, supporting a plausible anticancer role [^1135ptuy] [^112coxLd].

---

## Epidemiological evidence on vitamin D status and breast cancer risk

Observational studies are mixed: some report inverse associations between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk, whereas others are null or inconsistent [^113WfUua] [^1135ptuy]. A meta-analysis found a modest inverse association (RR 0.89 per 25 nmol/L), but Mendelian randomization does not support causality, suggesting **no causal effect on incidence** [^115Xoqmr].

---

## Vitamin D supplementation and breast cancer incidence

RCTs have not shown reduced breast cancer incidence with supplementation. The WHI (400 IU/day) and VITAL (2000 IU/day) found no significant effect on breast cancer incidence [^11231SgD] [^113mTi9c]. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (including higher doses) also found no effect on total cancer incidence (RR 0.98) [^1122BpPp]. Thus, **supplementation does not prevent breast cancer**.

---

## Vitamin D status and breast cancer prognosis

Lower 25(OH)D at diagnosis is associated with higher recurrence and mortality, especially in luminal subtypes [^111XNZQw] [^113v67qn]. The Pathways Study reported lower 25(OH)D in advanced-stage and triple-negative tumors and higher recurrence and mortality in the lowest quartile [^112Fdzuf]. A meta-analysis reported a 37% reduction in breast cancer mortality for the highest vs lowest 25(OH)D quartile [^115fFbNL]. These data suggest **deficiency worsens outcomes**, though causality remains uncertain.

---

## Vitamin D supplementation and breast cancer outcomes

Evidence that supplementation improves outcomes is limited and inconsistent. Some observational studies suggest better outcomes with higher 25(OH)D, but RCTs are lacking [^113WfUua]. The WHEL study found no association between 25(OH)D or intake and recurrence overall, though a subgroup of premenopausal women showed an inverse trend with dietary vitamin D [^115L38f7]. Overall, **RCT evidence is lacking** for improved outcomes.

---

## Vitamin D status among breast cancer patients

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in breast cancer patients and survivors. In a multiethnic cohort, 75.6% had insufficiency or deficiency, with lower levels in African American and Hispanic women [^114rBP1s]. Among premenopausal women starting chemotherapy, 74% were deficient at baseline, and many remained insufficient despite 400 IU/day [^113J3MM9]. This underscores **high prevalence of deficiency** in this population.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend vitamin D supplementation specifically for breast cancer prevention or treatment. The Endocrine Society recommends empiric supplementation in older adults (≥ 75 years) to potentially lower mortality, but not specifically for cancer prevention [^113h9V6a]. For breast cancer patients, supplementation is advised to correct deficiency and maintain bone health, especially with bisphosphonates or aromatase inhibitors [^112hyfi6]. Thus, there is **no prevention indication**, while correction of deficiency is standard.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Vitamin D supplementation is generally safe at recommended doses, but high doses can cause hypercalcemia and renal impairment. Monthly high-dose regimens did not reduce cancer incidence and may increase keratinocyte cancers in older adults [^117Prmbk] [^115K5wYw]. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D and calcium is advised, especially with high-dose or long-term use [^112hyfi6]. Overall, **routine monitoring helps prevent toxicity**.

---

## Gaps in current research and future directions

Key gaps include the lack of large RCTs testing supplementation on breast cancer outcomes, unclear optimal 25(OH)D targets, and limited data by subtype, ethnicity, and menopausal status. Future research should prioritize **large RCTs on outcomes**, define optimal levels, and clarify subgroup effects.

---

Vitamin D status is associated with breast cancer prognosis, but **RCTs show no reduction in incidence** and only modest mortality signals. Supplementation is appropriate to correct deficiency and support bone health, but **not as a primary prevention strategy**.

### Vitamin D supplementation and total cancer incidence and mortality: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1122BpPp]. Annals of Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on vitamin D supplementation and its impact on total cancer incidence and mortality have yielded inconsistent results. Most trials administered relatively low doses of vitamin D, typically not exceeding 1100 IU per day. To address this, we updated the meta-analysis by incorporating recent RCTs that tested higher doses of vitamin D supplements.

- **Materials and methods**: PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception until November 2018. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**:
	- For total cancer incidence, the analysis included 10 trials with 6537 cases, spanning 3 to 10 years of follow-up. The attained levels of circulating 25(OH) vitamin D [25(OH)D] in the intervention group ranged from 54 to 135 nmol/l. The summary RR was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93–1.03; P = 0.42; I² = 0%). Results remained null across subgroups, even when attained 25(OH)D levels exceeded 100 nmol/l (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.09; P = 0.48; I² = 26%).

	- For total cancer mortality, five trials were included, with a total of 1591 deaths registered over 3 to 10 years of follow-up. The summary RR was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79–0.96; P = 0.005; I² = 0%). This reduction was largely attributable to interventions with daily dosing, as opposed to infrequent bolus dosing. No statistically significant heterogeneity was observed based on attained levels of circulating 25(OH)D (P_heterogeneity = 0.83), with RR being 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98; P = 0.02; I² = 0%) for ≤ 100 nmol/l and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70–1.03; P = 0.11; I² = 0%) for levels above 100 nmol/l.

### Vitamin D insufficiency in a multiethnic cohort of breast cancer survivors [^114rBP1s]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Little is known about vitamin D status in breast cancer survivors. This issue is important because vitamin D influences pathways related to carcinogenesis.

The objective of this report was to describe and understand vitamin D status in a breast cancer survivor cohort. Data are from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle study. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington state, New Mexico, and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and medical records. Fasting blood, anthropometry, and lifestyle habits were collected after diagnosis and treatment. We examined distributions of 25(OH)D by race-ethnicity, season, geography, and clinical characteristics. Multivariate regression tested associations between 25(OH)D and stage of disease.

Results showed that five hundred ninety-seven (75.6%) of the women had low serum 25(OH)D, suggesting vitamin D insufficiency or frank deficiency. The overall mean (± SD) was 24.8 ± 10.4 ng/mL. It was lower for African Americans (18.1 ± 8.7 ng/mL) and Hispanics (22.1 ± 9.2 ng/mL). Women with localized (n = 424) or regional (n = 182) breast cancer had lower serum 25(OH)D than did women with in situ disease (n = 184) (P = 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively). Multivariate regression models controlled for age, body mass index (in kg/m²), race-ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet, and cancer treatments.

### Evaluation of vitamin D deficiency in breast cancer patients on bisphosphonates [^112hyfi6]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are very effective in treating osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease; however, unfavorable outcomes can occur when they are given to patients with occult vitamin D deficiency. No clear consensus exists on the assessment of vitamin D status in cancer patients undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. This study examines the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or metastatic bone disease, and observes the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in these patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study reviewed the electronic records of 321 breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates. Information on age, race, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), parathyroid hormone, and calcium were collected, and intakes of calcium and vitamin D supplements were queried in an outpatient pharmacy database.

- **Results**: Of the 321 patients treated with bisphosphonates, 209 (65.1%) had their 25-OHD levels checked at least once. Of these patients, 57 (27.3%) had a serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL, which is considered deficient. Additionally, 39 (18.7%) out of 209 patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation, with 400 IU of vitamin D per day, whereas 112 (53.6%) received > 600 IU of vitamin D per day, and 41 (19.6%) patients received 400–600 IU of vitamin D daily.

- **Conclusion**: Especially in the setting of metastatic bone disease in breast cancer patients, we advocate for routine 25-OHD concentration screening to detect vitamin D deficiency early. Clear guidelines for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients would be extremely beneficial to have.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the Finnish vitamin D trial: A randomized controlled trial [^1111wEaK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported that vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the total cancer incidence overall or in analyses stratified by several potential modifying factors, and our findings are in line with that observation. However, the meta-analysis did find that vitamin D supplementation decreased the incidence of cancer death. This was also observed in the VITAL study, which found a 25% lower risk of death from cancer in the analyses that excluded the first two years of follow-up. We were not able to investigate this outcome, because there were no cancer deaths as the first incident event. Also, the numbers of prespecified secondary cancer outcomes — colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer — were very low, but the lack of an effect on these outcomes agrees with the findings in other trials.

A strength of our study was the use of two vitamin D doses, which enabled an investigation of dose-response. There were clear and sustained differences in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the arms, with the achieved mean level of 120 nmol/L (48 ng/mL) in the 3200 IU/day arm being close to the upper limit of 125–150 nmol/L (50–60 ng/mL) suggested by the US Institute of Medicine. Other strengths include the population-based recruitment method and the use of national health records to collect data on incident events. The extensive data collected with the study forms during the trial also allow for future investigations of several health outcomes, many of which have limited dose-response data available. Limitations include the much lower than expected recruitment rate and the lower-than-anticipated event rate.

### Prognostic effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in early breast cancer [^111XNZQw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been linked to breast cancer risk, but its prognostic effects remain unknown. These effects are biologically plausible given the presence of vitamin D receptors in breast cancer cells, which act as nuclear transcription factors to regulate gene activity.

The study was conducted in a prospective inception cohort of 512 women with early breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 1996. Vitamin D levels were measured in stored blood samples. Clinical, pathological, and dietary data were accessed to examine the prognostic effects of vitamin D.

The mean age of the participants was 50.4 years, with an average vitamin D level of 58.1 ± 23.4 nmol/L. Vitamin D levels were deficient (≥ 72 nmol/L) in 24.0% of patients. There was little variation in mean vitamin D levels between summer and winter months. The mean follow-up period was 11.6 years; during this time, 116 women experienced distant recurrences, and 106 women died. Women with deficient vitamin D levels had an increased risk of distant recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.25) and death (HR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.86) compared to those with sufficient levels. The association persisted after individual adjustment for key tumor and treatment-related factors but was attenuated in multivariate analyses (HR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.86 for distant recurrence; HR = 1.60; 95% CI, 0.96 to 2.64 for death).

Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer.

### Vitamin D and breast cancer [^113WfUua]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. However, clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have yielded inconsistent results.

Regardless of whether vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common. The adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.

### Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of breast cancer [^113mTi9c]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

Although some observational studies have associated higher calcium intake, especially higher vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, with lower breast cancer risk, no randomized trial has evaluated these relationships.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women (N = 36,282) who were enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D₃ daily or a placebo for a mean of 7.0 years to determine the effects of supplement use on the incidence of hip fractures. Mammograms and breast exams were conducted serially. Invasive breast cancer was a secondary outcome. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed in a nested case-control study involving 1067 case patients and 1067 control subjects. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of breast cancer associated with random assignment to calcium with vitamin D(3). Associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels, total vitamin D intake, body mass index (BMI), recreational physical activity, and breast cancer risks were evaluated using logistic regression models. Statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Invasive breast cancer incidence was similar in the two groups (528 supplement vs. 546 placebo; hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.09). In the nested case-control study, no effect of supplement group assignment on breast cancer risk was observed. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were modestly correlated with total vitamin D intake (diet and supplements) (r = 0.19, P < .001) and were higher among…

### Cancer and vitamin D supplementation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11231SgD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D status has been associated with a higher risk of cancer in epidemiologic studies.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation alone on cancer incidence and mortality.

- **Design**: A systematic review was undertaken. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference abstracts, and clinical trial registries were searched (last search March 2017) for RCTs investigating vitamin D supplementation alone. RCTs with ≥ 12 months of follow-up and in participants with a mean or median age ≥ 60 years were eligible. During-study events were used as the main analysis, but after-study events were included in a secondary analysis. Subgroup analyses concerning different forms of vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D status at baseline, vitamin D dose, and exclusion of open-label trials were undertaken.

- **Results**: Thirty studies in 18,808 participants were included in the systematic review, with a median follow-up ranging from 1 to 6.2 years. The results of the meta-analysis for during-study events showed no evidence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation for cancer incidence (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.15) and cancer-related deaths (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.09). Including after-study events, the RRs were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.13) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.03), respectively. These results did not appear to be affected by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, vitamin D dose, or the exclusion of open-label trials.

- **Conclusion**: We did not find evidence of a significant impact of vitamin D supplementation on cancer incidence or mortality.

### Association of serum level of vitamin D at diagnosis with breast cancer survival: A case-cohort analysis in the Pathways Study [^112Fdzuf]. JAMA Oncology (2017). High credibility.

There is a long-standing interest in the potential benefits of vitamin D for preventing breast cancer recurrence and mortality, yet data from prospective cohort studies are limited. This study investigates the serum biomarker of vitamin D status, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), measured at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, to determine its association with prognosis.

The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors, established in 2006. Enrollment was completed in 2013, with follow-up ongoing. The cohort was established in Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated healthcare delivery system. Women with a diagnosis of incident invasive breast cancer were typically consented and enrolled within 2 months of diagnosis. The overall enrollment rate was 46% (4505 of 9820). Participants are followed for health outcomes and comorbidities at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 months after the baseline interview. A case-cohort design was used to efficiently assay 25OHD, selecting 1666 cohort members with serum samples and ensuring representation in the subcohort of races and clinical subtypes. Data analysis was performed from January 5, 2014, to March 15, 2015.

Primary outcomes include breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancer, and death. The results indicate that the mean (SD) age was 58.7 (12.4) years. Serum 25OHD concentrations were lower in women with advanced-stage tumors, with the lowest levels in premenopausal women with triple-negative cancer.

### Vitamin D and breast cancer recurrence in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study [^115L38f7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of research evaluating the relation between vitamin D and recurrence of breast cancer after treatment.

- **Objective**: This study was designed to evaluate the associations between circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and dietary, supplemental, and total intake of vitamin D and new breast cancer events within the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study design (n = 3085) was used to evaluate the relation between dietary, supplemental, and total vitamin D intake and breast cancer. A nested case-control study with 512 matched pairs was used for analysis of the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer recurrence.

- **Results**: No relation between 25(OH)D and breast cancer recurrence was observed. Compared with women with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for breast cancer recurrence were 1.14 (0.57, 2.31) for those with concentrations < 10 ng/mL, 1.00 (0.68–1.48) for concentrations ≥ 10 and < 20 ng/mL, and 1.05 (0.76, 1.47) for concentrations ≥ 20 and < 30 ng/mL. No significant associations were observed when analyses were stratified by pre- and postmenopausal status or for local, regional, or distant recurrence or death. Vitamin D intake was not related to breast cancer recurrence overall; however, for premenopausal women, there was a significant inverse association between dietary vitamin D intake and recurrence (P for trend = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: These results do not provide support for a relation between concentration of vitamin D and breast cancer recurrence.

### Review: The impacts of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on cancer patient outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fFbNL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] may affect the prognosis of cancer patients; however, the epidemiological results are not consistent.

- **Objective**: To perform a meta-analysis of all published studies to assess the associations of circulating 25(OH)D levels measured at or near the time of diagnosis and outcomes for cancer patients.

- **Data sources**: Searches of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases were performed and updated to December 2013.

- **Study selection**: Studies reporting an association between circulating 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis and outcomes for the patients were included.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed independently by two authors, and conflicts were resolved by a third investigator.

- **Data synthesis**: Included in the meta-analysis were 25 studies with 17,332 cases. Significant associations between circulating 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis and the outcomes for cancer patients were found. The pooled hazard ratio for the highest vs. the lowest quartile of circulating 25(OH)D levels was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33–0.91) for overall survival of colorectal cancer patients, 0.63 (95% CI = 0.51–0.77) for breast cancer patients, and 0.48 (95% CI = 0.36–0.64) for lymphoma patients. Higher 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality for patients with colorectal cancer (P = 0.005) and lymphoma (P < .001) and improved disease-free survival for patients with breast cancer (P < .001) or lymphoma (P < .05). A 10-nmol/L increment in circulating 25(OH)D level…

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^115Xoqmr]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The prospective epidemiological evidence for an association between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and the risk of breast cancer is inconclusive. A meta-analysis by Gandini and colleagues reported that a 25 nmol/L increment in circulating 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a relative risk of 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.98). Two subsequent meta-analyses observed no association between 25(OH)D concentration and risk of premenopausal breast cancer, whereas an inverse association was suggested for postmenopausal breast cancer. Specifically, Bauer and colleagues suggested a borderline significant inverse association for postmenopausal women with a relative risk per 12.5 nmol/L of circulating 25(OH)D of 0.97 (0.93 to 1.00).

We did not find an association between genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations and the risk of breast cancer. Our study was powered to find minimum detectable odds ratios ranging from 0.84 to 0.87 per 25 nmol/L in 25(OH)D. Information on menopausal status was not available in the large genetic networks that we used, but most women in our sample had postmenopausal breast cancer. In agreement with our findings, the Women's Health Initiative trial of vitamin D plus calcium supplementation in postmenopausal women did not support a protective association with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.09). A large cohort consortium of 9456 cases and 10,816 controls also found no association between the four single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with vitamin D and the risk of breast cancer.

### High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency despite supplementation in premenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy [^113J3MM9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased breast cancer risk and decreased breast cancer survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), in premenopausal women at the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and after 1 year of vitamin D supplementation.

The study included 103 premenopausal women from the northeastern United States with stages I to III breast cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy and participated in a 1-year zoledronate intervention trial. All patients were prescribed vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) 400 IU and calcium carbonate 1,000 mg daily. At baseline and at 6 and 12 months, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were obtained, and blood was collected and analyzed in batches for serum 25-OHD. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25-OHD levels less than 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20 to 29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as 30 ng/mL or greater.

At baseline, 74% of women were vitamin D deficient (median, 17 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency was slightly less common in white women (66%) compared with black (80%) and Hispanic (84%) women. After vitamin D supplementation for 1 year, less than 15% of white and Hispanic women, and no black women, achieved sufficient 25-OHD levels. Vitamin D levels did not correlate with baseline BMD and were not altered by chemotherapy or bisphosphonate use.

The study concludes that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in women with breast cancer.

### The role of vitamin D in breast cancer risk and progression [^1135ptuy]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)₂D₃), is primarily known as a key regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It exerts its biological functions by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in vitamin D-target tissues such as the intestine, kidney, and bone. Yet, the VDR is expressed in many additional normal and cancerous tissues, where it moderates the antiproliferative, prodifferentiating, and immune-modulating effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. Interestingly, several epidemiological studies show that low levels of 25(OH)D, a biological marker for 1,25(OH)2D3 status, are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) development. Mendelian randomization studies, however, did not find any relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with lower serum 25(OH)D and BC risk.

Nevertheless, multiple in vivo preclinical studies illustrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 or its less calcaemic structural analogues influence diverse cellular processes in BC, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recent insights also demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment impacts cell metabolism and the cancer stem cell population. The presence of VDR in the majority of BCs, together with the various anti-tumoural effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, has supported the evaluation of the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on BC development. However, most randomized controlled clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear decrease in BC incidence with supplementation.

### Targets of vitamin D receptor signaling in the mammary gland [^112coxLd]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mammary cells, the role of the vitamin D signaling pathway in normal glandular function and in breast cancer has been extensively explored. In vitro studies have shown that the VDR ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), modulates key proteins involved in signaling proliferation, differentiation, and the survival of normal mammary epithelial cells. Similar anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating effects of 1,25D have been observed in VDR-positive breast cancer cells, indicating that transformation per se does not abolish vitamin D signaling. However, many transformed breast cancer cells lose sensitivity to 1,25D secondary to alterations in vitamin D metabolizing enzymes or downregulation of VDR function.

Our laboratory has focused on three general areas over the years:

- **Mechanisms of vitamin D-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells**: We explore how vitamin D contributes to programmed cell death in cancerous cells.

- **Changes in the vitamin D signaling pathway during transformation**: This includes investigating the development of vitamin D resistance and its implications.

- **Impact of the VDR on growth regulatory pathways in vivo**: Using mouse models, we study the effect of VDR in the context of development and tumorigenesis.

Recent developments include:

- **Detection of megalin-mediated uptake**: This involves the uptake of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in mammary cells.

- **Identification of metabolizing enzymes**: We have identified CYP27B1 and CYP24 in mammary cells.

- **Demonstration of precocious mammary gland development**: Observed in VDR-null mice, this highlights the importance of VDR.

- **Identification of novel pathways during apoptosis**: New pathways triggered by 1,25D have been discovered during the apoptosis process.

Our preclinical studies have been complemented by emerging data from other groups, suggesting further areas of exploration.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^113v67qn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

We have shown that deficient serum concentrations of vitamin D were significantly associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence of breast cancer compared with patients who had adequate levels of vitamin D. Furthermore, the prognostic association varied with intrinsic subtype — significant only for patients with luminal types of breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to show that vitamin D concentration is a valuable prognostic indicator in the estimation of survival, depending on breast cancer intrinsic subtype.

Although several epidemiologic studies have evaluated associations between vitamin D concentration, breast cancer risk, and prognosis, the cited works have yielded inconsistent results. Among the methodological inconsistencies evident in these studies are evaluations of vitamin D status: some assessed the effects of dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin D, while others explored vitamin D status with respect to sunlight exposure. Measurement of circulating concentrations of 25-OHD provides an integrated measure of vitamin D derived from all sources, including sunlight exposure, diet, and supplementation, and is considered the best indicator of vitamin D body stores. The cited epidemiologic studies also used different categorizations of vitamin D status, and one work, similar to the present report, categorized vitamin D status by serum 25-OHD concentration as deficient, insufficient, and sufficient.

Several epidemiologic studies have shown conflicting results between vitamin D and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of keratinocyte cancer: an exploratory analysis of the D-Health randomized controlled trial [^115K5wYw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin D may play a role in the prevention of keratinocyte cancer (KC), but observational studies examining the association between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration and KC are largely uninformative because sun exposure causes both KC and vitamin D production. There is scant evidence from clinical trials on supplementary vitamin D.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of developing KC.

- **Methods**: We used data from the D-Health Trial, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation (60,000 international units monthly for 5 years) among Australians aged ≥ 60 years. KC outcomes were captured through linkage to a national administrative dataset for those who consented (N = 20,334; 95%). We used negative binomial regression to analyze the incidence of KC excisions and the incidence of actinic lesions treated using cryotherapy or serial curettage, and flexible parametric survival models for analysis of time to first KC excision.

- **Results**: Randomization to vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the incidence of KC lesions treated by excision [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.11], the incidence of actinic lesions treated using other methods (IRR 1.01; 95% CI 0.95–1.08), or time to first histologically confirmed KC excision (hazard ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.97–1.08). However, in subgroup analysis, vitamin D increased the incidence of KC excisions in adults aged ≥ 70 years (IRR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23; P-value for interaction = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce the incidence of KC.

### Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation and cancer risk: A post hoc analysis of the Vitamin D Assessment randomized clinical trial [^117Prmbk]. JAMA Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Previous randomized clinical trials have reported inconsistent results on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer incidence. This study examines whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation received monthly, without calcium, is associated with a reduction in cancer incidence and cancer mortality in the general population.

This research is a post hoc analysis of the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It recruited participants from family practices and community groups in Auckland, New Zealand, from April 5, 2011, through November 6, 2012, with follow-up completed on December 31, 2015. Participants were adult community residents aged 50 to 84 years. Out of 47,905 adults invited from family practices and 163 from community groups, 5110 participants were randomized to receive either vitamin D3 (n = 2558) or a placebo (n = 2552). Two participants withdrew consent, leaving 5108 participants included in the primary analysis. Data analysis was conducted by intention to treat.

Interventions involved oral vitamin D3, with an initial bolus dose of 200,000 IU followed by monthly doses of 100,000 IU, or placebo, for a median duration of 3.3 years (range, 2.5–4.2 years).

The primary outcome, assessed post hoc, was the number of all primary invasive and in situ malignant neoplasms (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) diagnosed from randomization until the study medication was discontinued on July 31, 2015.

Of the 5108 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (8.3) years.

### Interaction between current vitamin D supplementation and menopausal hormone therapy use on breast cancer risk: Evidence from the E3N cohort [^116jxb7W]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Experimental studies suggest protective effects of vitamin D on breast carcinogenesis, particularly on estrogen receptor-positive tumors; however, epidemiologic data are less conclusive.

Our objective was to investigate the association between postmenopausal breast cancer risk and past vitamin D supplementation overall, and according to the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).

Between 1995 and 2008, 2482 invasive breast cancer cases were diagnosed among 57,403 postmenopausal women from the E3N prospective cohort over 581,085 person-years. Vitamin D supplementation was assessed from biennially self-administered questionnaires sent in 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2005 and from medico-administrative data on drug reimbursements since 2004. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) for primary invasive breast cancer and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models.

A decreased postmenopausal breast cancer risk was associated with current vitamin D supplementation (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.97) but not past supplementation (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31; P-homogeneity = 0.02). The association with vitamin D supplementation differed according to MHT use: ever users (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.90) and never users (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.56; P-homogeneity = 0.02).

In this observational study, vitamin D supplementation, mostly taken daily and combined with calcium, was associated with a decreased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in MHT users. These findings should be confirmed before considering vitamin D supplementation to partly balance the MHT-associated risks.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^115Rw8MY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The randomized placebo-controlled Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial suggested a possible benefit of vitamin D on cancer incidence among black individuals. However, data are limited regarding the impact of vitamin D on breast cancer subtypes among African-American/black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of breast cancer.

We hypothesize that more vitamin D exposure (through diet, supplements, and sunlight) and higher intake of calcium are associated with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)+ and ER− breast cancer, and of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among black women.

This study was conducted among 1,724 black cases and 1,233 controls in the Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS) and WCHS2. Polytomous logistic regressions were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of ER+ and ER− breast cancer; logistic regressions were used for TNBC. The ORs from each study were pooled using an inverse-variance-weighted random-effects model.

Dietary vitamin D and calcium intake were not associated with risk of breast cancer subtypes in the pooled analysis. For supplemental vitamin D, we observed possible inverse associations between intake of ≤ 800 IU/d (compared with nonuse) and risk of several subtypes, with effects that appeared strongest for TNBC (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.94); no association was found for > 800 IU/d. More daylight hours spent outdoors in a year was associated with lower risk of ER+, ER−, and TNBC (e.g. highest compared with lowest quartile: TNBC OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02).

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^111HNEZg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

In this population-based breast cancer study of black women, a moderate intake of supplemental vitamin D was associated with a decreased risk of several breast cancer subtypes, with effects that appeared strongest for TNBC. More sunlight exposure was associated with decreased risk, including ER− and TNBC. Prior studies have shown the etiological heterogeneity of breast cancer by ER status among black women, indicating a need to evaluate risk factors separately for different subtypes. The study is the largest investigation at the time of writing to systematically evaluate vitamin D exposure from diet, supplements, and sun exposure, and calcium intake in relation to the risk of breast cancer subtypes, including the aggressive TNBCs, among black women.

Several RCTs have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer risk, but few had enough breast cancer cases and even fewer included enough black participants. For example, Lappe et al. did not find an effect of supplemental calcium plus 1100 IU vitamin D/d on the incidence of breast cancer. The number of breast cancer cases was small, with 19 cases in the intervention group and 24 in the placebo group. Another RCT, the Vitamin D Assessment study, with 36 breast cancer cases, was also not optimally powered to detect the effect on incidence. VITAL, which had 246 breast cancer cases, found no significant difference in breast cancer incidence comparing the vitamin D supplementation group with the control group. The study included 20% black participants and suggested that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of incidence.

### Plasma folate, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and risk of breast cancer in women [^116yyH9j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

B vitamins such as folate, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 are coenzymes essential for DNA integrity and stability. Deficiency in these B vitamins may promote tumor carcinogenesis.

- **Objective**: We prospectively evaluated plasma concentrations of folate, pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP; the principal active form of vitamin B-6), and vitamin B-12 in relation to breast cancer risk.

- **Design**: We included 848 incident cases of invasive breast cancer identified as of 31 March 2004 and 848 individually matched control subjects from 28,345 women in the Women's Health Study aged ≥ 45 years who provided blood samples and had no history of cancer and cardiovascular disease at baseline in 1993. Logistic regression controlling for matching factors and other risk factors for breast cancer was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Plasma concentrations of folate, PLP, and vitamin B-12 were not associated with the overall risk of breast cancer. Women in the highest quintile group relative to those in the lowest quintile had multivariate RRs of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.00, 2.02) for plasma folate (P for trend = 0.21), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.30) for plasma PLP (P for trend = 0.48), and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.82) for plasma vitamin B-12 (P for trend = 0.18). However, higher plasma folate concentrations were moderately associated with an increased risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer (P for trend = 0.04) and for developing estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumors (P for trend ≤ 0.05).

### Predictors of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations among postmenopausal women: The Women's Health Initiative Calcium plus Vitamin D Clinical Trial [^1151Ym9j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear how well surrogate markers for vitamin D exposure (e.g. oral intake of vitamin D and estimates of sunlight exposure), with and without consideration of other potential predictors of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, similarly rank individuals with respect to 25(OH)D blood concentrations.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine how much variation in serum 25(OH)D concentrations (nmol/L) could be explained by a predictive model using different vitamin D surrogate markers (latitude of residence, mean annual regional solar irradiance estimates, and oral sources) and other individual characteristics that might influence vitamin D status.

- **Design**: A random sample of 3055 postmenopausal women (aged 50–70 years) participating in 3 nested case-control studies of the Women's Health Initiative Calcium plus Vitamin D Clinical Trial was used. Serum 25(OH)D values, assessed at year 1 (1995–2000), and potential predictors of 25(OH)D concentrations, assessed at year 1 or Women's Health Initiative baseline (1993–1998), were used.

- **Results**: More than half of the women (57.1%) had deficient (< 50 nmol/L) concentrations of 25(OH)D. Distributions of 25(OH)D concentrations by level of latitude of residence, mean annual regional solar irradiance, and intake of vitamin D varied considerably. The predictive model for 25(OH)D explained 21% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentrations. After adjustment for the month of blood draw, breast cancer status, colorectal cancer status, fracture status, participation in the hormone therapy trial, and randomization to the…

### Prospective study of serum vitamin D and cancer mortality in the United States [^116gBcS9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality through its effects on incidence and/or survival. Epidemiologic studies of the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risk of cancer, however, have been largely limited to incident cancers at a few sites.

- **Methods**: A total of 16,818 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who were 17 years or older at enrollment, were followed from 1988–1994 through 2000. Levels of serum 25(OH)D were measured at baseline by radioimmunoassay. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and total cancer mortality (in the entire population or according to race/ethnicity, sex, age, and retinol status) and mortality from specific cancers. Because serum was collected in the south in cooler months and the north in warmer months, we examined associations by collection season. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified 536 cancer deaths in 146,578 person-years. Total cancer mortality was unrelated to baseline vitamin D status in the entire population, men, women, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and in persons younger than 70 or 70 years or older. We found no interaction between vitamin D and season or vitamin D and serum retinol. Colorectal cancer mortality was inversely related to serum 25(OH)D level, with levels 80 nmol/L or higher associated with a 72% risk reduction (95% confidence interval = 32% to 89%) compared with lower than 50 nmol/L, P(trend) = .02.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests no significant association between baseline vitamin D levels and total cancer mortality across various demographics, although there is an inverse relationship with colorectal cancer mortality.

### Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and risk of breast cancer: a nested case-control study using multiple time points [^112wdy64]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2015). Low credibility.

There is strong evidence that breast cancer risk is influenced by environmental factors. Blood lipid and lipoprotein levels are also influenced by environmental factors and are associated with some breast cancer risk factors. We examined whether serial measures of serum lipids and lipoproteins were associated with breast cancer risk.

- **Methods**: We carried out a nested case-control study within a randomized long-term dietary intervention trial with 4,690 women with extensive mammographic density followed for an average of 10 years for breast cancer incidence. We measured lipids in an average of 4.2 blood samples for 279 invasive breast cancer case subjects and 558 matched control subjects. We calculated subaverages of lipids for each subject based on menopausal status and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at blood collection and analyzed their association with breast cancer using generalized estimating equations. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (P = 0.05) and apoA1 (P = 0.02) levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk (75th vs. 25th percentile: HDL-C, 23% higher; apoA1, 28% higher) and non-HDL-C (P = 0.03) and apoB (P = 0.01) levels were negatively associated (75th vs. 25th percentile: non-HDL-C, 19% lower; apoB, 22% lower). These associations were observed only when lipids were measured when HRT was not used. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk.

- **Conclusions**: These results demonstrate that serum lipids and their specific components may have a role in influencing breast cancer risk, particularly when measured in the absence of HRT use.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^111Vn9Se]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

African-American/black women are about twice as likely to develop breast cancers with a more aggressive phenotype, such as estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), compared to white women in the United States, contributing to notable racial disparities in breast cancer mortality.

Experimental studies have highlighted the potential antitumorigenic properties of vitamin D. Recent findings from the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a randomized controlled trial (RCT), did not show that vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/d) reduced the rate of invasive cancer. However, subgroup analyses suggested a possible benefit of vitamin D on cancer incidence among black participants (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.01) and raised the possibility that BMI modifies the effect of vitamin D on cancer risk.

Most previous RCTs and observational studies conducted primarily among white women did not reveal significant associations between prediagnostic vitamin D exposure or circulating concentrations of vitamin D and breast cancer risk. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among black women than white women due to factors like darker skin pigmentation, higher prevalence of lactose intolerance, and less use of supplements. Additionally, obesity, which is more prevalent among black women, may further lower the bioavailability of vitamin D, given its fat solubility and sequestration in adipose tissue. Three studies have evaluated vitamin D exposure in relation to breast cancer risk by subtypes among black women: one small study e

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and subsequent risk of total and site specific cancers in Japanese population: Large case-cohort study within Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study cohort [^113Fi9Kd]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Subgroup analysis by sex showed no evidence of a significant difference in the effect of vitamin D between sexes (see supplementary tables D and E). In sensitivity analyses, exclusion of cases of cancer diagnosed in the first three years of follow-up did not appreciably alter the findings for total cancer (hazard ratio for highest versus lowest quarter: 0.81, 0.69 to 0.95; P for trend = 0.005) and liver cancer (0.43, 0.24 to 0.78; P for trend = 0.0045). The associations remained unchanged after exclusion of 1836 participants with supplemental vitamin use (data not shown). Additional adjustment for occupational status in the multivariable model did not significantly alter the risk estimates (data not shown).

To test whether the 25-hydroxyvitamin D/total cancer association was driven by associations with any one specific cancer site (particularly liver, lung, prostate, and breast cancer), we reanalyzed the 25-hydroxyvitamin D/total cancer association by alternately excluding cases of these cancers from total cancer cases — one cancer site at a time in separate models. Hazard ratios in each of these models showed no appreciable difference from the overall model, possibly indicating that the total cancer association is the result of an accumulation of small effects shared across multiple sites.

### A comprehensive re-assessment of the association between vitamin D and cancer susceptibility using Mendelian randomization [^111fcKYB]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In the UK Biobank (UKB) 25(OH)D GWAS, we identified 74 independent genetic instruments for 25(OH)D, which together explained close to 4.0% of the phenotypic variation in serum 25(OH)D. All the 25(OH)D variants used in previous Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were successfully replicated, with comparable SNP-25(OH)D effect sizes (see Supplementary Table 1). We also identified one 25(OH)D variant located near the HAL gene, which was previously reported to influence the risk of skin cancers. This variant was removed from our MR analyses on skin cancers, even though it only explained 0.05% of 25(OH)D variation.

Based on the estimated proportion of 25(OH)D variance explained by SNP of 4.0%, the power to detect moderate effect sizes (OR of 1.2 or more per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in 25(OH)D level) is adequate for most cancers. In the UKB, a 1 SD increase in 25(OH)D levels roughly translates to a 20-nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D level, which is the upper bound for the amount of 25(OH)D attainable through vitamin D supplementation (i.e. an increase of ~1000 IU/day). Sample sizes for each of the cancers evaluated are shown in Table 1. The estimated OR per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted 25(OH)D on cancer risks using the traditional 25(OH)D SNP instruments (n = 6) and the larger set of SNP instruments identified from the UK Biobank (n = 79) are shown separately in Table 2.

Consistent with the MR findings based on traditional genetic instruments, we found no evidence for a causal association between 25(OH)D and the risk of breast, prostate, lung, melanoma, and other cancers.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^1147LcJG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted by classifying patients based on serum 25-OHD concentration into sufficient (30–150 ng/ml), insufficient (20–29 ng/ml), or deficient (< 20 ng/ml) levels. Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the occurrence of the first locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, detection of a secondary primary tumor, or death from any cause. Recurrence at any site, including the contralateral axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes, was considered a distant metastasis. Conversely, recurrence in a remnant breast, the chest wall, or the axillary or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node was regarded as a locoregional recurrence.

- **Statistical methods**: The χ² test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were utilized to assess the significance of differences in clinicopathologic features between groups. Univariate survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and log-rank tests were employed for comparing survival curves. Multivariate analyses were conducted using Cox's proportional hazard regression model. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### Vitamin D intake and breast cancer risk: A case-control study in Italy [^1174g6bN]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been suggested to play a protective role against several cancers, including breast cancer.

- **Patients and methods**: We used data from a case-control study conducted in Italy from 1991 to 1994 to study the relation between dietary intake of vitamin D and breast cancer risk. Subjects were 2,569 women with incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer and 2,588 hospital controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to deciles of vitamin D intake were estimated by multiple logistic regression models.

- **Results**: After allowance for major risk factors for breast cancer and dietary covariates including calcium and energy intake, there was no association with vitamin D up to the seventh decile. Thereafter, the OR declined, so that the overall trend was statistically significantly inverse. The OR for subjects in the three highest deciles of consumption compared with those in the lowest ones combined was 0.79 (95% CI 0.70–0.90). Intake of vitamin D > 3.57 micrograms or 143 IU appeared to have a protective effect against breast cancer. The inverse association was consistent across strata of menopausal status.

- **Conclusions**: This study adds to the existing evidence that vitamin D intake is inversely associated with breast cancer risk.

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation reduces cancer risk: Results of a randomized trial [^111ed6Fr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). High credibility.

Numerous observational studies have found supplemental calcium and vitamin D to be associated with reduced risk of common cancers; however, interventional studies to test this effect are lacking.

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the efficacy of calcium alone and calcium plus vitamin D in reducing incident cancer risk of all types. This was a 4-year, population-based, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was fracture incidence, and the principal secondary outcome was cancer incidence. The subjects were 1,179 community-dwelling women randomly selected from the population of healthy postmenopausal women aged over 55 years in a 9-county rural area of Nebraska centered at latitude 41.4 degrees N. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1400–1500 mg of supplemental calcium per day alone (Ca-only), supplemental calcium plus 1100 IU vitamin D3 per day (Ca + D), or placebo.

When analyzed by intention to treat, cancer incidence was lower in the Ca + D women than in the placebo control subjects (P < 0.03). With the use of logistic regression, the unadjusted relative risks (RR) of incident cancer in the Ca + D and Ca-only groups were 0.402 (P = 0.01) and 0.532 (P = 0.06), respectively. When analysis was confined to cancers diagnosed after the first 12 months, RR for the Ca + D group fell to 0.232 (CI: 0.09, 0.60; P < 0.005) but did not change significantly for the Ca-only group. In multiple logistic regression models, both treatment and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significant, independent predictors of cancer.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^116qCZ25]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, using a comprehensive Mendelian randomisation study, we found little evidence for linear causal associations between genetic determinants of circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma, but we cannot rule out the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude. Our results, in combination with previous literature, provide evidence that population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency and subsequent widespread vitamin D supplementation should not currently be recommended as a strategy for primary cancer prevention.

### Influence of insulin-like growth factors on the strength of the relation of vitamin D and calcium intakes to mammographic breast density [^115Uynmc]. Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Diets with higher vitamin D and calcium contents were associated with lower mammographic breast density and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. Laboratory studies suggest that the actions of vitamin D, calcium, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) on human breast cancer cells are interrelated. We examined whether IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels could affect the strength of the association of vitamin D and calcium intakes with breast density.

Among 771 premenopausal women, breast density was measured by a computer-assisted method; vitamin D and calcium intakes by a food frequency questionnaire; and levels of plasma IGF-I and IGFBP-3 by ELISA methods. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations and interactions.

- **Results**: The negative associations of vitamin D or calcium intakes with breast density were stronger among women with IGF-I levels above the median (beta = -2.8, P = 0.002 and beta = -2.5, P = 0.002, respectively) compared with those with IGF-I levels below or equal to the median (beta = -0.8, P = 0.38 and beta = -1.1, P = 0.21; P(interaction) = 0.09 and 0.16, respectively). Similar results were observed within levels of IGFBP-3 (P(interaction) = 0.06 and 0.03, respectively).

This is the first study to report that the negative relation of vitamin D and calcium intakes with breast density may be seen primarily among women with high IGF-I or high IGFBP-3 levels. Our findings suggest that the IGF axis should be considered when evaluating the effects of vitamin D and calcium on breast density.

### Circulating vitamin C concentration and risk of cancers: a Mendelian randomization study [^112cZQZr]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

As circulating vitamin C was rarely measured in prospective cohort studies, most observational studies examined the preventative effects of vitamin C supplementation or dietary vitamin C against cancers. In a meta-analysis of 21 case-control and cohort studies, including 8,938 lung cancer cases, the risk of lung cancer decreased by 7% for every 100 mg/day increase in vitamin C intake among men. However, another pooled analysis of women from five prospective studies in the UK Dietary Cohort Consortium did not find evidence of a significant association between vitamin C intakes and breast cancer incidence. Observational studies also yielded controversial results for colorectal cancer. A pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies found that high (> 600 mg/day) versus low (≤ 100 mg/day) vitamin C intake was associated with a 19% lower risk of colon cancer, but no significant association was observed between vitamin C supplement use and colon cancer risk in a meta-analysis based on three studies conducted in Europe and the United States.

In the present study, we performed a more comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and RCTs, involving up to 1,992,894 participants to summarize the potential effect of vitamin C intake on several common site-specific cancers. Our findings also support the aforementioned beneficial association of dietary vitamin C with lung cancer and null findings for breast cancer or colon cancer. However, only dietary vitamin C, not supplemental vitamin C intake, exhibits a potential protective association with lung cancer.

### The role of vitamin D in reducing cancer risk and progression [^111W9PYo]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

### Vitamin D and calcium intakes and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women [^115wxK3T]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Some evidence suggests that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer risk. Despite the biological interaction between vitamin D and calcium, few studies have evaluated their joint effects on breast cancer risk.

- **Objective**: The objective was to evaluate the associations and potential interaction between vitamin D and calcium (from food and supplements) and breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study.

- **Design**: Breast cancer cases aged 25–74 years (diagnosed 2002–2003) were identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry. Controls were identified by using random digit dialing; 3,101 cases and 3,471 controls completed epidemiologic and food-frequency questionnaires. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using multivariate logistic regression.

- **Results**: Vitamin D and calcium intakes from food only and total combined intakes (food and supplements) were not associated with breast cancer risk, although the mean intake of vitamin D was low. Vitamin D supplement intake of more than 10 micrograms per day (400 IU/d) compared with no intake was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98). No categories of calcium supplement intake were significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but a significant inverse trend was observed (P = 0.04). There were no significant interactions involving vitamin D, calcium, or menopausal status.

- **Conclusions**: No associations were found between overall vitamin D or calcium intake and breast cancer risk. Vitamin D from supplements was independently associated with reduced breast cancer risk.

### The relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer incidence and natural history [^112gtJQv]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

The endocrine action of vitamin D and its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health are well known. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzyme system as the kidney, allowing for local manufacture of active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 1,25(OH)₂D) from circulating precursors 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], suggests an autocrine role for vitamin D as well. Preclinical and ecologic studies support a role for vitamin D in the prevention of breast cancer. Correlative study results regarding vitamin D intake or measurement of 25(OH)D, the long-lived precursor, are mixed but suggest a protective effect in premenopausal women. The large Women's Health Initiative failed to show any reduction in breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women with a modest amount of vitamin D supplementation; lack of effect, however, may have been related to trial design. A recent report also suggests that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortality. Finally, vitamin D is being investigated as a means to reduce aromatase inhibitor-induced joint symptoms.

### Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of breast cancer in women followed over 20 years [^113Xpedf]. Cancer Research (2016). High credibility.

Experimental evidence supports a protective role of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in breast carcinogenesis, but epidemiologic evidence is inconsistent. Whether plasma 25(OH)D interacts with breast tumor expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor-α (RXR) has not been investigated. We conducted a nested case-control study in the Nurses' Health Study, with 1,506 invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed after blood donation in 1989–1990, 417 of whom donated a second sample in 2000–2002.

- **VDR and RXR expression**: Assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tumor microarrays (n = 669 cases). Multivariate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Plasma 25(OH)D levels were not associated with breast cancer risk overall [top (≥ 32.7 ng/mL) vs. bottom (< 17.2 ng/mL) quintile RR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67–1.13; P trend = 0.21].

- **Summer vs. winter levels**: 25(OH)D measured in summer (May-October) was significantly inversely associated with risk (top vs. bottom quintile RR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46–0.94; P trend = 0.01); winter levels (November-April) were not (RR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.75–1.60; P trend = 0.64; P interaction = 0.03).

- **Stromal nuclear VDR expression**: 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with risk of tumors with high expression of stromal nuclear VDR [≥ 30 ng/mL vs. < 30 ng/mL RR (95% CI): VDR ≥ median = 0.67 (0.48–0.93); VDR < median = 0.98 (0.72–1.35), P heterogeneity = 0.12] and significantly stronger for summer measures (P heterogeneity = 0.01).

Associations were not significantly different by RXR expression. No overall association was observed between plasma 25(OH)D levels and breast cancer risk across all expressions.

### Vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer improves pathological complete response: A prospective randomized clinical trial [^113TWC6X]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Patients and methods**: Female patients with primary breast cancer, aged ≥ 18 years, who received neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) between June 2019 and June 2023 at İstanbul Florence Nightingale Hospital, were included in the study. The eligibility criteria required that their vitamin D levels be analyzed both before and after NST. Participants consented to the study and continued their follow-up from the start of NST to the final surgery. They were randomized into two groups: the vitamin D intake group (n = 114) and the control group (no vitamin D intake, n = 113), following a 1:1 allocation. The primary surgeon generated a random allocation sequence, enrolled participants, and assigned them to interventions. Patients with comorbidities affecting serum vitamin D levels, those who were pregnant or lactating, and those over 80 years of age were excluded. Patient records were collected and analyzed prospectively.

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: The study cohort received an oral form of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) replacement once a week during chemotherapy. Serum vitamin D levels, expressed as 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), were analyzed before the initiation and after the final dose of NST in the same institution using routinely calibrated equipment. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, vitamin D levels were defined as deficient (< 20 ng/mL), insufficient (≥ 20 – < 30 ng/mL), normal (≥ 30 – < 100 ng/mL), and hypervitaminosis (≥ 100 ng/mL).

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in early and advanced breast cancer [^114iXNVe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory and epidemiological studies have implicated vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D) promotes differentiation and apoptosis, and it potently inhibits the proliferation of malignant breast epithelial cells in culture. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D are higher in normal women than in patients with primary breast cancer.

- **Aim**: To clarify the role of vitamin D in breast cancer progression by comparing the levels of serum vitamin D in patients with early and advanced breast cancer.

- **Methods**: Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium were measured prospectively in 279 Caucasian women with invasive breast cancer; 204 women with early-stage disease and 75 women with locally advanced or metastatic disease.

- **Results**: Patients with early-stage breast cancer had significantly higher circulating levels of 25(OH)D (p < 0.005) and significantly lower PTH (p < 0.001) levels than those with advanced disease. Calcium levels did not differ significantly (p = 0.74).

- **Conclusion**: Serum levels of 25(OH)D are significantly higher in patients with early-stage breast cancer than in those with locally advanced or metastatic disease.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^116UAna3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

We observed strong inverse associations between daylight hours spent outdoors and the risk of all breast cancer subtypes. This observation aligns with previous ecological studies, which repeatedly found an inverse correlation between UV exposure and breast cancer risk in the United States. Prospective investigations conducted in the United States also found that increased sunlight exposure was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. These studies were conducted among primarily white women, who can be more efficient at producing vitamin D due to light skin pigmentation. They reported similar or less time spent outside in daylight compared with the black women enrolled in our study.

Studies conducted among European women living at high latitudes did not observe such associations, suggesting that the vitamin D concentrations necessary to reduce breast cancer risk may be difficult to achieve through skin synthesis in regions with low solar radiance. We found similar results for sunlight exposure in summer and other seasons combined. This could be explained by errors in reporting (some women may not accurately separate exposure in summer from other seasons) or the storage of vitamin D in adipose tissue, which potentially extends its effects accumulated through summer to other seasons.

A low amount of sun exposure may also reflect disrupted daily (circadian) rhythms, which may induce breast carcinogenesis by altering endocrine timing. However, excluding women who had shift work did not change our results. Physical activity was considered a confounding factor, but we…

### Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration and total cancer incidence and mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sD1CS]. Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on the association of 25(OH)D with total cancer incidence and mortality, relevant longitudinal observational studies were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. Due to the heterogeneity across studies in categorizing 25(OH)D concentration, all results were recalculated for an increase of 25(OH)D by 50 nmol/L.

In meta-analyses with random effects models, the summary risk ratios and confidence intervals (RRs (95% CI)) for the association of an increase of 25(OH)D by 50 nmol/L with total cancer incidence (5 studies) and mortality (13 studies) were 0.89 (0.81, 0.97) and 0.83 (0.71, 0.96), respectively. In sex-specific analyses, no significant association with total cancer incidence was observed among men or women. A clear inverse association with total cancer mortality was observed among women (0.76 (0.60, 0.98)) but not among men (0.92 (0.65, 1.32)). Large heterogeneity was observed for studies on total cancer mortality (P < 0.01) but not for studies on cancer incidence (P = 0.41). No publication bias was found.

The meta-analysis suggests a moderate inverse association of 25(OH)D concentration with total cancer incidence and mortality.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of cancer in adults [^116VfQDV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing cancers is contradictory.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of cancer in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science up to February 2014. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and consulted experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults who were healthy or recruited from the general population, or diagnosed with a specific disease. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol)), or as an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). We considered the risk of bias to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors.

- **Main results**: Eighteen randomized trials with 50,623 participants provided data for the analyses. All trials originated from high-income countries.

### Low pretreatment serum concentration of vitamin D at breast cancer diagnosis in postmenopausal women [^1137Eu4U]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for low pretreatment vitamin D (VitD) levels in postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) women, compared with postmenopausal women without BC.

A cross-sectional clinical study was conducted to compare 209 women with BC (case group) to 418 women without BC (control group), age range: 45 to 75 years. The case group consisted of women diagnosed with BC, amenorrhea ≥ 12 months, aged ≥ 45 years, without use of medication or clinical conditions that might interfere with VitD levels. The control group consisted of women with amenorrhea ≥ 12 months, aged ≥ 45 years, without BC. The groups were matched for age and time since menopause, at a case: control ratio of 1:2. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] concentration was measured in all women 10 to 20 days after BC diagnosis and before the proposed treatment. Serum levels ≥ 30 ng/mL were defined as sufficient. The Student's t-test or gamma distribution, χ test, and logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) were used for statistical analysis.

The BC group had a higher body mass index (BMI) and higher percentage of obesity than the control group (57.4% vs 40.2%, P < 0.0001). In addition, rates of insufficient (20–29 ng/mL) and deficient (< 20 ng/mL) 25(OH)D levels were higher in BC patients than in controls (55.6% vs 49.3%, P = 0.039 and 26.2% vs 20.3%, P = 0.018), respectively. In risk analysis (adjusted for age, time since menopause, and BMI), BC patients had a 1.5-fold higher risk of developing low VitD levels (OR = 1.52, 95% CI, 1.04–2.22, P = 0.029) than women without BC.

### Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study [^116JuRws]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if circulating concentrations of vitamin D are causally associated with the risk of cancer. It was designed as a Mendelian randomization study and involved large genetic epidemiology networks, including the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), the Genetic and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortiums, and the MR-Base platform.

- **Participants**: The study included 70,563 cases of cancer and 84,418 controls, with specific cancer cases as follows:
	- **Prostate cancer**: 22,898 cases
	- **Breast cancer**: 15,748 cases
	- **Lung cancer**: 12,537 cases
	- **Colorectal cancer**: 11,488 cases
	- **Ovarian cancer**: 4,369 cases
	- **Pancreatic cancer**: 1,896 cases
	- **Neuroblastoma**: 1,627 cases

- **Exposures**: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with vitamin D — rs2282679, rs10741657, rs12785878, and rs6013897 — were used to define a multi-polymorphism score for circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations.

- **Main outcomes measures**:
	- **Primary outcomes**: The risk of incident colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma was evaluated using an inverse variance weighted average of the associations with specific polymorphisms and a likelihood-based approach.
	- **Secondary outcomes**: Cancer subtypes were examined by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology.

- **Results**: There was little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with the risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations were 0.92.

### Vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation for prevention of cancer and fractures: An updated meta-analysis for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115DCagW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may reduce cancer and fracture risks.

- **Purpose**: To examine the benefits and harms of vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation on clinical outcomes of cancer and fractures in adults.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies identified from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 2011.

- **Study selection**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and nested case-control studies reporting incidence of or death from cancer and fracture outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: Multiple reviewers extracted details about participant characteristics, including baseline vitamin D status and use of supplements; details of statistical analyses, including adjustments for confounding; and methodological quality. Differences were resolved by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Nineteen RCTs (three for cancer and sixteen for fracture outcomes) and twenty-eight observational studies (for cancer outcomes) were analyzed. Limited data from RCTs suggested that high-dose (1000 IU/d) vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk for total cancer, and data from observational studies suggested that higher blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) concentrations might be associated with increased risk for cancer. Mixed-effects dose-response meta-analyses showed each 10-nmol/L increase in blood 25-(OH)D concentration was associated with a 6% (95% CI, 3% to 9%) reduced risk for colorectal cancer but no statistically significant dose-response relationships for prostate and breast cancer.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^114XFmbd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that vitamin D levels were prognostic in all patients with breast cancer, but the concentration was not significantly prognostic in patients with triple-negative and Her2/neu-enriched subtypes. One plausible explanation is that vitamin D acts synergistically to suppress the effects of estrogen in patients with luminal-type breast cancer. The antiproliferative and antitumor effects of vitamin D on estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells are mediated by the disruption of estrogen mitogenic and survival signals.

- **Vitamin D receptor element**: A potential vitamin D receptor element has been identified within the ER promoter gene, suggesting that 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ may directly regulate ER gene transcription.

- **Effects on prostaglandins and aromatase**: Vitamin D reduces the expression and biological activity of prostaglandins and decreases the synthesis of aromatase, in addition to suppressing the proliferative activity of 17ß-estradiol and downregulating the level of the estrogen receptor.

- **Influence on hormone levels**: Moreover, higher concentrations of 25-(OH)D have been shown to significantly lower serum luteal progesterone and estrogen levels. This may represent a mechanism by which higher 25-(OH)D levels in young women may reduce subsequent breast cancer risk.

Furthermore, sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)D₃ is generally higher in breast cancer cells that express estrogen receptors than in cells that do not synthesize the protein.

### Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer [^117HpNz5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has been associated with breast cancer metastasis and drug response. It has been shown to inhibit invasion and metastasis by reducing the activity of MMP-9, UPA, and TPA, and by increasing the levels of PA inhibitor 1, MMP inhibitor 1, and general antiangiogenic activity. Moreover, 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to several anticancer drugs and other agents. Vitamin D compounds have been demonstrated to potentiate apoptosis induced by adriamycin, Taxol, radiation, and tamoxifen. These findings indicate that maintenance of adequate vitamin D concentrations during adjuvant treatment may enhance the effects of such treatment and prolong survival.

We found that patients with vitamin D deficiency developed significantly more frequent second primary cancers than did patients with sufficient vitamin D concentration. Vitamin D deficiency also has been associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as colon, prostate, ovarian, breast, and other cancers. Secondary cancers are among the most threatening long-term health problems in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, some breast cancer treatment regimens are associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, which also can be caused by vitamin D deficiency. Such deficiency has been associated with an increased level of depression and overall mortality in the general population. Therefore, correction of vitamin D status may be important not only for survival but to improve quality of life in patients with breast cancer.

### Does vitamin D reduce the risk of dementia [^111WKCdL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding of the role of vitamin D in maintaining optimal health has advanced sharply in the past two decades. There is mounting evidence for beneficial roles for vitamin D in reducing the risk of bone diseases and fractures, many types of cancer, bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, several reports have also been published regarding the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection.

This article develops the hypothesis that vitamin D can reduce the risk of developing dementia, presenting the evidence from observational and laboratory studies. The observational evidence includes that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, dental caries, osteoporosis, and periodontal disease, all of which are either considered risk factors for dementia or have preceded the incidence of dementia.

The laboratory evidence includes several findings on the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection and reducing inflammation. Although this evidence is supportive, there do not appear to be observational studies of incidence of dementia concerning prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D or vitamin D supplementation. Such studies now appear to be warranted.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, the ES 2024 guidelines recommend considering empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. This approach may potentially lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality.

### Intake of vitamin D and calcium, sun exposure, and risk of breast cancer subtypes among black women [^114g4n7u]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Because vitamin D is the precursor to the steroid hormone calcitriol, several specific mechanisms in regulating ER+ development have been proposed. These include inhibiting estrogen synthesis in breast cancer cells or surrounding adipose tissue and downregulating ER in breast cancer cells to inhibit estrogen signaling. Vitamin D may also play a role in pathways against more aggressive breast cancer subtypes. In addition to ER+ cells, vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are also present in ER− cells, including two-thirds of TNBC. Acting on VDRs, vitamin D compounds could trigger growth arrest and apoptosis via estrogen-independent mechanisms and inhibit the expression of several myoepithelial markers associated with more aggressive breast cancers.

Black women are more likely to develop ER− and TNBC than white women, but few studies have investigated the role of vitamin D on the risk of breast cancer subtypes among them. In the BWHS, dietary vitamin D or calcium intake was not associated with the risk of ER+ or ER− disease, which is consistent with our observations. Supplemental vitamin D intake and sun exposure were not evaluated. To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 concentration) in relation to TNBC among black women, finding a significant inverse association, which supports our observations. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution because blood samples in the previous study were collected at the time of diagnosis, and more studies among this minority group are needed.

We recognize the potential of recall bias.

	- **Secondary outcomes**: Cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology

- **Results**: Findings indicated:
	- Little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with the risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes
	- Odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations showed no significant association
