## Question

What does 100 mg/dl protein in urine mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what 100 mg/dL protein in urine means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unit and whether this is a dipstick semiquantitative result or a laboratory concentration. Then, I should verify how 100 mg/dL maps to dipstick categories and what that implies for daily protein excretion. Next, I will consider clinical significance across contexts such as general adult medicine, pregnancy, pediatrics, and diabetes. After that, I need to check for confounders and confirmatory testing strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical interpretation and next steps, making sure I cite the right guidelines and studies at each step.

> Let me first confirm the unit and context. 100 mg/dL corresponds to 1,000 mg/L, and in urinalysis reporting, this aligns with a dipstick reading of 2+ protein, which spans approximately 100 to less than 300 mg/dL, indicating moderate proteinuria on a semiquantitative scale [^906efed3] [^a71e8fb5].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative translation to daily excretion. A spot protein-to-creatinine ratio around 1.0 roughly approximates 1 g of protein per day, so 100 mg/dL on dipstick in a moderately concentrated urine often corresponds to roughly 0.5–1.5 g/day, though this is an estimate and depends on urine concentration and creatinine excretion. I should confirm with a proper ratio or timed collection when it matters clinically [^79980d5f] [^1788b93c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without context. In general adult medicine, proteinuria above 150 mg/day is abnormal, so 100 mg/dL on dipstick is clearly abnormal and warrants confirmation and evaluation for causes such as CKD, diabetes, hypertension, or glomerular disease. Importantly, it is below nephrotic-range thresholds, which typically begin around 3.5 g/day in adults, though the exact threshold varies by guideline and disease context [^79980d5f] [^c692d778].

> I need to check pregnancy-specific interpretation. In pregnancy, significant proteinuria for preeclampsia is defined as ≥ 300 mg/24 h or a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3, so 100 mg/dL on dipstick is below diagnostic thresholds but still abnormal and should prompt confirmation with a protein-to-creatinine ratio rather than relying on dipstick alone, given poor diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks in this setting [^08ed5a63] [^f2ecc5bb] [^2adeea90].

> Let me consider pediatrics. In children, nephrotic-range proteinuria is typically defined as a first-morning protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/mmol (about 2 g/g) or proteinuria ≥ 1,000 mg/m²/day, so 100 mg/dL on dipstick is abnormal but not nephrotic-range. It still warrants confirmation and follow-up to exclude transient or orthostatic causes and to assess for underlying kidney disease [^dca68677] [^906efed3].

> I should confirm diabetes-related implications. In diabetes, any detectable albuminuria is clinically meaningful, and 100 mg/dL total protein on dipstick likely reflects albumin-predominant proteinuria that exceeds microalbuminuria thresholds, indicating established kidney involvement and higher cardiovascular risk. Guidelines recommend confirming with ACR and integrating with eGFR for CKD staging and risk stratification [^f19793e2] [^8b89a32e].

> But wait, what if this is a false positive or influenced by urine concentration. Dipstick total protein is semiquantitative, affected by urine specific gravity, and can miss nonalbumin proteins or give false positives with concentrated urine. I should double-check with a laboratory protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, preferably on a first-morning sample, and repeat testing if transient contributors are suspected such as exercise, infection, menstruation, or dehydration [^661cacf2] [^395a5328] [^824fb5ea].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing strategy. If the dipstick shows 2+ protein, I should obtain a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and if the clinical stakes are high or results are discordant, proceed to a 24-hour collection to quantify total protein. I need to ensure I interpret results in light of factors that alter creatinine excretion and thus ratios, including sex, body size, diet, and acute kidney injury [^1788b93c] [^824fb5ea] [^6697483a].

> Let me synthesize the clinical meaning. 100 mg/dL protein on urinalysis is abnormal and indicates moderate proteinuria, most often reflecting increased glomerular permeability rather than tubular or overflow proteinuria. It is not nephrotic-range in adults but is clinically significant and associated with higher risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, so I should confirm with a ratio, assess eGFR, evaluate for diabetes, hypertension, and other systemic causes, and consider nephrology referral if proteinuria persists or is accompanied by hematuria, reduced eGFR, or systemic features [^2a4569b4] [^f19793e2] [^817bb16a].

> I should double-check the immediate next steps. Repeat urinalysis with a first-morning sample, obtain a spot protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, check serum creatinine and eGFR, review history for diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disease, and medications, and if confirmed, initiate risk-factor modification including blood pressure control, glycemic optimization if diabetic, and consider ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy when indicated, with closer surveillance if proteinuria exceeds 1 g/day or if CKD is advanced [^f19793e2] [^8b89a32e] [^e60a7017].

Urine protein at 100 mg/dL corresponds to **2+ on dipstick** [^906efed3] and indicates **moderate proteinuria** [^a71e8fb5], which is abnormal and warrants evaluation. Confirm with a **urine protein-to-creatinine ratio** or **24-hour collection** [^395a5328] [^e46b325f], then assess for causes such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, or infection [^817bb16a]. Persistent 2+ proteinuria increases risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^2a4569b4], so monitor and treat underlying conditions [^e60a7017].

## Clinical significance of 100 mg/dl protein in urine

- **Definition**: 100 mg/dL protein in urine corresponds to a dipstick reading of 2+ [^906efed3], indicating moderate proteinuria [^a71e8fb5].
- **Normal range**: Normal urine protein excretion is < 150 mg per 24 hours [^79980d5f]; thus, 100 mg/dL is significantly elevated.
- **Clinical implications**: Moderate proteinuria is abnormal and suggests underlying kidney dysfunction or systemic disease [^817bb16a].

---

## Possible causes of 100 mg/dl proteinuria

Several **conditions** can cause moderate proteinuria:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Renal diseases | - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Interstitial nephritis <br/> - Polycystic kidney disease [^notfound] |
| Systemic diseases | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <br/> - Multiple myeloma [^notfound] |
| Transient causes | - Fever <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Stress <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Urinary tract infection [^824fb5ea] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When moderate proteinuria is detected, **confirm and quantify** it and identify the cause:

- **Confirmatory tests**: Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) or 24-hour urine collection [^395a5328] [^e46b325f].
- **Blood tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, blood glucose, electrolytes, and autoimmune panels (e.g. ANA, anti-dsDNA) [^f8e886b5].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound to assess kidney structure and size [^bfc530ae].
- **Additional tests**: Depending on clinical suspicion, consider serum protein electrophoresis, hepatitis serologies, or HIV testing [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Persistent moderate proteinuria is associated with:

- **Progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Increased risk of CKD progression and kidney failure [^2a4569b4] [^6d001dd6].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [^2a4569b4] [^8b89a32e].
- **Nephrotic syndrome**: May indicate underlying glomerular disease requiring specific treatment [^c692d778].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Treat underlying conditions**: Optimize blood pressure control, glycemic control in diabetes, and manage systemic diseases [^2a4569b4].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Salt restriction, weight management, and smoking cessation [^2a4569b4].
- **Medications**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed to reduce proteinuria and protect kidney function [^8b89a32e].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up with urine protein quantification, blood pressure, and renal function tests [^01e1144f].

---

## When to refer to a nephrologist

Referral to a nephrologist is indicated if:

- **Persistent proteinuria**: Confirmed moderate proteinuria persisting beyond 3 months [^notfound].
- **Declining renal function**: Decreasing eGFR or rising serum creatinine [^3a7d528b].
- **Suspected glomerular disease**: Presence of hematuria, edema, or systemic symptoms [^3a7d528b].
- **Nephrotic-range proteinuria**: Protein excretion > 3.5 g per 24 hours [^c692d778].

---

Urine protein at 100 mg/dL (2+ dipstick) indicates **moderate proteinuria** and is abnormal; confirm with UPCR or 24-hour collection, identify the cause, and manage to reduce the risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^395a5328] [^2a4569b4].

### The significance of trace proteinuria [^304e8611]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of a trace protein reading on urinalysis is unclear, and such a result is often ignored by the clinician.

Methods

We examined 185 samples of urine with trace proteinuria by both Chemstrips and sulfosalicylic acid testing, and compared the results with those of urinary albumin and total protein concentrations.

Results

Taking for the purposes of this study an arbitrary upper limit of normal of 20 mg/l for albumin and 100 mg/l for total protein concentration, we found abnormal albumin excretion in 87% and abnormal total protein excretion in 88% of trace samples. In this study, a negative urinalysis for protein excluded microalbuminuria in 87% and proteinuria in 78% of cases.

Conclusion

Qualitative testing for protein by urinalysis has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing or ruling out microalbuminuria. Trace proteinuria usually means microalbuminuria; negative proteinuria tends to rule it out.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^d9ef2a4b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^f77e1997]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — urine albumin versus total protein measurement notes limitations and variability. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measurement with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric (effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to be missed, and the significance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations, most laboratories currently use either turbidimetry or colorimetry to measure total protein, and these methods do not give equal analytical specificity and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency to react more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other non-albumin proteins, and many have significant interferences causing falsely high results. There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement, and the variety of methods and calibrants in use means that there is inevitably significant between-laboratory variation.

### Interpreting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy: the need for a more pathophysiological approach [^9ceed91b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

This review and opinion article focuses on the definitions and meanings of abnormal protein excretion in pregnancy, asking the following questions: Are our tests to determine abnormal proteinuria adequately performed? Are current guidelines for diagnosis of excessive proteinuria, especially when used to identify preeclampsia, supported by adequate data? Can the magnitude of proteinuria be used as a reliable clinical biomarker of the gravity of preeclampsia? Should timed urine collections, primarily 24-hour excretions, be supplanted by the urine protein/creatinine ratio in clinical practice? The answers to most of these questions are: We are not sure, or some guidelines are poorly supported by data and may prove erroneous. We suggest a more physiologic approach to assessment of proteinuria and believe that if clinicians and investigators looked at proteinuria in terms of how the kidney handles protein in health and disease it would lead to a more rational and evidence-based approach to proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, we recommend that current cutoff for abnormal proteinuria be used to diagnose preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria should not guide management. Other variables, such as status of blood pressure control, evidence of increasing organ damage in the liver and hematological systems, evidence of falling glomerular filtration rate, and signs of neurological involvement, are more reliable indicators of severity of preeclampsia.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^860ad84a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — result confirmation and accurate quantification: There is biological and analytical variability in urine albumin and urine protein loss, and all of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression; thus, positive tests should be confirmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss, and if a more accurate quantification of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions as recommended above.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^65a417ee]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^52d4a9f4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Urinary protein dipstick screening as an alternative when SCr is unavailable: The CI-AKI Consensus Working Panel supported the use of dipstick testing for urine protein as a rapid screen to identify patients who can undergo studies requiring contrast media without serum creatinine (SCr) measurement; of 310 patients with a negative urine protein test and no history of diseases potentially associated with renal impairment, none had a SCr level > 2.0 mg/dl (> 177 μmol/l), and only 1% had a level > 1.7 mg/dl (> 150 μmol/l). Thus, the Work Group recommends that, when a recent SCr is not available, a simple questionnaire or a dipstick testing for urine protein may be useful for identifying pre-existing kidney disease.

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — hematologic response and progression criteria define complete response as normalization of the FLC levels and ratio and negative serum and urine immunofixation; very good partial response as reduction in the dFLC to < 40 mg/L; partial response as a greater than 50% reduction in the dFLC; and no response as less than a PR. Progression is defined by any of the following: from CR, any detectable monoclonal protein or abnormal FLC ratio (light chain must double); from PR, 50% increase in serum M protein to > 0.5 g/dL or 50% increase in urine M protein to > 200 mg/d (a visible peak must be present); or serum-FLC increase of 50% to > 100 mg/L. When FLC ratio is not within the reference range, the uninvolved FLC concentration must be greater than the involved FLC concentration.

### Proteinuria as a therapeutic target in patients with chronic kidney disease [^e60a7017]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients excreting large amounts of urinary protein, who are otherwise deemed to be optimally treated, should still be considered at high risk for renal disease progression. The observation that reductions in urinary protein excretion, in a graded fashion over a relatively short period of time, correlate with long-term preservation of renal function supports the idea of using urinary protein excretion as a guide to implementation of renoprotective therapies. The association between residual proteinuria and renal outcomes suggests that minimization of proteinuria is an important therapeutic goal in the management of proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients. This article reviews the evidence for using proteinuria as a target for the implementation of therapies shown to have renal protective effects.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of LUPUS NEPHRITIS [^9d53fdea]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome in children — definitions and urine protein thresholds specify that nephrotic-range proteinuria is urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 g/g) or proteinuria ≥ 1000 mg/m2 per day, corresponding to dipstick 3+ (300–1000 mg/dl) or 4+ (≥ 1000 mg/dl). Nephrotic syndrome requires nephrotic-range proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia defined as serum albumin < 30 g/l (3 g/dl) or edema when albumin level is not available. Relapse is recurrence of nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as dipstick ≥ 3+ for 3 consecutive days. Dipstick categories are Negative: 0 to < 15 mg/dl; Trace: 15 to < 30 mg/dl; 1+: 30 to < 100 mg/dl; 2+: 100 to < 300 mg/dl; 3+: 300 to < 1000 mg/dl; and 4+: ≥ 1000 mg/dl. To rule out orthostatic proteinuria, the first morning urine should be collected separately for assessment.

### Contemporary test performance of the random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [^92ae0fe7]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a screening test used for predicting clinically significant proteinuria (urine protein ≥ 300mg) during pregnancy. No consensus exists on the optimal random UPCR cutoff for performing follow-up 24 hour urine (24H) total protein collection. We aim to evaluate the test performance of random UPCR in predicting proteinuria in a contemporary cohort.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients at our institution from 2014 to 2018 with a random UPCR and follow-up 24H protein collection. The primary analysis estimated the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of using random UPCR for the detection of proteinuria defined as urine protein ≥ 300mg on 24H protein collection. UPCR cutoffs from 0.10 to 0.30mg/dL were evaluated, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and area under the curve (AUC) was determined. A secondary analysis examined the correlation between UPCR and 24H protein using least squares regression and Pearson correlation.

Results

Paired UPCR and 24H collection results were available for 1,120 patients. Mean gestational age at time of UPCR was 31.1 ± 5.1 weeks and 687 (61.3%) of patients had a 24H ≥ 300mg. UPCR < 0.10mg/dL effectively excluded proteinuria ≥ 300mg on 24H collection, while UPCR ≥ 0.18mg/dL correctly classifies proteinuria with 91% sensitivity, 57% specificity, 77% positive predictive value, and 79% negative predictive value. UPCR ≥ 1.07mg/dL had 100% specificity for 24 hour proteinuria. The area under ROC curve was 0.86. UPCR and 24H collection were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85. After our institution lowered the threshold to obtain a 24H from UPCR ≥ 0.20mg/dL to ≥ 0.10mg/dL in May 2017, the percentage of patients meeting criteria for 24H collection increased from 57.8 to 84.4%.

Conclusion

The AUC and Pearson correlation suggest random UPCR is a high performance test for the prediction of proteinuria on 24H. Optimal test performance is dependent upon clinical consideration and upon the implications of the disease or condition. A random UPCR screen positive threshold of 0.18mg/dL maximizes sensitivity to identify clinically significant proteinuria.

Key Points

· Random urine protein to creatinine ratio is a high performance test for proteinuria. · A random UPCR threshold of 0.18mg/dL maximizes sensitivity to identify proteinuria. · Optimal test performance is dependent on the disease or clinical condition.

### The role of bone marrow biopsy in patients with plasma cell disorders: should all patients with a monoclonal protein be biopsied? [^a114cbda]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

To better categorize the critical role of the BM in establishing the diagnosis we categorized patients with MM into two groups based on testing parameters for CRAB and the presence of serum immunoglobulin free light chain ratio (FLCr) of ≥ 100 and involved FLC level ≥ 100). MM patients classified as "without CRAB/FLC" had laboratory values within reference range for calcium, creatinine, hemoglobin, and absence of lytic lesions assessed by conventional skeletal survey and FLCr < 100. This is contrasting to the IMWG diagnostic criteria for CRAB features (anemia > 2 g/dL below normal or < 10 g/dL, hypercalcemia > 1 mg/dL higher than normal or > 11 mg/dL, and renal insufficiency with creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or creatinine of > 2 mg/dL), since abnormalities outside of these stringent diagnostic criteria are likely to serve as triggers for further investigation in a patient with a monoclonal gammopathy. Those "with CRAB/FLC" had an abnormality detected in at least one of these variables. In patients without CRAB, chart rereview was conducted to further clarify the criteria used to establish the diagnosis of MM.

Patients with SMM were categorized based on serum M-protein and urine M-protein levels. Those SMM patients with a serum M-protein of ≥ 3 g/dL or urinary M-protein ≥ 500 mg per 24 h were classified as "MM-like" with the remaining patients classified as "MGUS-like." Patients without data on the serum M-protein at time of diagnosis of SMM were excluded from this categorization.

Descriptive statistics with median, interquartile range (IQR), and range were used for continuous variables and proportions (%) for categorical variables. The Pearson χ 2 and Fisher's exact test were used to compare categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed on JMP software (SAS, Cary, NC).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^70b2b889]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric proteinuria and albuminuria thresholds — In term and preterm neonates, protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) is high early in life, with "PCR 1000–3000 mg/g [100–300 mg/mmol]". For infants aged 6 months to 2 years, "a PCR of < 500 mg/g (< 50 mg/mmol) (or a 24-hour protein of < 150 mg/m2/d) is considered normal." For children over 2 years, normal is "a first morning urine PCR of < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) protein, or < 150 mg/m2/d, or a first morning urine ACR < 30 mg/g (< 3 mg/mmol)." First morning sampling and recognition of transient increases during illness or exercise apply to pediatrics, and orthostatic proteinuria affects adolescents, as "Orthostatic proteinuria is estimated to affect 2%–5% of adolescents." For diabetes screening in children, "ACR remains the standard."

### Cardiovascular implications of proteinuria: an indicator of chronic kidney disease [^2a4569b4]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria, defined as urine protein excretion greater than 300 mg over 24 h, is a strong and independent predictor of increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Proteinuria is a sign of persistent dysfunction of the glomerular barrier and often precedes any detectable decline in renal filtration function. Measurement of proteinuria is important in stratifying the risk for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease progression. A variety of basic pathophysiologic mechanisms that can partially explain simultaneous renal and cardiac disease will be discussed in this Review. In addition to being a prognostic marker, proteinuria is being considered as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular medicine. Therapeutic strategies for amelioration of proteinuria by achieving blood pressure targets, glycemic control in diabetes, treatment of hyperlipidemia, and reducing dietary salt and protein intake are also reviewed in this paper. Future clinical studies are needed to assess if proteinuria reduction should be a target of treatment to reduce the burden of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and improve survival in this high-risk population.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^e46b325f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Urinalysis vs urine protein-creatinine ratio to predict significant proteinuria in pregnancy [^64d033ab]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the urine protein-creatinine ratio with urinalysis to predict significant proteinuria (≥ 300 mg per day).

Study Design

A total of 116 paired spot urine samples and 24-h urine collections were obtained prospectively from women at risk for preeclampsia. Urine protein-creatinine ratio and urinalysis were compared to the 24-h urine collection.

Result

The urine protein-creatinine ratio had better discriminatory power than urinalysis: the receiver operating characteristic curve had a greater area under the curve, 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.95) vs 0.71 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.77, P < 0.001). When matched for clinically relevant specificity, urine protein-creatinine ratio (cutoff ≥ 0.28) is more sensitive than urinalysis (cutoff ≥ 1+): 66 vs 41%, P = 0.001 (with 95 and 100% specificity, respectively). Furthermore, the urine protein-creatinine ratio predicted the absence or presence of proteinuria in 64% of patients; urinalysis predicted this in only 19%.

Conclusion

The urine protein-creatinine ratio is a better screening test. It provides early information for more patients.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^f4ab8797]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Standardised reporting and handling practices are crucial for ensuring consistent and reliable urine ACR results. Urine albumin concentration can be measured in various ways, including immunoturbidimetric, immunonephelometric and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) methods. Ideally, measurement should be traceable to an international standard, but this has not yet been fully implemented. Consequently, laboratory variability can exceed 40% due to methodological differences, significantly affecting result interpretation. Proper storage and handling are also essential to prevent albumin degradation and ensure accuracy in detecting and monitoring kidney disease. Fresh urine samples provide the most reliable results. If immediate analysis is not possible, albumin remains stable in urine stored at 2–8°C for up to 7 days. Prolonged storage at −20°C can lead to albumin loss, whereas samples stored at −80°C maintain stable albumin concentrations, albeit with slightly increased variability. Anyway, precipitates formed during refrigeration or freezing should be redissolved by warming samples to room temperature and mixing before analysis. Variability in laboratory methods continues to challenge consistent albuminuria classification and CKD risk stratification. Efforts are currently under way to develop certified reference materials and standardised measurement procedures, including the use of LC–MS/MS‐based candidate reference measurement procedures to improve consistency across laboratories. Until these reference systems become widely available, laboratories should participate in external quality assessment schemes for urine albumin, creatinine and ACR to ensure accurate and reliable testing.

3.2 Reference values

The reference values for albuminuria have evolved based on historical and practical considerations. Consensus on definitions using albumin excretion and concentrations emerged in the mid‐1990s, including the introduction of sex‐specific ACR cut‐offs. At that time, the most sensitive strips detected albuminuria at a threshold of 20 mg/L. The lower limit for microalbuminuria (30 mg/24 h) was derived by multiplying this threshold by an average daily urine output of 1.5 L. The upper limits of 200 mg/L and 300 mg/24 h reflected the sensitivity of earlier albumin sticks, which detected concentrations between 100 and 300 mg/L. These cut‐offs are therefore somewhat arbitrary, as they were not established through prospective studies to define optimal thresholds based on prevalence or prognostic significance.

### Proteinuria as a surrogate marker for renal outcome: are we there yet? [^ef9f8ead]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Observational studies in glomerular diseases suggest that proteinuria reduction translates to improved outcomes. Because of a dearth of high-quality studies supporting this association, proteinuria is not universally recognized as a surrogate end point. Barbour et al. report on the longitudinal measure of proteinuria that best predicts hard renal outcomes. Their finding that time-varying proteinuria is the most reliable proteinuria metric is a necessary step in establishing proteinuria as a surrogate end point.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^895268dc]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria assessment for living donor evaluation — measurement method and thresholds are recommended as follows: We recommend measurement of albumin rather than total protein, and albumin excretion rate (AER) in a timed urine collection rather than albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot specimen if possible. We recommend an AER threshold of less than 30 mg/d to routinely accept a donor candidate and an intermediate range of AER 30 to 100 mg/d in which to individualize decisions based on other risk factors. We acknowledge that AER of 30 to 100 mg/d meets the criteria for CKD, yet candidates have not been excluded solely on this basis. We do not require tests of total urine protein in addition to albumin because normal ranges for nonalbumin protein excretion are not accepted.

Analytical performance for urine albumin measurement — the guideline notes that methodology should be traceable to international standards, yet inter-laboratory differences may exceed 40%. It advises that urine albumin should be measured using immunological assays capable of specifically and precisely quantifying albumin at low concentrations and producing quantitative results over the clinically relevant range. Acknowledging variability, the document states the biological variation of urine albumin exceeds 60% and that target analytical variation (CV) should be based on an optimal level of < 0.25 biological variation, approximately 15%.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^2adeea90]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

Predonation albuminuria — evaluation and selection criteria state that donor proteinuria should be measured as albuminuria, not total urine protein; initial evaluation of donor albuminuria (screening) should be performed using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a random (untimed) urine specimen; donor albuminuria should be confirmed using albumin excretion rate (AER, mg/day [mg/d]) in a timed urine specimen, with repeat ACR if AER cannot be obtained; for selection, urine AER less than 30 mg/d should be considered an acceptable level for donation, the decision to approve donor candidates with AER 30 to 100 mg/d should be individualized based on demographic and health profile in relation to the transplant program's acceptable risk threshold, and donor candidates with urine AER greater than 100 mg/ d should not donate.

KDIGO 2024 — detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes initial testing and confirmation: Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD. Thus, initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^5c5ea512]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is also consensus, but insufficient evidence, that sub-nephrotic levels of proteinuria confer a risk of thrombosis although the threshold level of proteinuria at which the risk of VTE is clinically significant remains unknown. Consequently, thromboprophylaxis in women with CKD varies across the UK and internationally. There are anecdotal data that regions with a higher threshold for thromboprophylaxis do not report many/any thrombotic events attributable to proteinuria alone. In contrast, clinicians with a lower threshold for recommending thromboprophylaxis accept the compromise that maternal morbidity and mortality from thrombosis justifies the number needed to treat. In the light of this uncertainty, the guideline committee suggest that non-nephrotic range proteinuria (uPCR > 100 mg/mmol or uACR > 30 mg/mmol) be considered a risk factor for thrombosis and thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin be offered in the presence of additional risk factors. Recognised risk factors include gestation, other medical comorbidity (including active lupus), age, BMI, parity, smoking, gross varicose veins, pre-eclampsia, assisted reproduction, operative delivery, post-partum haemorrhage, still-birth, hyperemesis, infection, and immobility. Renal disease aetiology, the trajectory of proteinuria and serum albumin concentrations may also inform the decision to offer thromboprophylaxis, although specific guidance on these factors is not possible due to insufficient evidence.

Fig. 1
Final decision tree model. RD denotes subsequently developing renal deterioration.

The final tree (Figure 1) has branch points that permit patient stratification into seven risk groups: minimum risk [urine protein < 100 mg/dL and the absence of mild haematuria (1–29 red blood cells/high-power field)], low risk 1 (urine protein < 100 mg/dL, the presence of mild haematuria and serum total protein ≥ 6.41 g/dL), low risk 2 (urine protein ≥ 100 mg/dL, serum albumin ≥ 3.95 g/dL and diastolic blood pressure < 74 mmHg), high risk 1 (urine protein < 100 mg/dL, the presence of mild haematuria and serum total protein < 6.41 g/dL), high risk 2 (urine protein ≥ 100 mg/dL, serum albumin ≥ 3.95 g/dL and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 74 mmHg), high risk 3 (urine protein ≥ 100 mg/dL, serum albumin < 3.95 g/dL and histological grade I or II) and very high risk (urine protein ≥ 100 mg/ dL, serum albumin < 3.95 g/dL and histological grade III or IV). Actual incidences of substantial renal deterioration were 1.0% (2 of 204 patients), 4.0% (10 of 252), 4.3% (3 of 70), 26.1% (6 of 23), 21.6% (16 of 74), 20.0% (7 of 35) and 51.4% (18 of 35) for the minimum-risk, low-risk 1, low-risk 2, high-risk 1, high-risk 2, high-risk 3 and very high-risk groups, respectively.

### Day-to-day variability in spot urine protein-creatinine ratio measurements [^565414f0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate measurement of proteinuria is important in the diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The reference standard test, 24-hour urinary protein excretion, is inconvenient and vulnerable to collection errors. Spot urine protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) is a convenient alternative and is in widespread use. However, day-to-day variability in PCR measurements has not been evaluated.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study of day-to-day variability in spot urine PCR measurement.

Setting & Participants

Clinically stable outpatients with CKD (n = 145) attending a university hospital CKD clinic in Australia between July 2007 and April 2010.

Index Test

Spot urine PCR.

Outcomes

Spot PCR variability was assessed and repeatability limits were determined using fractional polynomials.

Measurements

Spot PCRs were measured from urine samples collected at 9:00 am on consecutive days and 24-hour urinary protein excretion was collected concurrently.

Results

Paired results were analyzed from 145 patients: median age, 56 years; 59% men; and median 24-hour urinary protein excretion, 0.7 (range, 0.06–35.7) g/d. Day-to-day variability was substantial and increased in absolute terms, but decreased in relative terms with increasing baseline PCR. For patients with a low baseline PCR (20 mg/mmol [177 mg/g]), a change greater than ± 160% (repeatability limits, 0–52 mg/mmol [0–460 mg/g]) is required to indicate a real change in proteinuria status with 95% certainty, whereas for those with a high baseline PCR (200 mg/mmol [1,768 mg/g]), a change of ± 50% (decrease to < 100 mg/mmol [< 884 mg/g] or increase to > 300 mg/mmol [> 2,652 mg/g]) represents significant change.

Limitations

These study results need to be replicated in other ethnic groups.

Conclusions

Changes in PCR observed in patients with CKD, ranging from complete resolution to doubling of PCR values, could be due to inherent biological variation and may not indicate a change in disease status. This should be borne in mind when using PCR in the diagnosis and management of CKD.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of nephrotic syndrome in children [^dca68677]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to definitions, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following definitions in children:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Nephrotic-range proteinuria|- Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 g/g) in a spot urine sample, or proteinuria ≥ 1,000 mg/m² per day in a 24-hour urine sample, corresponding to 3+ (300–1,000 mg/dL) or 4+ (≥ 1,000 mg/dL) by urine dipstick|
|Nephrotic syndrome|- Nephrotic-range proteinuria and either serum albumin < 30 g/L (3 g/dlL) or edema when albumin level is not available|
|Complete remission|- First morning urine or 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio ≤ 200 mg/g (0.2 g/g or 20 mg/mmol or negative or trace dipstick or < 100 mg/m² per day) on ≥ 3 consecutive days|
|Partial remission|- First morning urine or 24-hour urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio > 200 mg/g (0.2 g/g) but < 2 g/g (or > 20 and < 200 mg/mmol) and, if available, serum albumin ≥ 30 g/L (3 g/dL)|
|Relapse|- Recurrence of nephrotic-range proteinuria in a child who had previously achieved complete remission < br > - Assess relapse commonly by urine dipstick, defined as dipstick ≥ 3+ for 3 consecutive days.|

KDIGO 2024 CKD — preferred measurement modality: Because creatinine excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allows correction for variations in urinary concentration, and measurement of urinary albumin is now recommended because it is relatively standardized and because it is the single most important protein lost in the urine in most CKDs; commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive for the reliable detection of proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and are only semiquantitative, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

### Urine protein as a rapid screen for renal function in the ED: can it replace serum creatinine in selected patients? [^aac43f9a]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Many radiology departments are unwilling to perform studies that require contrast administration to adult emergency department patients over the age of 35 without having a documented serum creatinine concentration of less than 2.0 mg/dl within a week of the study. Significant diagnostic delays may ensue waiting for this serum test. The present study was performed to determine whether a negative urine protein test, obtained by dip testing, will serve as a marker for a serum creatinine concentration below 2.0 mg/dl in emergency department patients who give no history of a disease which potentially could cause renal insufficiency. Emergency patients aged 35 years or more presenting to a university hospital who did not volunteer a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, or systemic lupus erythematosus in triage were enrolled. Only patients with a negative urine protein test whose serum creatinine was tested for other reasons were included. Of the 310 patients who had no protein in their urine and no history of disease which potentially could cause renal insufficiency, none had a serum creatinine concentration greater than 2.0 mg/dl (mean = 0.82 mg/dl, SD 0.28). Ages ranged from 35 to 96 years (mean = 59.7 years, SD = 17.5). All patients would have qualified for a contrast load for contrast computed tomography studies or for intravenous pyelogram. In patients who do not have a known history of hypertension, multiple myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus, or specific renal disease, urine dip testing for protein in the emergency department may be a rapid and safe screen for imaging studies requiring contrast without having to await serum creatinine testing.

### The urine protein / creatinine ratio as a reliable indicator of 24-h urine protein excretion across different levels of renal function and proteinuria: the TUNARI prospective study [^a6860538]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ROC curve analysis revealed a high effective of PCR to separate patients above and below a clinically significant level of 24-hUP excretion. A high sensitivity and specificity for PCR were observed both in general analysis and in subgroups of renal function. Consistent with the high sensitivity and specificity in patients across levels of renal function, a high Youden index was observed. Also, across levels of renal function, the capacity of PCR to rule in and rule out significant 24-hUP was demonstrated by the LR + above 6 and LR- below 0.15, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that PCR on isolated urine samples shows substantial discriminatory ability in patients with different levels of renal function, making it valuable for clinical decision-making.

We used the ROC curve and AUC to compare the performance of PCR with 24-h UP, evaluating how different thresholds affect sensitivity and specificity. These metrics are key to compare the effective of both methods. With a cut-off value of 0.77 according to the Youden index, and an AUC of 0.95, along with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 86.5%, these metrics are essential to correctly detect proteinuria in general. When assessed by renal function levels, the cut-off value ranged from 0.76 to 0.83 with an AUC greater than 0.94, the sensitivity was between 86.4% to 93.3% and the specificity was approximately 90%. By proteinuria levels, performance was significantly affected in the > 0.3–3.5 g/day group, the cut-off point was 0.50 with a sensitivity of 64.1% and specificity of 84.6, and the AUC was 0.76. However, it is important to consider that the Youden index has limitations, such as not identifying false positives and negatives. Therefore, LR improves this evaluation by measuring how PCR results can change the probability of disease, providing a direct clinical interpretation for diagnosis.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — urine sampling for albuminuria and proteinuria: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, and a first morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with 24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion; a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Overnight, first void in the morning, second void in the morning, or random sample collections are therefore recommended as first-line tests, recognizing that although the reference point remains the accurately timed 24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a difficult procedure to control effectively.

### Proteinuria is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the young population [^c1a55536]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

For urine analysis, 10 cc of mid‐steam urine after 4 hours from the last voiding was obtained. Spot urine protein analysis was performed with the conventional dipstick method using PH indicator that shows urine protein level as either negative, trace (equivalent to 10–30 mg/dL), +1 (30–100 mg/dL), +2 (100–300 mg/dL), +3 (300–1000 mg/dL), or +4 (≥ 1000 mg/dL). Internal and external quality control measures were pursued in each institution that was monitored by Korean Association of Laboratory Quality Control. Participants who were detected with urine protein (≥ +1) at baseline were defined as having proteinuria, and those who were not detected with urine protein or detected with trace amounts were defined as having no proteinuria. Baseline demographic factors, lifestyle habits, anthropometric and laboratory markers and comorbidities were included as covariates. The coding strategy, outcome measurement, and variable definitions used in this study have been validated in our prior studies. The ICD‐10 codes used in this study are summarized in Table S1. Definitions of variables are provided in Table S2.

Proteinuria — spot urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) guidance and correction: The guideline discourages random (spot) UPCR assessments in patients with glomerular disease, yet in clinical practice a trend in spot UPCR in an individual patient over time provides meaningful input; if using the spot UPCR, efforts should be made to collect samples at the same time of day with similar activity, often with the first morning sample providing the most consistency. A correction is noted for Figure 4 on page 91: instead of " < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol)" for UPCR, the values should be " < 3,000 mg/g (< 300 mg/mmol) or < 3,500 mg/g" in order to correspond to the traditional thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria.

Study selection and data extraction procedures

Two reviewers (RKM and MD) independently abstracted the data. They recorded characteristics of the study (authors, journal, year of publication, country, study design, objectives, type of medical centre, and period or duration of the study); characteristics of the participants (study population, method of selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria, whether consecutive cases, number of participants, number of excluded participants and reasons for exclusion, personal and medical characteristics of enrolled women, inpatients compared with outpatients, level of activity); information on how the diagnostic tests were carried out and the results (timing of protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio compared with 24 hour urine collection, method of assessment for the completeness of 24 hour urine collection, number of incomplete collections, prevalence of significant proteinuria (significant > 300 mg/24 hours, severe > 5000 mg/24 hours), range of proteinuria, laboratory methods for measurement of protein and creatinine, and results of diagnostic test); definitions of adverse outcome for mother or baby (acceptable definitions were any reported by the authors of the included studies); and methods for assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the tests and the results (number of true positives, number of true negatives, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, method of agreement, receiver operating characteristics curve, area under the curve, and the proposed diagnostic cut-off point for significant proteinuria).

Disagreements were resolved by consensus or arbitration of a third reviewer (MDK). For multiple or duplicate publication of the same dataset, we included only the most recent or complete study.

Multiple myeloma — Standard IMWG response criteria are: Stringent complete response requires complete response plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow biopsy by immunohistochemistry with κ/λ ratio ≤ 4:1 or ≥ 1:2 after counting ≥ 100 plasma cells. Complete response requires negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. Very good partial response is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level < 100 mg per 24 h. Partial response is ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to < 200 mg per 24 h; if the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, a ≥ 50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria; if serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable and serum-free light assay is also unmeasurable, ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells is required provided baseline bone marrow plasma-cell percentage was ≥ 30%; in addition, if present at baseline, a ≥ 50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. Minimal response is ≥ 25% but ≤ 49% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urine M-protein by 50%–89%, with a 25%–49% reduction in SPD of soft tissue plasmacytomas also required if present at baseline.

Chapter 4: Nephrotic syndrome in children — diagnostic definitions and thresholds include the following: Nephrotic-range proteinuria is first morning or 24-h PCR ≥ 2 g/g (or 200 mg/mmol or ≥ 3+ dipstick). Nephrotic syndrome requires nephrotic-range proteinuria plus either hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 30 g/l (3 g/dl)) or edema when albumin is not available. Complete remission is first morning or 24-h PCR ≤ 200 mg/g (or 20 mg/mmol or negative or trace dipstick) on three or more consecutive occasions, while partial remission is first morning or 24-h PCR > 200 mg/g but < 2 g/g (or > 20 and < 200 mg/mmol) and, if available, serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l (3 g/dl). Relapse is defined in children as dipstick 3+ for 3 consecutive days. Typical urine dipstick protein ranges are Negative: 0 to < 15 mg/dl; Trace: 15 to < 30 mg/dl; 1+: 30 to < 100 mg/dl; 2+: 100 to < 300 mg/dl; 3+: 300 to < 1000 mg/dl; and 4+: ≥ 1000 mg/dl. For children aged 1–18 years, to rule out orthostatic proteinuria, the first morning urine should be collected separately for assessment.

Table 7
Review of assays to assess albuminuria

Table 8
Definitions of albuminuria a

The JNC 7, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), and the ADA all recommend the use of morning spot albumin/creatinine measurement for annual quantitative testing for urine albumin in adults with diabetes. Individuals should be fasting. The optimal time for spot urine collection is the early morning, but for minimizing variation, all collections should be at the same time of day; the individual preferably should not have ingested food for at least 2 h.

Positive test results represent "albuminuria" in these guidelines, corresponding to protein excretion of > 300 mg/24 h, > 200 μg/min, or > 300 mg/g creatinine (Table 8). In these patients, quantitative measurement of urine albumin excretion is used in assessing the severity of albuminuria and its progression, in planning treatment, and in determining the impact of therapy. To properly assess the stage of kidney disease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be calculated from the serum creatinine value, age, sex, and race of the patient. An eGFR of < 60 mL/min, regardless of the presence of low levels of albuminuria, is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. A urine albumin value of < 30 mg/g creatinine, although considered "normal," should be reassessed annually, because values as low as 10 mg/g creatinine have been associated in some studies with an increased cardiovascular risk. If the value is ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine, changes should be reassessed after 6 to 12 months if antihypertensve therapy is required or annually in those who are normotensive. For children with type 1 diabetes, testing for low levels of albuminuria is recommended to begin after puberty and after a diabetes duration of 5 years. Of note is that most longitudinal cohort studies have reported significant increases in the prevalence of low levels of albuminuria only after diabetes has been present for 5 years.

In the algorithms of both the NKF and the ADA for urine protein testing, the diagnosis of low levels of albuminuria requires both the demonstration of increased albumin excretion (as defined above) on two of three tests repeated at intervals of 3 to 6 months and the exclusion of conditions that "invalidate" the test (Fig. 1).

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^79980d5f]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Definition of Proteinuria Twenty-four hundred years ago, Hippocrates noted the association between "bubbles on the surface of the urine" and kidney disease. 3, 4 Today, proteinuria is defined as urinary protein excretion of greater than 150 mg per day. Urinary protein excretion in healthy persons varies considerably and may reach proteinuric levels under several circumstances. Most dipstick tests that are positive for protein are a result of benign proteinuria, which has no associated morbidity or mortality. False-negative results occur with dilute urine and when the urinary proteins are nonalbumin or low molecular weight. 18 Fortunately, the ratio is about the same numerically as the number of grams of protein excreted in urine per day. Thus, a ratio of less than 0. 2 is equivalent to
0. 2 g of protein per day and is considered normal, a ratio of 3. 5 is equivalent to
3.

5 g of protein per day and is considered nephrotic-range proteinuria. To diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, split urine specimens are obtained for comparison. The first morning void is discarded. A 16-hour daytime specimen is obtained with the patient performing normal activities and finishing the collection by voiding just before bedtime. An eight-hour overnight specimen is then collected. The daytime specimen typically has an increased concentration of protein, with the nighttime specimen having a normal concentration. Patients with true glomerular disease have reduced protein excretion in the supine position, but it will not return to normal, as it will with orthostatic proteinuria. ISOLATED PROTEINURIA A proteinuric patient with normal renal function, no evidence of systemic disease that might cause renal malfunction, normal urinary sediment and normal blood pressures is considered to have isolated proteinuria.

Protein excretion is usually less than 2 g per day. These patients have a 20 percent risk for renal insufficiency after 10 years and should be observed with blood pressure measurement, urinalysis and a creatinine clearance every six months. 7 Isolated proteinuria with urinary protein excretion of more than 2 g per day is rare and usually signifies glomerular disease. 7 These patients need further testing, and a nephrology consultation should be considered.

### Proteinuria should be used as a surrogate in CKD [^bca1d9ef]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Surrogate end points of renal failure are instrumental to the testing of new treatments in patients with chronic kidney disease, the natural history of which is characterized by a slow, asymptomatic decline in renal function. The magnitude of proteinuria is widely recognized as a marker of the severity of glomerulopathy. Population-based studies have identified proteinuria as a predictor of future decline in glomerular filtration rate and of the development of end-stage renal disease. More importantly, a reduction in proteinuria invariably translates into a protection from renal function decline in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease with overt proteinuria. Thus, proteinuria should be considered a valuable surrogate end point for clinical trials in patients with proteinuric renal diseases.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^bfc530ae]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^f2ecc5bb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1.3

We recommend quantification of proteinuria is undertaken by protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). Twenty-four hour urine collection for quantification of protein is not required (1B).

Rationale

Dipstick testing of urine with reagent strips to detect proteinuria preferentially detects albumin. False positives occur with dehydration, exercise, infection and alkaline urine. False negatives occur with dilute urine, and non-albumin proteinuria. A systematic review of seven prospective studies showed that the sensitivity and specificity of a dipstick result of ≥ 1+ protein for predicting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy (> 300 mg/24 h) ranges from 47 to 86% and 39–95% respectively, leading to the conclusion that the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor. However, automated dipstick urinalysis provides a more accurate screening test for the detection of proteinuria than visual testing in hypertensive pregnancies.

Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in children — urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and albumin thresholds: The substitution of spot UPCR for the 24-hour urine collection has been established as the standard of care for children, with nephrotic-range proteinuria defined as first morning UPCR of ≥ 2 g/g. Whereas the 2012 KDIGO guideline maintained albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dL, the current guideline suggests serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dl; however, we suggest continuing to use the definition of nephrotic syndrome for children in the absence of evidence to support a change to a higher cutoff. It is unknown whether children with nephrotic-range proteinuria and less severe hypoalbuminemia (albumin of 2.6–2.9 g/dL) have similar pathology or treatment responses, and this has not been studied in prospective clinical trials. Practice Point 4.1.1 states that the definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children are based on the clinical characteristics outlined in Figure 39.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^817bb16a]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) urine albumin/protein testing — specimen selection and confirmation: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, a first morning void sample is preferred, and a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Because creatinine excretion is fairly constant over 24 hours, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) allows correction for urinary concentration; ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement and PCR on random or early morning untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance and correlation with 24-hour collection. Although the accurately timed 24-hour specimen remains a reference point, it is a difficult procedure to control; hydration affects urine concentration, and reporting albumin or protein to creatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration and reduce intraindividual variability. Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended, positive tests should be confirmed and large changes repeated, and if more accurate quantification is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions. Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive and only semiquantitative; the use of such strips should be discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements or validated point-of-care devices, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^010c4d4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Baseline evaluation for chronic hypertension in pregnancy — initial testing before or at presentation is used to detect possible end-organ involvement, and if testing was not done before pregnancy, it should be performed at entry to prenatal care. Recommended baseline tests include serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes (specifically potassium), blood urea nitrogen, complete blood count, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine for total protein and creatinine (to calculate creatinine clearance) as appropriate, and electrocardiogram or echocardiogram as appropriate; uric acid is no longer a recommended routine baseline test. Because the kidneys are usually the first end-organ to be affected, baseline renal function assessment commonly includes serum creatinine, a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and, if needed, a 24-hour urinary collection for total protein and creatinine clearance; for patients with borderline or abnormal urine protein-to-creatinine ratios or serum creatinine values, a 24-hour urine collection is recommended. A spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of less than 0.15 safely indicates a level of proteinuria less than 300 mg for a 24-hour sample and, in the absence of an abnormality in serum creatinine, likely does not warrant further evaluation with a 24-hour urine collection, unless there is a need to assess creatinine clearance. Evidence includes a systematic review reporting protein-to-creatinine ratio cutoffs of 0.13–0.15 with sensitivities ranging from 90% to 99% to rule out significant proteinuria of 300 mg or more, and a meta-analysis with sensitivities of 86% (95% CI, 86–93%) for a cutoff of 0.13 and 88% (95% CI, 85–92%) for a cutoff of 0.15 to detect 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample. Assessment of creatinine clearance may be helpful in some cases; with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine between 0.9 mg/dL and 1.4 mg/dL), there is normal intravascular volume expansion and an incremental increase in creatinine clearance.

### Proteinuria, measured or estimated albuminuria for risk prediction in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^c5dc8440]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health concern, affecting approximately 1 in 10 people worldwide. As a decrease in kidney function is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, accurate prediction of prognosis and early intervention of risk factors are important therapeutic strategies for CKD.

Albumin is a predominant urinary protein and its presence can be indicative of kidney damage, which may lead to the development of CKD. Measuring albuminuria is more sensitive and accurate than measuring total proteinuria for the early detection of kidney disease, particularly at low levels of proteinuria. Moreover, clinical practice guidelines for the screening and management of CKD recommend using glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to diagnose CKD. Therefore, measurement of albuminuria is essential for the initial diagnosis of CKD. Moreover, albuminuria is a well-established prognostic factor of CKD and recent predictive tools for CKD include albuminuria in their equations. Formulas have also been proposed for converting the urine protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) into an estimated urine albumin:creatinine ratio (eACR). Nevertheless, many physicians still measure urine total protein because it is less expensive and more customary or because measuring urine albumin is sometimes not available in real-world clinical practice. In addition, in some diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, proteinuria is still used to determine disease severity and treatment goals. In addition, there remains uncertainty regarding the superiority of albuminuria over proteinuria in predicting the risk of kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT), and there is no agreement on whether PCR should be converted if ACR is not accessible. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether the predictive performances of albuminuria and proteinuria differ for various CKD aetiologies.

The Korean Cohort Study for Outcome in Patients with CKD (KNOW-CKD) is a prospective cohort study that included patients already diagnosed with CKD grades 1–5 with various aetiologies. This study aimed to compare the predictive performance of the measured spot urine ACR (mACR), PCR and eACR converted from the PCR for the risk of KFRT.

Practice Point 1.1.1.2 — repeat testing after incidental abnormal findings: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD. There is known biological and analytical variability in serum creatinine (SCr) and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to their properties as markers of kidney disease. In people without risk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD and any unexpected results should be verified before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the person does have CKD even with an unexpected finding, and subsequent testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeat sample should be determined based on clinical setting including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/AKD.

KDIGO 2024 — Factors affecting interpretation of urine albumin or protein — Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated. Hematuria, menstruation, exercise, and infection can falsely elevate albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) by increasing albumin and protein in urine, while nonalbumin proteins can cause a false decrease because other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration also affects ratios: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion therefore higher ACR and PCR, whereas males have higher urinary creatinine excretion therefore lower ACR and PCR; low weight with low urinary creatinine excretion can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, whereas high weight with high urinary creatinine excretion can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower creatinine excretion with acute kidney injury or low-protein intake, and higher creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise, also influence results.

Point-of-care testing (POCT) diagnostic performance for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) is summarized as follows: studies addressed measurement bias (n = 1), analytical variability (n = 5), analytical sensitivity (n = 2), and analytical specificity (n = 63). Specificity ranged from 17.5 to 99.5 when ACR ≥ 30 mg/g and 30.0–98.7 when ACR ≥ 300 mg/g; for PCR, specificity ranged from 80.8–96.9 when PCR ≥ 200 mg/g and 75.6–95.2 when PCR > 500 mg/g. Given cost-effectiveness, availability without laboratory studies, and acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that in specific clinical scenarios, POCT should be used.

In the case of a stable patient, in complete remission on immunosuppressants, the use of PCR to monitor the level of proteinuria on an outpatient basis is highly recommended. In an additional analysis where we stratified the level of proteinuria, we observed a moderate correlation between PCR and 24-hUP for patients with proteinuria levels ≤ 0.3 g/day (r s = 0.70 and r 2 = 0.40), however, the correlation was low for patients with proteinuria between > 0.3–3.5 g/day (r s = 0.53 and r 2 = 0.21). It is imperative to highlight that the correlation was compromised in patients with proteinuria > 3.5 g/day (r s = 0.36), but the effective of proteinuria detection in this group was 100% (proteinuria > 3.5 g/day), which makes ROC curve analysis unfeasible and reinforces the purpose for which PCR was created. These findings underscore the discriminatory capacity of PCR to identify patients within the nephrotic range.

Potential methodological limitations of this study should be acknowledged. One limitation is that the study was conducted within the nephrology service of a single center, which limited the sample size to the patients available in that service. The sample was restricted to the number of patients in the service and some patients who had two urine samples taken in different periods of follow-up. We performed analyses comparing the first sample of all patients to all samples as well as the subgroup assessment (phase 1 vs phase 2) and no notable changes were observed in correlation, sensitivity or specificity. The inclusion of these additional samples helped us increase the power of our analyses and markedly reduced our likelihood of bias. This study presents a majority non-White population, which reduces external validity, but is also a strong point for internal validation in non-White populations. This study was conducted in Salvador, BA, which has the largest population of African descent outside of Africa. The Black and Mixed-Race populations have been reported to have a much higher risk of end-stage renal disease compared to the White population. Furthermore, studies from the United States and Brazil show that younger populations of African descent experience higher prevalence rates, worse renal survival in certain glomerulopathies, particularly focal glomerulosclerosis, and greater mortality in the case of lupus nephritis. This underscores the need for heightened attention and care for these younger demographic groups, who often face worse outcomes.

### Time to abandon microalbuminuria? [^a7f125a8]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The term microalbuminuria — a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) between 20 and 200 microg/min — has been introduced to identify subjects at increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between albuminuria and risk is not restricted to the microalbuminuric range and extends to as low as 2–5 microg/min. On the contrary, the increase of UAE above 200 microg/min (macroalbuminuria) heralds the onset of proteinuria (urinary protein excretion above 0.5 g/24 h) and progressive renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a component of the metabolic syndrome and may represent a marker of the increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria is a sign of established kidney damage and plays a direct pathogenic role in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria reflects functional and potentially reversible abnormalities initiated by glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, a size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier normally associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline that may result in end-stage renal disease. Thus, the limit of 200 microg/min segregates patients with albuminuria or proteinuria who are at quite different risk. Among subjects with albuminuria, however, there is a continuous relationship between albumin excretion and risk and no lower bound between normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria can be identified that segregates subjects at different risk. Thus, the terms microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria could be replaced by the concepts of albuminuria- and proteinuria-associated diseases. Future studies are needed to identify levels of albuminuria below which therapy is no longer beneficial.

### Evaluation of proteinuria redux [^b41cec8d]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

All of the methods for quantitative evaluation of proteinuria (or albuminuria) suffer from some methodological flaw. A new modification that improves the accuracy of the urine protein-to-creatinine ratios for predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion has been examined in a well-characterized cohort of patients with glomerular disease. This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

### Proteinuria, measured or estimated albuminuria for risk prediction in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^f549b0da]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Although albuminuria is a gold standard to define chronic kidney disease, proteinuria is still widely used in real-world clinical practice. Some studies suggest equations for estimating albuminuria from proteinuria. However, to date, the superiority of albuminuria over proteinuria is inconclusive.

This study adds:

Both the albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) showed good predictive performance for the risk of kidney failure with replacement therapy. However, estimated ACR calculated from the PCR showed inferiority, especially in patients with low albuminuria.

Potential impact:

This study indicates that predictive performance of albuminuria and proteinuria can vary according to the degree of albuminuria. Therefore, measuring albuminuria should be preferred to estimating albuminuria in patients with low albuminuria.

Furthermore, we examined effect modification of hs‐CRP for the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups by age (< 60 and ≥ 60 years); sex; BMI (< 25 and ≥ 25 kg/m 2); presence of diabetes mellitus; and previous CVD, baseline GFR (< 50 and ≥ 50 mL/min per 1.73 m 2), serum albumin (< 4.0 and ≥ 4.0 g/dL), and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (< 100 and ≥ 100 mg/dL). To compare predictive ability of hs‐CRP, we calculated Harrell c‐statistics, area under the receiver‐operating characteristics curves, category‐free net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement for models. The base model included conventional factors of age, sex, alcohol intake, smoking status, Charlson comorbidity index, socioeconomic status, educational status, baseline BMI, systolic blood pressure, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and albumin. The base+hs‐CRP model additionally adjusted for hs‐CRP in addition to the base model. The renal model additionally adjusted for baseline eGFR and baseline urine protein‐to‐creatinine ratio in addition to the base model. Finally, the renal+hs‐CRP model was constructed after hs‐CRP was added to the renal model. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14.2 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX). P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: prospective observational study [^c631e39c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The dipstick test is widely used as a primary screening test for detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP). However, it often shows a false positive test result. This study was performed to determine which pregnant women should be recommended to undergo determination of urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (mg/mg, P/Cr test) after dipstick test for confirmation of SPIP.

Methods

This was a multicenter, prospective, and observational study of 2212 urine specimens from 1033 pregnant women who underwent simultaneous dipstick and P/Cr tests in the same spot urine samples at least once. SPIP was defined as P/Cr > 0.27. Preeclampsia was diagnosed in women with both hypertension and SPIP.

Results

Preeclampsia, hypertension alone, and SPIP alone developed in 202 (20%), 73 (7.1%), and 120 (12%) women, respectively. Creatinine concentration [Cr] varied greatly, ranging from 8.1 to 831 mg/dL in the 2212 urine samples. Rate of positive dipstick test results increased with increasing [Cr], while SPIP prevalence rate was lower in urine samples with higher [Cr], yielding higher false positive rates in samples with higher [Cr]. Postpartum urine samples had significantly lower [Cr] compared to those obtained antepartum (60 [8.7–297] vs. 100 [10–401] mg/dL, respectively). At the first P/Cr test among women with similar dipstick test results, the risk of having SPIP was consistently and significantly higher for hypertensive women than for normotensive women at any dipstick test result: 18% (14/77) vs. 3.2% (8/251), 47% (26/55) vs. 8.7% (37/425), 91% (82/90) vs. 59% (44/75) for negative/equivocal, 1+, and ≥ 2+ test results, respectively. The risk of SPIP was 16% (9/55) for normotensive women when two successive antenatal urine samples showed a dipstick test result of 1 +.

Conclusions

For prediction of SPIP, the dipstick test was more likely to show a false positive result in concentrated urine samples with higher [Cr]. Hypertensive women with ≥ 1+ as well as normotensive women with ≥ 2+ on dipstick test should be advised to undergo the P/Cr test.

### Use of a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria during pregnancy [^312bc7fc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio is a clinically useful predictor of significant proteinuria (300 mg/24 hour).

Study Design

The medical records of 138 women who completed both a random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio and a 24-hour urine collection for the evaluation of preeclampsia were reviewed. Urine samples for the random protein-to-creatinine ratio were collected before the 24-hour urine collection. With the use of a protein level of at least 300 mg in the 24-hour urine sample as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the random protein-to-creatinine ratio for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria were determined with a range of cutoffs.

Results

Fifty percent of the study population had significant proteinuria. The data suggest that a cutoff below 0.14 ruled out significant proteinuria. The best cutoff of ≥ 0.19 yields a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 70%. All of the false-negative test results had 24-hour urine protein levels below 400 mg; 13 of the 21 false-positive results had levels that ranged from 250 to 300 mg.

Conclusion

The random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio is strongly associated with the 24-hour total protein excretion. A level below 0.14 can rule out significant proteinuria. A best cutoff of ≥ 0.19 is a good predictor of significant proteinuria. With further study, the random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio could replace the 24-hour urine collection as a simpler, faster, more useful method for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria.

### Early change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression: an individual patient meta-analysis [^08661590]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether proteinuria is a valid surrogate end point for randomized trials in chronic kidney disease.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data.

Setting & Population

Individual patient data for 9,008 patients from 32 randomized trials evaluating 5 intervention types.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials of kidney disease progression until 2007 with measurements of proteinuria both at baseline and during the first year of follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Predictor

Early change in proteinuria.

Outcomes

Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results

Early decline in proteinuria was associated with lower risk of the clinical outcome (pooled HR, 0.74 per 50% reduction in proteinuria); this association was stronger at higher levels of baseline proteinuria. Pooled estimates for the proportion of treatment effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria ranged from -7.0% (95%CI, -40.6% to 26.7%) to 43.9% (95%CI, 25.3% to 62.6%) across 5 intervention types. The direction of the pooled treatment effects on early change in proteinuria agreed with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical outcome for all 5 intervention types, with the magnitudes of the pooled treatment effects on the 2 end points agreeing for 4 of the 5 intervention types. The pooled treatment effects on both end points were simultaneously stronger at higher levels of proteinuria. However, statistical power was insufficient to determine whether differences in treatment effects on the clinical outcome corresponded to differences in treatment effects on proteinuria between individual studies.

Limitations

Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many chronic kidney disease clinical trials.

Conclusions

These results provide new evidence supporting the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point, but do not provide sufficient evidence to establish its validity in all settings.

Urine albumin and creatinine measurement — reporting standards and assays: Urine albumin (and protein) concentrations in urine should be reported as a ratio to creatinine — ACR (or PCR), which corrects for variations in urinary flow and enables reporting on untimed, spot samples, obviating the need for timed, including 24-hour, collections. Laboratories should ensure that they are enrolled and demonstrate satisfactory performance in an EQA scheme for urine albumin, creatinine, and ACR, and ACR results should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol) or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assays are generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine in urine but should be validated for each intended use.

3 MEASUREMENT

3.1 Measurement technique and urine sample type

Historically, urinary protein assessment relied on measuring 24‐h total protein excretion. Advances in the understanding of kidney disease, as reflected in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guideline, shifted the focus to albuminuria, recognising it as the predominant urinary protein in most kidney diseases. These recommendations have been retained in the updated KDIGO 2024 guidelines, further reinforcing the clinical importance of albuminuria assessment. Measuring urinary albumin, now widely recommended, is a relatively standardised and sensitive procedure that improves the sensitivity, quality and consistency of kidney disease detection and management. Although total protein measurements are less expensive, they lack the sensitivity to detect low but clinically significant levels of albuminuria, leading to their replacement by albumin‐specific assays (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Comparison of albuminuria measurement methods.

Albuminuria can be assessed using semi‐quantitative dipstick tests, particularly in resource‐limited settings. These reagent strips provide a quick, inexpensive and convenient screening method but have limited sensitivity and specificity, partly due to their inability to account for urine concentration or dilution. While these tests may eventually facilitate at‐home monitoring for CKD patients, they should currently be regarded as preliminary tools requiring confirmation through laboratory‐based methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective clinical decision‐making.

While 24‐h urine collection is the gold standard for assessing albuminuria due to its ability to account for variations in urine tonicity and the circadian rhythm of urinary albumin excretion, practical limitations often necessitate alternative methods. Although 24‐h urine collections provide comprehensive data, including assessments of muscle mass (via 24‐h creatinine excretion) and dietary intake (sodium and protein intake measured through sodium and urea excretion, respectively), they are labour‐intensive and prone to errors such as incomplete collection. Timed overnight collections are less cumbersome while still covering a reasonable collection interval; however, compliance remains poor compared to spot urine sampling. These challenges have led to the widespread adoption of more practical methods, including random urine samples, first‐morning voids and early‐morning voids.

### Urine as a source of biomarkers and biological knowledge in chronic kidney disease [^7f536446]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Albuminuria and estimates of glomerular filtration rate remain the main diagnostic and monitoring metrics used in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although these are both useful markers of kidney disease, they represent the consequence rather than the cause of CKD, can neither detect disease at its earliest stages nor determine its aetiology, and are often suboptimal in guiding therapeutic intervention. By contrast, nucleotide, protein, peptide and metabolite findings from urine can provide a wealth of information about kidney-tissue biology and pathological processes, thereby representing a source of potential biomarkers for early disease detection, prognostication and therapeutic guidance. Urinary biomarker research is currently dominated by studies of protein biomarkers that reflect tissue injury and repair, inflammation and fibrosis, and can be combined for use in multi-marker panels. Data on biomarkers for guiding therapy are scarce, underscoring the urgent need for more targeted studies, given the availability of several new therapies that are effective in attenuating CKD progression and improving patient outcomes. Consequently, although several (mainly protein) biomarkers with evidenced potential to improve disease management are currently available, their clinical implementation is limited by the paucity of clinical and health-economic impact data, especially data on the combined use of urinary biomarkers and the latest therapies available for people with CKD.

### Methods for diagnosing proteinuria-when to use which test and why: a review [^dcfa680e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria plays a central role in the diagnosis of kidney disease and has a high prognostic value. The test methods used differ considerably regarding their impact on test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Therefore, knowledge of the methodology is crucial for the interpretation of the results. In addition to the distinction between semiquantitative and quantitative tests, there are also relevant differences within the 2 methods. In general, semiquantitative tests are easy to handle but have limitations such as incomplete quantification, a lack of specificity regarding the type of proteinuria, and a high rate of false-positive results that require retesting with a quantitative method for verification. In contrast, quantitative methods, especially immunoassays, have the advantages of high test accuracy and the possibility of targeted detection of specific protein molecules in addition to albumin. However, these methods are more expensive and require access to a laboratory or an electronic point-of-care device. In this Review, the different types of tests for proteinuria and their underlying methodologies and strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail to allow a rational decision of use and the correct interpretation of the results depending on the clinical context.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^eba38411]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: ANNUAL TESTING FOR ALBUMINURIA IN PATIENTS WITHOUT CLINICAL PROTEINURIA SHOULD BEGIN IN PUBERTAL OR POSTPUBERTAL INDIVIDUALS 5 YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES AND AT THE TIME OF DIAGNOSIS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, REGARDLESS OF TREATMENT B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: URINE ALBUMIN AT CONCENTRATIONS ≥ 30 mg/g CREATININE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CONTINUOUS RISK MARKER FOR CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS B (moderate).

A. Diagnosis/screening.

Diabetes is associated with a very high rate of cardiovascular events and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the Western world. Early detection of risk markers, such as albumin in the urine (formerly termed "microalbuminuria"), relies on tests for urinary excretion of albumin. Conventional qualitative tests (chemical strips or "dipsticks") for albuminuria do not detect the small increases of urinary albumin excretion. For this purpose, tests to detect albumin concentrations are used (Table 7). Low levels of albuminuria have been defined by the Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 and the ADA and have more recently been redefined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Committee (,–) as excretion of 30–300 mg of albumin/24 h, 20–200 μg/min, or 30–300 μg/mg creatinine (Table 8) on two of three urine collections. Recent data, however, suggest that risk extends below the lower limit of 20 μg/min, reinforcing the notion that this factor is a continuous variable for cardiovascular risk.

### Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment and reimbursement of treatments for the management of chronic kidney disease [^70f5c2c0]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence base for the validity of surrogate endpoints in CKD

Historically, drug development for CKD has focused on patients with later stages of disease as they are at high risk of CKD progression. This is in part because the commonly used patient-relevant final or 'target' outcomes in clinical trials occur only after a prolonged disease course that may extend 10–20 years, a timeframe that is not feasible for trials of early CKD. Implementing treatments in the early stages of CKD could have a greater impact on delaying the time to progression to kidney failure and reducing the risk of progression than interventions applied at later stages of disease. As discussed above, surrogate endpoints can be used earlier in the CKD process and with smaller sample size and shorter follow-up duration.

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) define CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months with implications for health. This can include an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or other marker of kidney damage, which is most commonly, elevated albuminuria. Thus, GFR and urine albuminuria have been extensively evaluated as candidate surrogate endpoints because they are the most widely used biomarkers in CKD. The urine albumin concentration is often divided by the urine creatinine concentration to account for variations in urine dilution between individuals. This is a central reason for the recommendation to use it measured as urine albumin to creatinine ratio in a spot urine, to detect and stage CKD. In specific disease, total protein or urine albumin assessed using 24-h urine collections are also used. Here on in, we will continue to use the general term urine albumin (or albuminuria) to refer to all of the variations.

Over the past two decades, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) have led the evaluation of the validity of changes in GFR and albuminuria as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in CKD. Level 3 evidence (biological plausibility) for GFR decline as an endpoint of CKD progression is very strong. Change in GFR over time is the definition for the progression and remission of kidney disease–patients cannot reach kidney failure in the absence of a decline in GFR. Albuminuria is generally caused by increased permeability of the glomerular capillary wall to macromolecules. Experimental studies showed that increased tubular exposure to albumin promotes activation of inflammatory mediators causing tubulo-interstitial injury and further kidney damage. Albuminuria would not be expected to be a surrogate across all CKD etiologies. Unlike GFR, its use would require understanding that the specific disease affects albuminuria and that the intervention is expected to impact its change.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^4573468a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The term microalbuminuria was introduced in 1981 by Viberti, Parving and Svendsen and colleaguesto describe urinary albumin excretion levels below the detection threshold of standard dipstick tests but predictive of progression to overt proteinuria, particularly in patients with diabetes. Initially defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200 μg/min or 30–300 mg/24 h, it quickly gained recognition as a critical prognostic marker. Although microalbuminuria was widely accepted as a risk marker for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without diabetes, the term has since been abandoned due to its misleading implication that small or abnormal albumin molecules were being excreted in urine, as well as the potential for misinterpreting microalbuminuria as clinically insignificant. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrated that any detectable albuminuria, even within 'normal' ranges, is associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a continuous relationship between albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes., This pattern parallels findings in blood pressure, where even high‐normal levels (a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 mHg) are associated with elevated risk. Advances in the understanding of albumin heterogeneity, including the presence of albumin fragments and modified forms in urine, further challenged the validity of the term. Consequently, microalbuminuria has been removed from clinical and laboratory nomenclature and replaced by standardised, more quantitative terms, such as moderately and severely increased albuminuria.

### Association between preoperative proteinuria and postoperative acute kidney injury and readmission [^75475061]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Proteinuria indicates renal dysfunction and is a risk factor for morbidity among medical patients, but less is understood among surgical populations. There is a paucity of studies investigating how preoperative proteinuria is associated with surgical outcomes, including postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and readmission.

Objective

To assess preoperative urine protein levels as a biomarker for adverse surgical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, population-based study was conducted in a cohort of patients with and without known preoperative renal dysfunction undergoing elective inpatient surgery performed at 119 Veterans Affairs facilities from October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2014. Data analysis was conducted from April 4 to December 1, 2016. Preoperative dialysis, septic, cardiac, ophthalmology, transplantation, and urologic cases were excluded.

Exposures

Preoperative proteinuria as assessed by urinalysis using the closest value within 6 months of surgery: negative (0 mg/dL), trace (15–29 mg/dL), 1+ (30–100 mg/dL), 2+ (101–300 mg/dL), 3+ (301–1000 mg/dL), and 4+ (> 1000 mg/dL).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was postoperative predischarge AKI and 30-day postdischarge unplanned readmission. Secondary outcomes included any 30-day postoperative outcome.

Results

Of 346 676 surgeries, 153 767 met inclusion criteria, with the majority including orthopedic (37%), general (29%), and vascular procedures (14%). Evidence of proteinuria was shown in 43.8% of the population (trace: 20.6%, 1+: 16.0%, 2+: 5.5%, 3+: 1.6%) with 20.4%, 14.9%, 4.3%, and 0.9%, respectively, of the patients having a normal preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In unadjusted analysis, preoperative proteinuria was significantly associated with postoperative AKI (negative: 8.6%, trace: 12%, 1+: 14.5%, 2+: 21.2%, 3+: 27.6%; P < .001) and readmission (9.3%, 11.3%, 13.3%, 15.8%, 17.5%, respectively, P < .001). After adjustment, preoperative proteinuria was associated with postoperative AKI in a dose-dependent relationship (trace: odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3, to 3+: OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8–2.2) and 30-day unplanned readmission (trace: OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1, to 3+: OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4). Preoperative proteinuria was associated with AKI independent of eGFR.

Conclusions and Relevance

Proteinuria was associated with postoperative AKI and 30-day unplanned readmission independent of preoperative eGFR. Simple urine assessment for proteinuria may identify patients at higher risk of AKI and readmission to guide perioperative management.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^c692d778]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO 2022 — Definitions of nephrotic syndrome and proteinuria ranges list numeric thresholds for adults, children, and non-nephrotic-range proteinuria. Adults have proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g per 24 h and PCR ≥ 3000 mg/g (≥ 300 mg/mmol). Children have ≥ 40 mg/m^2/h, ≥ 300 mg/dl, 3+ on urine dipstick, and PCR ≥ 2000 mg/g (≥ 200 mg/mmol). Non-nephrotic-range proteinuria includes 0.3–3.4 g per 24 h with PCR < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol). Laboratory notes state bromcresol green (BCG) methods can give erroneously high serum albumin results and are about 5.5 g/l higher than BCP, CE, or iMN, affecting hypoalbuminemia definitions.

### SuPAR mediates viral response proteinuria by rapidly changing podocyte function [^674d8499]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Most importantly, we found that the association between suPAR levels and proteinuria differed significantly according to the predominant variant: suPAR levels were associated with proteinuria in patients infected with the non-Omicron variant (odds ratio, OR 2.07, 95% CI [1.75–2.45]), but not in patients infected with Omicron (OR 1.35, 95% CI [0.97–1.88]) (P = 0.023 for interaction). Patients infected with non-Omicron variants exhibited a stepwise increase in suPAR levels with increasing severity of proteinuria, but this association was heavily attenuated in patients infected with the Omicron variant (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
The association between suPAR and proteinuria in patients with COVID-19 was dependent on the underlying variant.

Violin plot depicting the median suPAR level across four different proteinuria classes ["none or trace", 1+ (30–99 mg/dL), 2+ (100–300 mg/dL), or 3+ (> 300 mg/dL) respectively], stratified by non-Omicron and Omicron SARS-Cov-2 infections. The central line in box represents median, box represents the interquartile, and whiskers represent the minimum and maximum, respectively. Plot was generated using R with ggplot2 package. The sample size (n) of each class is shown below the graphs.

To determine the nature of the proteinuria as glomerular or tubular in patients with COVID-19, we performed urine electrophoresis in a randomly selected subset of patients from M 2 C 2 with and without AKI. Interestingly, our results revealed an albumin-predominate urine protein profile whether the patients had AKI or not, suggesting that the proteinuria in COVID-19 is predominantly of glomerular origin (Supplementary Fig. 10). Overall, these data align with the aforementioned functional and biophysical results, implying that suPAR associates with SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein to cause proteinuria in a variant-dependent manner.

Albuminuria evaluation — initial testing method and specimen: Practice Point 1.3.1.1 states to use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference) and that in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children, specifying urine ACR or reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Supporting context notes that assays to measure albumin are more precise and sensitive than assays to measure urine protein.
