## Question

pain is resolving, not present on exam, is ovarian torsion still likely?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ovarian/adnexal torsion is still likely when a patient's abdominal/pelvic pain is resolving and the current physical examination is non-tender. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how often torsion presents with intermittent or resolving pain. Then, I should evaluate the sensitivity of physical examination for torsion. Next, I need to check the reliability of imaging, especially ultrasound Doppler and CT, in ruling torsion in or out. After that, I should review guideline-driven principles on managing suspected torsion when findings are equivocal. Finally, I will synthesize whether torsion remains in the differential and what immediate actions are appropriate, despite symptom resolution and a negative exam [^1166XquS] [^113ns5Ze] [^114dggTr].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical issue: ovarian torsion can be partial and intermittent, producing waxing and waning pain that may temporarily resolve as the adnexa detorses, which means improving symptoms alone do not eliminate the diagnosis, and delaying evaluation risks ischemia and loss of ovarian function, particularly in children and adolescents where salvage is time-dependent [^113zipob] [^11696Gbj] [^114E6io9].

> I should review concrete evidence of intermittent or resolving pain presentations to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing; case reports and pediatric series document intermittent torsion with minimal objective findings at presentation, and guidelines specifically describe torsion pain as often sudden-onset and intermittent with associated nausea and vomiting, which fits the scenario of pain that improves between episodes [^112F4qLU] [^111zTwgv] [^1166XquS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on a normal exam; I need to check how sensitive the physical examination is for torsion, and the data show that a substantial proportion of confirmed cases lack abdominal tenderness or a palpable mass, so a non-tender abdomen today does not safely exclude torsion and should not lower suspicion unduly if the history is concerning [^111xZ7P8] [^111P5YoE] [^112qNZmo].

> Next, I should review imaging reliability; my first instinct is to rely on absent Doppler flow as decisive, but wait, I should verify that because the dual ovarian blood supply can preserve arterial signals even in torsion, so normal arterial Doppler or transiently normal ultrasound cannot rule out torsion, particularly with intermittent detorsion and retorsion causing fluctuating perfusion and edema [^116gxHBz] [^116uPonE] [^112qNZmo].

> Now, I will examine CT because sometimes pain pathways lead to CT first; I initially thought a normal CT could definitively exclude torsion, but I should double-check the nuances: one series reported that CT prospectively identified torsion in only 47% when relying on contemporaneous reports, highlighting limited sensitivity of CT interpretations, while another retrospective review noted that all proven torsion cases who had CT demonstrated abnormal ovaries on re-read, suggesting that a completely normal, well-visualized ovary on CT makes torsion unlikely, yet real-world misses occur and CT should not be used to exclude torsion when clinical concern persists [^1158BmeX] [^112wEude].

> I need to assess the risk of false reassurance from symptom resolution; cases document patients discharged after pain improvement and negative imaging who later re-presented with necrotic torsion, and pediatric literature warns that detorsion can transiently relieve pain while the ovary remains edematous and at high risk of retorsion, which can progress to ischemia and even asynchronous contralateral torsion if not addressed promptly [^1141WNST] [^113zipob] [^116osD2v].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management principles to ensure I'm aligned; both SOGC and ACOG emphasize that torsion is a clinical diagnosis supported — but not excluded — by imaging, advocate a high index of suspicion in females with acute pelvic pain, and recommend timely gynecologic consultation and diagnostic laparoscopy when suspicion remains, aiming for ovarian preservation whenever feasible, even when the ovary appears dusky at surgery [^114dggTr] [^113ns5Ze] [^1166XquS] [^111HHGdc].

> But wait, what if the intermittent pain was actually due to a ruptured functional cyst or appendiceal colic; I should verify differentiating features, and although overlap is substantial, the absence of reliable clinical or laboratory discriminators to exclude torsion among girls with abdominal pain means that persistent or characteristic intermittent episodes with nausea and a risk factor such as an adnexal mass over 5 cm should sustain suspicion and expedite specialist evaluation [^111P5YoE] [^114jD5g2] [^112mvivj].

> Bringing this together, I should state the clinical conclusion clearly: yes, ovarian torsion remains a meaningful possibility despite resolving pain and a negative physical exam, because torsion can be intermittent, exam sensitivity is limited, and imaging — particularly Doppler ultrasound and CT — cannot reliably exclude torsion when clinical suspicion is present, warranting urgent gynecologic input to prevent delayed diagnosis and potential ovarian loss [^113zipob] [^112qNZmo] [^11696Gbj] [^1166XquS].

> In terms of immediate action, I need to ensure a time-sensitive, fertility-preserving pathway: arrange urgent gynecology consultation, obtain pelvic ultrasound with Doppler recognizing that normal flow does not rule out torsion, avoid false reassurance from symptom improvement, and proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy without undue delay if suspicion remains after imaging, prioritizing detorsion and ovarian preservation per ACOG and SOGC guidance to optimize salvage and future function [^116gxHBz] [^1166XquS] [^113ns5Ze] [^111HHGdc].

Ovarian torsion is less likely if pain has resolved and there are no exam findings, but it cannot be completely excluded because torsion can be intermittent or spontaneously detorse [^114E6io9] [^112F4qLU]. Clinical suspicion should remain if risk factors or a suggestive history are present [^111zTwgv], and ultrasound with Doppler is recommended [^113ns5Ze] to assess for ovarian enlargement, peripheral follicles, or a twisted pedicle [^1111cNuC]. If imaging is inconclusive but suspicion persists, consider MRI or diagnostic laparoscopy [^116gxHBz] [^1166XquS]. Resolving pain and a normal exam make torsion less likely, but do not rule it out [^112qNZmo] [^1141WNST].

---

## Clinical presentation and pathophysiology

Ovarian torsion typically presents with sudden-onset, severe, unilateral pelvic or abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting [^111zTwgv]. However, pain may be intermittent or resolve with partial torsion or spontaneous detorsion, making diagnosis challenging [^112qNZmo] [^112F4qLU] [^114E6io9]. Pathophysiology involves twisting of the ovarian pedicle, causing compromised blood flow, ischemia, and potential necrosis if not promptly treated [^114dggTr] [^116uPonE].

---

## Likelihood of ovarian torsion with resolving pain and normal examination

When a patient presents with resolving pain and no abnormal findings on physical examination, the likelihood of ovarian torsion decreases significantly. However, ovarian torsion cannot be entirely excluded based solely on clinical improvement and a normal examination [^112qNZmo]. Intermittent torsion or spontaneous detorsion can cause transient symptom resolution, potentially leading to missed or delayed diagnosis [^112F4qLU] [^1141WNST].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and laboratory evaluation

Imaging is crucial for evaluating suspected ovarian torsion, particularly when clinical findings are inconclusive [^112mvivj]. Ultrasound with Doppler is the primary imaging modality [^113ns5Ze], assessing ovarian size, vascular flow, and the presence of adnexal masses or cysts [^111ZeDVC]. Key ultrasound findings suggestive of torsion include:

- Enlarged ovary with peripheral follicles ("string of pearls" sign) [^1111cNuC]
- Decreased or absent Doppler flow [^113ns5Ze]
- Twisted vascular pedicle ("whirlpool sign") [^116gxHBz]
- Free fluid in the pelvis [^117F8WFt]

However, normal Doppler flow does not definitively exclude torsion, as intermittent torsion or dual ovarian blood supply can preserve flow [^113W5xZX] [^116gxHBz]. If ultrasound is inconclusive, MRI or CT may be used to further evaluate ovarian morphology and vascular compromise [^116uPonE]. Laboratory tests, such as white blood cell count and inflammatory markers, are nonspecific [^111P5YoE] and cannot reliably differentiate ovarian torsion from other causes of abdominal pain.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize maintaining a high index of suspicion for ovarian torsion, even when pain is resolving and the examination is normal [^111zTwgv]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends timely diagnostic laparoscopy in adolescents with suspected ovarian torsion to preserve ovarian function and future fertility [^1166XquS]. Similarly, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommends prompt surgical intervention when torsion is suspected, regardless of symptom resolution [^115USec2].

---

## Clinical decision-making and management

In clinical practice, decisions about further diagnostic evaluation or surgical intervention should be guided by the overall clinical picture, including patient history, risk factors, and imaging findings [^112mvivj]. If clinical suspicion for ovarian torsion remains high despite symptom resolution, prompt surgical exploration is recommended to prevent ovarian ischemia and preserve fertility [^115USec2] [^1166XquS]. Conversely, if suspicion is low and imaging is normal, conservative management with close follow-up may be appropriate [^114E6io9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, while resolving pain and normal physical examination findings significantly decrease the likelihood of ovarian torsion, the diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded due to the possibility of intermittent torsion or spontaneous detorsion [^111zTwgv]. Clinical suspicion should remain high in patients with risk factors or a suggestive history, and prompt ultrasound with Doppler is recommended. If clinical suspicion persists despite inconclusive imaging, surgical exploration should be considered to prevent ovarian ischemia and preserve fertility [^115USec2].

### Ovarian and tubal torsion: Imaging findings on US, CT, and MRI [^1111cNuC]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of adnexal torsion is often challenging, as clinical presentation is nonspecific and the differential for pelvic pain is broad. However, prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to good clinical outcomes and preservation of the ovary and/or fallopian tube. Ultrasound (US) imaging is most frequently used to assess torsion. However, as computed tomography (CT) utilization in the emergency setting has increased, there are times when CT is the initial imaging test. Additionally, the nonspecific clinical presentation may initially be interpreted as gastrointestinal in etiology, where CT is the preferred exam. For these reasons, it is imperative to know the findings of adnexal torsion on CT as well as US. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in cases where the diagnosis remains unclear and is particularly helpful in the young or pregnant patient with equivocal sonographic findings, as it provides excellent soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation.

This article illustrates the findings of surgically confirmed ovarian and fallopian tube torsion on US, CT, and MRI, including those in the pregnant patient. Ovarian enlargement, adnexal mass, twisting of the vascular pedicle, edematous and heterogeneous appearance of the ovary, peripheral ovarian follicles, free fluid, uterine deviation towards the side of torsion, adnexal fat stranding, tubal dilatation, and decreased adnexal enhancement will be reviewed. Familiarity with the range of imaging findings across multiple modalities is key to improving the likelihood of timely diagnosis and therefore, better clinical management.

### Myths in the evaluation and management of ovarian torsion [^112qNZmo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is a rare but serious cause of pelvic pain in females. Making the diagnosis is important because misdiagnosis can lead to an ischemic ovary and subsequent infertility.

- **Objective**: Although all emergency physicians are aware of ovarian torsion, there are several myths regarding its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article attempts to review some of these myths to improve emergency diagnosis and evaluation.

- **Discussion**: Ovarian torsion is not an easy diagnosis to make, and it is commonly missed. Signs and symptoms often mimic other disorders such as appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis becomes more challenging in that torsion can occur in female patients of all ages, including infants and the elderly. Normal arterial blood flow on ultrasound does not rule out ovarian torsion, and not every patient will have a mass on imaging or a palpable mass on examination. Patients may have symptoms for several hours or days, and thus, ovarian torsion may be present even with a longer duration of symptoms. Surgery is the definitive treatment and may still be effective after several hours of symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Although ovarian torsion is a challenging diagnosis, understanding myths surrounding the disorder may help emergency physicians consider it in unusual populations. If there is any clinical concern for ovarian torsion, a gynecologic consult may be helpful, even if imaging findings are not conclusive. Surgery remains the standard method for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

### Third place winner. Three-year-old female with intermittent ovarian torsion [^112F4qLU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We report an atypical case of ovarian torsion, an uncommon cause of abdominal pain in a very young girl. She presented with intermittent episodes of groin and thigh pain over a 10-week period. The child had minimal objective findings at the time of each evaluation. Despite the delay in diagnosis, the ovary was preserved. Despite its rarity, ovarian torsion must be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in young girls.

### Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian torsion in premenarchal girls [^111xZ7P8]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment of ovarian torsion in premenarchal girls with surgically verified ovarian torsion.

- **Design and participants**: A retrospective cohort study design was utilized. The medical charts of all premenarchal girls with surgically verified ovarian torsion treated in a university-affiliated tertiary medical center from 1997 to 2012 were reviewed for clinical, treatment, and outcome data.

- **Results**: Thirty-two premenarchal girls were identified, with a median age of 9 years. There were 7 recurrences during the study period (17.9%), totaling 39 cases. The main presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (92.3%) and nausea and vomiting (84.6%). Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness in 25 cases (64.1%). Abdominal ultrasound was performed in 31 patients (38 cases) and yielded pathologic findings in 28 (73.7%), mainly an enlarged ovary (11 cases, 28.9%). Doppler flow studies were abnormal in 15 cases. In 26 cases (68.4%), the tentative preoperative working diagnosis was ovarian torsion. Laparoscopy was performed in 26 cases, laparotomy in 10, and laparoscopy converted to laparotomy in 3 cases. Conservative management, mainly with additional cyst drainage or cystectomy, was used in 37 cases (95.2%), with oophoropexy in 5 cases. Two patients required oophorectomy due to a suspected neoplasm and severe ovarian necrosis. Pathologic examination demonstrated 5 simple cysts, 1 necrotic ovary, and 1 mature cystic teratoma.

- **Conclusions**: Ovarian torsion in premenarchal girls is associated with nonspecific signs and symptoms.

### European Society of Paediatric Radiology abdominal imaging task force recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part IX: Imaging in anorectal and cloacal malformation, imaging in childhood ovarian torsion, and efforts in standardising paediatric uroradiology terminology [^117RxXnx]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The technique consists of multiplanar imaging (at least in two planes) at a slice thickness of usually ≤ 2 mm, acquiring T2-weighted spin-echo sequences and fat-suppressed T1-weighted images before and after gadolinium. Additionally, a high-resolution isotropic 3-D MR sequence in T2 weighting and (after contrast) with T1 weighting may be helpful and will allow for multiplanar reconstructions and 3-D navigation. Dynamic high-resolution (3-D) sequences similar to those used for MR urography or MR angiography could be used during the active filling into the stoma and the common channel, as well as in the late phase of the MR urography for proper depiction of dynamics and the ureters; the pelvic floor and its muscles should always be included, as well as the distal spine and spinal cord. Respectively, meticulous post-processing is obviously mandatory, and the interpretation usually is done by comparing all other imaging results, e.g. from US or fluoroscopy.

- **Imaging in childhood ovarian torsion**: Ovarian and/or adnexal torsion is defined as complete or partial torsion of the ovary on its ligamentous supply, which eventually compromises the ovarian circulation. It is referred to as adnexal torsion if the fallopian tube is twisted along with the ovary; the rare (isolated) tubal torsion can also be encountered. Ovarian/adnexal torsion is relatively rare in childhood (an estimated incidence of 4.9 per 100,000 females ages 1 year — 20 years), but it is an important differential diagnosis in girls with abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion can also be encountered in neonates.

### A diagnostic challenge: primary omental torsion and literature review - a case report [^113rBDuf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Primary omental torsion is a rare abdominal condition that poses a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. It is characterized by the twisting of the omentum, which can lead to vascular compromise and subsequent necrosis. Correct and timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications. This report presents a case of primary omental torsion, providing insights into its clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and management strategies. A comprehensive literature review is included to highlight the rarity and complexity of this condition.

- **Clinical presentation**: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain localized in the right lower quadrant, mimicking appendicitis. Physical examination revealed tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness.

- **Diagnostic procedures**: Ultrasound and CT scans were employed to differentiate omental torsion from other abdominal pathologies. Imaging findings suggested a whirled appearance of the omentum, aiding in the diagnosis.

- **Management and outcome**: The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery, which confirmed the diagnosis and allowed for the removal of the necrotic omentum. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up showed a resolution of symptoms.

This case underscores the importance of considering primary omental torsion in differential diagnoses for acute abdominal pain. Enhanced imaging techniques can aid in preoperative diagnosis, potentially reducing the need for exploratory surgery.

### Ovarian torsion in a pediatric patient: The importance of repeat imaging [^1141WNST]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of abdominal pain. She was afebrile with an elevated white blood cell count and a negative pelvic ultrasound. The pain resolved while in hospital, and the patient was discharged home. The patient returned 10 days later, and the pain now migrated from the left flank to the subumbilical region. The patient now had an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. On pelvic ultrasound, the patient had a large midline mass and a normal right ovary. The patient was taken to the operating room where she was found to have a torted and necrotic left ovary and fallopian tube, which were removed. There are few instances where pediatric ovarian torsion presents as intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should always have a high index of suspicion for ovarian torsion in any case of abdominal/pelvic pain in young girls with previous negative imaging.

### Ovarian cystic teratoma torsion in pregnancy [^112EnKji]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain during pregnancy is frequently encountered, and the differential diagnosis is extensive. Acute ovarian torsion in a pregnant patient is rare and difficult to diagnose. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will occur if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely manner. This case describes a 28-year-old primigravida who presented to the emergency department with right lower abdominal pain. The patient was ultimately found to have an extremely large cystic teratoma of the right ovary with concomitant torsion.

Bedside ultrasonography is a highly accessible tool that can be used in pregnant women for screening a mass or ascites. Laparoscopic surgery is now accepted as a safe modality for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Because acute ovarian torsion is not frequently encountered, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimize morbidity. It is important to include ovarian torsion in the differential diagnosis of any pregnant woman with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware of the possibility of acute ovarian torsion in pregnant women and maintain a high index of suspicion. Early surgical intervention should be undertaken.

### Evaluation of acute pelvic pain in women [^112mvivj]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of pelvic pain in women can be challenging because many symptoms and signs are insensitive and nonspecific. As the first priority, urgent life-threatening conditions (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, ruptured ovarian cyst) and fertility-threatening conditions (e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion) must be considered. A careful history focusing on pain characteristics, review of systems, and gynecologic, sexual, and social history, in addition to physical examination, helps narrow the differential diagnosis.

The most common urgent causes of pelvic pain are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cyst, and appendicitis. However, many other diagnoses in the differential may mimic these conditions, and imaging is often needed. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be the initial imaging test due to its sensitivities across most etiologies and its lack of radiation exposure.

A high index of suspicion should be maintained for pelvic inflammatory disease when other etiologies are ruled out because the presentation is variable and the prevalence is high. Multiple studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of women presenting with pelvic pain have pelvic inflammatory disease. Adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women require unique considerations.

### Cannot exclude torsion — a 15-year review [^11696Gbj]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion remains a challenging diagnosis, often leading to delayed operative intervention and resultant ovarian loss.

- **Methods**: Charts of patients with ovarian operative cases were retrospectively reviewed at a free-standing children's hospital over 15 years. Torsion was based on intraoperative findings.

- **Results**: Of 328 operative ovarian cases, 97 (29.6%) demonstrated torsion. The mean patient age was 9.2 years (2 days to 17 years, ± 0.54 SEM), with 52% occurring between 9 and 14 years. Of the patients, 97% presented in pain. The presence of a pelvic mass 5 cm or larger on imaging had 83% sensitivity for torsion, while an ultrasound reading was only 51% sensitive. Elevated white blood cell count was the only preoperative characteristic associated with prompt operative intervention. Utilization of laparoscopy increased during the latter half of the study (18%-42%, P < .0434). There was a positive trend, although insignificant, in the use of laparoscopy and ovarian salvage. Pathology was overwhelmingly benign (infarction [46%], cysts [33%], and benign neoplasms [19%]).

- **Conclusion**: Torsion was responsible for one third of all operative ovarian cases. Sonography is not reliable in diagnosis or exclusion of ovarian torsion. Thus, a strategy of earlier and liberal use of Diagnostic Laparoscopy (DL), particularly with a pelvic mass of approximately 5 cm, may improve ovarian salvage. Because pathology is predominantly benign, the edematous detorsed ovary is safe to salvage.

### A diagnostic challenge: primary omental torsion and literature review - a case report [^114YUB7w]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Omental torsion presents with nonspecific symptoms of an acute abdomen and is mainly diagnosed intraoperatively during diagnostic laparoscopy. Awareness of omental torsion as a differential diagnosis in acute abdomen cases and careful inspection of the omentum in a "negative laparoscopy" are recommended for appropriate management of surgical patients. However, cases without complications may be managed conservatively in the future.

### Paediatric cystic ovarian torsion masquerading appendicitis [^116GhNSU]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The patient has recovered well following her surgery. She had a follow-up ultrasound scan at 3 months, which demonstrated the left ovary measuring 38×17×26 mm and a right ovary measuring 18×10×18 mm with viable ovarian tissue.

### An ovary with a twist: A case of interesting sonographic findings of ovarian torsion [^113W5xZX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy young woman presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. Multiple diagnoses were considered, as must be the case in women with lower quadrant abdominal pain. Rapid identification of an abnormally enlarged ovary in close proximity to the opposite ovary on pelvic ultrasonography suggested the diagnosis of ovarian torsion, which was verified on laparoscopy. Notably, normal Doppler flow to both ovaries was demonstrated on pelvic ultrasound. We present this case and its associated images with the intent to highlight a readily identifiable sign of ovarian torsion for emergency physicians and to briefly review ovarian torsion's salient clinico-pathologic features.

### Ovarian torsion: Developing a machine-learned algorithm for diagnosis [^1139H4py]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is a common concern in girls presenting to emergency care with pelvic or abdominal pain. The diagnosis is challenging to make accurately and quickly, relying on a combination of physical examination, history, and radiological evaluation. Failure to establish the diagnosis in a timely fashion can result in irreversible ovarian ischemia, with implications for future fertility. Ultrasound is the mainstay of evaluation for ovarian torsion in the pediatric population; however, even with a high index of suspicion, imaging features are not pathognomonic.

- **Objective**: We sought to develop an algorithm to aid radiologists in diagnosing ovarian torsion using machine learning from sonographic features and to evaluate the frequency of each sonographic element.

- **Materials and Methods**: All pediatric patients treated for ovarian torsion at a quaternary pediatric hospital over an 11-year period were identified by both an internal radiology database and hospital-based International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code review. Inclusion criteria were surgical confirmation of ovarian torsion and available imaging. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis could not be confirmed, no imaging was available for review, the ovary was not identified by imaging, or torsion involved other adnexal structures but spared the ovary. Data collection included patient age, laterality of torsion, bilateral ovarian volumes, torsed ovarian position (i.e. whether medialized with respect to the mid-uterine line), and the presence or absence of Doppler signal within the ovary.

### A rare case of right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^1164WR4w]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Isolated fallopian tube torsion without involvement of the ovary is a rare condition, most frequently presenting during reproductive years. Imaging, vitals, physical exams, and laboratory findings all fail to help establish a definitive diagnosis. The majority of the diagnoses are made on the operating table.

Physical exams most often reveal unilateral and localized abdominal pain, often with nausea and vomiting, but few other reliably common findings. Diagnosis becomes even more challenging due to the fact that isolated tubal torsion often occurs in pregnancy and preferentially on the right side, further complicating the clinical picture. We describe a case of isolated tubal torsion, unique in that localized necrosis and inflammation from the torsion triggered a secondary appendicitis. The patient required surgical intervention, including an appendectomy and salpingectomy emergently.

Given its elusive and rare nature, awareness and early intervention by the emergency physician are required to recognize tubal torsion, as operative intervention is crucial. Early intervention can lead to the preservation of fertility and improved fetal survival.

### Deciphering ovarian torsion: Insights from CT imaging analysis [^1158BmeX]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In the milieu of emergency medicine, pelvic and lower abdominal pain frequently present, with ovarian torsion posing a formidable diagnostic quandary amid multifarious etiologies. Given the burgeoning reliance on CT in acute care settings, it invariably assumes primacy as the principal imaging modality. This study endeavors to elucidate the CT imaging manifestations encountered by surgically confirmed ovarian torsion patients, using CT to differentiate necrosis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis (January 2015 - April 2019) utilizing hospital archives was conducted on patients diagnosed with ovarian torsion post-surgery. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients who underwent CT examinations within one week of diagnosis. A large array of CT findings encompassing midline orientation, uterine deviation, and intraovarian hematoma/mass were systematically documented.

- **Results**: Ninety patients were diagnosed with ovarian torsion. Fifty-three (59%) had CT within one week of diagnosis; 41 (77%) underwent a CT with IV contrast, and 12 (23%) without IV contrast. The mean age was 43 years (range 19–77 years), with nearly equal distribution of each ovary's involvement. The mean maximum ovarian diameter was 11.7 ± 6.3 cm (4.2–34.8 cm). The most common imaging features included the presence of a thickened pedicle (43/53, 81%), midline ovary (41/53, 77%), the presence of a thickened fallopian tube (31/49, 63%), and ipsilateral uterine deviation (33/53, 62%). Based on contemporaneous imaging reports, torsion was diagnosed in 25 of 53 studies, giving a sensitivity of 47%.

- **Conclusion**: Enlarged ovaries are a significant finding in diagnosing ovarian torsion, with a marked prevalence of specific imaging features that aid in its detection.

### Ovarian torsion in a patient with müllerian agenesis: Increased risk [^116ZczL2]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with müllerian agenesis may be at an increased risk of ovarian torsion due to the absence of the utero-ovarian ligament and the fact that the ovary is not tethered to a fixed and relatively non-mobile structure, the uterus.

- **Case**: We report a case of a 14-year-old female with abdominal pain who had a physical examination suggestive of müllerian agenesis. Imaging was non-diagnostic and demonstrated an abdominal mass. Emergent surgery revealed ovarian torsion.

- **Summary and conclusion**: We present this case of ovarian torsion and müllerian agenesis to highlight the association and review potential risk factors.

### Isolated fallopian tube torsion: Two case reports of a rare entity [^1158vQ6B]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Isolated fallopian tube torsion is a rare entity that is difficult to diagnose, as its clinical presentation is often highly nonspecific. Early diagnosis is important to avoid damage or loss of the fallopian tube or even the ovary, as this diagnosis occurs predominantly in women of childbearing age. Imaging may be helpful in suggesting this difficult diagnosis, with confirmation of this entity made in the operating room. Treatment can range from detorsing the tube to salpingectomy or even salpingo-oopherectomy. Here, we present two cases of isolated fallopian tube torsion, followed by a discussion of its imaging findings.

Uterine torsion is considered exceedingly rare in childhood. Nonspecific symptoms of acute torsion may result in a missed diagnosis with long-term complications. We report three cases of uterine torsion in young girls and argue that the condition may be more common than traditionally reported.

- **Cases**: Three girls were referred with complex utero-adnexal structural abnormalities initially diagnosed as an "unusual congenital anomaly". Further evaluation revealed uterine torsion as the underlying event. Corrective surgery effectively preserved uterine functions in two of the patients.

- **Conclusions**: Uterine torsion may not be as rare in young girls as previously thought, and a missed diagnosis can have devastating effects. This emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion.

### Abdominal pain in the post-menopausal female: Is ovarian torsion in the differential [^113jmJjJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is often thought of as a disease process of reproductive-aged women; however, it is also seen in the extremes of age. In post-menopausal women, it can be both a challenge to diagnose and associated with increased morbidity.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 68-year-old woman with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain 6 hours before arrival at the emergency department (ED). She was diagnosed with ovarian torsion secondary to an ovarian mass and underwent a full malignancy evaluation.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Given the higher risk of malignancy in post-menopausal women, ovarian mass-related torsion is an uncommon but important cause of acute-onset lower abdominal pain. Due to the lower prevalence of ovarian torsion in the post-menopausal group, delayed or missed diagnosis is common and may increase associated morbidity. This morbidity is due to the increased likelihood of malignancy and complications of associated medical and surgical treatment of the mass. This report highlights the increased malignancy risk, difficulty with diagnosing torsion in the post-menopausal age group, and the rationale for different management strategies when compared to premenopausal women.

### Ovarian torsion in a three-year-old girl [^115QS25K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is the fifth most encountered gynecological emergency requiring surgery, representing only 2.7% of surgical emergencies, and it is an entity worth being familiar with in the emergency department (ED).

- **Objectives**: Untreated ovarian torsion may result in loss of ovarian function, tissue necrosis, and death from thromboembolism or sepsis. It presents with vague symptoms and abdominal pain, making diagnosis difficult, especially in children. The objective of this article is to present a case of pediatric ovarian torsion and to review its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

- **Case report**: A 3-year-old girl presented to the ED with vomiting, fever, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Initially diagnosed with appendicitis through physical examination and a computed tomography scan, she was taken to the operating room for surgical exploration. The patient was subsequently found to have ovarian torsion, which was treated appropriately.

- **Conclusion**: Although a rare phenomenon, this case serves to increase awareness of the clinical presentation of ovarian torsion in pediatric patients. Abdominal pain in a female child represents a challenging differential diagnosis, for which a physician must consider ovarian torsion.

### Ovarian torsion in pediatric and adolescent patients: A systematic review [^113zipob]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion in pediatric patients is a rare event and is primarily managed by pediatric general surgeons. Torsion can be treated with detorsion of the ovary or oophorectomy. Oophorectomy is the most common procedure performed by pediatric general surgeons for ovarian torsion. The purpose of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to examine evidence from the medical literature and provide recommendations regarding the optimal treatment of ovarian torsion.

Using PRISMA guidelines, six questions were addressed by searching Medline, Cochrane, Embase Central, and National Clearinghouse databases using relevant search terms. Risks of ovarian detorsion, including thromboembolism and malignancy, indications for oophoropexy, benefits of detorsion including recovery of function and subsequent fertility, and recommended surveillance after detorsion were evaluated. Consensus recommendations were derived for each question based on the best available evidence.

Ninety-six studies were included. Risks of ovarian detorsion, such as thromboembolism and malignancy, were reviewed, demonstrating minimal evidence for unknowingly leaving a malignancy behind in the salvaged ovary and no evidence in the literature of thromboembolic events after detorsion of a torsed ovary. There is no clear evidence supporting the benefit of oophoropexy following a single episode of ovarian torsion. The gross appearance of the ovary does not correlate with long-term ovarian viability or function.

### Paediatric cystic ovarian torsion masquerading appendicitis [^116t9eg4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Regardless of the underlying pathology, it was clear operative management was needed in this case. In the absence of a dedicated paediatric surgical service, an open approach is commonly adopted, especially in smaller patients. This patient may have benefited from a laparoscopic approach, as it would have facilitated quick identification of the underlying pathology, and management could have proceeded without extending the incision. Nonetheless, the patient has recovered well and her follow-up imaging has shown promising results for future fertility.

- **Patient's perspective**: When I was informed that my daughter's pain had not been caused by appendicitis but due to her right cystic ovary having twisted, although I was relieved the cause had been discovered and rectified, I also felt confused as to how a large cyst had developed in her ovary at such a young age, and concerned about her future fertility prospects.

- **Learning points**: Ovarian torsion should always be considered as a differential diagnosis in all female patients with acute right iliac fossa pain and raised inflammatory markers. Ultrasound scans can be particularly useful in the female population; however, it can be overlooked in children with typical features of appendicitis. A laparoscopic approach can help identify pelvic pathology mimicking appendicitis; however, outside of centres for paediatric surgery, often an open approach is preferred, particularly in younger and smaller children. Attempts should be made to salvage torted ovaries regardless of the appearance. A follow-up ultrasound must be arranged to ensure ongoing patient health and assessment.

### The diagnostic challenge of identifying isolated fallopian tube torsion: A case report of laparoscopic management [^1157BK5w]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Torsion of adnexal structures is a relatively uncommon occurrence. Isolated fallopian tube torsion is an even rarer gynecologic cause of acute low abdominal pain. Diagnosis of this condition is frequently delayed because of its rarity and the prolonged investigations required to rule out more common causes of acute abdominal pain on a differential diagnosis. A case of a 32-year-old woman with isolated right fallopian tube torsion managed laparoscopically is presented.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part I: corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, genital causes of haemoperitoneum and adnexal torsion [^116gxHBz]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Ultrasound (US) represents the primary imaging modality to assess ovarian torsion. During ovarian torsion, due to the aforementioned dual blood supply, color Doppler US may still demonstrate some arterial vascular flow. Nevertheless, in the presence of suggestive clinical and imaging findings, this persistence of adnexal vascularization does not rule out torsion.

After inconclusive US (lesion not clearly depicted or ambiguous findings), in premenopausal women, MRI represents the better technique to assess suspected adnexal torsion (AT), but CT is often performed in patients with alternative presumptive diagnoses. At CT, the unilaterally enlarged ovary (usually greater than 5 cm) is displaced from its expected site and often located on the midline, and the uterus is attracted towards the ipsilateral side by the shortened adnexal ligament. The edematous ovary may show eccentric or concentric wall thickening or a 'target-like' pattern corresponding to peripheral displacement of follicles. Congested, enhancing ovarian blood vessels are generally seen. In this regard, it should be recalled that the pathognomonic twisted pedicle usually shows a spiral configuration, but may also present as a solid-like component adjacent to the ovarian mass. Pelvic free fluid and inflammatory fat stranding are generally present. In full-blown AT, hemorrhage appears as a hyperattenuating area and adnexal contrast enhancement is minimal or absent. When present, a mature cystic teratoma shows calcifications, foci of fat attenuation, and enhancing mural nodules.

### Ovarian torsion among girls presenting with abdominal pain: a retrospective cohort study [^111P5YoE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion (OT) is an important cause of abdominal pain in girls. Prompt recognition of OT may lead to higher rates of ovarian salvage.

- **Objective**: To identify clinical and laboratory findings that may indicate OT among girls with abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on two cohorts of girls aged 5–17 years admitted to a children's hospital. Cohort 1 comprised girls admitted with abdominal pain from the emergency department in 2008. Cohort 2 included girls with a discharge diagnosis of OT from 2003 to 2009.

- **Results**: In Cohort 1, 325 girls were admitted from the emergency department with abdominal pain during 2008. Of these, 9 (3%) were diagnosed with OT. In Cohort 2, 37 girls were diagnosed with OT between 2003 and 2009. Clinical or laboratory features differentiating OT from all abdominal pain could not be identified. A comparison of girls admitted with confirmed appendicitis showed that OT was more likely to be associated with a mass (RR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 17) and less likely to be associated with anorexia (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93), guarding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85), an elevated C-reactive protein (RR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83), or leucocytosis (RR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78). Findings were similar in girls with an admission diagnosis of 'possible appendicitis'.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical or laboratory features that would identify cases of OT among girls admitted with abdominal pain could not be identified. Some findings help to differentiate OT from appendicitis, but there is a large degree of overlap. OT is an uncommon condition but has important management implications.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^116CFuFc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

- **Treatment indications**: Goals of treatment for endometrioma include relieving symptoms, ruling out malignancy, treating or preventing ovarian torsion, improving fertility outcomes, preserving ovarian hormonal function, and minimizing recurrence. Because ovarian endometriomas are rarely isolated and more commonly occur concurrently with nonovarian endometriosis, surgical excision of both ovarian and nonovarian lesions is often indicated.

In some circumstances, surveillance may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients who are evaluated to be at low risk for torsion or malignancy based on mass size (generally less than 5 cm), appearance, and patient characteristics, including age and family history.

### Factors associated with torsion in pediatric patients with ovarian masses [^114jD5g2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Low credibility.

Management of ovarian torsion has evolved toward ovarian preservation regardless of ovarian appearance during surgery. However, patients with torsion and an ovarian neoplasm undergo a disproportionately high rate of oophorectomy. Our objectives were to identify factors associated with ovarian torsion among females with an ovarian mass and to determine if torsion is associated with malignancy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of females aged 2–21 years who underwent an operation for an ovarian cyst or neoplasm between 2010 and 2016 at 10 children's hospitals was performed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with torsion. Imaging data were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value in identifying ovarian torsion.

- **Results**: Of 814 girls with an ovarian neoplasm, 180 (22%) had torsion. In risk-adjusted analyses, patients with a younger age, mass size greater than 5 cm, abdominal pain, and vomiting had an increased likelihood of torsion (P < 0.05). Specifically, patients with a mass size greater than 5 cm had two times the odds of torsion (odds ratio: 2.1; confidence interval: 1.2, 3.6). Imaging was not reliable at identifying torsion (sensitivity 34%, positive predictive value 49%) or excluding torsion (specificity 72%, negative predictive value 87%). The rates of malignancy were lower in those with an ovarian mass and torsion than those without torsion (10% versus 17%, P = 0.01). Among the 180 girls with torsion and a mass, 48% underwent oophorectomy, of which 14% (n = 12) had a malignancy.

- **Conclusions**: In females with an ovarian neoplasm, torsion is not conclusively associated with malignancy, providing important insights into surgical decision-making processes.

### Twist and shout! Pediatric ovarian torsion clinical update and case discussion [^115gcChy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion (OT) in the pediatric patient is an uncommon event and presents a challenging diagnosis. Clinicians caring for children in acute settings should be aware of the symptoms and diagnostic findings associated with OT. All patients suspected of having OT require consultation with gynecology. However, some controversy exists regarding the best operative intervention. In this article, case discussions serve as a platform for exploring the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of pediatric OT, as well as reviewing the latest evidence related to its diagnosis and treatment.

### Adnexal torsion — a multimodality imaging review [^117F8WFt]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Adnexal torsion is a gynecological surgical emergency. Prompt restoration of ovarian blood flow may prevent permanent irreversible damage. Patients frequently present with non-specific symptoms and signs; therefore, adnexal torsion is often an unexpected radiological diagnosis. Although ultrasound is the initial imaging technique of choice in suspected adnexal torsion, many patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) either as a first-line test following non-specific presentation or as a confirmatory test following equivocal ultrasound findings. Using multiple techniques, this review illustrates the wide variety of imaging features observed in adnexal torsion, enabling a confident diagnosis that may result in a more favorable surgical outcome.

### A tale of 2 torsions: Ovarian torsion in infants and toddlers [^115jrnAY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common chief complaint in both the emergency department and the primary care setting. Although most patients are ultimately diagnosed with benign, self-limited conditions, the differential diagnosis in infants and toddlers does include ovarian torsion. In this article, we present two cases involving female infants younger than 18 months who were found to have ovarian torsion during evaluation in our pediatric emergency department. We discuss the clinical presentation, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and potential long-term complications of ovarian torsion, with special attention to the younger population.

### Ovarian torsion: Incremental role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound [^113d9cBa]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

We highlight the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a supplementary modality to ultrasound (USG) examination in ovarian torsion in this case report. The reported patient had a clinical history suspicious for ovarian torsion; however, USG and Doppler flow study findings were equivocal. CEUS was performed to resolve the diagnostic dilemma and assess the status of ovarian parenchymal viability. It revealed non-enhancement of the ovarian cyst wall and pedicle throughout the USG examination, thus establishing the diagnosis of non-viable or infarcted ovarian parenchyma. The per-operative and histopathology findings were consistent with our CEUS findings. CEUS is an emerging promising modality that provides information regarding parenchymal perfusion, resulting in a reliable diagnosis of ovarian torsion, along with information on ovarian parenchymal viability. This ability makes CEUS equivalent to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler; however, it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

- **Case report**: We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized. The patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### Acute adnexa with preserved flow to the ovary: Could isolated tubal torsion be the cause [^1129jGwq]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Isolated tubal torsion (ITT) is a surgical emergency that is less well characterized than ovarian torsion and presents with its own diagnostic challenges. We retrospectively examined patients with ITT and compared them to patients with ovarian torsion to better understand the unique features of this pathophysiologic process.

The medical records of patients who were identified as having ITT or ovarian torsion intraoperatively between January 2019 and November 2022 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical documentation, diagnostic imaging reports, operative reports, and pathology results were collected.

A total of 82 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 62 (75.6%) had ovarian torsion, and 20 (24.4%) had ITT. Most patients (63.4%) underwent two or more imaging studies prior to the operating room. A diagnosis of torsion occurred more often on preoperative imaging for the ovarian torsion group (67.7% ovarian torsion vs. 35.0% ITT, P = .01). Doppler flow to the ovary was expectedly absent in 65.9% of ovarian torsion patients but interestingly also absent in 25% of ITT patients (P = .01). Patients with ovarian torsion were more likely to have ovarian cysts (56.5% vs. 10.0%, P < .001), while patients with ITT were significantly more likely to have a paratubal cyst (90.0% vs. 38.7%, P < .001).

ITT is a surgical emergency that poses a risk to future fertility. Ultrasound studies, including Doppler, may not be as definitive in patients with ITT, and early cross-sectional imaging should be considered. When there is a high clinical suspicion, timely intervention is crucial for preserving future reproductive potential.

### Asynchronous bilateral ovarian torsion. A case report and mini review [^116osD2v]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Adnexal torsion is a serious condition, and a delay in surgical intervention may result in the loss of the ovary. Children and adolescents who have suffered from uterine adnexal torsion may be at risk for asynchronous torsion of the contralateral adnexa.

- **Case**: We report the case of asynchronous bilateral ovarian torsion in a 9-year-old girl, resulting in right and subsequently left salpingo-oophorectomy.

- **Conclusion**: The diagnosis of ovarian torsion often is delayed. When ovarian torsion is suspected, laparoscopy should be performed without delay, and conservative management should be strongly considered to prevent surgical castration. Oophoropexy of the ipsilateral and contralateral ovary should be considered to prevent a retorsion.

### Prevalence of abnormal CT findings in patients with proven ovarian torsion and a proposed triage schema [^112wEude]. Emergency Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Many women with ovarian torsion present with nonspecific abdominal or pelvic pain and initially receive computed tomography (CT). We hypothesize that the CT scans performed on these women will all show abnormalities of the involved ovary. Our purpose is to review cases of surgically proven ovarian torsion at our institution over the last 20 years, assessing CT findings in women with ovarian torsion. A retrospective review of all patients at our institution with surgically proven ovarian torsion from 1985 to 2005 was conducted. Two physicians reviewed available CT reports, and a radiologist reviewed all available images.

CT was obtained in 33% of the 167 patients. Dictated reports were available for 28 studies; all described an enlarged ovary, ovarian cyst, or adnexal mass of the involved ovary. Radiologist review of the available CT images confirmed these findings. This series supports the claim that a CT scan with well-visualized, normal-appearing ovaries rules out ovarian torsion. In contrast, abnormal pelvic findings or the failure to visualize the ovaries in women with pelvic pain necessitates further evaluation for torsion.

Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

At the occasion of the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) annual meeting in 2015, held in Graz, Austria, the newly termed ESPR Abdominal (gastrointestinal and genitourinary) Imaging Task Force set out to complete the suggestions for paediatric urogenital imaging and procedural recommendations. Some of the last missing topics were addressed, and proposals on the imaging of children with anorectal and cloacal malformations and suspected ovarian torsion were issued after intense discussions and a consensus-finding process that considered all evidence.

Additionally, the terminology was adapted to fit new developments, introducing the term "pelvicalyceal dilatation/distension (PCD)" instead of the sometimes misunderstood "hydronephrosis". The present state of paediatric urogenital radiology was discussed in a dedicated minisymposium, which included an attempt to adapt terminology to create a standardised glossary.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: Ovarian torsion [^1141B5FE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed condition with a high rate of morbidity.

- **Objective**: This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of ovarian torsion, including presentation, evaluation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on evidence.

- **Discussion**: Ovarian torsion is one of the most common gynecological surgical emergencies and occurs with the complete or partial rotation of the ovary along the supporting ligaments, obstructing vascular flow. Several risk factors include the presence of an ovarian mass or cyst. The most commonly affected population includes reproductive-aged women, though cases also occur in premenarchal females, pregnant women, and postmenopausal women. Abdominal or pelvic pain is common but is not always sudden in onset or severe. Nausea and vomiting occur in 70% of cases. Ultrasound can assist with diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast can assist with diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent gynecologic consultation for surgical detorsion, along with symptomatic therapy in the ED.

- **Conclusions**: An understanding of ovarian torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Fertility preserving management of ovarian torsion [^114E6io9]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

To analyze characteristics of acute and chronic ovarian torsion, review treatment recommendations, and present possible surgical techniques for fertility preservation in young women, a literature review was conducted alongside a demonstration of perioperative management using radiologic images and intraoperative video footage. Ovarian torsion is mostly mentioned in the context of gynecologic emergencies, where acute ovarian torsion with arterial obstruction leads to ovarian ischemia and necrosis. However, ovarian torsion can also occur as a partial or intermittent torsion with venous and lymphatic obstruction, followed by ovarian swelling. In both cases, surgical management of ovarian torsion commonly includes oophorectomy, although leading guidelines recommend preservation of the ovary. The aim was to raise awareness for the clinical features of ovarian torsion and demonstrate adequate perioperative management, thereby avoiding surgical overtreatment in young women.

The study was conducted at the Medical University of Vienna, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Two cases were presented: one of acute ovarian torsion with a consequently ischemic ovary and another of chronic ovarian torsion with massive ovarian edema. The patients included in this video gave consent for publication and posting of the video online, including platforms such as social media, the journal website, and scientific literature websites (e.g. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, etc).

Laparoscopic management with detorsion of the torquated ovaries, cystectomy, and ovarian tissue preservation was employed.

### Acute pelvic pain [^1138fCzn]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain has gynecologic and nongynecologic causes, and distinguishing between them can be difficult in the emergency department. Conditions such as ovarian cysts, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for emergency physicians to identify. While pelvic pathologic conditions can be readily assessed with ultrasound, this method has significant limitations. Notably, adnexal torsion can occur despite normal vasculature on ultrasound with Doppler; thus, patients with significant pain or risk factors may require exploratory laparotomy. Emergency physicians and clinicians must be prepared to manage all aspects of pelvic emergencies, encompassing both gynecologic and nongynecologic issues.

### Ovarian torsion: Diagnosis of inclusion mandates earlier intervention [^111XZChq]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of ovarian torsion (OT) is often delayed because of diagnostic uncertainty and reliance on radiologic confirmation. In contrast, when testicular torsion (TT) is suspected, diagnosis and management are expedited despite the lack of certainty, and operative exploration is not delayed by radiologic investigations. We compared the management of torsion in both sexes to define a better clinical pathway for suspected OT.

- **Methods**: A 2.5-year review of the Pediatric Health Information System database was performed to determine the incidence of TT and OT at large children's hospitals. Additionally, a 10-year retrospective review of children (0–19 years) diagnosed with TT or OT at a single academic center was conducted to identify differences in diagnosis and management and determine the impact on gonadal salvage rates.

- **Results**: The incidence of TT was comparable with OT in the Pediatric Health Information System database (0.03% vs. 0.02%). A total of 158 patients with TT and 90 patients with OT were managed at our center, with a median age of 12 years in both groups. Boys presented earlier after the onset of pain (36 vs. 72 hours, P < .0001) and were imaged more quickly (0.77 vs. 1.86 hours, P < .0001). Time to the operating room (OR) was also shorter for TT (2.3 vs. 6.3 hours, P < .0001). The salvage rate for TT was 30.3% vs. 14.4% for OT (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: Girls with suspected OT waited 2.5 times as long for diagnostic imaging and 2.7 times as long to be taken to the operating room. In addition, the gonadal salvage rate was significantly worse for girls compared with boys with TT.

### Paediatric cystic ovarian torsion masquerading appendicitis [^115Xu82b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In the paediatric population, torsion of the ovary is rare, with an incidence of around 5 in 100,000. While ovarian cysts measuring 1 cm or less have a prevalence in the prepubertal population of 2%–5%, cysts greater than 2 cm are considered to be rare. Some cysts are hormonally active and facilitate the development of sexual characteristics. Cysts greater than 2 cm require follow-up until regression is seen due to their risk of torsion.

Ovarian torsions usually present with a sudden onset of abdominal pain and may be a differential diagnosis of an acute surgical abdomen. Torsion usually results from twisting of the ligamentous support that results in venous congestion. The condition has previously been managed with an oophorectomy; however, a systematic review has shown that detorsion alone is sufficient, with promising results for future fertility.

### Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy [^113g1Skt]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is increased during pregnancy and complicates 1 in 800 pregnancies. Torsion can also occur in a normal ovary, usually the right one. Ovarian torsion most often occurs between 6 and 14 weeks' gestation, when uterine enlargement is most rapid.

The pelvic transvaginal ultrasound represents the first step in diagnosis: initially, it is possible to observe an increase in ovarian volume, with displaced follicles on the edge. Hyperechoic areas, which are signs of bleeding infarction, might be associated with hypoechoic areas indicating interstitial oedema in the ovary. In 94% of cases, the absence of venous flow is highly predictive of ovarian torsion; however, the opinion on the role of pulsed Doppler or color Doppler is discordant. Although in the presence of an enlarged, oedematous, and painful ovary, the absence of flow is highly suggestive of adnexal torsions.

When ultrasound diagnosis is challenging, MRI can be utilized. MRI findings could include an oedematous and thick vascular pedicle with haemorrhagic signal intensities within the ovary. It is recommended to perform a T1- and fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequence to detect haemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted images can be employed to detect the absence of vascular supply.

MRI imaging features of ovarian torsion include an enlarged ovary and a thickened, twisted fallopian tube. On T1-weighted images, the signal intensity varies according to the age of internal blood products. Late torsion demonstrates increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images due to necrosis.

### What every radiologist should know about adnexal torsion [^116uPonE]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Adnexal torsion is the fifth most common gynecologic surgical emergency, requiring clinician and radiologist awareness. It involves the rotation of the ovarian tissue on its vascular pedicle, leading to stromal edema, hemorrhagic infarction, and necrosis of the adnexal structures with the subsequent sequelae. Expedient diagnosis poses a difficult challenge because the clinical presentation is variable and often misleading. Adnexal torsion can mimic malignancy as it can take a subacute, intermittent, or chronic course and, thereby, can be complicated to diagnose. The torsion may occur in the normal ovary but is usually secondary to a preexisting adnexal mass. Early surgery is necessary to avoid irreversible adnexal damage and to preserve ovarian function, especially in children and young women.

Pelvic ultrasound forms the foundation of diagnostic evaluation due to its ability to directly and rapidly evaluate both ovarian anatomy and perfusion. Moreover, it is a noninvasive and accessible technique. However, the color Doppler appearance of the ovary should not be relied upon to rule out torsion because a torsed ovary or adnexa may still have preserved arterial flow due to the dual blood supply. MR and CT may be used as problem-solving tools needed after the ultrasound examination but should not be the first-line imaging modalities in this setting due to ionizing radiation and potential time delay in diagnosis. The goal of this article is to review the adnexal anatomy, familiarize radiologists with the main imaging features, and discuss the main mimickers and the most common presentations.

### Paediatric cystic ovarian torsion masquerading appendicitis [^112ySAhd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of right iliac fossa pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. Clinical examination supported a diagnosis of appendicitis. The patient was taken to theatre for an open appendicectomy the following morning. Intraoperatively, a right-sided ovarian haemorrhagic cyst with 360 degrees torsion was discovered. The ovary was torted along with the cyst. Both were detorted, and the abdomen was closed. The patient was discharged 48 hours later, with gynaecology outpatient follow-up scheduled for 6–8 weeks later. Paediatric ovarian torsions caused by a haemorrhagic cyst greater than 2 cm are rare. This case discusses an atypical presentation of ovarian torsion and how the clinical presentation can mimic appendicitis.

### Ovarian torsion: Management and ovarian prognosis: A report of 45 cases [^111WuvE1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion in childhood and adolescence is a rare entity. Traditionally, the treatment is oophorectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate ovarian outcomes and propose a decision-making protocol for suspected ovarian torsion.

- **Methods**: Between January 1986 and December 2007, 45 ovarian torsion cases in 40 girls were operated on. In all the cases, when the ovary was preserved, patients were clinically and ultrasonographically followed up for several months.

- **Results**: The median age was 11 years. The median delay between the first symptoms and the surgical procedure was 3 days. There was a statistical difference (P = .0003) between the mean of the largest diameter of the twisted normal ovary and the mean of the largest diameter of the twisted diseased ovary. Underlying pathology was benign in 22 cases and low-grade malignancy in 2 (one grade II immature teratoma and one steroid cell tumor). Conservative management was performed in 26 cases. At follow-up, 17 ovaries were follicular, 7 being black-bluish during surgery.

- **Conclusions**: A conservative approach after detorsion of black-bluish ovaries is safe and effective in children. Although very unlikely, the fear of missing malignancy must incite caution and can lead, when the size of the twisted ovary is greater than 75 mm, to prefer laparotomy to laparoscopy.

### Acute ovarian torsion in an infant: Diagnostic clues on supine and decubitus abdominal radiographs confirmed by ultrasound [^112Urbg2]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Acute ovarian torsion is an uncommon yet important diagnostic consideration in any female pediatric patient presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 2-month-old infant presented to the emergency department with a several-day history of constipation. Evaluation with plain radiographs demonstrated a subtle yet persistent soft tissue mass in the right pelvis. Follow-up ultrasound revealed characteristic findings for ovarian torsion, and subsequent salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, confirming the diagnosis. Acute ovarian torsion is an uncommon and frequently overlooked diagnosis in female infants presenting with gastrointestinal or urinary tract symptoms. Careful assessment of plain radiographic findings may aid in the further management of this difficult diagnosis in female infants. Ultrasound is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

### Paediatric cystic ovarian torsion masquerading appendicitis [^115wV71H]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old girl presented to the accident and emergency department in the evening with a 2-day history of worsening right-sided abdominal pain. The pain was non-migratory in nature and was associated with anorexia, a single episode of diarrhea, and vomiting. This was the first time she had experienced this pain. The patient was fit and well with no other medical conditions and was premenarcheal. Her mother provided an uneventful perinatal and family history.

On assessment by the surgical team, the patient was found to be feverish with a temperature of 38.1°C. She displayed generalized tenderness over her lower abdomen, particularly in the right iliac fossa. Her blood analysis revealed an inflammatory response with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19 x 10^9/L and C-reactive protein of 62 mg/L. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics. As she remained clinically stable overnight, a plan was made to perform an open appendicectomy the following morning.

Intraoperatively, she was found to have an appendix adhering to the posterior aspect of the cecum, which appeared macroscopically normal. While no free fluid was identified, mesenteric lymph nodes of the small bowel were noticed, and no Meckel's diverticulum was found. A decision was made to remove the appendix.

Before closure, a limited inspection of the pelvis was performed through the right iliac fossa wound. This revealed a suspicious black lesion, prompting the extension of the wound for further exploration. The patient was found to have a large hemorrhagic torted ovarian cyst measuring 7×.

### Imaging of acute pelvic pain in girls: Ovarian torsion and beyond [^1138rCSe]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Identifying the etiology of acute pelvic pain in girls is often clinically challenging. Particularly in young girls, it is often difficult to determine if acute pelvic symptoms are originating from a gynecologic source or from a genitourinary or gastrointestinal etiology based on the child's clinical examination alone. Therefore, imaging plays a key role in establishing a diagnosis and directing medical and surgical treatment.

Pediatric gynecologic conditions, which can present acutely with pain or a mass, or both, include ovarian torsion, hematometrocolpos, pelvic inflammatory disease, inguinal hernias containing an ovary or the uterus or both, adnexal cysts, pregnancy, vaginal foreign bodies, and ovarian vein thrombosis. Sources of pelvic pain in girls from nongynecologic etiologies include appendicitis, distal ureterolithiasis, and Crohn's disease.

Owing to the lack of ionizing radiation, widespread availability, and lack of need for sedation, gray scale with color Doppler ultrasound examination is often the initial imaging obtained when there is suspicion of gynecologic pathology. Radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis are commonly used in the acute setting when there is concern for a bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is used when the diagnosis remains unknown and to clarify findings found on ultrasound and radiographs.

Correctly identifying and diagnosing the causes of acute pelvic pain in girls is crucial for the care of these patients.

### Case report: ovarian torsion in pregnancy - diagnosis and management [^113Vnt4Q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion (OT) is one of the most common gynecologic surgical emergencies. All age groups can be affected, but ovarian stimulation, as found during early pregnancy or infertility treatment, is a major risk factor. Diagnosing OT in early pregnancy can be challenging. Patients frequently present with abdominal pain and non-specific symptoms. A missed diagnosis of OT could lead not only to ovarian necrosis and sepsis but also threaten the pregnancy. The objective of this article is to present a case of OT in early pregnancy and to review its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

A 30-year-old woman at 10 weeks gestational age presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a two-hour duration of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was not on ovarian stimulation treatments. A bedside ED ultrasound showed an enlarged edematous right ovary with a large cyst, but without flow on color Doppler. Immediate obstetric consultation was initiated. An eventual radiology ultrasound showed decreased but present flow in the right ovary. The patient underwent emergent laparoscopic surgery, during which the necrotic right ovary was removed. She was placed on progesterone therapy upon hospital discharge and eventually delivered a healthy term infant.

Ovarian torsion in pregnancy is increasing in frequency due to the growing prevalence of ovarian stimulation treatment. Although diagnostic ultrasound is a frequently used imaging tool in patients with suspected OT, the mere presence of blood flow on Doppler ultrasonography of the adnex does not rule out the condition.

### Emergency laparoscopy for suspected ovarian torsion: are we too hasty to operate [^115wZ4XB]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to reevaluate the rate of correct diagnosis of ovarian torsion (OT) in our department. The study design was a retrospective computerized chart review conducted at a tertiary referral center. It involved seventy-eight women who underwent laparoscopy for suspected OT, with the intervention being laparoscopy. The main outcome measures were the rate of true diagnosis of torsion and the correlation with Doppler studies.

The results indicated that the preoperative diagnosis of OT was confirmed in only 36 (46.1%) of the patients. An immediate operation (< 10 hours) after admission (n = 48) was associated with a statistically significantly higher likelihood of operatively confirming OT (56.2% vs. 28.6%). It was found that the lack of ovarian blood flow on Doppler sonography was a good predictor of OT; women with pathologic flow were statistically significantly more likely to have OT (77% vs. 29%). The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal ovarian flow for OT were 43.8% and 91.7%, respectively, with a positive and negative predictive value of 78% and 71%, respectively.

Despite 20 years of research, the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of OT remains low. The urge to operate can be attributed to the importance of preserving ovarian function in young women as well as to the availability and the low associated complication rate of laparoscopy.

### Oophoropexy to round ligament for recurrent ovarian torsion [^114w3KMY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency commonly affecting women of reproductive age, often associated with ovarian or paraovarian masses. However, in the absence of these masses, torsion can still occur, potentially indicating an underlying anatomical abnormality that predisposes to retorsion. This report presents a distinctive surgical technique used in a young girl in her early adolescence with recurrent right ovarian torsion. The patient, with a history of torsion managed by detorsion, presented again with symptoms suggestive of recurrence. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a twisted but viable right ovary at risk of future torsion. To prevent recurrence, a new approach was employed: the right ovarian ligament was plicated with 2–0 prolene, and the ovary was fixed to the right round ligament. The procedure successfully stabilized the ovary and prevented further torsion. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. This case demonstrates the potential of oophoropexy as an effective technique for managing recurrent ovarian torsion in adolescents.

### Ovarian torsion: To pex or not to pex? Case report and review of the literature [^115Tvx4k]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 7-year-old girl who underwent laparoscopic ovariopexy for a suspected ovarian torsion following a previous oophorectomy. We consider the role of elective ovariopexy of the contralateral ovary in the case of adnexal torsion.

- **Design**: Case study and review of the literature.

- **Result**: There was evidence to suggest a very recent adnexal torsion and an unusually long ovarian pedicle, with a possible familial linkage. The patient underwent laparoscopic ovariopexy for the remaining normal ovary, which was found to be loosely twisted at operation. After detorsion, ovariopexy was performed laparoscopically by suturing the ovary to the back of the uterus. There are no other descriptions in the literature of a familial linkage with ovarian torsion.

- **Conclusion**: The case presented reminds doctors of the strong possibility of ovarian torsion in young girls presenting with pelvic pain. Laparoscopic ovariopexy for the contralateral ovary should be considered in all women with evidence of torsion, including children and adolescents, as is standard for testicular torsion.

### No. 341-diagnosis and management of adnexal torsion in children, adolescents, and adults [^111zWBfi]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for adnexal torsion, specifically with respect to surgical detorsion and cystectomy, technical considerations indicate that the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend performing oophorectomy rather than cystectomy only in postmenopausal patients with ovarian torsion due to the increased risk of malignancy.

### Non-visualization of the ovaries on pediatric transabdominal ultrasound with a non-distended bladder: Can adnexal torsion be excluded [^115543zt]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric reproductive organs are optimally imaged with a full bladder. However, the filling of the bladder often leads to significant delay in diagnosis and can subject the patient to invasive bladder catheterization. Since the key imaging feature in ovarian torsion is unilateral ovarian enlargement, we suspected that a torsed ovary is large enough to be visualized even if the bladder is not well distended.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate if clinically suspected adnexal torsion can be excluded based on non-visualization of the ovaries on transabdominal ultrasound (US) with a non-distended bladder in pediatric patients.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study comprised 349 girls (1–19 years old) between January 1, 2013, and July 30, 2018. Three hundred and forty-one of the girls were referred to transabdominal US to assess for adnexal torsion and/or appendicitis, and the ovaries were initially not visualized on US. Their bladders were subsequently filled and rescanned with a distended bladder showing the ovaries. Ovarian volumes and time between US scans were documented. The ratio of the volume of the larger ovary to the smaller one was calculated. Nine girls had surgically proven adnexal torsion and a preoperative transabdominal US with a non-distended bladder. There was an overlap of one girl between the two groups. The negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and sensitivity and specificity for exclusion of adnexal torsion based on non-visualization of the ovaries on US with a non-distended bladder were evaluated.

### Ovarian torsion in prepubertal girls: Clinical characteristics, biological and radiological features, recurrence rate [^115GKHVR]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ovarian torsion is often delayed among prepubertal girls, and the management after surgical detorsion is poorly codified. We explored the French experience over the last two decades.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted in French pediatric surgery centers from January 2000 to December 2022, focusing on girls presenting with at least one episode of ovarian torsion in the prepubertal period. Data collected included patient history, symptomatology, biological and imaging assessment at the first episode, emergency surgery details, and follow-up, including recurrence.

- **Results**: Thirty centers participated, including 502 girls who were diagnosed with ovarian torsion during a surgical procedure performed due to abdominal pain (with or without an ovarian mass). The mean age was 7.9 years (± 2.8), with a median age of 8.3 years (Q1 5.97; Q3 10.12) at the first episode. Nausea or vomiting occurred in 71% of cases. Fever was present in 23% of cases, more frequently appearing 24 hours after the onset of abdominal pain. In 20 cases (4%), a review of patient history revealed early puberty signs; some had estrogen levels exceeding the 97th percentile and were referred to endocrinologists to assess hormonal anomalies. Of the 482 girls without oophoropexy after the first torsion episode, 71 (14.7%) experienced at least one recurrence. Among them, 10 (7.5%) had an ovarian mass and 42 (55%) had enlarged ovaries.

- **Conclusion**: Symptoms of ovarian torsion in prepubertal girls are not specific. Clinicians should be aware of this insidious presentation.
