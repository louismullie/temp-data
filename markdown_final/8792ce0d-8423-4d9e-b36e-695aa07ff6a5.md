## Question

Cetirizine and benedryl together

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cetirizine and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) should be used together, and if so, when and how to do it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and receptor overlap to assess redundancy. Then, I should verify what guidelines and trials say about combining first- and second-generation H1 antihistamines. Next, I will review safety, sedation, and anticholinergic risks. After that, I should identify clinical scenarios where combination therapy is reasonable versus discouraged. Finally, I will outline practical dosing, monitoring, and counseling if combination is used, and close with a bottom-line recommendation anchored to evidence and labeling.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basics. Both cetirizine and diphenhydramine are H1-receptor antagonists; cetirizine is a second-generation agent with minimal CNS penetration and once-daily dosing, whereas diphenhydramine is a first-generation agent with prominent sedation and anticholinergic effects and a shorter duration necessitating multiple daily doses, so mechanistically there is substantial overlap and potential for additive CNS depression without clear receptor-level synergy [^113qhkYa] [^112Fi6oM] [^112DpFCV].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on combining different H1 antihistamines. Contemporary urticaria guidance emphasizes that if symptoms are refractory, the preferred strategy is to up-dose a single second-generation antihistamine rather than combine agents, because H1 receptors may already be saturated and the clinical benefit of mixing sedating and nonsedating H1 blockers is likely limited; moreover, there are no robust trials showing superiority of combination therapy over optimized monotherapy dosing [^1129cT5F] [^111a5Zze]. I should also note that in desensitization protocols for drug hypersensitivity, both agents may be used sequentially or adjunctively, but that is a specialized, monitored setting rather than routine outpatient care [^114QG6ns].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check safety signals. Diphenhydramine carries meaningful sedation and performance impairment, with additive CNS effects when combined with other sedatives, and it is associated with excess injuries in real-world cohorts; cetirizine is less sedating but not devoid of somnolence, and combining the two predictably increases CNS depression and anticholinergic burden, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^117JCwnR] [^112tAyQ1] [^111TTiy9] [^114YZiRh]. I should double-check the anticholinergic risk as well; diphenhydramine has high anticholinergic activity and is flagged in geriatric safety guidance as increasing delirium risk, reinforcing caution with combination use [^116NTHBQ] [^116hYN65].

> Let me consider when combination therapy might still be reasonable. In severe, refractory urticaria where optimized second-generation dosing has failed, a time-limited strategy of adding a sedating first-generation antihistamine at bedtime to a daytime second-generation agent can be considered to blunt nocturnal pruritus, but this should be individualized, monitored closely, and de-escalated if ineffective or if adverse effects emerge; outside of urticaria, some oncology and desensitization protocols pragmatically layer antihistamines for premedication, though evidence quality varies and this is not a blanket endorsement for routine combination [^1129cT5F] [^114QG6ns] [^115RwN1T]. But wait, what if the indication is anaphylaxis? I should confirm that H1 antihistamines are adjuncts only; epinephrine is first-line, and guidelines list either diphenhydramine or cetirizine as secondary options, not as a required combination, so stacking both is not standard of care in that setting either [^116C6rPZ].

> I will now examine practical guidance if, after shared decision-making, combination is used short term. A cautious approach is to maintain cetirizine at standard daytime dosing and add diphenhydramine at bedtime only, using the lowest effective diphenhydramine dose and reassessing within days for efficacy and tolerability; avoid daytime diphenhydramine when possible due to sedation and functional impairment, and counsel on additive effects with alcohol or other CNS depressants [^112tAyQ1] [^114YZiRh]. I should confirm that cetirizine can be dosed up to 20–40 mg/day in refractory urticaria per expert guidance, which often obviates the need for combination, and I need to ensure we screen for high anticholinergic risk, glaucoma, urinary retention, or cognitive vulnerability before layering a first-generation agent [^112DpFCV] [^114AjPJr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cetirizine's duration was uniformly 24 hours; let me verify pharmacokinetics. Cetirizine's half-life averages roughly 6–10 hours with once-daily dosing commonly effective due to sustained H1 blockade, whereas diphenhydramine's duration is shorter, typically necessitating every 4–6 hours dosing; this mismatch further weakens the rationale for chronic combination and supports using cetirizine as the backbone with selective, short-term bedtime diphenhydramine only if needed [^112DpFCV].

> Next, I should review special populations and monitoring. In older adults, avoid or minimize diphenhydramine because of delirium and fall risk, and be cautious even with cetirizine at higher doses; in pediatrics, weight-based diphenhydramine dosing is standard, but sedation and paradoxical excitation can occur, so combination therapy is rarely justified outside specialist-directed protocols; in pregnancy, cetirizine has reassuring safety data, whereas diphenhydramine is generally considered acceptable short term if needed, though non-sedating options are preferred when possible [^116NTHBQ] [^114AjPJr] [^114fuVnc].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. Routine combination of cetirizine and diphenhydramine is not recommended because of overlapping H1 antagonism, lack of proven added benefit over optimized second-generation dosing, and additive sedation and anticholinergic effects; instead, up-dose cetirizine to 20–40 mg/day if needed, consider adding an H2 blocker or a leukotriene antagonist in refractory urticaria, and reserve a short, bedtime-only diphenhydramine trial for severe nocturnal symptoms with close follow-up and prompt de-escalation if ineffective [^1129cT5F] [^113mdBKs] [^112DpFCV]. I should confirm that patients are counseled on impairment risks, fall prevention, and avoidance of CNS co-medications, and that we document the rationale if combination therapy is initiated, given the limited evidence base and potential harms [^112tAyQ1] [^114YZiRh].

It is **generally not recommended** to take cetirizine and Benadryl (diphenhydramine) together because both are H1 antihistamines and can cause additive sedation and anticholinergic effects [^1129cT5F]. If combined, use the lowest effective doses and avoid CNS depressants; monitor for **excessive drowsiness, confusion, and anticholinergic symptoms** [^112tAyQ1]. For severe urticaria, consider cetirizine alone at higher doses (up to 40 mg/day) [^112DpFCV] or add an H2 blocker (e.g. famotidine) rather than combining two H1 agents [^1129cT5F]. Avoid combination use in older adults, children, or those with CNS or respiratory conditions.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and overlap

Both cetirizine and diphenhydramine are H1 antihistamines; cetirizine is a second-generation agent with minimal CNS penetration and less sedation, whereas diphenhydramine is a first-generation agent with significant CNS penetration and sedation [^113qhkYa]. Their **overlapping mechanisms** can produce additive sedation and anticholinergic effects [^112tAyQ1].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no strong evidence** supporting routine combination use of cetirizine and diphenhydramine for allergic reactions or urticaria [^1129cT5F]. Guidelines recommend using second-generation antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine) as first-line therapy due to their favorable safety profiles and once-daily dosing [^113qhkYa]. If symptoms persist, increasing the dose of cetirizine (up to 40 mg/day) or adding an H2 antagonist (e.g. famotidine) is preferred over combining two H1 antihistamines [^112DpFCV] [^1129cT5F].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Combining cetirizine and diphenhydramine can lead to **additive sedation**, cognitive impairment, and anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision) [^112tAyQ1]. These risks are higher in older adults, children, and individuals with pre-existing CNS or respiratory conditions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination might be considered

In rare cases, short-term combination therapy may be considered for **severe, refractory urticaria** or angioedema when standard monotherapy fails. Even then, use the lowest effective doses, monitor closely, and limit duration.

---

## Alternative strategies

Preferred alternatives to combination therapy include:

- **Increase cetirizine dose**: Up to 40 mg/day for refractory symptoms [^112DpFCV].
- **Add H2 antagonist**: Famotidine or ranitidine can be added to cetirizine for additional histamine blockade [^113nkuXF].
- **Glucocorticoids**: Short courses of prednisone or methylprednisolone for severe flares [^112Xj7ff].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

Patient-specific factors should guide the decision to combine these medications:

| **Factor** | **Consideration** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults and children are at higher risk of sedation and anticholinergic effects [^114AjPJr] |
| Comorbidities | CNS disorders, respiratory conditions, and cardiovascular disease increase risk [^112tAyQ1] |
| Medication history | Concurrent CNS depressants, MAO inhibitors, or anticholinergics increase risk [^112tAyQ1] |
| Pregnancy | Cetirizine is preferred; diphenhydramine should be used cautiously |

---

## Clinical recommendations and precautions

If combination therapy is deemed necessary:

- **Lowest effective doses**: Use minimal effective doses of both medications.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for excessive sedation, cognitive impairment, and anticholinergic symptoms.
- **Avoid CNS depressants**: Do not combine with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids [^112tAyQ1].
- **Limit duration**: Use short-term only, with regular reassessment of need.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Routine allergic symptoms | Cetirizine alone; avoid combination |
| Severe, refractory urticaria | Increase cetirizine dose or add H2 antagonist |
| Short-term combination therapy | Use lowest effective doses, monitor closely, limit duration |
| Older adults, children, comorbidities | Avoid combination therapy |

---

Combining cetirizine and diphenhydramine is **generally not recommended** due to additive sedation and anticholinergic effects. Use cetirizine alone at higher doses or add an H2 antagonist if needed, and reserve combination therapy for rare, severe cases with close monitoring.

### Intravenous cetirizine versus intravenous diphenhydramine for the treatment of acute urticaria: a phase III randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^113Mcf9M]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Acute urticaria is a frequent presentation in emergency departments (EDs), urgent care centers, and other clinical arenas. Treatment options are limited if diphenhydramine is the only intravenous antihistamine offered because of its short duration of action and well-known adverse effects. We evaluate cetirizine injection, the first second-generation injectable antihistamine, for acute urticaria in this multicenter, randomized, noninferiority, phase 3 clinical trial.

Methods

Adult patients presenting to EDs and urgent care centers with acute urticaria requiring an intravenous antihistamine were randomized to either intravenous cetirizine 10 mg or intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg. The primary endpoint was the 2-hour pruritus score change from baseline, with time spent in treatment center and rate of return to treatment centers as key secondary endpoints. Frequency of sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects were also recorded.

Results

Among 262 enrolled patients, the 2-hour pruritus score change from baseline for intravenous cetirizine was statistically noninferior to that for intravenous diphenhydramine (-1.6 versus -1.5; 95% confidence interval -0.1 to 0.3), and in favor of cetirizine. Treatment differences also favored cetirizine for mean time spent in treatment center (1.7 versus 2.1 hours; p = 0.005), return to treatment center (5.5% versus 14.1%; p = 0.02), lower change from baseline sedation score at 2 hours (0.1 versus 0.5; p = 0.03), and adverse event rate (3.9% versus 13.3%).

Conclusion

Intravenous cetirizine is an effective alternative to intravenous diphenhydramine for treating acute urticaria, with benefits of less sedation, fewer adverse events, shorter time spent in treatment center, and lower rates of revisit to treatment center.

### Diphenhydramine: time to move on? [^116wECC1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine is one of the most widely available, longest-used antihistamine medications but has many side effects including sedation and risk of toxicity in overdose including cardiac toxicity. It is frequently inappropriately used when newer, more favorable antihistamine medications are available. Second-generation antihistamines are also widely available and affordable, with many of the same desired effects as diphenhydramine and fewer, if any, of the undesirable side effects. Because of the negative side effects and wide availability of alternative antihistamine medications, it is definitively time to move on from diphenhydramine.

### A randomized double-blind feasibility study comparing cetirizine and diphenhydramine in the prevention of paclitaxel-associated infusion-related reactions: the PREMED-F1 study [^116YiFgm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cetirizine is a less sedative alternative to diphenhydramine for the prevention of infusion-related reactions (IRR) to paclitaxel. However, its use remains controversial. In this study, we assessed feasibility for a future definitive non-inferiority trial comparing cetirizine to diphenhydramine as premedication to prevent paclitaxel-related IRR.

Methods

This was a single-center randomized prospective feasibility study. Participants were paclitaxel-naive cancer patients scheduled to start paclitaxel chemotherapy. They were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg+oral placebo (control) or intravenous placebo+oral cetirizine 10 mg (intervention) for their first two paclitaxel treatments. The percentage of eligible patients completing a first paclitaxel treatment and the recruitment rate were assessed (feasibility outcomes). Drowsiness was measured at baseline and at selected time points using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) (safety outcome). IRR events were also documented (efficacy outcome).

Results

Among 37 eligible patients, 27 were recruited and randomized (control 13; intervention 14) and 25 completed the study. The recruitment rate was 4.8 participants/month, meeting the primary feasibility target. Drowsiness was the main adverse effect associated with the premedication. The increase in drowsiness compared to baseline (ΔSSS) was greater in the diphenhydramine group compared to the cetirizine group (median ΔSSS 2 (IQR 3.25) vs median ΔSSS 0 (IQR 1), p < 0.01) when measured one hour after the premedication administration. One participant had an IRR and no unexpected serious adverse event occurred.

Conclusion

The trial methods were feasible in terms of recruitment, retention, and safety. Cetirizine was significantly less sedating than diphenhydramine. IRR were infrequent and a larger trial is warranted to confirm non-inferiority for IRR prevention.

### Sedation and performance impairment of diphenhydramine and second-generation antihistamines: a meta-analysis [^117JCwnR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antihistamines are among the most frequently used medications in the United States. Despite dramatically higher cost, second-generation antihistamines are replacing diphenhydramine because of the perception that they are not constrained by its sedating effects.

Objective

We sought to examine, through meta-analytic procedures, the collective evidence regarding the sedating and performance-impairing effects of diphenhydramine relative to placebo and second-generation antihistamines.

Methods

A search that began with the MEDLINE database was limited to those studies that included patients with atopic disease and control subjects, were blinded and randomized clinical trials, objectively examined alertness and psychomotor performance, reported means and variances, and were written in English. Information was systematically abstracted from the resulting 18 articles, and effect size was calculated.

Results

Diphenhydramine impaired performance relative to placebo control and second-generation antihistamines, including acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, and terfenadine. However, results were quite varied, the average sedating effect of diphenhydramine was modest, and in some instances results of tests of performance in the diphenhydramine group showed less sedation than in the control or second-generation antihistamine groups. A significant (P < .05) average effect size indicated a mild sedating effect caused by second-generation antihistamines in comparison with placebo.

Conclusion

The absence of a consistent finding of diphenhydramine-induced sedation is surprising given that most studies have been designed to increase the probability of this outcome, including administering a 50-mg dose. On the basis of this meta-analysis of performance-impairment trials, a clear and consistent distinction between sedating and nonsedating antihistamines does not exist.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^111Fm5tW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the United States and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome. However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion. In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established. However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough — despite an important sedative effect (dizziness) — especially in the United States. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR for the treatment of acute urticaria was demonstrated in a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, single dose, multicenter (US and Canada), parallel group trial in 262 patients 18 years of age and older presenting to Emergency Departments or Urgent care Centers (NCT02935699). Subjects were treated with 10 mg of QUZYTTIR or 50 mg diphenhydramine injection. Patients with acute urticaria with or without other diseases were enrolled, including patients with concomitant angioedema. The majority of the patients were Caucasian (48%) and female (63%) with a mean age of 39 years.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in patient-rated pruritus score assessed 2 hrs post treatment for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Pruritus was graded on a severity score of 0 to 3 with 0 = no pruritus, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The trial was non-inferiority design with the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.50 for the difference between treatment groups. Two key secondary efficacy outcome measures: (i) the need to return to any ED or clinic after patient discharge, and (ii) time spent at the treatment center (time from treatment administration to readiness for discharge) were adjusted for multiplicity.

Result for the change from baseline in the pruritus scores are shown in Table 1. The difference between treatment groups excluded the pre-specified non-inferiority margin, i.e. the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference of diphenhydramine minus QUZYTTIR did not include – 0.50. The primary efficacy data are presented in Table 1.

Additionally, in this trial the proportion of patients returning to any emergency department or clinic was lower in the QUZYTTIR treatment group (6%) compared to the diphenhydramine treatment group (14%), and the time spent in the treatment center (hours spent reported as mean (SD) was shorter in the QUZYTTIR treatment group (1.7 (0.9)) compared to the diphenhydramine treatment group (2.1 (1.1)).

### Premedication protocols to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy: a literature review [^111NmyBy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to chemotherapy may prevent patients from receiving the most effective therapy. This review was undertaken to identify evidence-based preventive premedication strategies that reduce the likelihood of HSR in the first instance and improve the safety of subsequent infusions in patients who have demonstrated HSR to a certain class of chemotherapy. PubMed was searched until October 2021 using the key words: "hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs", "hypersensitivity to antineoplastic agents", "taxanes hypersensitivity", "platinum compound hypersensitivity", "premedication", "dexamethasone", "prednisone", "hydrocortisone", "antihistamine", "diphenhydramine", "cetirizine", "famotidine", "meperidine", "aspirin", "ibuprofen", and "montelukast". The search was restricted to articles published in English. A total of 73 abstracts were selected for inclusion in the review. Most premedication regimens have been derived empirically rather than determined through randomized trials. Based on the available evidence, we provide an update on likely HSR mechanisms and a practical guide for classifying systemic HSR. The evidence indicates that a combination of prevention strategies using newer antihistamines, H2 antagonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids and other interventions used judiciously reduces the occurrence and severity of HSR and improves safety.

### Antihistamines: do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^111RPkEM]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is one of the most important steps in the phlogistic allergic reaction. Its activity is due to the link to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of second generation are the most currently prescribed drugs in allergic diseases for their high selectivity, little or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action and long half lives. Antihistamines can modulate part of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation reducing mediator release and expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the release of cytokines, chemokines and consequently inflammatory cells recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is considered too, as a main parameter in a global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^114WTwXp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QUZYTTIR

The safety data of QUZYTTIR was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, non-inferiority study comparing QUZYTTIR to intravenous diphenhydramine in 262 adults with acute urticaria.

The adverse reactions with QUZYTTIR occurred at an incidence of less than 1% and include: dyspepsia, feeling hot, dysgeusia, headache, paresthesia, presyncope, and hyperhidrosis.

An additional randomized, double-blind, single dose study was conducted in 33 adults which showed similar safety results.

Sedation

Subject-rated sedation scores were assessed at baseline, 1 hr, and/or 2 hrs, and/or "Readiness for Discharge". Sedation was rated on a 0 to 3 scale (0 = none, to 3 = severe) with lower sedation scores indicating less sedation. Subjects in the QUZYTTIR treatment group reported less sedation at all time points compared to subjects treated with diphenhydramine.

### The influence of selection bias on identifying an association between allergy medication use and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113nuZok]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Medications to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed to complement emerging vaccinations. Recent in vitro and electronic health record (EHR) studies suggested that certain allergy medications could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to carefully examine the potential selection bias associated with utilizing EHRs in these settings.

Methods

We analyzed associations of three allergy medications (cetirizine, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine) with testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, measuring the potential effect of selection bias on these associations. We used a retrospective cohort of EHR data from 230,376 patients (18 years+) who visited outpatient clinicians in a single, large academic center at least once but were never hospitalized (10/1/2019–6/1/2020). Main exposures included EHR documentation of three allergy medications and allergy, with an intermediate outcome of receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 test, and the primary outcome as testing negative.

Findings

SARS-CoV-2 testing rates varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance. Increasing age and public insurance were associated with a higher adjusted odds of test negativity, while being Black or Hispanic was significantly associated with test positivity. Allergy diagnosis and use of any of three allergy medications were each associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a test (e.g. diphenhydramine - Odds Ratio (OR) 2.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.73, 3.28; cetirizine 1.75 (95% CI 1.60, 1.92)). Among those tested, only use of diphenhydramine was associated with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.10, 4.55). However, analyses revealed that selection bias may be responsible for the apparent protective effect of diphenhydramine.

Interpretation

Diphenhydramine use was associated with more SARS-CoV-2 testing and subsequent higher odds for negative tests. While EHR-based observational studies can inform a need for interventional trials, this study revealed limitations of EHR data. The finding that diphenhydramine documentation conferred a higher odds of testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 must be interpreted with caution due to probable selection bias.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^113LNn3h]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In total, our combined searches yielded 1996 citations (see Figure 1). After screening, no studies were identified that met all inclusion criteria. The vast majority of references were not articles primarily relating to anaphylaxis, or anaphylaxis treatment. References relating to specifically to anaphylaxis treatment were reviews, systematic reviews, case reports, case series, and other types of observational (usually retrospective) studies. There were a number of controlled trials relating to anaphylaxis prevention, but none about treatment of pediatric anaphylaxis.

Figure 1
Search flow diagram.

The search of the UK National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials using anaphylaxis as a keyword identified no useful proposed, ongoing, or completed studies.

One study registered in the Australia/New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in March 2011 met inclusion criteria. This was an RCT of intravenous versus intramuscular (control) epinephrine treatment of acute anaphylaxis in an emergency department in patients 15 years of age and older. The status of the trial in the database indicated that the investigators were not yet recruiting as of April 2011. Attempts to contact the primary investigator via email were unsuccessful.

One additional study identified through the search was an RCT comparing the sedative properties of cetirizine versus diphenhydramine in the treatment of acute food-induced allergic reactions in children. The full text of this article was extracted and reviewed and, ultimately, excluded because the condition being studied was not anaphylaxis, but rather all allergic reactions.

Table 1
Adults 18+ Years: Demographics & SARS-CoV-2 Testing (N = 230,376).

We then examined individual allergy medication use and univariate associations with both testing and being negative for SARS-CoV-2 (among those who were tested; Table 2). Having a documented allergy diagnosis, and each allergy medication, were associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 testing, most notably diphenhydramine (OR = 2.99, 95% CI: (2.73, 3.28)). Among those with a SARS-CoV-2 test, however, while cetirizine and hydroxyzine usage were not associated with a negative test, diphenhydramine revealed an apparent protective effect with high rates of negativity (unadjusted OR = 2.95 95% CI: (1.48, 5.91)). This calculation reflects a negativity rate of 98.6% for those who took diphenhydramine compared to 95.7% for those who did not have this documentation in their EHR.

### Chronic urticaria: a role for newer immunomodulatory drugs? [^112Xj7ff]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50–60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs. A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of current medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals. The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night. Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7–14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20–50% of chronic urticaria patients unresponsive to antihistamines alone. When urticaria is unremitting and is not controlled by combined therapy with antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may be needed. Long-term corticosteroid therapy should be administered at the lowest dose able to control urticarial symptoms, in order to minimize adverse effects. In a few patients, however, high-dose corticosteroid therapy may have to be administered for long periods. In these patients, immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine can be started. This type of treatment has a corticosteroid-sparing effect and is also generally effective in patients with severe, unremitting urticaria, but requires careful monitoring of cyclosporine plasma concentration and possible adverse effects. Other immunomodulating drugs that have been tried in chronic urticaria patients include hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine and methotrexate, but their efficacy has not been proven in large controlled studies. Warfarin therapy may also be considered in some patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema unresponsive to antihistamines.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1129cT5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response? According to the British American and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)? In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H 1 -receptors are already occupied by another H 1 -antihistamine.

Key point: There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

Is it useful to combine H 1 - and H 2 -antihistamines? Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H 1 -antihistamines and H 2 -antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H 1 -antihistamines alone. This effect is related to an increase in the plasma levels of H 1 -antihistamine, most likely due to a pharmacologic interaction with the isoenzyme cytochrome P-450 in the liver. This phenomenon does not occur when cimetidine is associated with cetirizine. Accordingly, a review of recent studies does not allow confident decision-making about the use of H 2 -receptor antagonists in urticaria.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^113qhkYa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — comparative properties and use: Oral antihistamines block histamine at the H1 receptor and are categorized as first- or second-generation agents; first-generation examples include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, with use limited by sedation and mucosal dryness, whereas commonly used second-generation drugs include fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and desloratadine, and in almost all situations second-generation antihistamines are preferred. Data indicate that cetirizine and levocetirizine are the most potent but carry a modest risk of sedation not seen with other drugs in this class. Advantages include rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, maintenance of effectiveness with regular use, and availability without a prescription; maximum benefit is with continuous use, but as-needed use can provide significant symptom relief and is appropriate for some patients with intermittent symptoms. Although most studies have shown that intranasal steroids (INS) used continuously are superior to oral antihistamines for AR, especially for nasal congestion, an antihistamine used alone intermittently or continuously may provide adequate relief; oral antihistamines usually add no further improvement to INS, though adding as-needed INS to a regularly taken oral antihistamine is a viable strategy. The choice between oral agents and intranasal sprays is often based on patient preference, which may promote better adherence, and a table lists FDA-approved oral antihistamines for AR with key prescribing details.

### Treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria: focus on oral antihistamines [^113pRF8P]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of first- and newer-generation antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), with a focus on management in the pharmacy.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE (1966-October 2005), with no time or language restrictions. Key words or phrases used were histamine, antihistamine(s), first- and second-generation, allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, quality of life, impairment, sedation, cost-effectiveness, astemizole, cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, and mizolastine. Additional references were found in the bibliographies of the articles cited.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and other experimental studies of the use of antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU were selected. Review papers and guidelines were also included.

Data Synthesis

First-generation antihistamines are effective at ameliorating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and CIU; however, they are associated with adverse effects due to a lack of selectivity for the histamine H(1)-receptor and an ability to bind to cerebral H(1)-receptors. Newer-generation agents, in general, possess high H(1)-receptor selectivity and a low tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier, while maintaining efficacy. In general, safety at elevated doses has been demonstrated for the newer antihistamines, although higher rates of sedation and impairment have been reported with increasing doses for some agents.

Conclusions

Pharmacists can play an important role in the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU by considering the relative advantages of newer-generation agents when reviewing treatment options.

### Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (diphenhydramine) [^114AjPJr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction.

Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine.

Use in Pediatric Patients

In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death.

As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation.

Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older)

Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients.

### Prophylactic administration of diphenhydramine to reduce neuroleptic side effects in the acute care setting: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Px2N6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroleptics are commonly prescribed drugs to treat acute conditions (e.g., migraines) in the emergency department, but can cause serious adverse effects. Using diphenhydramine to prevent these adverse effects is very common but remains controversial.

Objective

We performed a systematic review to determine whether prophylactic administration of diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of neuroleptic adverse effects in patients with acute conditions.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating any neuroleptic with diphenhydramine vs. the same neuroleptic with any inactive agent. Primary outcome was incidence of any extrapyramidal adverse effect. Secondary outcomes were akathisia, rescue medication, subjective restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and sedation. Independent reviewers scanned identified citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect models.

Results

Of 1566 identified citations, nine studies (n = 1648 patients) met eligibility criteria. Four studies were specifically designed to compare the incidence of neuroleptic adverse effects with and without co-administration of diphenhydramine. Four studies were at high risk of bias. In primary analysis, diphenhydramine had no effect on the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (7 studies, n = 1393, risk ratio [RR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–1.31) or akathisia (5 studies, n = 1094; RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.33–1.82) or any of the secondary outcomes. In subgroup analysis, diphenhydramine was associated with a significant decrease in extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (4 studies, n = 705; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41–0.90). Dosage analysis yielded no further information.

Conclusions

When compared with placebo, diphenhydramine was associated with a significant reduction of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Overall quality of evidence is low. Further studies are warranted.

### First do no harm: managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^115zC7ms]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present current concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively nonimpairing second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine), because older agents (eg, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than are the differences between the first and second generations. A nonsedating, nonimpairing (even at higher than recommended doses), second-generation antihistamine is preferred for all patients, particularly those with a higher risk for the development of adverse effects. We recommend that primary care and specialist physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and all other health professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis follow this consensus document and share this information with patients for whom antihistamine therapy is recommended. In addition, further epidemiologic studies on the effects of antihistamines should be performed.

Diphenhydramine for insomnia — evidence from systematic review and randomized trials — was evaluated in "one SR, comprised of four randomized trials", that used "diphenhydramine 50 mg compared to placebo", with studies "short in duration (5–28 days)" in adults with "primary insomnia per DSM-IV or predominately having trouble falling asleep", using "subjective sleep assessment". Across outcomes including "sleep latency, TST, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency", "all four studies… resulted in mixed outcomes, with the majority not being statistically different compared to placebo". Notably, "diphenhydramine had benefit on self-perceived sleep latency in many of the nursing home residents (mean age 78 years)", but "several instances of daytime hypersomnolence were noted… after patients had taken diphenhydramine 50 mg for five consecutive days". Additionally, "another meta-analysis evaluated two RCTs", including one trial comparing "diphenhydramine (50 mg), temazepam (15 mg), and placebo for a duration of two weeks in 25 elderly volunteers (mean age 73.9 years) with primary insomnia per DSM-IV".

### Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (diphenhydramine) [^112tAyQ1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma.

Information for Patients

Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol.

Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc.

Drug Interactions

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.)

MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use

Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE).

### Diphenhydramine as adjuvant therapy for acute migraine: an emergency department-based randomized clinical trial [^111jGMLp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

More than 1 million patients present to US emergency departments (EDs) annually seeking care for acute migraine. Parenteral antihistamines have long been used in combination with antidopaminergics such as metoclopramide to treat acute migraine in the ED. High-quality data supporting this practice do not exist. We determine whether administration of diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously results in greater rates of sustained headache relief than placebo+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing 2 active treatments for acute migraine in an ED. Eligible patients were adults younger than 65 years presenting with an acute moderate or severe headache meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 migraine criteria. Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of allergic symptoms. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 hours of medication administration and maintaining this level of relief without use of any additional headache medication for 48 hours. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean improvement on a 0 to 10 verbal scale between baseline and 1 hour, the frequency with which subjects indicated they would want the same medication the next time they present to the ED with migraine, and the ED throughput time. Sample size calculation using a 2-sided α of .05, a β of .20, and a 15% difference between study arms determined the need for 374 patients. An interim analysis was conducted when data were available for 200 subjects.

Results

Four hundred twenty patients were approached for participation. Two hundred eight eligible patients consented to participate and were randomized. At the planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the study be halted for futility. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Fourteen percent (29/208) of the sample reported allergic symptoms. Of patients randomized to diphenhydramine, 40% (40/100) reported sustained relief at 48 hours, as did 37% (38/103) of patients randomized to placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference of 3%: -10% to 16%). One hour after medication administration, patients randomized to diphenhydramine improved by a mean of 5.1 on the 0 to 10 scale versus 4.8 for those randomized to placebo (95% CI for difference of 0.3: -0.6 to 1.1). Eighty-five percent (84/99) of the patients in the diphenhydramine arm reported they would want the same medication combination during a subsequent ED visit, as did 76% (77/102) of those who received placebo (95% CI for difference of 9%: -2% to 20%). Median ED length of stay was 122 minutes (interquartile range 84 to 180 minutes) in the diphenhydramine group and 139 minutes (interquartile range 90 to 235 minutes) in the placebo arm. Rates of adverse effects, including akathisia, were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion

Intravenous diphenhydramine, when administered as adjuvant therapy with metoclopramide, does not improve migraine outcomes.

### The influence of selection bias on identifying an association between allergy medication use and SARS-CoV-2 infection [^11469qUA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

To understand the association between medications frequently used to control allergy symptoms (diphenhydramine, cetirizine and hydroxyzine) and testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, we performed a retrospective analysis with the target population of all patients in a single, large academic medical center, UF Health, in Gainesville, Florida. From the EHR, we obtained race, ethnicity, sex, age and insurance type at date of encounter, allergy diagnoses as documented on the EHR problem list, (associated ICD10 codes: J30, Z91.0x, L51, L50, T78.4x), SARS-CoV-2 testing and results, and documentation of cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or diphenhydramine use in patient medication lists. Insurance type was grouped as public for patients with any documented use of public insurance over the study period. The analytic sample was restricted to all health system encounters of adults 18 years of age or older who had exclusively outpatient encounters documented in their EHR from October 01, 2019-June 30, 2020. We used an extended study period including a time period before the onset of the SARS-Co-V2 pandemic in order to include non-COVID-19 disease-related outpatient visits where usual care, medications and problems and diagnoses may be documented. We limited to exclusively outpatient visits since testing for inpatient admissions or procedures were frequently on different dates, and could not be consistently associated. Additionally, with many tests ordered to allow asymptomatic patients to receive whatever hospital-based care was needed, we sought to eliminate that source of testing bias.

### Diphenhydramine hci [^114ctxqn]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma.

Information for Patients: Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol.

Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc.

Drug Interactions: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc).

MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed.

Pregnancy: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use: Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE).

### Second-generation antihistamines for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria [^113j4xaT]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a serious disorder that can greatly compromise quality of life. While H1 antihistamines are the accepted first-line treatment for CIU, older generations of these agents (e.g., hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine) are associated with anticholinergic and CNS effects, such as drowsiness and sedation, that can pose risks to patients, especially when driving. Second-generation agents available in the United States (U.S.) (e.g., cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine) has greatly reduced these CNS effects, making them the current treatments of choice in CIU, but their potency and tolerability profiles vary. Differences in duration of in vivo receptor occupancy may affect the potency of H1 antihistamines. Levocetirizine appears to have greater in vivo H1 receptor occupancy compared with later generation H1 antihistamines, which may confer an advantageous efficacy/safety profile. This has been confirmed in a recent head-to-head study showing that levocetirizine was more effective than desloratadine in improving pruritus in CIU patients. Fexofenadine has been shown to have a low occupancy of H1 antihistamine receptors in the brain, which reduces the likelihood of sedation. More studies are required to further assess receptor occupancy and other factors that may differentiate the second-generation H1 antihistamines.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^114fuVnc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — pregnancy: antihistamines and nasal saline — There is little data on the safety of intranasal antihistamines (INAH) in pregnancy, but a randomized study in pregnant women with allergic rhinitis (AR) found nasal saline lavage safe and effective with symptom, medication use, and resistance reductions, and nasal saline therefore is a good first-line option. As a whole, oral antihistamines still appear to be safe for use in pregnancy; cetirizine was not associated with increased rates of major malformations or teratogenic risk, safety was reaffirmed in a UCB Pharma Patient Safety Database analysis up to February 2015, a 2013 multicenter case-control study of birth defects did not support previously postulated associations between diphenhydramine, loratadine, and chlorpheniramine and major congenital anomalies, and loratadine does not appear to increase hypospadias risk, with a 2014 systematic review identifying the most safety data for loratadine and no evidence of increased risk of hypospadias.

### History matters: preventing severe allergic transfusion reactions [^117YNYXB]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Administration of premedication is not unusual in clinical settings before administering a known allergenic agent. For example, 2 doses of steroids are given before infusion of a computed tomography contrast dye. This finding agrees with our finding that the administration of antihistamines or steroids (at least twice before and within 12 hours of the transfusion) was associated with a decreased risk of developing severe ATRs. Steroids were useful in ATR prevention as regular medications as opposed to premedication, likely due to their more extended time of peak effect and longer half-life. Interestingly, famotidine was not helpful as a regular medication, possibly due to its short half-life. When administered as premedication, famotidine and cetirizine decreased the ATR risk, but diphenhydramine did not. Because there are many differences between the H1-blockers (both between generations and among different drugs), it is not surprising that their effectiveness varies by situation. As previously mentioned, diphenhydramine is probably a more effective treatment medication than premedication drug in ATRs.

In addition, our study shows that transfusions within 12 hours of another transfusion are associated with a lower risk of developing ATRs (odds ratio = 0.542; P < .01), likely due to desensitization. A previous study concluded that in chronically transfused patients, an increased number of transfusions may lead to desensitization. In our study, however, patients with multiple ATRs experienced their reactions to 335 transfusions approximately 50 months apart. Therefore, the possible desensitization effect must be further investigated to understand its protective timeline better.

Despite its strengths, this retrospective study has several limitations. Although individual data collection was manual and laborious, potential errors cannot be entirely excluded. In addition, this study did not consider the medication dosages or routes and possibly other interventions that might confound the results and reduce the risk of severe ATR over time, such as allergy shots or immunotherapy. Also, potential risks of premedication were not weighted in this study.

Whether blood bank services should indicate premedication and washing or volume reduction to better mitigate ATRs in patients with a history of at least 1 severe ATR requires further studies and the development of optimized protocols, such as those described in other clinical settings.

In conclusion, based on this study, product washing or volume reduction and antiallergy medications in the form of premedication or regular medication may benefit patients with a history of at least 1 severe ATR.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^115qiCv5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clopidogrel hypersensitivity — continuation of clopidogrel with steroids and antihistamines (treating through) is used because cardiology data show a significant risk (25%-30%) of thrombosis with interruption of antiplatelet therapy. In one series, 62 patients received a 30-mg twice-daily tapering prednisone course plus benadryl 25 to 50 mg Q6–8PRN without drug stoppage and this approach was successful in 98% of patients with rashes resolving in about 5 days, failing in 1 patient who developed angioedema and required hospitalization. Among 25 patients with delayed rashes treated with methylprednisolone and antihistamines (fexofenadine 180 mg every day with 25–50 mg diphenhydramine-QHS) for a mean of 10 ± 8 days without interruption of clopidogrel, 22 of 25 (88%) had no adverse effects/events on long-term follow-up and all completed clopidogrel therapy; the mean duration of steroid treatment was 10 days, and 2 patients had recurrent symptoms treated with more corticosteroids (18 days starting with prednisone 60 mg), an antileukotriene (montelukast 10 mg), and antihistamines; in sum, 3 patients failed this therapy; another group used prednisone 30 mg twice a day with cetirizine 10 mg daily with success. This approach is reasonable for benign, maculopapular, or erythematous eruptions likely to be T-cell–mediated and without organ involvement, but it is not recommended in IgE-mediated reactions or rashes suggestive of a severe T-cell–mediated reaction, and caution is warranted for cutaneous reactions suggestive of IgE (eg, urticaria) because the studies demonstrating this approach to urticarial rashes are not robust enough to determine safety.

### Diphenhydramine as an analgesic adjuvant in refractory cancer pain [^113gjhzC]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Clinical and animal data suggest that antihistamines may have efficacy in the management of pain. While many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the analgesic action of antihistamines, the exact mechanism is unknown. Controlled clinical trials in different pain models have demonstrated that antihistamines have direct and adjuvant analgesic activity. We report three patients with advanced cancer pain refractory to adjuvants and oral, intravenous, and epidural opioids, who achieved sustained pain relief after the repeated administration of diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine may be useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain that has failed to respond to treatment with opioids and adjuvant analgesics. We suggest a starting dose of 25 mg of oral or parenteral diphenhydramine every 6 to 8 hours, with titration to effect.

Next, we examined the target pathway for astemizole and terfenadine. We assayed three additional compounds commercialized for their anti-HRH1 activity but did not observe a significant effect on cell viability. Even at concentrations up to 50 μM, fexofenadine (an active moiety of terfenadine), diphenhydramine and cetirizine do not significantly alter the AML 8227 cell count compared to DMSO (Fig. 4a). While all these compounds target the HRH1, these three have a different assortment of additional targets than astemizole and terfenadine. This indicates that HRH1 is not the sole target of the anti-LSC activity of these two compounds. To confirm this, we tested whether the addition of histamine, the endogenous substrate of HRH1, can reverse the phenotype of cell death induced by astemizole and terfenadine. We co-incubated 8227 AML cells with 10μM histamine and either astemizole, terfenadine or control (DMSO) and did not observe a rescue of cell viability but rather histamine has an additive impact to the toxicity (Fig. 4b). Thus, the HRH1 is not the target of astemizole and terfenadine anti-LSC activity.

H1R antihistamine effects on PRV-induced pelvic pain

Pain originating from a visceral organ is typically referred to a corresponding "dermatome" on the skin that shares common spinal cord innervation with the given visceral organ. A role for histamine and histamine receptors in pain responses has been documented in both humans and animal models. To examine H1R as a therapeutic target for pelvic pain, we examined the effects of pharmacologic antagonists on the development of PRV-induced pain responses. PRV-infected C57BL/6 female mice were treated by oral gavage with saline or with antihistamines specific for H1R (hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, or cetirizine). Mice treated with saline alone exhibited responses to pelvic stimuli that were significantly greater than baseline by PID 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 1A; P < 0.05). Mice treated with the H1R antagonist hydroxyzine showed a modest reduction in pelvic sensitivity (Table 2) that was significantly increased above baseline by PID 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 1B; P < 0.05). In contrast, diphenhydramine-treated mice failed to develop significant pain until PID 3 and 4 (Figure 1C; P < 0.05) and developed only 56% of the total pain exhibited by saline-treated mice (Table 2). Similar to diphenhydramine-treated mice, cetirizine-treated mice failed to develop significant pain until PID 3 and 4 (Fig 1D; P < 0.05) and developed only 59% of the total pain exhibited by saline-treated mice (Table 2).

### Unintentional cetirizine overdose causing anticholinergic syndrome [^114MHYGF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of anticholinergic syndrome due to second generation antihistamines is infrequently reported. Largely due to their decreased affinity for central nervous system (CNS) receptors, second generation antihistamines are rarely associated with anticholinergic symptoms, though toxicity is still possible particularly when taken in excess. We report a case of a six year old boy who presented with agitation, hallucinations, fixed and dilated pupils, tachycardia, and hyperthermia consistent with anticholinergic toxicity several hours after accidental overdose of a second generation antihistamine, cetirizine. Early identification of this rare phenomenon is important not only for appropriate emergency management but also for avoidance of potentially invasive and unnecessary tests which may further increase patient morbidity.

### Diphenhydramine for the prevention of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine: a randomized, controlled trial [^114miAsW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The utility of intravenous prochlorperazine as an antiemetic agent and abortive therapy for headache may be limited by the frequent occurrence of akathisia, the distressing effects of which have been shown to disrupt patient care. We tested the hypothesis that adjuvant diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department of an academic tertiary care medical center with an annual census of 95,000 emergency patient visits. We enrolled a convenience sample of 100 adult patients who received 10 mg of intravenous prochlorperazine for the treatment of nausea/vomiting or headache. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 2-minute infusion of prochlorperazine with either 50 mg of diphenhydramine or placebo. The incidence of akathisia at 1 hour was measured by using explicit diagnostic criteria. To measure the influence of treatment on sedation, the subjects noted, on a 100-mm visual analog scale, their degree of sedation before and after treatment.

Results

Akathisia developed in 18 (36%) of 50 subjects in the control group and in 7 (14%) of 50 subjects in the diphenhydramine group, a 61% relative reduction. The addition of adjunct diphenhydramine resulted in an absolute reduction of 22% in the incidence of akathisia (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 38%; p = 0.01). The odds ratio for akathisia with the use of adjuvant diphenhydramine was 0.39 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.85). Mean sedation scores increased 12 mm after infusion of prochlorperazine alone (95% CI 3 to 21 mm) compared with a 33-mm increase after infusion of prochlorperazine with adjuvant diphenhydramine (95% CI 24 to 42 mm). The 12-mm difference between the groups was statistically significant (95% CI 9 to 34 mm, P < .001).

Conclusion

Adjuvant diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine and is associated with an increase in sedation.

### Are antimuscarinic effects common in hydroxyzine overdose? A cohort analysis of antimuscarinic effects in hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine-poisoned patients [^113c5Dk8]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exposures to hydroxyzine, a first-generation H1 antihistamine, have increased rapidly over the last two decades. Many assumptions about hydroxyzine poisoning are based on other antihistamines, like diphenhydramine. However, the receptor affinities of hydroxazine suggest that there should be fewer antimuscarinic findings than diphenhydramine.

Methods

This was a cohort study that compared hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2020, and the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was to assess for antimuscarinic findings in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients, using diphenhydramine-poisoned patients as a comparison group. The secondary outcomes were to assess for markers of overall toxicity. Inclusion criteria were single-substance exposures with known outcomes. Exclusion criteria for National Poison Data System exposures were chronic exposures, unintentional exposures, and patients younger than 12years old. There were no exclusion criteria for exposures reported to the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry.

Results

There were 17,265 hydroxyzine and 102,354 diphenhydramine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System and 134 hydroxyzine and 1,484 diphenhydramine exposures reported to the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry that met inclusion criteria. In both datasets, hydroxyzine-poisoned patients had lower rates and relative risk of developing antimuscarinic findings or receiving physostigmine, with the exception of hyperthermia in the Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry dataset. Coma/central nervous system depression (major), respiratory depression, seizures, ventricular dysrhythmias, intubation, and benzodiazepine administration were less likely in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients, but central nervous system depression (mild) was more likely in exposures reported to the National Poison Data System. The mortality in hydroxyzine-poisoned patients was rare: 0.02% and 0.8% of exposures reported to the National Poison Data System and Toxicologic Investigators Consortium Core Registry, respectively.

Discussion

The clinical manifestations of hydroxyzine exposures are consistent with the pharmacology of hydroxazine. The clinical effects were consistent across two United States national datasets. Clinicians should not generalize the illness script of diphenhydramine exposures to hydroxyzine exposures.

Conclusions

Hydroxyzine-poisoned patients were less likely to develop antimuscarinic findings than diphenhydramine-poisoned patients. Hydroxyzine-poisoned patients were more likely to have mild central nervous system depression than an antimuscarinic toxidrome.

### Pharmacologic attenuation of pelvic pain in a murine model of interstitial cystitis [^113mdzGA]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Our evidence for histamine-mediated pelvic pain provides a mechanistic understanding of previous clinical findings. The H2R antagonist cimetidine produced significant improvement in pain and nocturia in a limited trial of IC/PBS patients, however clinical trials have yet to be conducted with ranitidine or famotidine. Similarly, pilot clinical studies yielded modest pain relief in IC/PBS patients receiving the old-line H1R antagonist hydroxyzine (Atarax), but studies have not yet been conducted with newer generation H1R antagonists like diphenhydramine or cetirizine. Modern H1R antagonists likely attenuated pelvic pain better here than older generation H1R antagonists because newer H1R antagonists are well-absorbed, act faster, have greater efficacy, and a longer duration of action. We have previously shown that H1R and H2R are expressed in both the bladder and colon of mice, leaving the possibility of the H1R and H2R antihistamines acting at either or both of the organs to quell pelvic pain. Additionally, the colon modulates PRV-induced pelvic pain, pelvic organs generally exhibit neural-mediated crosstalk, and IBS is a co-morbidity of IC/PBS. Therefore, these epidemiologic and animal model findings together suggest that H1R and H2R antagonists may have general application for the treatment of pelvic pain.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112LWDHQ]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — first-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine) efficacy and safety: An industry-sponsored, multicenter trial compared diphenhydramine (50 mg) with a valerian-hops preparation for 28 nights in 184 adults (average age 44.3 years), and pooled trials reported a mean difference of 2.47 minutes (95% CI -8.17–3.23 minutes) for subjective sleep latency and a 17.86 minutes increase (95% CI -3.79–39.51) in subjective total sleep time (sTST) with diphenhydramine versus placebo; only one trial assessed sleep efficiency, where subjective mean sleep efficiency increased 4.6% (1.44% to 7.88% higher) from baseline to week two in the diphenhydramine group relative to placebo. Safety data using first-generation antihistamines long-term for chronic insomnia disorder was not available, and the 2023 Beers Criteria carries a strong recommendation to avoid using these agents in older adults; tolerance to sedative effects has been noted after three to four days of continuous use. In performance studies, no differences between the morning-after psychomotor impairment and morning-after memory impairment was seen with diphenhydramine compared to baseline in one trial, but in a driving simulator diphenhydramine (50 mg) for one week impaired driving, including lane keeping, in drivers aged 25 to 44 years to a greater extent than alcohol (approximately 0.1% blood alcohol concentration), and self-reported drowsiness was not a good predictor of impairment.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111a5Zze]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamines

What range of doses is more appropriate for antihistamines? Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses are the recommended first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate chronic urticaria. In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria in whom the standard dose is not effective, there is evidence that increasing the dose up to fourfold might control symptoms, without compromising the patient's safety. There have been no well-designed, randomized double-blind clinical trials comparing the efficacy of therapeutic and upgraded doses. Some studies have been performed in spontaneous chronic urticaria and in certain forms of inducible chronic urticaria using desloratadine (up to 20 mg), levocetirizine (up to 20 mg), cetirizine (up to 30 mg), fexofenadine (up to 240 mg), rupatadine (up to 20 mg) and bilastine (up to 80 mg), but they have had mixed results. Limited data are available for updosing, but considering the good safety profile of most second-generation antihistamines, it might be worth evaluating the efficacy of antihistamines at higher-than-licensed doses before switching to other therapies. Regarding the best way to apply this treatment, the guidelines advise to employ high doses of antihistamines as a second treatment step. However, as in the case of cold urticaria, a useful approach may include starting with four times higher dose, with subsequent dose reduction in the presence of a clinical response.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111fWi9P]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — asparaginase hypersensitivity and infusion reactions notes that asparaginase products are associated with potentially severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) due to anti-asparaginase or anti-PEG antibodies and may be associated with the production of neutralizing antibodies and lack of asparaginase activity. ERW-rywn is used for patients who develop allergic reactions to E. coli-derived asparaginase. With IV pegaspargase and calaspargase, nonallergic infusion reactions can occur within minutes or seconds and may manifest with flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, tachypnea, and anxiety. Slowing the infusion to ≥ 2 hours (but < 4 hours for calaspargase), with concurrent infusion of saline and use of anti-allergy premedications given IV or PO such as hydrocortisone, diphenhydramine, other antihistamines including cetirizine (category 2B for IV cetirizine), and acetaminophen, can reduce these reactions. Although routine premedication has been generally avoided, universal premedication and TDM can be considered to decrease the incidence and severity of adverse events and the need to substitute pegaspargase with ERW-rywn. In patients with previous hypersensitivity reaction to pegaspargase, some studies have found desensitization protocols helpful; however, this practice is not currently recommended in the guidelines.

### A case of massive diphenhydramine and naproxen overdose [^113V6r6U]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diphenhydramine, a first generation H 1 histamine receptor antagonist, is a commonly used nonprescription medication that is used for the treatment of allergy, as a sleep aid, or combined with cough and cold remedies. Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is used commonly for analgesia. Although most cases of diphenhydramine or naproxen overdose require excellent supportive care only, meticulous attention should be given to cardiovascular and neurologic status.

Case Report

A 22-year-old woman presented with altered mental status secondary to intentional ingestion of 240 combination caplets of naproxen sodium 220 mg and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25 mg. While in the emergency department, she manifested a wide-complex tachycardia in the setting of hypotension that required repeated administration of sodium bicarbonate to overcome the sodium channel blockade caused by diphenhydramine. Aggressive potassium repletion was performed simultaneously. Her clinical course was complicated by status-epilepticus that required intubation. Orogastric lavage was performed, which returned blue pill slurry consistent with the ingested caplets. The patient was extubated on hospital day 2 and transferred to psychiatry thereafter. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In light of recent social media trends, such as the "Benadryl challenge" and its widespread availability, emergency providers should be familiar with diphenhydramine toxicity, especially the life-threatening neurologic consequences and risk of cardiovascular collapse. NSAIDs, such as naproxen, and other nonprescription analgesics are becoming more and more important in light of the current opioid crisis. There should be an emphasis on understanding these medications and their potential implications when taken in overdose.

### Notes from the field: antihistamine positivity and involvement in drug overdose deaths-44 jurisdictions, United States, 2019–2020 [^111SC5X2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Among 92,033 overdose deaths during 2019–2020, 13,574 (14.7%) were antihistamine-positive and 3,345 (3.6%) were antihistamine-involved; fewer than 0.1% (90) involved antihistamines alone (Table). Nearly all antihistamine-positive and -involved deaths (13,475, 99.6%; 3,339, 99.8%, respectively) included first-generation H1 antihistamines, primarily diphenhydramine (9,645, 71.1%; 2,226, 66.5%, respectively). The proportions of antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-involved overdose deaths were highest for females (52.0%; 52.8%), persons aged 35–44 years (26.1%; 26.5%), and White, non-Hispanic persons (78.1%; 78.7%); demographic patterns of antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-positive deaths were similar, except that deaths were more frequent among males (57.8%; 59.6%) and in the Midwest region (43.6%; 51.0%). Most antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-involved overdose deaths co-involved opioids (82.8% and 82.7%, respectively), primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs).

### Antihistamines and driving ability: evidence from on-the-road driving studies during normal traffic [^113NVCME]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

All antihistamines are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and thus may cause sedation. Most antihistamine users are ambulatory patients and therefore presumably drive a car.

Objective

To summarize the effects of antihistamine drugs on driving ability.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A literature search (MEDLINE and cross-references) was performed using the keywords driving and antihistamine. Sixteen studies using the on-the-road driving test during normal traffic were included in the review. Studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled and included a positive control.

Results

First-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine, triprolidine, terfenadine, dexchlorpheniramine, clemastine) significantly impair driving performance after both one-time and repeated (daily) administration. Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, ebastine, mizolastine, acrivastine, emedastine, mequitazine) may also impair driving performance, but the magnitude and extent of impairment depend on the administered dose, sex, and time between testing and treatment administration. Tolerance develops after 4 to 5 days of administration, but impairment is not absent. Third-generation antihistamines (fexofenadine and levocetirizine) have been shown to produce no driving impairment after both one-time and repeated administration.

Conclusions

First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. In the context of driving safety but also taking into account the cardiotoxic properties of some of the second-generation antihistamines, we advise treating patients with third-generation antihistamines such as fexofenadine and levocetirizine.

### Diphenhydramine as an adjunct to sedation for colonoscopy: a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study [^116nWceK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous benzodiazepines in combination with opiates are used to achieve moderate sedation for colonoscopy. Although effective, these agents have potential adverse effects, such as respiratory depression and hypotension. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride possesses central nervous system depressant effects that theoretically could provide a synergistic effect for sedating patients.

Objective

The objective was to assess the efficacy of adding diphenhydramine hydrochloride as an adjunct to improve sedation and to reduce the amount of standard sedatives used during colonoscopy.

Design

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

The study was conducted in a university hospital with an active GI fellowship training program.

Patients

The study group comprised 270 patients undergoing screening/diagnostic/therapeutic colonoscopy were enrolled.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg of diphenhydramine or placebo, given intravenously 3 minutes before starting conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam and meperidine.

Main Outcome Measurements

The main outcome measure was anesthetic effect as assessed by the endoscopy team and by the patient; quantity of adjunctive sedatives to achieve adequate sedation.

Results

Of 270 patients, data were analyzed for 258 patients, with 130 patients in the diphenhydramine group and 128 patients in the placebo group. There was a 10.1% reduction in meperidine usage and 13.7% reduction in midazolam usage in favor of the diphenhydramine group. The mean evaluation scores as judged by the faculty, the fellows, and the nurses were statistically significant in favor of the diphenhydramine group. In addition, patient scores for overall sedation and pain level favored the group that received diphenhydramine.

Conclusions

Intravenous diphenhydramine given before initiation of standard sedation offers a significant benefit to conscious sedation for patients undergoing colonoscopy.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^116NTHBQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

Medication classes associated with postoperative delirium in older adults — Current evidence most strongly associates use of anticholinergic drugs, meperidine and benzodiazepines with increased postoperative delirium, and studies have identified the following medications with increased delirium: diphenhydramine, meperidine, midazolam, and anticholinergic medications. Relevant medications or medication classes include benzodiazepines, anticholinergics (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, oxybutynin, chlorpromazine, promethazine, tricyclic antidepressants, paroxetine and drugs with high anticholinergic properties), diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, histamine-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine), sedative-hypnotics, and meperidine. Drugs that contribute to serotonin syndrome can increase delirium risk, as can the use of multiple medications (five or greater). Specific conditions may warrant use of these medications; for example, a patient with a history of alcohol abuse or chronic benzodiazepine usage may require treatment with a benzodiazepine to prevent withdrawal complications, or a patient may require treatment with diphenhydramine for a severe allergy or transfusion reaction.

Asparaginase toxicity management — hypersensitivity and infusion reactions: Asparaginase products can cause systemic clinical hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, anaphylaxis), and with intravenous (IV) pegaspargase/calaspargase a nonallergic infusion reaction can also occur, and it is usually not possible to clinically distinguish this reaction from allergic hypersensitivity. Pegaspargase/calaspargase are the standard formulations; calaspargase is only IV, whereas pegaspargase is available IV or intramuscular (IM) but is usually given IV. To reduce risk, slowing the infusion to ≥ 2 hours (but < 4 hours for calaspargase), infusing normal saline concurrently, and using IV or by mouth (PO) anti‑allergy premedications such as hydrocortisone, diphenhydramine, other antihistamines (eg, cetirizine [category 2B for IV cetirizine]), and acetaminophen can reduce the risk of these reactions, and universal premedication and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be considered. ERW-rywn is indicated for patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli asparaginase products, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^114YZiRh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking cetirizine hydrochloride; due caution should therefore be exercised when driving a car or operating potentially dangerous machinery. Concurrent use of cetirizine hydrochloride with alcohol or other CNS depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of CNS performance may occur.

Risk of New Onset Pruritus After Discontinuation of Cetirizine: Cases of pruritus after discontinuation of cetirizine have been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients where pruritus was not present before initiation of cetirizine. Pruritus occurred within a few days of discontinuing cetirizine among patients who used cetirizine long-term (e.g., few months to years). Reported cases of pruritus were infrequent, but some were serious with patients experiencing widespread severe pruritus. If pruritus occurs after discontinuation of cetirizine, symptoms may improve with restarting or tapering cetirizine.

Drug-Drug Interactions: No clinically significant drug interactions have been found with theophylline at a low dose, azithromycin, pseudoephedrine, ketoconazole, or erythromycin. There was a small decrease in the clearance of cetirizine caused by a 400-mg dose of theophylline; it is possible that larger theophylline doses could have a greater effect.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^113KRX3R]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapies

Pharmacological therapies include traditional oral antihistaminic medications (see Box 10). Some patients prefer sedating formulations at bedtime (for example, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine) and others non-sedating preparations during the day (for example, cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine). Efficacy is variable and recommendations are based on anecdotal experience for lack of good evidence in EB and other dermatologic conditions. Centrally acting medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, have evidence for efficacy from the burn literature, and may have application in EB. Many of these medications have also been used successfully for neuropathic pain (see sub-section on adjunctive measures for neuropathic pain under End of Life Pain). Antidepressants with nortriptyline re-uptake inhibitory actions have been used for various pruritic conditions with some evidence for efficacy, with mirtazapine showing promise. Low-dose cyclosporine has been used in a single case of dominant dystrophic EB to reduce generalized itching. Anecdotal success has been reported with ondansetron in EB; however, the same had been reported for pruritus from cholestatic jaundice, although controlled trials did not confirm efficacy. Similar suggestions were made related to the pruritus of uremia, leading to recommendations that ondansetron should be considered, although clinical trials are needed in EB.

Other medications that have shown sporadic clinical success in treating itch in EB include: cyproheptadine; selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine); tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline); opioid antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone); kappa receptor agonists (butorphanol, dextromethorphan, nalbuphine); other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (granisetron, dolasetron); antipsychotic agents (olanzapine, pimozide) and cannabinoids. These agents and the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant may prove to be useful in certain subsets of patients, although evidence to guide therapy is lacking and practitioners are encouraged to pursue the aforementioned therapies based on patient response to prior medications, potential interactions within the patient's medication list and medication availability (see Box 10).

### Evaluation of the efficacy of antihistamines using human monocyte-derived dendritic cells stimulated with histamine [^115Gcfwz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It has been reported that histamine induces CD86 expression and chemokine production in human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), which can be blocked by both H(1)- and H(2)-receptor antagonists.

Objective

We sought to examine whether the efficacy of H(1)-type antihistamines can be assessed by using MoDCs.

Methods

We examined the suppressive effects of 1 H(2)-type antihistamine (cimetidine) and 5 different H(1)-type antihistamines (cetirizine, diphenhydramine, ketotifen, olopatadine, and emedastine) on the induction of CD86 and IL-8 production by MoDCs from 23 healthy individuals stimulated with histamine. We also examined the responses of MoDCs from 13 patients with chronic urticaria to these antihistamines, and compared the in vitro efficacy with the actual clinical response to antihistamines evaluated by patient and physician assessments.

Results

All the antihistamines we examined suppressed the increase of CD86(+) cells after histamine stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion, and all H(1)-type antihistamines were more efficacious than cimetidine. IL-8 production stimulated with histamine was also suppressed by cetirizine, ketotifen, and olopatadine. Unexpectedly, the suppressive effect of these antihistamines on the CD86 augmentation was highly variable among different healthy control participants. Interestingly, in 10 of 13 cases of chronic urticaria, this in vitro analysis of antihistamines correlated with the clinical response to antihistamines.

Conclusion

This study suggests that the evaluation of antihistamines using MoDCs can be a useful method for the screening of effective antihistamines, for the comparison of the efficacy of antihistamines, and for predicting the efficacy of antihistamines on an individual basis.

Asparaginase hypersensitivity and infusion reactions — management uses severity-based actions: ERW-rywn should be used as a second-line agent in patients who have developed a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis due to PEG hypersensitivity; anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions of Grade 3–4 severity (CTCAE v5.0) merit permanent discontinuation of the type of asparaginase that caused the reaction; for Grade 1 reactions and Grade 2 reactions (rash, flushing, urticaria, and drug fever ≥ 38°C) without bronchospasm, hypotension, edema, or need for parenteral intervention, the asparaginase may be continued with consideration for anti-allergy premedication (hydrocortisone, famotidine or ranitidine, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and acetaminophen); preventive measures that can be considered include slowing the infusion to ≥ 2 hours, infusing normal saline concurrently, and using the premedications above; if anti-allergy premedication is used prior to PEG or ERW-rywn administration, therapeutic drug monitoring using commercially available asparaginase activity assays is highly recommended since premedication may mask reactions indicating neutralizing antibodies; hypersensitivity is significant, and TDM can be considered for low-grade systemic reactions with potential rechallenge when adequate asparaginase activity is demonstrated.

H1-antihistamine dosing, comparisons, and pregnancy categories in chronic urticaria — Double-blind, randomized controlled studies demonstrate safety and efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, and daily dosing of antihistamines is generally more effective than as-needed dosing for maintaining improvements in quality of life; relatively few head-to-head studies exist and there are not enough studies to demonstrate clear evidence of superiority of one specific second-generation antihistamine; pregnancy categories differ, with cetirizine, levocetirizine, and loratadine having a Category B rating and fexofenadine and desloratadine having a Category C rating; many patients might not respond adequately to conventional, FDA-approved doses, data on higher-than-conventional dosing are limited, and studies of cetirizine in doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/d showed conflicting results; trials include two large multicenter studies of 439 and 418 patients randomized to fexofenadine at 20, 60, 120, or 240 mg twice daily with better disease control at the three higher doses but no statistically significant differences among the higher doses, a randomized crossover study of 30 patients comparing 5 mg/d versus 20 mg/d desloratadine showing greater efficacy at 20 mg, and a double-blind randomized trial of 80 patients with treatment failure in whom levocetirizine or desloratadine doses were increased from 5 to 10 and then 20 mg at weekly intervals showing that higher doses were required for many to become symptom free; more reports of increased somnolence occurred with these higher doses and 2- to 4-fold increases might be necessary in some cases and can be tolerated without remarkable untoward effects.

### Diphenhydramine and migraine treatment failure in pediatric patients receiving prochlorperazine [^115H6bUN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objectives are to determine whether diphenhydramine coadministered with prochlorperazine versus prochlorperazine only is associated with a difference in the risk of migraine treatment failure, as measured by the need for additional therapy, hospitalization rates, and 72-hour return rates, and to compare extrapyramidal adverse effects between groups.

Methods

Retrospective cohort of patients aged 7 to 18 years treated in the emergency department for migraines using prochlorperazine with or without diphenhydramine between 2013 and 2019. Patients were included if they had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, codes for migraine or unspecified headache and were treated with prochlorperazine as part of their initial migraine therapy. Data collected included demographics, medications administered, pain scores, neuroimaging, disposition, return visits, and documentation of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the association between diphenhydramine coadministration and each of the outcomes.

Results

A total of 1683 patients were included. Overall, 13% required additional therapy with a 16.7% admission rate and a 72-hour return rate of 5.3%. There was no association between initial treatment with diphenhydramine and the odds of additional therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.74 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.53–1.03]), admission rates (aOR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.89–1.67]), or return visit rates (aOR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.55–1.51]). Extrapyramidal adverse effects occurred in 2.4% of patients in the prochlorperazine group and 0% in the prochlorperazine with diphenhydramine group.

Conclusions

There was no association between diphenhydramine coadministration and the need for additional therapy, 72-hour return visit rates or admission rates. Extrapyramidal effects did not occur in patients treated with diphenhydramine.

### Diphenhydramine, sodium bicarbonate, or combination for acute peripheral vertigo: a randomized clinical trial [^113FYctm]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does intravenous sodium bicarbonate alone or with diphenhydramine provide better symptom relief than diphenhydramine alone for adults with acute peripheral vertigo?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 225 patients, combination therapy with diphenhydramine and sodium bicarbonate produced greater improvement in vertigo severity at 60 minutes and reduced the need for rescue medication compared with diphenhydramine alone. Sedation occurred more often with diphenhydramine, whereas sodium bicarbonate caused more injection discomfort.

Meaning

This study suggests that combination therapy with diphenhydramine and sodium bicarbonate may offer more effective relief of acute peripheral vertigo symptoms than diphenhydramine alone and could reduce the need for additional treatment.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution [^113PTmcV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics: Cetirizine hydrochloride at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibited the wheal and flare caused by intradermal injection of histamine in 19 pediatric volunteers (aged 5 to 12 years) and the activity persisted for at least 24 hours. In a 35 day study in children aged 5 to 12, no tolerance to the antihistaminic (suppression of wheal and flare response) effects of cetirizine hydrochloride was found. In 10 infants 7 to 25 months of age who received 4 to 9 days of cetirizine in an oral solution (0.25 mg/kg bid), there was a 90% inhibition of histamine-induced (10 mg/mL) cutaneous wheal and 87% inhibition of the flare 12 hours after administration of the last dose. The clinical relevance of this suppression of histamine-induced wheal and flare response on skin testing is unknown.

The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine releasers were also inhibited by cetirizine, as was response to a cold challenge in patients with cold-induced urticaria. In mildly asthmatic subjects, cetirizine hydrochloride at 5 to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine, with virtually total blockade after a 20 mg dose. In studies conducted for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by cetirizine hydrochloride at a dose of 20 mg. In four clinical studies in healthy adult males, no clinically significant mean increases in QTc were observed in cetirizine hydrochloride treated subjects. In the first study, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, cetirizine hydrochloride was given at doses up to 60 mg per day, 6 times the maximum clinical dose, for 1 week, and no significant mean QTc prolongation occurred. In the second study, a crossover trial, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg and erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hours) were given alone and in combination. There was no significant effect on QTc with the combination or with cetirizine hydrochloride alone. In the third trial, also a crossover study, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg and ketoconazole (400 mg per day) were given alone and in combination. Cetirizine hydrochloride caused a mean increase in QTc of 9.1 msec from baseline after 10 days of therapy. Ketoconazole also increased QTc by 8.3 msec. The combination caused an increase of 17.4 msec, equal to the sum of the individual effects. Thus, there was no significant drug interaction on QTc with the combination of cetirizine hydrochloride and ketoconazole. In the fourth study, a placebo-controlled parallel trial, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg was given alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg as a single dose on the first day followed by 250 mg once daily). There was no significant increase in QTc with cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg alone or in combination with azithromycin. In a four-week clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years, results of randomly obtained ECG measurements before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment showed that cetirizine hydrochloride 5 or 10 mg did not increase QTc versus placebo. In a one week clinical trial (N = 86) of Cetirizine Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP (0.25 mg/kg bid) compared with placebo in pediatric patients 6 to 11 months of age, ECG measurements taken within 3 hours of the last dose did not show any ECG abnormalities or increases in QTc interval in either group compared to baseline assessments. Data from other studies where cetirizine hydrochloride was administered to patients 6 to 23 months of age were consistent with the findings in this study.

Chronic urticaria — doxepin and hydroxyzine as options when symptoms persist: Treatment with hydroxyzine or doxepin can be considered in patients whose symptoms remain poorly controlled with dose advancement of second-generation antihistamines and the addition of H1-antihistamines, first-generation H1-antihistamines at bedtime, and/or antileukotrienes. Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant with both H1- and H2-receptor antagonist properties, and it has potent H1-antagonist activity, with in vitro studies showing 775 times more potent antagonism for the H1-receptor than diphenhydramine. A crossover study compared 25 mg of doxepin 3 times daily with 50 mg of diphenhydramine 3 times daily for the treatment of CIU.

### Increased risk of serious injury following an initial prescription for diphenhydramine [^111TTiy9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Diphenhydramine may be associated with excess risk of injury relative to nonsedating H1-receptor antagonists.

Objective

This study sought to compare the risk of injury in patients exposed to diphenhydramine with the risk of injury in patients exposed to loratadine.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of injury was carried out in 12,106 patients whose initial antihistamine prescription was for diphenhydramine and in 24,968 patients whose initial antihistamine prescription was for loratadine. Data were taken from a health care claims database that included employees, dependents, and retirees who filed claims from January 1991 through December 1998. Rates of six serious injuries in the diphenhydramine cohort after and before the first prescription were compared with rates in the loratadine cohort after and before the first prescription.

Results

In the 30 days after the first antihistamine prescription, the rate of all injuries was 308 per 1,000 person-years in the diphenhydramine cohort versus 137 per 1,000 person-years in the loratadine cohort. The rate ratio estimate adjusted for age and gender using Poisson regression was 2.27 (95% confidence limits [CL] 1.93, 2.66). In the corresponding 30 days of the preceding year, the injury rates in the diphenhydramine and loratadine cohorts were 128 and 125 per 1,000 person-years, and the adjusted rate ratio was 1.02 (CL 0.83, 1.26). Thus, the cohorts appeared to have similar preprescription injury rates. The differences between the cohorts declined with time from prescription: For all injuries, the estimated percentage decline in the rate ratio was 4.1% per day (CL 3.3, 4.9), and the estimated time from the initial prescription until the diphenhydramine cohort returned to baseline risk was 32.3 days (CL 26.9, 37.6).

Conclusions

If these associations are causal, the percentage of the injuries attributable to diphenhydramine was 55% (CL 41, 65), implying a substantial number of excess injuries and costs incurred as the result of diphenhydramine use. The high use rates of this drug and the high incidence of injury suggest that further study of the association between injury and type of antihistamine is needed.

### Cetirizine (Zerviate) [^113QgtTR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

ZERVIATE®, an antihistamine, is a histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist. Its effects are mediated via selective inhibition of H1 histamine receptors. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been documented in a variety of animal and human models. In vivo and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H1 receptors.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In healthy subjects, bilateral topical ocular dosing of one drop of ZERVIATE®resulted in a mean cetirizine plasma Cmaxof 1.7 ng/mL following a single dose and 3.1 ng/mL after twice-daily dosing for one week. The observed mean terminal half-life of cetirizine was 8.6 hours following a single dose and 8.2 hours after twice-daily dosing of ZERVIATE®for one week.

### Intranasal substituted cathinone "bath salts" psychosis potentially exacerbated by diphenhydramine [^114Jbaty]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In this report, we describe a case of intranasal "bath salts"-associated psychosis. Symptoms developed during a 3-week binge and were potentially exacerbated by oral diphenhydramine taken for insomnia. The clinical case conference includes expert discussion from 3 disciplines: emergency medicine toxicology, behavioral pharmacology, and addiction medicine. It is hoped that the discussion will provide insight into the clinical aspects and challenges of addressing acute substituted cathinone toxicity, including acute psychosis, a major adverse effect of bath salts consumption.

### FDA requires warning about… [^112WntSt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The itching, also called pruritus, has been reported in patients who used these medicines daily, typically for at least a few months and often for years. Patients did not experience itching before starting the medicines. Reported cases were rare but sometimes serious, with patients experiencing widespread, severe itching that required medical intervention. As a result, we are revising the prescription cetirizine and levocetirizine prescribing information to include a new warning about this risk. We will subsequently request that manufacturers add a warning about pruritus to the Drug Facts Label of the OTC versions. We are adding a warning about the risk of pruritus after stopping long-term use of prescription cetirizine or levocetirizine to the prescribing information to increase awareness about this rare but serious reaction. The updated prescribing information also states that pruritus symptoms may improve with restarting the medicines.

We will also request that manufacturers add a warning about pruritus to the Drug Facts Label of OTC cetirizine and levocetirizine. In the meantime, we want to make the public aware of this risk. We will follow up when additional information becomes available. Cetirizine and levocetirizine are antihistamines that block a molecule called histamine that the body releases during allergic reactions. Both medicines are approved to treat seasonal allergies, called seasonal allergic rhinitis, in adults and children 2 years and older. The medicines are also approved to treat year-round allergies, called perennial allergic rhinitis, and chronic hives, called chronic idiopathic urticaria, in patients 6 months and older.
- Cetirizine and levocetirizine are available as prescription and over-the-counter medicines to treat seasonal allergies, called seasonal allergic rhinitis; year-round allergies, called perennial allergic rhinitis; and chronic hives, called chronic idiopathic urticaria.
- Cetirizine and levocetirizine are antihistamines that block a molecule called histamine that the body releases during allergic reactions.
- FDA is warning that patients stopping allergy medicines cetirizine or levocetirizine after long-term use may experience rare but severe itching. This itching, also called pruritus, has been reported in patients who had been using these medicines daily, typically for at least a few months and often years. Itching was not present before patients started the medicines.
