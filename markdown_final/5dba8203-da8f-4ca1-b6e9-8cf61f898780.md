## Question

Interpret this lab result: HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS DNA MUT (See Below, EZ) showing heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D pathogenic variants.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting a lab result for hereditary hemochromatosis showing HFE C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the genotype and its nomenclature. Then, I should evaluate population frequency and penetrance. Next, I will appraise the biological impact on iron indices and clinical outcomes. After that, I should align interpretation with major guidelines. Then, I need to risk stratify with cofactors, define a management pathway for normal versus abnormal iron studies, address family screening and counseling, and finally document key communication points and special differentials, verifying each claim against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the genotype and its implications: C282Y/H63D detected on opposite chromosomes constitutes HFE compound heterozygosity, which is distinct from C282Y homozygosity that carries the highest risk for clinically significant iron overload and from H63D homozygosity, whose clinical significance is limited and debated; compound heterozygosity is relatively common in populations of European ancestry, with U.S. NHANES-based estimates around 1.97% and much lower risk than C282Y homozygosity, although it appears enriched in referred cohorts, suggesting a weak association with phenotype expression that requires clinical correlation rather than automatic diagnosis of hemochromatosis [^113d7L9b] [^115YHe4i] [^113uk8ZF].

> Wait, let me verify the biological impact and penetrance before drawing conclusions: longitudinal population data from the HealthIron cohort show that compound heterozygotes have modestly higher transferrin saturation and ferritin than wild-type controls, with minimal progression over roughly 12 years and very low morbidity that does not differ from controls, particularly highlighting that premenopausal women resemble wild-type at baseline and that severe iron overload is rare without cofactors [^111AM8ou].

> Hold on, I should also check referred series for potential confounders: in a clinical referral study, every compound heterozygote with ferritin above 1000 μg/L had identifiable comorbid drivers such as alcohol, steatosis, diabetes, or viral hepatitis, reinforcing that this genotype alone seldom explains marked iron overload and that phenotype must be interpreted in context [^111YdsFM].

> Next, I should review what major guidelines actually say to avoid over-calling disease: EASL 2022 states management of p.C282Y/p.H63D should be driven by phenotype and cofactors, not genotype alone, and that patients with confirmed iron overload on this genotype warrant evaluation for other causes of iron excess rather than defaulting to an HFE-HH diagnosis, while EASL 2010 emphasizes that even C282Y homozygosity is insufficient for diagnosis without evidence of increased iron stores and provides sex-specific TS and ferritin thresholds to trigger evaluation; BSH 2018 aligns on threshold-based case finding in appropriate ancestry, and ACG 2019 underscores that H63D without C282Y is not a risk genotype, implying that compound heterozygotes require careful clinical correlation rather than automatic labeling as HH [^113uk8ZF] [^111viGqW] [^112ughp1] [^112dgQXJ] [^114QGrtg] [^114d4Dnb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, misclassification is common in practice, so I should confirm that abnormal iron tests alone in a non-HH genotype are not sufficient; indeed, a large tertiary-center review found frequent misdiagnosis and unnecessary phlebotomy in patients without compatible genotypes, typically in the setting of other liver disease or inflammation, so I need to ensure secondary causes are systematically excluded before attributing findings to HFE genetics [^113nXjcn].

> I will now examine risk stratification pragmatically: baseline fasting serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, CBC, and liver enzymes are essential; if TS is persistently elevated and ferritin exceeds approximately 300 μg/L in men or 200 μg/L in women, that merits evaluation regardless of genotype, whereas lower values reduce the likelihood of clinically meaningful iron overload in compound heterozygotes; risk modifiers that can convert a low-penetrance genotype into phenotypic expression include male sex, aging beyond 40 years in men or postmenopausal status in women, Northern European ancestry, alcohol excess, metabolic syndrome and fatty liver, viral hepatitis, and exogenous iron supplementation, so I should confirm and quantify these before ascribing causality to HFE status [^112dgQXJ] [^113uk8ZF] [^114QGrtg].

> If baseline iron studies are normal, I should not jump to treatment; rather, I should reassure, document the low-risk genotype status, and arrange infrequent surveillance tailored to sex and menopausal status, with counseling to moderate alcohol, manage weight and metabolic risk, and avoid unnecessary iron supplements; although exact surveillance intervals vary, periodic rechecking of ferritin and TS over time is reasonable for men and postmenopausal women, with less frequent follow-up in premenopausal women, and this conservative, phenotype-driven approach is consistent with EMQN and EASL guidance prioritizing clinical expression over genotype [^113oDkdH] [^113ESgdy] [^113uk8ZF].

> If iron studies are abnormal, I should double-check for secondary causes first because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and TS can be altered by liver disease; only after excluding inflammation, significant alcohol use, NAFLD, chronic viral hepatitis, malignancy, and transfusional or hemolytic states should I proceed to quantify iron burden with hepatic MRI for iron concentration, reserving biopsy for cases where staging of fibrosis is needed or noninvasive tests are inconclusive, and if true iron overload is confirmed, phlebotomy is appropriate with standard targets of ferritin near 50 μg/L during induction and maintenance typically under 100 μg/L, accompanied by assessment for end-organ complications including diabetes, arthropathy, and cardiomyopathy per guideline recommendations [^113uk8ZF] [^113ezoTm] [^112SQPtX].

> Let me think about how to phrase the diagnosis to avoid overstatement: for a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote, the correct chart language is that this genotype confers a low risk for mild to moderate iron loading, particularly in the presence of cofactors, and that HFE hemochromatosis is not diagnosed unless increased iron stores are demonstrated and alternate causes have been reasonably excluded; importantly, severe disease is uncommon in such individuals in population studies, so reassurance and risk-factor modification are key to patient communication [^113uk8ZF] [^111AM8ou].

> Now, regarding family screening, let me first confirm the principles before making an error: first-degree adult relatives can be offered HFE testing in a targeted manner, primarily to identify unsuspected C282Y homozygotes who warrant closer monitoring; I initially thought siblings of a compound heterozygote had a 25% chance of being C282Y homozygotes, but hold on, I should verify Mendelian expectations because that risk depends on parental carrier states and cannot be assumed without parental genotypes, so the safer recommendation is cascade testing focused on adult first-degree relatives with appropriate counseling, prioritizing detection of C282Y homozygosity and correlating with iron indices rather than labeling based on H63D alone [^1112CU78].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is too severe for this genotype; in that scenario, I should consider digenic or non-HFE causes of hereditary iron overload such as HJV, HAMP, TFR2, or SLC40A1, using next-generation sequencing panels when hepatic iron is clearly increased and common secondary causes have been excluded, because rare variants or dual hits can markedly increase penetrance and require the same phenotype-driven treatment while genetic confirmation proceeds in parallel [^112SQPtX] [^1126PYwW] [^114KaSko].

> I should double-check that my overall clinical conclusion aligns with the highest-quality evidence: C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity is common, produces small upward shifts in iron indices, shows low clinical penetrance, and should be managed based on phenotype and cofactors rather than genotype alone, with avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in the absence of proven iron overload and with periodic surveillance and risk-factor modification as the cornerstone of care, which is consistent with population cohort data and contemporary hepatology and hematology guidelines [^111AM8ou] [^113uk8ZF] [^114QGrtg].

The patient is a **compound heterozygote (C282Y/H63D)** for HFE mutations, which confers a **low risk of clinically significant iron overload** [^111AM8ou]. Most have normal or mildly elevated iron indices, and severe iron overload is rare without additional risk factors (e.g. alcohol, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C) [^111YdsFM] [^115YHe4i]. For **management**, guidance is based on phenotype: check ferritin and transferrin saturation [^114QGrtg], and if ferritin > 300 ng/mL (men) or > 200 ng/mL (women) or transferrin saturation > 45%, evaluate for other causes and consider phlebotomy only if iron overload is confirmed [^112dgQXJ] [^113uk8ZF]. Routine family screening is **not indicated** [^1112CU78], but first-degree relatives should have iron studies and HFE testing if abnormal [^11543X31].

## Clinical significance of compound heterozygosity

- **Risk of iron overload**: Compound heterozygotes [^115YHe4i] have a low risk of clinically significant iron overload [^111AM8ou]; most have normal or mildly elevated iron indices, and severe overload is rare without additional risk factors [^111YdsFM].

- **Clinical manifestations**: When present, iron overload is usually mild to moderate [^111YdsFM] and often associated with comorbidities such as alcohol use, metabolic syndrome, or hepatitis C [^1114p1ix].

- **Comparison with other genotypes**: Risk is significantly lower than C282Y homozygotes [^112pCm37] but slightly higher than simple heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes [^111AM8ou].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and monitoring

- **Initial evaluation**: Obtain serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, CBC, and LFTs to assess iron status and liver function [^115gFMow] [^112dgQXJ].

- **Interpretation of iron studies**: Elevated ferritin (> 300 ng/mL in men, > 200 ng/mL in women) or transferrin saturation (> 45%) warrants evaluation for other causes of hyperferritinemia (e.g. alcohol, metabolic syndrome, liver disease) [^112dgQXJ] [^114QGrtg].

- **Imaging and biopsy**: If significant iron overload is suspected, consider MRI or liver biopsy [^112dgQXJ] to confirm and quantify hepatic iron [^113uk8ZF].

- **Follow-up**: Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation every 1–2 years [^113oDkdH] if initial studies are normal; if elevated, monitor more frequently and address modifiable risk factors [^113ESgdy].

---

## Management strategies

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Advise moderation of alcohol, weight management, and avoidance of unnecessary iron supplements or vitamin C [^114QGrtg] [^113uk8ZF].

- **Phlebotomy**: Consider [^113uk8ZF] only if iron overload is confirmed by MRI or biopsy, based on individualized assessment [^114QGrtg].

- **Genetic counseling**: Provide counseling [^1139DCj8] to explain the low risk of significant iron overload and the influence of environmental factors [^114qBbCN].

---

## Family screening recommendations

For family screening, **first-degree relatives** do not require routine genetic testing [^1112CU78]; obtain iron studies and perform HFE testing only if results are abnormal [^11543X31]. Genetic counseling should be offered to explain the **low risk associated with compound heterozygosity** and the importance of monitoring iron status [^113oDkdH].

---

## Summary of clinical implications and recommendations

| **Clinical implication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Low risk of significant iron overload [^111AM8ou] | Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation every 1–2 years [^113oDkdH] |
| Mildly elevated iron indices [^111AM8ou] | Evaluate for other causes of hyperferritinemia [^114QGrtg] |
| Confirmed iron overload | Consider phlebotomy based on individualized assessment [^113uk8ZF] |
| Family members | - No routine genetic screening [^1112CU78] <br/> - Monitor iron status |

---

Compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D confers a **low risk of clinically significant iron overload** [^111AM8ou]. Management should be phenotype-guided, with regular monitoring of iron indices and individualized treatment if iron overload is confirmed [^113uk8ZF].

### Hfe C282y/h63d compound heterozygotes are at low risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity [^111AM8ou]. Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity is unknown among HFE compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D). We used a prospective population-based cohort study to estimate the prevalence of elevated iron indices and hemochromatosis-related morbidity for compound heterozygotes. In all, 31,192 subjects of northern European descent were genotyped for HFE C282Y and H63D.

An HFE-genotype stratified random sample of 1,438 subjects, followed for an average of 12 years to a mean age of 65 years, completed questionnaires and gave blood. Clinical examinations were blinded to HFE genotype. A total of 180 (84 males) clinically examined C282Y/H63D participants were compared with 330 (149 males) controls with neither HFE mutation; 132 (65 males) and 270 (122 males), respectively, had serum iron measures at both time points.

- **Serum measures**: Mean serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly greater for male and female compound heterozygotes than for wild-types at baseline and follow-up (all P < 0.02), except for females who were premenopausal at baseline, where SF was similar in both genotype groups. For subjects with serum measures from both baseline and follow-up, mean SF and TS levels did not change significantly for men or for postmenopausal women. However, for premenopausal women, SF levels increased from 43 to 109 microg/L for compound heterozygotes and from 35 to 64 microg/L for wild-types (both P < 0.001).

- **Morbidity prevalence**: Male and female compound heterozygotes had a similar prevalence of hemochromatosis-related morbidity compared to wild-types. One of 82 males and zero of 95 females had documented morbidity.

### The clinical relevance of compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D substitutions in hemochromatosis [^111YdsFM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Two major mutations are defined within the hemochromatosis gene, HFE. Although the effects of the C282Y substitution have been well characterized, the clinical significance of the C282Y/H63D state remains unclear. This study assessed the phenotypic expression in C282Y/H63D subjects as compared with C282Y homozygotes.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 91 C282Y/H63D probands, 158 C282Y/H63D subjects identified through family screening, and 483 C282Y homozygotes. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation, genotyping, biochemical assessment, and liver biopsy examination where clinically indicated.

- **Results**: C282Y/H63D probands had significantly less clinical and biochemical expression than C282Y homozygotes. Biochemical expression was higher in C282Y/H63D probands than in C282Y/H63D subjects identified through family screening (P < .001). Of the C282Y/H63D subjects with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 μg/L, all had known comorbid factors that could have contributed to the increased ferritin level. Of the 51 C282Y/H63D subjects who underwent liver biopsy examination, significantly increased iron stores were present in 9 subjects and hepatic fibrosis was present in 13. Twelve of the 13 had evidence of hepatic steatosis, excess alcohol consumption, or diabetes. The mobilizable iron level was significantly higher in C282Y homozygous males than in compound heterozygous males (P < .001). Genetic screening of C282Y/H63D first-degree relatives detected 5 C282Y homozygotes.

- **Conclusions**: C282Y/H63D subjects referred for assessment had a high prevalence of increased…

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^112dgQXJ]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically concerning the iron panel, EASL 2010 guidelines recommend evaluating C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes. This evaluation is necessary if there is an increased serum ferritin level (> 200 mg/L in females, > 300 mg/L in males), increased transferrin saturation (> 45% in females, > 50% in males), or increased liver iron attributable to other causes of hyperferritinemia.

### Prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene in the United States [^113d7L9b]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

Population-based estimates of the prevalence of disease-associated mutations, such as hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations, are essential for determining the usefulness of genetic screening.

- **Objective**: To estimate the prevalence of the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D in the US population.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional population-based study using samples from the DNA bank of phase 2 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1992 to 1994.

- **Setting and Participants**: Genotyped samples of cells from a total of 5,171 participants, cross-classified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, were analyzed.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Estimates of the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations.

- **Results**: The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity is estimated to be 0.26% (95% confidence interval, 0.12%-0.49%) and 1.89% (95% CI, 1.48%-2.43%) for H63D homozygosity. For compound heterozygosity, it is 1.97% (95% CI, 1.54%-2.49%). The prevalence estimates for C282Y heterozygosity (C282Y/wild type) are 9.54% among non-Hispanic whites, 2.33% among non-Hispanic blacks, and 2.75% among Mexican-Americans. The prevalence estimates of the C282Y mutation in the US population are 5.4% (95% CI, 4.7%-6.2%) and 13.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-14.8%) for the H63D mutation.

- **Conclusions**: Estimates of HFE mutation prevalence are within the expected range for non-Hispanic whites and blacks; however, the estimated prevalence of the C282Y mutation among Mexican-Americans is less than expected. Mutation data now need to be linked to clinically relevant indices, such as transferrin saturation level.

Regarding medical management for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to general principles, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend evaluating patients with p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygosity or p.H63D homozygosity and confirmed iron overload for other causes of iron overload.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^114qBbCN]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic reporting scenarios**: The diagnostic referral for an affected individual presents as homozygous p.C282Y. The individual carries the p. Cys282Tyr variant homozygously in the HFE gene. Reports should state that, in the presence of a suggestive phenotype, this genotype supports the diagnosis of HFE-related HH. A formal diagnosis requires demonstration of increased hepatic iron stores.

	- Additional comments may refer to implications of the result for other adult first-degree family members, and recommend genetic counselling for predictive/carrier testing. It is not appropriate to simply state that all relatives must or should be tested. Genetic testing for p.C282Y and biochemical testing for iron overload is recommended for first-degree adult family members.

- **Diagnostic referral of affected individual as compound heterozygous p.C282Y/p.H63D C282Y**: Patients with this genotype may experience iron overload, but typically to a much lesser degree than p.C282Y homozygous HH patients, and usually in association with other risk factors. Although compound heterozygotes might maintain elevated iron indices during middle age, documented iron overload-related disease is rare, and this genotype should therefore have a different interpretation than for a p.C282Y homozygote referred on the same basis. The genotype is common among the general European population, and a reference to the local estimated frequency may be given.

	- The individual is a carrier of both the p. Cys282Tyr and the p. His63Asp variants in the HFE gene. Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded.

Methods used for non-HFE-related HH testing

A total of 25 laboratories reported performing full gene sequencing for the diagnosis of non-HFE-related HH, with the majority (52%) offering a panel of tests for HJV, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1 (FPN), and HFE - whole gene. Some laboratories (24%) also offer testing for FTH1 (for hyperferritinemia), and two of the responding laboratories perform a more complete panel of tests for other iron overload-related genes, adding 5'UTRFTL (for hyperferritinemia), TF (for hypotransferrinemia), SLC11A2 (for anemia and iron overload), CP (for aceruloplasminemia), and BMP6 (so far not associated with human HH). The most common method used is direct DNA sequencing of the coding regions of selected genes, with some laboratories reporting other methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing of the detected variants and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification has been used in cases where a large gene deletion is suspected.

- **Reporting practices**: The reporting of HFE genotyping results is generally performed using standard pre-defined templates, most commonly (63%) adapted according to specific reasons for referral. The reporting models and interpretative comments included are usually based on established guidelines. Some laboratories refer to more general guidelines for genetic testing, but the majority refer to specific HH guidelines established either at a national level or from other published clinical or molecular diagnostic guidelines.

### Hemochromatosis: Genetic testing and clinical practice [^115RMQMK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The availability of a facile treatment for hemochromatosis renders early diagnosis of iron overload syndromes mandatory, and in many instances, genetic testing allows identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical disease before pathologic iron storage occurs. Numerous proteins implicated in iron homeostasis have recently come to light, and defects in the cognate genes are associated with iron storage. Although most adult patients with hereditary iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, an increasing number with hereditary iron storage have an HFE genotype not characteristic of the disease. Heterozygosity for mutations in the gene encoding ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is probably the second most common genetic cause of hereditary iron storage in adults; here, the primarily affected cell is the macrophage. Rare defects, including mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene, have also been identified in pedigrees affected with "non-HFE hemochromatosis".

Homozygous mutations in the newly identified genes encoding hemojuvelin (HFE2) and hepcidin (HAMP) cause juvenile hemochromatosis. At the same time, heterozygosity for mutations in these genes can modify the clinical expression of iron storage in patients predisposed to iron storage in adult life. Hemochromatosis might thus be considered a polygenic disease with strong environmental influences on its clinical expression. As our mechanistic understanding of iron pathophysiology improves, our desire to integrate clinical decision-making with the results of laboratory tests and molecular diagnostics continues to grow.

Follow-up of unaffected p.C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes

It is recognized that early treatment to normalize iron stores increases the likelihood that the potential serious complications of the disease are effectively prevented, morbidity and mortality are reduced, and quality of life is increased. Moreover, it was recently shown in a cohort of 1,086 p.C282Y homozygous patients, treated at early stages, that they have a long-term survival superior to the general population, with a decreased number of deaths by cardiovascular disease or extra-hepatic cancer, further supporting the benefit of sustained phlebotomy treatment of iron overload in HH.

The question remains, however, as to whether preventive treatment should be recommended to all unaffected but genetically confirmed individuals because there is no evidence that all of these subjects will necessarily develop iron overload-related morbidity. To address this question, a systematic literature search was performed. Search terms were phrased as PICO where patients (P) were defined as clinically or biochemically unaffected p.C282Y homozygotes or p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes; interventions (I) were the follow-up of iron indices (TS, SF) and phlebotomy treatment in comparison (C) with no intervention, and the expected outcome (O) was the evolution of iron indices and/or development of clinical symptoms. All systematic reviews or meta-analyses and comparative designs (cohort studies, case–control studies, and cross-sectional studies) were eligible for inclusion.

### Estimated analytic validity of HFE C282Y mutation testing in population screening: The potential value of confirmatory testing [^116CMxS3]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the analytic sensitivity and specificity of HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity in the hypothetical setting of population screening for hemochromatosis.

- **Methods**: We analyzed published results of the Molecular Genetics Survey performed by the American College of Medical Genetics/College of American Pathologists between 1998 and 2002, taking into account its educational nature.

- **Results**: Analytic sensitivity for C282Y homozygosity is 98.4% (95% CI 95.9%-99.5%). The analytic specificity is 99.8% (99.4%-99.9%). At a frequency of 40 per 10,000 for the homozygous genotype, the analytic positive predictive value is 66%.

- **Conclusion**: HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity is highly reliable. Homozygosity is uncommon in population screening, however, and confirmatory testing should be considered.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^115Xrrw7]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

A variety of methods for HFE genotyping are in use by laboratories participating in the EMQN EQA scheme for HFE HH. The most common testing strategies detect the p.C282Y (c.845G > A) and p.H63D (c.187C > G) variants and are based on PCR/restriction enzyme digestion or various allele-specific amplification strategies.

The vast majority of HFE-related hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for p.C282Y. p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygosity may be a risk factor predisposing to mild or moderate forms of iron overload when associated with comorbidity factors, for example, alcohol or metabolic syndrome. The association of homozygosity for p.H63D with iron overload is debated and requires further clinical research. It is now recommended that other risk factors or genetic causes be sought and investigated in patients with this genotype and demonstrated iron overload. Testing for these two HFE variants can be performed either sequentially or simultaneously.

Sequential testing, starting with p.C282Y, will avoid detection of p.H63D homozygotes, and this has been considered by most experts as an advantage. However, this reflex testing approach increases the turnaround time and overall cost. A simultaneous testing strategy should be weighed against the possibility of creating anxiety or unnecessary investigation. The laboratory should consider these factors when deciding to use this strategy. When a method detects both variants concurrently, which is generally the case, there is an obligation to review the results thoroughly.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: Missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis [^113nXjcn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that can cause iron overload and organ damage. It is characterized by mutations in the HFE gene, with HFE C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) being at risk of developing manifestations of hemochromatosis. Abnormal iron study results also occur in many liver and hematologic diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

- **Methods**: Pertinent clinical and laboratory data, including HFE genotype, were tabulated from the electronic medical records of patients with the International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision code 275, "disorders of iron metabolism", who were seen at a tertiary referral center between January 2002 and May 2012.

- **Results**: HFE genotyping was obtained in only 373 of 601 patients (62%); 200 were C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Of the 173 patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes, 53% were misdiagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 38% underwent phlebotomy. In two thirds of these cases, the misdiagnosis was made by a nonspecialist. In the remaining 228 patients who were not genotyped, 80 were diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 64 were phlebotomized. Of patients misdiagnosed with hemochromatosis, 68% had known liver disease and 5% had a hematologic cause of abnormal iron study results.

- **Conclusions**: Abnormal iron study results in patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes commonly lead to a misdiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis and inappropriate treatment.

### A population-based study of the effect of the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations on iron metabolism [^111F5W6S]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

The C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene are important causes of hemochromatosis. In the elderly, these mutations might be associated with increased morbidity because of the lifelong accumulation of iron. In a population-based sample of the elderly, we determined the value of genotyping for HFE mutations to screen for subclinical hemochromatosis. HFE genotype frequencies were determined in a random group of 2095 subjects (55 years and over). Within this random group, we selected a total of 342 individuals across the six genotype groups to measure their serum transferrin saturation, iron, and ferritin levels.

We also estimated the heritability and parameters needed to evaluate screening, including the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of HFE genotypes. Iron parameters were significantly increased in subjects who were homozygous, heterozygous, or compound heterozygous. The effect of the mutations was more pronounced in men than in women. For the H63D mutation, an allele dose effect was observed. The HFE gene explained about 5% of the variability in serum iron indices.

The PPV for hemochromatosis for the C282Y homozygous was 100% in men and 67% in women. The NPV of the wild-type allele was 97% for both men and women. The sensitivity of both mutations was 70% for men and 52% for women, and the specificity was 62% for men and 64% for women. Our study shows that the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations are determinants of iron parameters in the elderly and will be effective in detecting individuals at high risk of hemochromatosis. However, when screening based on t

### H63D mutation in the HFE gene increases iron overload in beta-thalassemia carriers [^115tDQ94]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. The HFE gene implicated in this disorder has been identified on chromosome 6 (6p21.3). The most prevalent mutation in HH patients changes the 282 cysteine residue to tyrosine (C282Y). The role of a second mutation that changes the 63 histidine to aspartic acid (H63D) in iron overload has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the H63D mutation on the ferritin levels of beta-thalassemia carriers.

- **Design and methods**: Beta-thalassemia carriers have a tendency to increase iron absorption because of mild anemia and slightly increased erythropoiesis. Differences in ferritin levels between homozygotes for H63D and wild type may indicate a modulator effect of the HFE mutation on iron absorption. We studied 152 healthy males, heterozygous for beta-thalassemia. Serum ferritin was measured by chemiluminescence. H63D genotypes were determined by digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products with MboI restriction enzyme.

- **Results**: Forty-five subjects were H63D heterozygotes and four subjects were H63D homozygotes. Ferritin levels were (mean ± SD): 250 ± 138 microg/L in homozygotes for the wild type H/H; 295 ± 186 microg/L in H/D heterozygotes; and 389 ± 75 microg/L in homozygotes for the mutation D/D. The difference in ferritin values between H/H and D/D is statistically significant (p = 0.022).

- **Interpretation and conclusions**: Beta-thalassemia carriers who are homozygotes for the H63D mutation have higher ferritin levels than other genotypes.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis: Only 1% of adult HFEC282Y homozygotes in South Wales have a clinical diagnosis of iron overload [^116s96RC]. Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

In northern Europe, about 90% of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for a single mutation (C282Y) of the HFE gene, and approximately 1 in 150 people in the general population carries this genotype. However, the clinical significance of HFE mutations remains uncertain, as is the proportion of people homozygous for C282Y who will develop clinical symptoms leading to a diagnosis of HH. A systematic review of patients with HH over a 2-year period within a defined UK region has revealed that only 1.2% of adult C282Y homozygotes have been diagnosed with iron overload and received treatment. Among those in whom body iron load could be estimated, only 51% had more than 4 g of iron, which is the diagnostic threshold for iron overload.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^113oDkdH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The guidance for reporting predictive/carrier testing results assumes that the iron status of the individual is not known and that appropriate genetic counseling has been performed prior to testing. In cases where screening is performed with additional genetic and/or phenotypic data, reporting recommendations may be adapted to reflect individual case scenarios more closely.

- **Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected); homozygous p.C282Y**: The individual is homozygous for the p. Cys282Tyr variant in the HFE gene. He is at an increased risk of developing HFE-related HH, and it is recommended that serum iron parameters (TS and ferritin) be monitored. The report may refer to implications of the result for other adult family members and suggest that genetic counseling be considered if not previously performed. Given the variable penetrance of p.C282Y homozygosity, it is not considered appropriate to state that the individual has, or will go on to develop, HH if no evidence of phenotypic expression is given.

- **Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected); compound heterozygous p.C282Y/p.H63D**: The individual is a carrier of both the p. Cys282Tyr and p. His63Asp variants in the HFE gene and is at low risk of developing significant iron overload. He may be at risk of developing mild-to-moderate iron overload if there is an association with other comorbidity factors (e.g. alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, and/or metabolic syndrome). Additional comments may suggest monitoring of iron indices.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^115YHe4i]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The association with hemochromatosis of the p.H63D variant in HFE (rs1799945, NG_008720.2:g.8671C > G; NM_000410.3:c.187C > G; NP_000401.1:p. His63Asp) was in question since its first description. Subsequent case-control studies have reported a median p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygous genotype frequency among clinically characterized hemochromatosis cohorts of 4.6% (0–21.7%), which is significantly higher than the compound heterozygote frequency of 1.7% (0–7.7%) reported in screening studies. Although this observation suggests that compound heterozygosity is associated with hemochromatosis, longitudinal studies have shown that the risk of disease progression is low in compound heterozygotes identified by screening. A more recent report of the evolution of iron indices in 180 compound heterozygotes for p.C282Y and p.H63D identified in the HealthIron study concluded that in these, the mean iron indices do not change during middle age in males, but SF increases in females. Although maintaining elevated iron indices during middle age, documented iron overload-related disease in compound heterozygotes is rare. Furthermore, p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygote hemochromatosis patients with clinical disease expression frequently have additional risk factors for iron overload or liver disease. In conclusion, although p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygosity is a risk factor for slightly higher serum iron parameters and mildly increased hepatic iron stores, this genotype is considered insufficient to cause hemochromatosis.

### Incidence of liver complications with hemochromatosis-associated HFE p.C282Y homozygosity: The role of central adiposity [^113cLJ6T]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The iron overload condition, hemochromatosis, is the most common genetic disorder in people of Northern European ancestry. HFE gene mutations downregulate hepcidin protein, increasing circulating iron and, in some cases, causing iron accumulation. Iron overload can increase oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, leading to insulin resistance, liver scarring, and hepatocellular carcinoma if left untreated.

Among Northern Europeans, the HFE p.C282Y homozygous (+/+) genotype is present in up to 1 in 150 persons and is the predominant cause of hemochromatosis. Studies of p.C282Y+/+ individuals in population samples reported low clinical penetrance, although estimates have increased with increasing sample size and inclusion of older ages. Beutler et al. (n = 152 p.C282Y+/+) found that only 1% had hemochromatosis symptoms in Californian health appraisal clinics after excluding diagnosed patients. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study (HEIRS) examined 36,962 men and 62,749 women (median age 50 years [range: 25–100]) and reported liver complications as the only disease associated in 299 p.C282Y+/+ males (odds ratios [OR] = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.49–7.22), with no association in female p.C282Y+/+ (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.15–2.44) compared to those without p.C282Y or p.H63D HFE variants.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116hmY5q]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

When questioned about the real need and implications of testing for p.H63D in the diagnosis of HFE-related HH, no consensual opinions were obtained among respondents. Some respondents expressed serious doubts about whether they should test for p.H63D (16.7%), whereas others unambiguously declared that there is no need to test for p.H63D (19.4%). The common arguments against testing include its lack of clinical relevance, its high frequency in the normal population with uncertain implications, and the possibility of raising unnecessary anxiety. The continued offering of this test is often attributed to the pressure from requesting clinicians.

The majority of laboratories (48.6%), however, still consider testing for p.H63D to be necessary and/or important. They emphasized the need for careful wording in reports, particularly in the absence of p.C282Y, and suggested that results should be contextualized. The most consistent justification for testing was the increased risk of iron overload in p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, with a minority also acknowledging a risk for p.H63D homozygotes. Additionally, some respondents highlighted the importance of providing lifestyle recommendations in these cases.

### Prevalence of HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations in a French-Canadian population of neonates and in referred patients [^115jqxmi]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disease characterized by exaggerated absorption of intestinal iron leading to its accumulation in some organs over the years. Its prevalence is estimated to be 3–5/1000 in Caucasians. A single mutation, C282Y, in the HFE gene explains 80–90% of all diagnosed cases in populations of northwestern European ancestry. The importance of another frequent mutation in this gene, H63D, as well as of C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, is still a matter of debate. We estimated the prevalence of these mutations in newborns from a genetically well-defined French-Canadian population in Quebec City. We compared genotype and allele frequencies between neonates and referred patients for HFE molecular analysis.

We genotyped anonymous-unlinked cord blood samples for C282Y (n = 881) and H63D (n = 870) mutations from neonates. Referred patients (n = 1084) were genotyped in two different laboratories and pooled after verifying the similarity of both groups. No C282Y homozygote was found in neonates (allele frequency = 0.043). However, we identified 163 C282Y homozygotes (15%) among 1084 referred patients, leading to a not surprising 97-fold enrichment of this genotype. We found a similar proportion of genotypes homozygous for H63D in both groups, suggesting a weak association with the disease. However, we found a 5-fold enrichment of compound heterozygotes in the referred group. Fewer C282Y homozygotes were observed in the French-Canadian population than in northwest European populations. However, the strong enrichment of homozygotes between the neonates and referred patients was significant.

### Iron overload in an HFE heterozygous carrier: A case report and literature review [^114RxsK4]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron absorption and tissue deposition. Three loss-of-function mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), namely, C282Y (c.845G > A), H63D (c.187C > G), and S65C (c.193A > T), account for the vast majority of HH cases. These mutations cause alterations in HFE membrane expression, structure, and/or activity, leading to dysregulation of iron absorption. It is well established that the phenotypic expression of HFE mutations varies markedly.

Herein, we describe a 64-year-old Caucasian woman with a reported history of hemochromatosis. The father of the patient had died of complications due to iron overload. Testing of HFE codon C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations showed heterozygous C282Y. The patient had significantly elevated transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) levels. Her liver function test results showed elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. The patient has been treated with regular phlebotomy to prevent the clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits of mutations: 20 years of research [^117VYyDd]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that is hallmarked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs. The HFE mutation p. Cys282Tyr is pathologically most relevant and occurs in the Caucasian population with a carrier frequency of up to 1 in 8 in specific European regions. Despite this high prevalence, the mutation causes a clinically relevant phenotype only in a minority of cases. In this review, we summarize historical facts and recent research findings about hereditary hemochromatosis and outline the pathological consequences of the associated gene defects. In addition, we discuss potential advantages of HFE mutations in asymptomatic carriers.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^116CYsNU]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The iron overload condition hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) can cause liver cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. Males homozygous for the p.C282Y missense mutation in the Homeostatin Iron Regulator (HFE) gene have the greatest risk; yet, only a minority develop these conditions. This study aimed to determine whether common genetic variants influencing iron levels or liver disease risk in the general population also modify clinical penetrance in HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D carriers.

We studied 1,294 male and 1,596 female UK Biobank HFE p.C282Y homozygous participants of European ancestry with medical records up to 14 years after the baseline assessment. Polygenic scores were employed to quantify genetic effects of blood iron biomarkers and relevant diseases identified in the general population. Analyses were also performed in other HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D genotype groups.

- **Results**: In male p.C282Y homozygotes, a higher iron polygenic score increased the risk of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis diagnoses (odds ratio for the top 20% of iron polygenic score vs. the bottom 20% = 4.90; 95% confidence intervals, 1.63–14.73; p = 0.005), liver cancer, and osteoarthritis but not diabetes. A liver cirrhosis polygenic score was associated with liver cancer diagnoses. In female p.C282Y homozygotes, the osteoarthritis polygenic score was associated with increased osteoarthritis diagnoses, and the type-2 diabetes polygenic score was associated with diabetes. However, the iron polygenic score was not robustly associated with diagnoses in p.C282Y female homozygotes or in other p.C282Y/p.H63D genotypes.

- **Conclusion**: The study provides valuable insights into the role of genetic modifiers on liver endpoints in individuals with HFE hemochromatosis, suggesting potential pathways for risk stratification and management in affected individuals.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1112CU78]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Genetic testing of clinically asymptomatic adult first-degree relatives of individuals with rare forms of HFE- or non-HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) aims to identify additional individuals at risk. This testing is therefore recommended.

- **Recommendations for diagnostic and predictive testing**: Population screening for the p.C282Y variant is not currently recommended (1B). It is considered good practice to confirm elevated transferrin saturation (TS) before HFE genetic diagnostic testing (1B). Testing adult siblings (brothers and sisters) of p.C282Y homozygotes is recommended due to the increased risk of p.C282Y homozygosity and related increased morbidity (1B). Testing adult offspring of p.C282Y homozygotes is also recommended because of the similar risks (1C). Testing asymptomatic parents of p.C282Y homozygotes is not systematically recommended; instead, it should be a clinical decision based on their age, sex, and ferritin levels, which influence the probability of developing severe iron overload (1C). Systematic testing of adult first-degree relatives of p.C282Y heterozygotes is not currently recommended in the absence of evidence of benefit (2C). HFE testing of minors is not recommended (1B). Prenatal diagnosis is not appropriate in HFE-related HH because it is a treatable, adult-onset condition (1C). Genetic testing of first-degree relatives for both rare HFE-related and non-HFE-related HH should be performed by specialist/reference centers or laboratories (2C).

### Contribution of different HFE genotypes to iron overload disease: a pooled analysis [^112pCm37]. Genetics in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the contribution of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene to the clinical expression of hereditary hemochromatosis, we conducted a pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies. These studies reported HFE genotype data, which was used to evaluate the association of different HFE genotypes with iron overload. Additionally, we used data from the pooled analysis and published data to estimate the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype.

Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation carried the largest risk for iron overload (OR = 4383, 95% CI 1374 to > 10,000) and accounted for the majority of hemochromatosis cases (attributable fraction (AF) = 0.73). Risks for other genotypes were much smaller: OR = 32 for genotype C282Y/H63D (95% CI 18.5 to 55.4, AF = 0.06); OR = 5.7 for H63D/H63D (95% CI 3.2 to 10.1, AF = 0.01); OR = 4.1 for C282Y heterozygosity (95% CI 2.9 to 5.8, with heterogeneity in study results, making this association uncertain); and OR = 1.6 for H63D heterozygosity (95% CI 1 to 2.6, AF = 0.03). Estimates of penetrance for the C282Y/C282Y genotype were highly sensitive to estimates of the prevalence of iron overload disease. At a prevalence of 2.5 per 1000 or less, penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is unlikely to exceed 50%. Penetrance of other HFE genotypes is much lower.

C282Y homozygosity confers the highest risk for iron overload, but the H63D mutation is also associated with increased risk. Our data indicate a gradient of risk associated with different HFE genotypes and suggest the presence of other modifiers, either genetic or environmental, that contribute to the variability in expression.

### Iron overload in HFE C282Y heterozygotes at first genetic testing: A strategy for identifying rare HFE variants [^116j4nu8]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Heterozygotes for the p. Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene do not usually express a hemochromatosis phenotype. Aside from the compound heterozygous state for C282Y and the widespread p. His63Asp (H63D) variant allele, other rare HFE mutations can be found in trans on chromosome 6.

- **Design and methods**: We performed molecular investigations of the genes implicated in hereditary hemochromatosis in six patients who presented with iron overload but were simple heterozygotes for the HFE C282Y mutation at first genetic testing. Functional impairment of new variants was deduced from computational methods, including molecular modeling studies.

- **Results**: We identified four rare HFE mutant alleles, three of which have not been previously described. One mutation is a 13-nucleotide deletion in exon 6 (c.1022_1034del13, p. His341_Ala345 > LeufsX119), predicted to lead to an elongated and unstable protein. The second one is a substitution of the last nucleotide of exon 2 (c.340G > A, p. Glu114Lys), which modifies the relative solvent accessibility in a loop interface. The third mutation, p. Arg67Cys, is also located in exon 2 and introduces a destabilization of the secondary structure within a loop of the α1 domain. We also found the previously reported c.548T > C (p. Leu183Pro) missense mutation in exon 3. No other known iron genes were mutated. We present an algorithm at the clinical and genetic levels for identifying patients deserving further investigation.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that additional mutations in HFE may have a clinical impact in C282Y carriers.

Methods used for HFE testing: All the laboratories responding to this survey routinely screen for the HFE variants p.C282Y and p.H63D, although some of them (12%) report having a policy of testing for p.H63D only in the situation of clinically affected patients with a previous result showing p.C282Y heterozygosity. In addition, 64% of respondents also test routinely for the p.S65C variant, with some reporting that the test is performed occasionally and only on specific demand. A minority of laboratories (6%) reported routinely testing for other genetic variants included in commercially sourced kits.

A large number of different methods are used by laboratories. The four methodological approaches most frequently reported were:

- **Real-time PCR**: 41%
- **PCR and RFLP**: 16%
- **PCR and reverse hybridization**: 14%
- **Direct sequencing**: 11%

Additionally, other less commonly used methods (4.5–5.5%) include:

- **Allele-specific PCR**
- **PCR and high-resolution melting or single-strand conformational polymorphism**
- **Pyrosequencing**
- **Single base extension**

According to this survey, allelic discrimination real-time PCR was the most commonly described method for HFE genotyping.

### Differential HFE allele expression in hemochromatosis heterozygotes [^116J24j1]. Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with C282Y homozygosity. Some heterozygotes may also present with abnormal iron parameters; however, the precise role of H63D and C282Y mutations in iron overload is poorly understood. We investigated the level of expression of the mutated and unmutated HFE alleles in these heterozygous patients.

- **Methods**: We studied the expression of HFE messenger RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 34 heterozygotes using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by enzymatic digestion or sequence analysis of the PCR products, which allows relative quantification of mutated and unmutated transcripts. HFE proteins were quantified by Western blotting in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphocyte extracts from 2 C282Y and H63D homozygotes and a compound heterozygote.

- **Results**: (187C > G; H63D) mutated transcripts predominated in H63D and compound heterozygotes, and the normal transcripts in C282Y heterozygotes. The amount of HFE protein was increased in the H63D homozygotes and the compound heterozygote compared with the C282Y homozygotes. We also discovered a new mutation at codon 282 (C282S) associated with severe iron overload.

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrate the existence of differential allelic expression of the HFE alleles, suggesting that the (187C > G; H63D) mutation plays a role in the disease expression in H63D heterozygotes, particularly when associated with environmental or host factors.

### The frequency and potential implications of HFE genetic variants in children with cystic fibrosis [^117Vbnna]. Pediatric pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Our unanticipated incidental discovery of three children with CF and the C282Y/H63D genotype, accompanied by abnormal iron status biomarkers, revealed their predisposition to HH, the most common genetic disorder among Caucasians of northwestern European ancestry with a prevalence as high as 1 in 250. The relatively high prevalence of HFE variants we observed, confirming previous studies, is not surprising given their ancestry and global data on the allelic frequency of C282Y. In fact, the general population of northwestern European ancestry carries HFE variants with approximately the same frequency as the CF population.

Both the C282Y HFE variant and the most prevalent CFTR variant, F508del, have been dated by ancient DNA studies or family trio DNA-based estimations to the Early Bronze Age (about 5000 years ago). Over many centuries, the two variants, conferring presumed selective advantages, have proliferated together and must have been co-transmitted in many families. What is surprising, however, is that the risk of HH in CF and its potential for causing a treatable, in fact preventable with phlebotomies, liver disease has not been previously described, even in previous determinations of HFE variant frequency within discrete CF populations.

According to clinical practice guidelines, HH genetic diagnosis and disease staging should be accomplished after identifying two HFE pathogenic variants. Stage 1 refers to genetic predisposition in which two HFE variants are present with no abnormalities detected in iron status.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); heterozygous p.C282Y. It has been documented that some p.C282Y heterozygotes may exhibit mild to moderately raised indices of iron overload, although complications due to iron overload are very rare and may be influenced by additional factors, both genetic and environmental. The individual is a carrier of the p. Cys282Tyr variant in the HFE gene. Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded. In patients with a severe iron overload phenotype, other rare forms of HH cannot be excluded. Additional comments may refer to implications of the result for other adult first-degree family members, and genetic counselling may be considered. It is not considered appropriate to recommend predictive/carrier testing to all relatives (cascade family screening). Biochemical testing of first-degree adult family members may be considered.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); homozygous p.H63D. It has been suggested that p.H63D homozygotes may have a slight risk of iron overload. Despite some geographical variation, this genotype is present in about 3% of the general European population, and its significance as a susceptibility factor remains uncertain. The individual is homozygous for the p. His63Asp variant in the HFE gene. Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded. This genotype may be associated with a slight increase of ferritin and TS. Other causes of iron overload should be considered. In patients with a severe iron overload phenotype, other rare forms of HH should be evaluated.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^1177BJZT]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Iron overload in humans is associated with a variety of genetic and acquired conditions. Of these, HFE hemochromatosis (HFE-HC) is by far the most frequent and well-defined inherited cause when considering epidemiological aspects and risks for iron-related morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with HFE-HC are homozygotes for the C282Y polymorphism [1]. Without therapeutic intervention, there is a risk that iron overload will occur, with the potential for tissue damage and disease.

While a specific genetic test now allows for the diagnosis of HFE-HC, the uncertainty in defining cases and disease burden, as well as the low phenotypic penetrance of C282Y homozygosity, poses a number of clinical problems in the management of patients with HC. This clinical practice guideline will therefore focus on HFE-HC, while rarer forms of genetic iron overload recently attributed to pathogenic mutations of transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), hepcidin (HAMP), hemojuvelin (HJV), or to a subtype of ferroportin (FPN) mutations, on which limited and sparse clinical and epidemiologic data are available, will not be discussed. We have developed recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and management of HFE-HC.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116uCQke]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The EMQN external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for HFE continues to detect both genotyping errors and variable quality of interpretive comments. This indicates the continued importance of quality assurance and improvement. It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent). The techniques used should be validated in-house with appropriate sample types and numbers. If CE-marked IVD kits are used, in-house verification should be performed. Laboratories reporting HFE testing results should participate annually in EQA. EQA provides a long-term, retrospective assessment of laboratory performance, allowing laboratories to demonstrate consensus with their peers and providing information on inter-method comparability. Unless dictated by legislation, the choice of EQA provider lies with the laboratory; however, the use of an EQA programme that assesses reporting as well as genotyping and that is accredited to ISO 17043 is recommended, wherever possible.

- **Recommendations for HFE testing strategies**: Laboratories providing testing for HFE-associated HH should test for p.C282Y (1A). According to local practice, p.H63D can be considered an optional complementary test that can be offered sequentially or simultaneously with p.C282Y testing (2C). Testing for p.S65C should not be offered; if detected as an incidental finding, it should not be reported (1B). It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited according to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent).

### HFE gene mutation (C282Y) and phenotypic expression among a hospitalised population in a high prevalence area of haemochromatosis [^116LwM4C]. Gut (2000). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that up to 0.5% of the Caucasian population is homozygous for the HFE gene C282Y mutation. High prevalence values have been reported in Northern Europe. To what extent the presence of this mutation is associated with overt clinical haemochromatosis is unclear.

- **Aim**: To determine the prevalence of the C282Y allele in a hospitalised population of an acute medical department, and study the phenotypic expression in the homozygotes.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were obtained from 2027 hospitalised patients; 1900 Caucasians and 127 non-Caucasians. Serum iron, transferrin, and ferritin were measured at admission. The presence of the HFE gene mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis. Follow-up fasting blood samples were obtained from patients homozygous for the mutation.

- **Results**: Fourteen of the 1900 Caucasian subjects (0.74%) were homozygous and 224 (11.8%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, including 32 subjects (1.7%) who were compound heterozygous for the C282Y and H63D mutations. Ten of 14 (71%) homozygous patients displayed mild to moderate biochemical expression of haemochromatosis with a serum ferritin level < 550 µg/l. Two (14%) patients were "non-expressing", and two of five in whom liver biopsies were carried out had cirrhosis, including one with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in a hospitalised population was 0.74%. However, the majority of homozygous patients displayed mild to moderate biochemical expression. C282Y mutation screening may detect.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^114iaTPc]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically concerning genetic testing, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing for hemochromatosis. This should occur after obtaining informed consent for genetic testing in patients with clinical and biochemical signs of hemochromatosis, elevated transferrin saturation, and high serum ferritin concentrations, or otherwise unexplained persistently elevated transferrin saturation.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1139DCj8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The following provides basic guidelines for reporting HFE test results based on reasons for referral and resulting genotypes. Points regarded as essential are highlighted in italics. It should be stressed that these guidelines are presented under the assumption that HFE genotyping is performed to confirm, exclude, or predict the most common HFE-related forms of HH. They do not cover rare or population-specific alternative variants in HFE. Other forms of iron overload and other types of HH exist, and further investigation may be suggested where relevant clinical and biochemical features indicate. In those rare cases with a strongly suggestive phenotype that are not confirmed to be p.C282Y homozygous, investigation for other genetic forms of HH or referral to a specialist unit may be suggested. However, it must be stressed that these are rare and should only be considered in cases where there is a documented severe iron overload that remains unexplained after the exclusion of other causes.

Reference to the implications of the HFE test result for other adult family members and recommendations for genetic counselling should be reserved only for individuals carrying the p.C282Y variant; otherwise, it may create unnecessary anxiety. In cases where screening is performed with additional genetic and/or phenotypic data, reporting recommendations may be adapted to reflect individual case scenarios more closely.

### Variable phenotypic presentation of iron overload in H63D homozygotes: Are genetic modifiers the cause [^112FsSX3]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

First considered as a polymorphism of the HFE gene, the H63D mutation is now widely recognized as a haemochromatosis-associated allele. However, few H63D homozygotes with clinical manifestations of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have been reported. Concurrently, an increasing number of genes have been shown to interact with HFE in iron metabolism.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical expression of iron overload (IO) associated with H63D homozygosity and to search for potential genetic modifiers within the HFE or other genes that could explain the variability of the phenotypes. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical phenotype of 56 H63D homozygotes referred for a personal or family history of IO. For each subject, we examined intragenic HFE haplotypes and transferrin receptor (TfR) gene polymorphisms and searched for the Y250X mutation on the TFR2 gene. Additionally, we sequenced the HFE gene of H63D homozygotes with HH.

Results indicated that fifty of 56 subjects had biological and/or clinical abnormalities of iron metabolism. Up to two-thirds of patients (n = 34) had no acquired cause of IO. Among these, 12 had a phenotypic diagnosis of HH. In the iron-loaded group, there was a strong prevalence of male patients. No correlation was found between the potential genetic modifiers and phenotypes, and no additional mutation of the HFE was identified.

In conclusion, the variable phenotypes associated with H63D homozygosity do not appear to be linked to other HFE mutations, to the TFR2 Y250X mutation, or to HFE or TfR gene intragenic polymorphisms.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^114P7Lc5]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Clinical elements that should raise a definite suspicion of HC are reported. In Whites with a negative first-level HFE test (i.e. p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity is not detected) and in non-Whites, a second-level genetic test should be considered to identify rarer variants in the HFE or other genes known to be linked to hepcidin control. In general, these types of HC are less influenced by cofactors and characterized by a more severe and homogeneous clinical picture appearing at a younger age. Their molecular diagnosis is often complex since variants in HC genes other than HFE are typically private (i.e. restricted to members of only one or a few families).

To this end, modern approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly expanded the diagnostic possibilities in rarer HC while at the same time opening enormous challenges of interpretation of the results. NGS is generally available only at referral centers and requires specific expertise to avoid misdiagnosis, with a long wait time for results. Nonetheless, treatment of patients with a defined HC phenotype should not be delayed pending the result of the genetic test. Recently, NGS methods have also made it possible to estimate the global prevalence of HFE and non-HFE HC in different populations.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly in the context of genetic testing, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining HFE testing for the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in all patients with unexplained increased serum ferritin and increased transferrin saturation. HFE testing should be pursued only in patients with increased transferrin saturation.

### Digenic inheritance of mutations in HAMP and HFE results in different types of haemochromatosis [^1126PYwW]. Human Molecular Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Haemochromatosis (HH) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease caused by inappropriate iron absorption. Most HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, penetrance of the C282Y mutation is incomplete, and other genetic factors may well affect the HH phenotype. Ferroportin and TFR2 mutations also cause HH, and two HAMP mutations have recently been reported that cause juvenile haemochromatosis (JH) in the homozygous state. Here, we report evidence for digenic inheritance of HH.

We have detected two new HAMP mutations in two different families, in which there is concordance between the severity of iron overload and heterozygosity for HAMP mutations when present with the HFE C282Y mutation.

- **Family A**: The proband has a JH phenotype and is heterozygous for C282Y and a novel HAMP mutation, Met50del IVS2+1(-G). This is a four nucleotide ATGG deletion which causes a frameshift. The proband's unaffected mother is also heterozygous for Met50del IVS2+1(-G), but lacks the C282Y mutation and is heterozygous for the HFE H63D mutation. Met50del IVS2+1(-G) was absent from 642 control chromosomes.

- **Family B**: A second novel, less severe HAMP mutation, G71D, was identified. This was detected in the general population at an allele frequency of 0.3%.

We propose that the phenotype of C282Y heterozygotes and homozygotes may be modified by heterozygosity for mutations that disrupt the function of hepcidin in iron homeostasis, with the severity of iron overload corresponding to the severity of the HAMP mutation.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of HFE gene mutations in patients with iron overload [^116Je1aJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

The HFE gene contains two mutant alleles: C282Y and H63D. The C282Y mutation occurs in 55–100% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. The aim of our study was to re-examine the frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with mild and marked iron overload and in normal subjects.

A total of 82 patients with iron overload were included in this study. They underwent hepatic iron index determination and/or quantitation of iron stores by phlebotomy. The control group consisted of 81 healthy blood donors. HFE mutation analysis was performed on leukocyte DNA using PCR-amplified genomic DNA.

Of patients with iron overload, 70 out of 82 (85%) were homozygous for C282Y versus 2 out of 81 (2.5%) in the control population. Four patients had no HFE mutations despite significant iron overload, including a sister and brother (brother not included in the study group) with hepatic iron concentrations greater than 500 micromoles per gram dry weight.

In conclusion, 85% of our patients with iron overload were C282Y homozygotes, although a few had no HFE gene mutations. Pooled data and analysis of chromosomes considered to be at risk for H63D indicate that H63D is associated with iron overload.

### Nonexpressing homozygotes for C282Y hemochromatosis: minority or majority of cases [^117XYeP1]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Genetic testing for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene has been a major advance in the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. In most studies, more than 90% of typical hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Large-scale population screening studies in predominantly Caucasian populations have demonstrated a high prevalence of C282Y homozygotes, approximately 1 in 300. Despite this high prevalence by genetic testing, the clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis and mortality from the disease are much less common.

One possibility is the presence of many undiagnosed cases with nonspecific symptoms and deaths attributed to liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease without recognizing iron overload secondary to hemochromatosis. Another possibility is a high prevalence of nonexpressing homozygotes. In this review, the available data on nonexpressing C282Y homozygotes is collected, including information on pathogenesis, environmental interactions, and implications for population screening using genetic testing.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^111cmUD5]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic condition associated with iron overload, predominantly caused by the missense mutation p.C282Y in the homeostatic iron regulator (HFE) gene among individuals of European ancestry. This mutation is homozygous in over 95% of cases, with additional diagnoses in p.H63D homozygotes. The p.C282Y mutation results in reduced plasma hepcidin levels, elevated ferritin and transferrin (TF) saturation levels, and a gradual accumulation of systemic iron in adults. Clinical manifestations of HH include fatigue, arthropathy, diabetes, liver disease, and hormone dysregulation. The disease can progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiomyopathy.

However, penetrance to clinical symptoms or disease remains limited. In the UK Biobank (UKB) study, the largest community study thus far of HFE p.C282Y homozygotes (n = 2890), it was estimated that only 25.3% of p.C282Y homozygous male participants and 12.5% of homozygous female participants were diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the age of 65 years. These results were similar to a 2015 study across seven American medical systems (eMERGE: n = 106 homozygotes), which reported that 24.4% of male and 14.0% of female p.C282Y homozygotes were diagnosed with hemochromatosis (mean age 66.4 ± 15.8 years). Kaplan-Meier survival curves from the eMERGE study suggested that 50% of homozygote men and 25% of homozygote women were eventually diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the age of 90 years.

### Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11195ASM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are difficult because of the variable penetrance of HFE gene mutations and the absence of definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities. The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing.

This guideline provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience is internists and other primary care physicians. The target patient population includes all persons who have a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including the relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111dSU2D]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

- **General population screening**: When considering the evidence required to determine whether general population screening should be performed for the C282Y mutation, a key factor is the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity. Approximately 30% of C282Y homozygotes do not have phenotypic expression of excess iron stores in cross-sectional studies. Because of this, from a public policy perspective, general population screening for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is not indicated.

In a large Norwegian study, 65,238 subjects were screened using transferrin saturation (TS). When TS was elevated on two determinations, cases were confirmed by genetic testing and/or liver biopsy. In 147 subjects, liver biopsies were performed, and only four men and none of the women had cirrhosis, indicating a 2.7% prevalence of cirrhosis. An Australian population study of 3,011 individuals revealed 16 C282Y homozygotes. Of these 16, liver biopsy was performed in 11 cases with serum ferritin > 300 μg/L. Among them, three were identified with advanced fibrosis and one with cirrhosis, who had associated alcoholic liver disease (ALD), showing a 6.3% prevalence of cirrhosis. Other prospective population studies have reached similar conclusions that the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity is quite low. This discrepancy between the morbidity seen in referred patients and the lack of morbidity in screened patients is not unique to HH.

Economic models that have included genetic testing have suggested that population screening for HH would be effective if only 20% of patients developed life-threatening complications. The natural history of untreated HH has been illustrated in the Copenhagen Heart study.

### Iron absorption by heterozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation associated with hemochromatosis [^115PUSpf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Research conducted before genotyping became possible suggested that subjects heterozygous for the genetic mutation associated with hemochromatosis absorbed nonheme iron more efficiently than control subjects when tested with a fortified meal. However, heme-iron absorption in these subjects has not been reported.

- **Objective**: We compared the absorption of heme and nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals between HFE C282Y-heterozygous and wild-type control subjects.

- **Design**: After prospective genotyping of 256 healthy volunteers, 11 C282Y-heterozygous and 12 wild-type control subjects were recruited, and their iron absorption was compared by using a hamburger test meal with or without added iron and ascorbic acid. After retrospective genotyping of 103 participants in previous iron-absorption studies, 5 C282Y-heterozygous subjects were compared with 72 wild-type control subjects.

- **Results**: HFE C282Y-heterozygous subjects did not differ significantly from wild-type control subjects in their absorption of either heme or nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals. No differences were detected in blood indexes of iron status (including serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and non-transferrin-bound iron) or in blood lipids or transaminases. However, heterozygotes had significantly greater, although normal, fasting glucose concentrations than wild-type control subjects. Compound heterozygotes, those who had both HFE C282Y and H63D mutations, absorbed more nonheme (but not heme) iron from meals with high (but not low) iron bioavailability.

### Iron overload: What is the role of public health [^113c4YGZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis classical (HHC), is an iron overload disorder associated, in most cases, with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Although suggested algorithms for diagnosing iron overload are available, questions remain about options for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and the duration of treatment. This article provides a summary of an expert workgroup meeting convened on September 24–25, 2009, entitled "Iron Overload: What is the Role of Public Health?"

The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the role of public health in this field.

- **Research priorities of the field**: Discussions focused on clinical, genetic, and public health issues.
- **Concerns about the validity of screening recommendations**: The meeting addressed the concerns regarding screening guidelines for the condition.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits of mutations: 20 years of research [^112s5z2h]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence and penetrance of HFE-HH are important to understand. The HFE mutation C282Y occurs in approximately 6% of Caucasians and thus represents the most common genetic variant among this population. The frequency of the C282Y allele decreases from Northern to Southern Europe, suggesting that it initially occurred as a "master" mutation in the Neolithic Age in the Celtic population and then spread throughout the rest of Europe later on. Immigration from Europe to the US and Australia led to the widespread distribution of HH among Caucasian adults living in those geographic areas.

Despite the high prevalence of the C282Y allele, numerous population screening studies provided evidence that the mutation clinically manifests in hemochromatosis in only a subgroup of carriers. Differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and the definition of disease penetrance make it difficult to confirm an exact number for the overall penetrance of the C282Y mutation. A meta-analysis taking into account the data from 16 independent studies reported a penetrance of C282Y homozygosity of 14%. It was shown that homozygous men face a much higher risk of developing an iron overload phenotype than women, which may be explained by the physiological blood loss in women or by the frequency disparity of certain HLA haplotypes that occur between male and female patients. The penetrance of the heterozygous C282Y mutation is even lower, with only approximately 3% of mutation carriers showing disease symptoms. Despite the fact that HFE mutations are not always pathogenic per se, they rather represent polymorphism.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^116bKEAv]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically in relation to genetic testing, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend considering genotyping for p.H63D in special clinical situations. It is important to recognize that p.H63D, in combination with p.C282Y and usually other acquired risk factors, is associated with a higher risk of mild iron overload. Avoid obtaining genotyping for p.H63D to guide treatment.

### HFE genotypes in decompensated alcoholic liver disease: Phenotypic expression and comparison with heavy drinking and with normal controls [^1114p1ix]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Predisposition to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) may be partly genetic. Heterozygosity for the HFE mutations C282Y and/or H63D has been associated with more severe disease in several liver conditions. Studies in ALD have not used controls matched for alcohol consumption, and results have been conflicting.

HFE genotyping was performed in two Caucasian heavy-drinking cohorts with more than 60 units per week for males and more than 40 units per week for females over more than five years. The first cohort included 254 patients with decompensated ALD (Child's grade B or C), while the second cohort consisted of 130 controls with similar alcohol consumption but without liver disease. Results in males were also compared with those from another study of healthy male blood donors.

- **Results**:
	1. Genotype distributions for the C282Y and H63D mutations were similar in ALD patients, heavy-drinking controls, and healthy blood donors.
	2. ALD patients with and without HFE mutations had similar disease severity, age at presentation, and alcohol consumption.
	3. Increased serum ferritin and % transferrin saturation were seen in 63% and 29% of ALD patients, regardless of HFE genotype. The increased % transferrin saturation was due to reduced unsaturated iron binding capacity rather than increased serum iron.
	4. Stainable liver iron was present in 52% of patients; the grade was greater in patients with two HFE mutations than in those with one or none.
	5. Only the two C282Y homozygote patients had substantial iron overload.

Although serum iron abnormalities are common, C282Y and H63D mutation frequencies were not increased in heavy drinkers with decompensated liver disease.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: Detection of C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene by means of Guthrie cards in population of Czech Republic [^113eH7Fx]. Genetic Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in the population of the Czech Republic. A total of 257 randomly selected newborn screening cards (Guthrie cards) were analyzed for the C282Y and H63D mutations within the HFE gene. Complete results were obtained from 254 cards for the C282Y mutation and 257 cards for the H63D mutation. No sample was identified as homozygous for C282Y, and two (0.78%) were homozygous for H63D. Twenty (7.87%) samples were C282Y-heterozygous, and 69 (26.84%) were H63D-heterozygous. Of these, two (0.79%) carried one copy of each mutation, i.e. were compound heterozygous. Allele frequencies for C282Y and H63D were 0.039 and 0.142, respectively. The observed genotype frequencies for both C282Y and H63D mutations in the Czech Republic are in the range of values reported for other Central and Western European populations.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^114H5BHW]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The iron overload condition hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) can cause liver cirrhosis, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. Males homozygous for the p.C282Y missense mutation in the Homeostatin Iron Regulator (HFE) gene have the greatest risk; yet, only a minority develop these conditions. We aimed to determine whether common genetic variants influencing iron levels or liver disease risk in the general population also modify clinical penetrance in HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D carriers.

- **Methods**: We studied 1,294 male and 1,596 female UK Biobank HFE p.C282Y homozygous participants of European ancestry with medical records up to 14 years after baseline assessment. Polygenic scores quantified genetic effects of blood iron biomarkers and relevant diseases (identified in the general population). Analyses were also performed in other HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D genotype groups.

- **Results**: In male p.C282Y homozygotes, a higher iron polygenic score increased the risk of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis diagnoses (odds ratio for the top 20% of iron polygenic score vs. the bottom 20% = 4.90; 95% confidence intervals, 1.63–14.73; p = 0.005), liver cancer, and osteoarthritis but not diabetes. A liver cirrhosis polygenic score was associated with liver cancer diagnoses. In female p.C282Y homozygotes, the osteoarthritis polygenic score was associated with increased osteoarthritis diagnoses, and the type-2 diabetes polygenic score was associated with diabetes. However, the iron polygenic score was not robustly associated with diagnoses in p.C282Y female homozygotes or in other p.C282Y/p.H63D genotypes.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^112SQPtX]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly with respect to genetic testing, EASL 2010 guidelines recommend considering genetic testing of other hemochromatosis genes (TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV). This is suggested for patients with increased iron stores after exclusion of C282Y homozygosity, provided that iron excess has been confirmed through direct assessment methods such as MRI or liver biopsy, and other hepatic and hematological disorders have been ruled out.

### Frequency and biochemical expression of C282Y/H63D hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in the healthy adult population in Italy [^111ZgQci]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The actual prevalence of the main hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations in the Italian adult population and their phenotypic expression have not yet been established. This information is key to advocate a mass-screening program.

- **Methods**: Two thousand one hundred adults were tested for the C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations by an automated genotyping assay, as well as transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin levels.

- **Results**: No homozygotes for the C282Y mutation were found. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation was 3.1%, while heterozygosity and homozygosity for the H63D mutation were 21.5% and 2.5%, respectively. TS was significantly higher in C282Y heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes as compared to wild-type individuals (P < 0.01). Interestingly, among the HFE wild-type subjects, 5.9% had a TS value above the 45% threshold.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that (i) the predicted prevalence for C282Y homozygosity in Italy is 1:3900; (ii) the C282Y/H63D wild-type population has an increased baseline of iron parameters, possibly due to genetic factors not linked to the C282Y/H63D mutations; and (iii) since in the latter population the actual tissue iron burden cannot be assessed, phenotypic (TS) screening in Italy is not recommended until the true prevalence of all mutations in the HFE gene and in other hemochromatosis genes is established.
