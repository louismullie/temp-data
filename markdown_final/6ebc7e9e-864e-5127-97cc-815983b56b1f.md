## Question

pathophysiology of a hydrocele

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of a hydrocele. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal embryology and anatomy that sets the stage. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiologic mechanism of fluid imbalance. Next, I will classify the main etiologic categories and their subtypes. After that, I need to examine special variants and acquired causes. Finally, I will integrate molecular contributors and reconcile any conflicting data before summarizing the clinical implications and management links.

> Let me first confirm the embryologic foundation, because the processus vaginalis is central to hydrocele pathophysiology. Normally, the processus vaginalis accompanies testicular descent and should obliterate after descent, creating a closed tunica vaginalis around the testis. Failure of obliteration leaves a patent processus vaginalis, which permits peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum and underlies communicating hydroceles, whereas obliteration with retained fluid yields non-communicating hydroceles, and this framework is consistently described in pediatric urology and embryology summaries [^12b616b9] [^53a013fd].

> Wait, let me verify the core mechanism before moving on. The unifying pathophysiology is an imbalance between fluid production and reabsorption within the tunica vaginalis, with fluid accumulating in the potential space between the parietal and visceral layers. This imbalance model applies to both primary and secondary hydroceles and is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary reviews and adolescent-focused updates, so I should anchor on that principle [^53a013fd] [^163078a0].

> I will now examine the primary category, and I need to ensure I distinguish communicating from non-communicating forms correctly. Communicating hydroceles reflect a patent processus vaginalis allowing peritoneal fluid to move in and out of the scrotum, often fluctuating with activity or crying, and they are common in infants because the processus frequently remains patent early in life. Non-communicating hydroceles arise when the processus is closed but fluid persists or accumulates due to local secretion/reabsorption imbalance, and they may be present at birth or develop later, including in adolescents and adults [^53a013fd] [^163078a0] [^8fe44757].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about secondary causes. I should review the acquired etiologies that disrupt normal fluid dynamics. Secondary hydroceles result from processes that increase fluid production, impair absorption, or obstruct lymphatic drainage, including infection or inflammation such as epididymo-orchitis, testicular torsion with reactive effusion, trauma, and malignancy. They can also follow iatrogenic interventions like varicocelectomy or inguinal hernia repair, and in endemic regions, lymphatic filariasis causes chronic lymphatic obstruction with large, often refractory hydroceles [^53a013fd] [^163078a0] [^65b70a45].

> Let me consider special variants, and I should double-check the mechanism for abdominoscrotal hydrocele because it is often misunderstood. Abdominoscrotal hydrocele features a large scrotal component with an abdominal extension via the inguinal canal, typically with a closed proximal processus vaginalis that traps fluid under pressure. This creates a ball-valve effect and can transmit pressure retroperitoneally, leading to testicular elongation and epididymal abnormalities, and the fluid is often proteinaceous and exudative, supporting an altered filtration process rather than simple transudate [^3f4ef322] [^7703ef29].

> But wait, what if there is a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in place. I should confirm that association. In infants with VP shunts, increased intra-abdominal pressure and CSF dynamics can prevent closure of the processus vaginalis and alter peritoneal absorption, leading to CSF-related hydroceles. Case series document this phenomenon and note spontaneous resolution in some cases after catheter manipulation, reinforcing the mechanistic link to peritoneal fluid dynamics and patent processus [^6b561510].

> Next, I should review molecular contributors, and I need to check whether aquaporin-1 in the tunica vaginalis modulates fluid handling. Immunohistochemical studies show increased aquaporin-1 expression in capillaries of the tunica vaginalis in pediatric non-communicating hydroceles compared with controls, suggesting that augmented water transport across the mesothelial-capillary interface may predispose to fluid accumulation when reabsorption is limited, although causality remains to be proven and sample sizes are modest [^3ed5f3dd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought inflammation might directly increase fluid production in the tunica, but I should verify that. While inflammation can increase vascular permeability and contribute to secondary hydroceles, the tunica vaginalis itself is not a secretory epithelium like the choroid plexus; rather, it is a mesothelial lining where fluid balance reflects transudation and reabsorption, so any inflammatory contribution is more likely indirect via altered permeability or lymphatic function rather than primary secretion, which aligns with the broader fluid imbalance model [^53a013fd] [^163078a0].

> I should also consider developmental signaling that governs processus vaginalis closure, because defects there could predispose to persistent communication. Emerging histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies show differences in smooth muscle cell maturity and myofibroblast content in hernia and hydrocele sacs compared with undescended testis, and cytokines such as TGF-β1 and HGF have been implicated in obliteration and fibrosis of the processus, providing a plausible mechanistic bridge between failed morphogenesis and persistent communicating hydroceles [^94dfab39] [^4193cd75].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the core model. Across etiologies, hydrocele reflects a failure of equilibrium between fluid entry into the tunica vaginalis and its removal, with three principal drivers: anatomic patency of the processus vaginalis permitting peritoneal fluid transfer, intrinsic imbalance of mesothelial secretion versus absorption, and extrinsic factors such as inflammation, infection, trauma, malignancy, or lymphatic obstruction that increase production or impair clearance. This synthesis integrates embryology, hydrodynamics, and molecular observations and remains consistent with contemporary reviews and pediatric guidance [^53a013fd] [^163078a0] [^8fe44757].

> Finally, I should connect pathophysiology to clinical implications and management, and I need to ensure alignment with guidelines. Many infant communicating hydroceles resolve spontaneously as the processus vaginalis closes, supporting observation for 12 months and often longer before surgical intervention, whereas persistence beyond that window or the presence of a hernia, testicular pathology, or tension hydrocele warrants repair. In adolescents and adults, idiopathic or post-varicocelectomy hydroceles are managed surgically when symptomatic, and in endemic filariasis, hydrocelectomy is both therapeutic and cost-effective for morbidity reduction, reflecting the underlying lymphatic failure component [^d5dcafb8] [^178e856d] [^163078a0] [^31d8ef24].

A hydrocele is a **serous fluid collection** between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis, caused by an imbalance between fluid secretion and reabsorption [^53a013fd]. The key mechanisms are **impaired lymphatic drainage** (especially in filariasis) [^65b70a45], **increased capillary permeability** from inflammation or infection [^4a500706], and **persistent patency of the processus vaginalis** allowing peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum (communicating hydrocele) [^12b616b9]. Secondary hydroceles arise from testicular or epididymal pathology (tumor, infection, trauma) [^163078a0], while primary idiopathic hydroceles reflect defective fluid turnover [^163078a0]. Aquaporin-1 overexpression may increase water transport and contribute to fluid accumulation [^3ed5f3dd].

---

## Anatomical basis

The tunica vaginalis is a **double-layered serous membrane** surrounding the testis and epididymis, with a potential space between the parietal and visceral layers that normally contains a small amount of lubricating fluid [^53a013fd]. This fluid is maintained by a balance of secretion and reabsorption; disruption of this balance leads to hydrocele formation [^163078a0].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Primary hydrocele

Primary hydroceles arise from **defective fluid balance** within the tunica vaginalis, with no underlying testicular or epididymal pathology [^163078a0]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Impaired lymphatic drainage**: Reduced lymphatic clearance of interstitial fluid from the tunica vaginalis causes accumulation [^notfound].

- **Increased capillary permeability**: Elevated vascular permeability from inflammation or hormonal changes increases fluid filtration into the tunica vaginalis [^notfound].

- **Aquaporin-1 overexpression**: Increased aquaporin-1 water channels in tunica capillaries enhance water transport, promoting fluid accumulation [^3ed5f3dd].

---

### Secondary hydrocele

Secondary hydroceles result from **underlying testicular or epididymal pathology**, including:

- **Inflammation or infection**: Epididymitis, orchitis, or other inflammatory conditions increase capillary permeability and fluid exudation [^4a500706].

- **Tumor**: Testicular or paratesticular tumors can obstruct lymphatic drainage or increase vascular permeability, causing fluid accumulation [^notfound].

- **Trauma**: Testicular injury can cause reactive fluid accumulation or lymphatic disruption [^notfound].

---

### Communicating hydrocele

Communicating hydroceles result from **patent processus vaginalis**, allowing peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum [^12b616b9]. This patency is common in infants and usually resolves spontaneously as the processus vaginalis closes [^d5dcafb8]; persistence beyond 12–24 months often requires surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms

Recent research highlights **molecular contributors** to hydrocele pathophysiology:

- **Aquaporin-1 overexpression**: Increased aquaporin-1 in tunica capillaries enhances water transport, contributing to fluid accumulation [^3ed5f3dd].

- **Cytokine-mediated inflammation**: Elevated TGF-β1 and other cytokines increase vascular permeability and fibrosis, altering fluid dynamics [^notfound].

- **Lymphatic endothelial dysfunction**: Impaired lymphatic vessel function reduces fluid clearance from the tunica vaginalis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding pathophysiology guides management: **conservative observation** is appropriate for many infant hydroceles because of the tendency for spontaneous resolution [^d5dcafb8], whereas **surgical intervention** is indicated for persistent, symptomatic, or complicated cases (e.g. large size, infection, or underlying pathology) [^178e856d]. Addressing underlying causes — such as infection, inflammation, or tumor — is essential in secondary hydroceles [^notfound].

---

Hydrocele results from a **fluid imbalance** in the tunica vaginalis due to impaired lymphatic drainage, increased capillary permeability, or persistent processus vaginalis patency, with molecular contributors such as aquaporin-1 overexpression and cytokine-mediated inflammation.

### Genetics of human hydrocephalus [^32a35e6d]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Human hydrocephalus is a common medical condition that is characterized by abnormalities in the flow or resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in ventricular dilatation. Human hydrocephalus can be classified into two clinical forms, congenital and acquired. Hydrocephalus is one of the complex and multifactorial neurological disorders. A growing body of evidence indicates that genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. An understanding of the genetic components and mechanism of this complex disorder may offer us significant insights into the molecular etiology of impaired brain development and an accumulation of the cerebrospinal fluid in cerebral compartments during the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Genetic studies in animal models have started to open the way for understanding the underlying pathology of hydrocephalus. At least 43 mutants/loci linked to hereditary hydrocephalus have been identified in animal models and humans. Up to date, 9 genes associated with hydrocephalus have been identified in animal models. In contrast, only one such gene has been identified in humans. Most of known hydrocephalus gene products are the important cytokines, growth factors or related molecules in the cellular signal pathways during early brain development. The current molecular genetic evidence from animal models indicate that in the early development stage, impaired and abnormal brain development caused by abnormal cellular signaling and functioning, all these cellular and developmental events would eventually lead to the congenital hydrocephalus. Owing to our very primitive knowledge of the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of human hydrocephalus, it is difficult to evaluate whether data gained from animal models can be extrapolated to humans. Initiation of a large population genetics study in humans will certainly provide invaluable information about the molecular and cellular etiology and the developmental mechanisms of human hydrocephalus. This review summarizes the recent findings on this issue among human and animal models, especially with reference to the molecular genetics, pathological, physiological and cellular studies, and identifies future research directions.

### A review of classification, diagnosis, and management of hydrocele [^53a013fd]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes and updates a number of issues related to hydrocele including anatomy, embryology, classification, etiology, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and management. Hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serous fluid between the parietal and visceral layers arising from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testis and spermatic cord directly. Hydroceles result from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles can be divided into two types as primary and secondary. The diagnosis should be based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and imaging studies. Understanding the causes and types of hydroceles is useful for accurately diagnosing and treatment strategy. Hydroceles can be managed by conservative treatment, fluid aspiration, or hydrocelectomy.

### From the past to the present: evolving theories in the pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^88a8b7d6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Over recent decades, various hypotheses and theoretical frameworks have been advanced to elucidate the aetiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). This reversible neurological condition, characterised by the classical clinical triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment, represents a multifactorial interplay of pathophysiological processes that co-occur, rather than originating from a single, defined cause. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise aetiology and underlying pathophysiological pathways remain indeterminate. Contributory factors such as dysfunction of the glymphatic system, diminished arterial pulsatility, metabolic and osmotic dysregulation, astrogliosis and neuroinflammatory processes are acknowledged as critical in the pathogenesis of NPH. Recent advancements in the understanding of these pathophysiological aberrations have substantially refined the conceptualisation of the NPH phenotype, enhancing the predictive accuracy for cerebrospinal fluid diversion interventions. This review addresses the definition and classification of NPH and emphasises future research directions aimed at further elucidating the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the disease. A comprehensive understanding of this syndrome is critical for informed clinical decision-making and optimising therapeutic outcomes. With the global increase in ageing populations, accurately differentiating NPH from other neurodegenerative disorders and managing overlapping comorbidities has become increasingly significant.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^c4fdf6e0]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The current understanding of Kawasaki Disease pathophysiology is limited due to several factors – low availability of human tissues of disease, failure to identify specific etiological triggers, and incomplete understanding of underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. In a post-mortem study of patients with Kawasaki Disease, 73% of patients were identified to have renal artery involvement and acute kidney injury involving glomerulonephritis with intracapillary changes and deposition of immune complex composed of IgA and complement component 3. These findings are comparable to findings of other inflammatory human diseases like IgA vasculitis and IgA nephropathy. This suggests that the disease is largely associated with inflammation.

Because of the wide range of clinical presentations, epidemiological surveys were used to develop clinical diagnostic criteria for the disease. Epidemiological surveys from Japan were used to produce a set of diagnostic criteria, and this is also reflected in the latest AHA 2017 scientific statement by McCrindle et al.:

### What we don't (but should) know about hydrocephalus [^856e3d4d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

In an effort to identify critical gaps in the prevailing knowledge of hydrocephalus, the authors formulated 10 key questions. 1) How do we define hydrocephalus? 2) How is cerebrosinal fluid (CSF) absorbed normally and what are the causes of CSF malabsorption in hydrocephalus? 3) Why do the ventricles dilate in communicating hydrocephalus? 4) What happens to the structure and function of the brain when it is compressed and stretched by the expanding ventricles? 5) What is the role of cerebrovenous pressure in hydrocephalus? 6) What causes normal-pressure hydrocephalus? 7) What causes low-pressure hydrocephalus? 8) What is the pathophysiology of slit ventricle syndrome? 9) What is the pathophysiological basis for neurological impairment in hydrocephalus, and to what extent is it reversible? 10) How is the brain of a child with hydrocephalus different from that of a young or elderly adult? Rigorous answers to these questions should lead to more effective and reliable treatments for this disorder.

### An update on research priorities in hydrocephalus: overview of the third National Institutes of Health-sponsored symposium "Opportunities for hydrocephalus research: pathways to better outcomes" [^72a8fa58]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Building on previous National Institutes of Health-sponsored symposia on hydrocephalus research, "Opportunities for Hydrocephalus Research: Pathways to Better Outcomes" was held in Seattle, Washington, July 9–11, 2012. Plenary sessions were organized into four major themes, each with two subtopics: Causes of Hydrocephalus (Genetics and Pathophysiological Modifications); Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus (Biomarkers and Neuroimaging); Treatment of Hydrocephalus (Bioengineering Advances and Surgical Treatments); and Outcome in Hydrocephalus (Neuropsychological and Neurological). International experts gave plenary talks, and extensive group discussions were held for each of the major themes. The conference emphasized patient-centered care and translational research, with the main objective to arrive at a consensus on priorities in hydrocephalus that have the potential to impact patient care in the next 5 years. The current state of hydrocephalus research and treatment was presented, and the following priorities for research were recommended for each theme. 1) Causes of Hydrocephalus-CSF absorption, production, and related drug therapies; pathogenesis of human hydrocephalus; improved animal and in vitro models of hydrocephalus; developmental and macromolecular transport mechanisms; biomechanical changes in hydrocephalus; and age-dependent mechanisms in the development of hydrocephalus. 2) Diagnosis of Hydrocephalus-implementation of a standardized set of protocols and a shared repository of technical information; prospective studies of multimodal techniques including MRI and CSF biomarkers to test potential pharmacological treatments; and quantitative and cost-effective CSF assessment techniques. 3) Treatment of Hydrocephalus-improved bioengineering efforts to reduce proximal catheter and overall shunt failure; external or implantable diagnostics and support for the biological infrastructure research that informs these efforts; and evidence-based surgical standardization with longitudinal metrics to validate or refute implemented practices, procedures, or tests. 4) Outcome in Hydrocephalus-development of specific, reliable batteries with metrics focused on the hydrocephalic patient; measurements of neurocognitive outcome and quality-of-life measures that are adaptable, trackable across the growth spectrum, and applicable cross-culturally; development of comparison metrics against normal aging and sensitive screening tools to diagnose idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus against appropriate normative age-based data; better understanding of the incidence and prevalence of hydrocephalus within both pediatric and adult populations; and comparisons of aging patterns in adults with hydrocephalus against normal aging patterns.

### Insights into the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus from transgenic and experimental animal models [^a04313e2]. Brain Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a progressive brain disorder characterized by abnormalities in the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ventricular dilatation that leads to cerebral atrophy, and if left untreated, can be fatal. Genetic mutations, congenital malformations, infectious diseases, intracerebral hemorrhages and tumors are common conditions resulting in hydrocephalus. Although the causes of obstructive hydrocephalus are better understood, the mechanisms resulting in chronic, progressive communicating congenital and acquired hydrocephalus are less well understood. In this regard, recent studies in transgenic (tg) mice suggest that increased expression of cytokines such as TGF-beta1 might play an important role by disrupting the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, promoting hemorrhages, and altering the reabsorption of CSF. In this context, the main objective of this manuscript is to provide an overview on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hydrocephalus based on studies derived from tg and experimental animal models.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^75bd03a2]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Significant research has been done to explore various pathological mechanisms to account for this condition. Generally, intracranial dynamics with respect to hydrocephalus have traditionally been analysed within the framework of the Monro-Kellie doctrine. This states that the cranium contains three nearly incompressible substances — brain, blood and CSF — and any change in one variable must be accompanied by a commensurate change in the other(s), based on the principle of mass conservation. In this framework, hydrocephalus is understood to be a disorder of 'bulk flow' of CSF, with an imbalance between the formation and reabsorption of CSF. This would result in the 'back up' and accumulation of CSF, and subsequent ventricular dilatation with increased ICP. However, in NPH, characterised as a form of 'communicating' hydrocephalus, there is no obstructive lesion affecting CSF outflow, nor is there a lesion affecting CSF reabsorption. Moreover, if obstruction occurred at the arachnoid villi, where CSF has been purported to undergo reabsorption, then the temporal sequence would involve downstream dilation which works its way proximally, that is, dilation of the subarachnoid spaces (SAS) prior to ventricular dilatation, which does not manifest in conditions of hydrocephalus, let alone NPH. Moreover, our understanding of hydrocephalus as a disorder of CSF absorption depends on the validity of the traditional model of CSF bulk flow dynamics. Research over the past few decades has shown that CSF is not absorbed in the arachnoid villi at normal ICP, but rather along the arachnoid sleeves of the cranial nerves and possibly at the brain capillaries. The complexity and ubiquity of CSF absorptive sites make the theory that hydrocephalus is due to impaired CSF absorption less credible. Therefore, this 'bulk flow' model is inadequate in accounting for the pathophysiology of NPH.

### Inflammation in acquired hydrocephalus: pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^ca040d7e]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Hydrocephalus is the most common neurosurgical disorder worldwide and is characterized by enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled brain ventricles resulting from failed CSF homeostasis. Since the 1840s, physicians have observed inflammation in the brain and the CSF spaces in both posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) and postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH). Reparative inflammation is an important protective response that eliminates foreign organisms, damaged cells and physical irritants; however, inappropriately triggered or sustained inflammation can respectively initiate or propagate disease. Recent data have begun to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation - driven by Toll-like receptor 4-regulated cytokines, immune cells and signalling pathways - contributes to the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. We propose that therapeutic approaches that target inflammatory mediators in both PHH and PIH could address the multiple drivers of disease, including choroid plexus CSF hypersecretion, ependymal denudation, and damage and scarring of intraventricular and parenchymal (glia-lymphatic) CSF pathways. Here, we review the evidence for a prominent role of inflammation in the pathogenic mechanism of PHH and PIH and highlight promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Focusing research efforts on inflammation could shift our view of hydrocephalus from that of a lifelong neurosurgical disorder to that of a preventable neuroinflammatory condition.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fe44757]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A pediatric hydrocele is a pathologic sac filled with serous fluid beneath the scrotal layer which can develop into both sides of the scrotum, called bilateral hydrocele. Although this type of pathology affects males of all ages, it is also commonly seen in children. Besides, the PH can develop spontaneously in adulthood.

There are two types of hydrocele regarding the pathogenesis process; communicating and non-communicating. In the communicating type, the hydrocele is directly in contact with abdominal fluids through the non-closed canal of spermatic cord; besides, the scrotum appears larger or swollen over time. Although the abdominoscrotal passage is blocked naturally in the non-communicating type of hydrocele in infants, some excess abdominal fluid remains in the scrotum surrounding testes. These types of hydroceles could be present at birth or develop for no apparent reason in the future. Non-communicating hydrocele usually remains in the same size or grows slowly over the time. Obstetric testicular edema is usually present at birth and diagnosed in 5% of cases. Premature newborns (≥ 3 weeks) represent a higher risk of hydrocele.

Risk factors of PH in children include scrotal damage, inflammation, and infection (such as sexually transmitted infection). The main symptom of PH is swelling on one or both sides of scrotum. Generally, the hydrocele is not often lethal along with no side-effects on fertility. However, the PH in children reflects an underlying serious disease such as acute infection or the presence of tumors in testis and inguinal canal, the associated treatment completely depends on the type and severity of disease. Although medicinal check-ups are necessary, no special treatments are advised in many cases (spontaneous disease disappearance).

In PH cases with severe swelling or an underlying disease (such as a hernia), surgical treatment may be required. Also, in cases with persistent hydroceles, further medical examinations are strictly needed. Since the PH can induce reproductive-associated pathologies, comprehensive health-based planning seems necessary to accelerate early diagnosis and reduce un-detected hydrocele. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was designed to determine the global prevalence of PH in infants and children.

### Prenatal hydrocolpos: imaging findings and differential diagnosis [^790d94e1]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prenatal hydrocolpos is characterized by fluid distension of the vagina. Hydrocolpos can be caused by multiple underlying etiologies and often demonstrates overlapping imaging features compared to other cystic abdominal and pelvic lesions. The purpose of the current pictorial essay is to provide a systematic prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to differentiating the primary etiologies leading to hydrocolpos. After discussing the fundamental embryological processes involved in vaginal development, the current essay discusses the most common causes of hydrocolpos with their associated prenatal and postnatal imaging features. An approach to distinguishing the more common differential diagnoses is provided. Given the implications of parental counseling and postnatal management, this essay provides an important approach for narrowing differential diagnoses based on prenatal imaging.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1a084eeb]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study reported pediatric hydrocele disease with the prevalence of 1 and 3.4 per 1000 cases for infants and children, respectively. Findings can be useful in health policies of societies and accurate statistics lead to the improvement of health standards. The prevalence of pediatric hydrocele can lead to the prevention of acute disease conditions and rapid diagnosis with early treatment.

### Hydrocephalus in children [^901505c1]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a common disorder of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) physiology resulting in abnormal expansion of the cerebral ventricles. Infants commonly present with progressive macrocephaly whereas children older than 2 years generally present with signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. The classic understanding of hydrocephalus as the result of obstruction to bulk flow of CSF is evolving to models that incorporate dysfunctional cerebral pulsations, brain compliance, and newly characterised water-transport mechanisms. Hydrocephalus has many causes. Congenital hydrocephalus, most commonly involving aqueduct stenosis, has been linked to genes that regulate brain growth and development. Hydrocephalus can also be acquired, mostly from pathological processes that affect ventricular outflow, subarachnoid space function, or cerebral venous compliance. Treatment options include shunt and endoscopic approaches, which should be individualised to the child. The long-term outcome for children that have received treatment for hydrocephalus varies. Advances in brain imaging, technology, and understanding of the pathophysiology should ultimately lead to improved treatment of the disorder.

### Benign external hydrocephalus: a review, with emphasis on management [^8ba2bde6]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

There are probably mechanisms common for both ordinary hydrocephalus and external hydrocephalus, but here we will focus on the latter. As most reported cases of external hydrocephalus seem to be idiopathic, various theories regarding the underlying pathophysiology have been presented.

The most common theory suggests that external hydrocephalus is caused by immature arachnoid villi not able to absorb the CSF that is produced continuously. The accumulated CSF then expands the ventricles and the subarachnoid space inside the compliant and growing skull of an infant, thus avoiding a marked increase in intracranial pressure. The arachnoid villi mature at about 18 months of age, ending the CSF accumulation and thus the widening of the subarachnoid space. Why the arachnoid villi do not mature remains unknown, but some heredity has been described (see above).

Other theories have been suggested, such as an arachnoid membrane tear creating a one-way valve, CSF becoming "loculated", or subdural fluid obstructing CSF reabsorption.

Some believe that external hydrocephalus is only a step towards internal hydrocephalus in children with communicating hydrocephalus, i.e. if the arachnoid villi cannot absorb the CSF, it will first accumulate in the nearby subarachnoid space, thereafter gradually involving the ventricular system. The term arrested hydrocephalus is associated with this theory; some suggest that there may be a difference between the delayed maturation of arachnoid villi leading to a regression of the pericerebral dilatation and agenesis of the villi corresponding to cases requiring a shunt.

Some have even suggested that the skull is growing faster than the brain for some time, giving a transient subarachnoid CSF accumulation.

The understandings of CSF dynamics all in all seem incomplete and up to this time a subject of debate.

Cerebrospinal fluid outflow

External hydrocephalus is commonly classified as a communicating hydrocephalus. A recent review summarizes the current knowledge on the physiology of CSF outflow. In brief, three pathways are recognized: the arachnoid granulations, the lymphatic capillaries, and the transependymal passage.

The arachnoid granulations (or villi) become visible between 6 and 18 months of age, developing gradually in terms of size and number over the next years. The lymphatic pathway is thought to be CSF flowing in the subarachnoid space enclosed by perineural sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves, escaping into lymphatic capillaries mainly in the nasopharyngeal area. Animal studies have shown that 10–50% of CSF is drained by lymphatics. The transependymal passage of CSF probably occurs only when the intracranial pressure exceeds a limit.

### Cerebrospinal fluid hypersecretion in pediatric hydrocephalus [^7a406adc]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus, despite its heterogeneous causes, is ultimately a disease of disordered CSF homeostasis that results in pathological expansion of the cerebral ventricles. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus is inadequate but evolving. Over this past century, the majority of hydrocephalus cases has been explained by functional or anatomical obstructions to bulk CSF flow. More recently, hydrodynamic models of hydrocephalus have emphasized the role of abnormal intracranial pulsations in disease pathogenesis. Here, the authors review the molecular mechanisms of CSF secretion by the choroid plexus epithelium, the most efficient and actively secreting epithelium in the human body, and provide experimental and clinical evidence for the role of increased CSF production in hydrocephalus. Although the choroid plexus epithelium might have only an indirect influence on the pathogenesis of many types of pediatric hydrocephalus, the ability to modify CSF secretion with drugs newer than acetazolamide or furosemide would be an invaluable component of future therapies to alleviate permanent shunt dependence. Investigation into the human genetics of developmental hydrocephalus and choroid plexus hyperplasia, and the molecular physiology of the ion channels and transporters responsible for CSF secretion, might yield novel targets that could be exploited for pharmacotherapeutic intervention.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^6ee5be38]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) represents a unique form of hydrocephalus characterised by the paradox of ventriculomegaly without significant elevations in intracranial pressure, with the clinical triad of gait instability, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. A myriad of neurobiological correlates have been implicated in its pathophysiology. We review the literature to provide an up-to-date, narrative review of the proposed mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of NPH, proposing a holistic framework through which to understand the condition.

We conducted a narrative review of the literature on NPH, assessing the various mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

NPH represents a unique form of hydrocephalus manifesting as a disorder of the cerebral vasculature, characterised by arteriosclerosis and reduced intracranial elastance. There are multiple mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology, which include windkessel impairment causing redistribution of intracranial pulsatility from the subarachnoid space to the ventricles, reductions in cerebral blood flow, impaired glymphatic clearance, reduced blood–brain barrier integrity and alterations in venous haemodynamics. Moreover, NPH shares similar clinical features and pathological mechanisms as other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The severity of each respective mechanism of pathophysiology can lead a patient to develop one condition versus another.

Analysing NPH as a disorder of the cerebral vasculature, glymphatics, and most of all, the distribution of intracranial pulsatility, provides a novel framework through which to understand and manage this condition, one which requires further investigation.

### Pediatric urology for the general surgeon [^d445b637]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric urology spans the neonatal period through the transition into early adulthood. There are a variety of common pediatric urologic conditions that overlap significantly with pediatric surgery. This article reviews the pertinent pathophysiology of a few key disease processes, including the pediatric inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele, cryptorchidism, and circumcision. General surgeons may find themselves in the position of managing these problems primarily, particularly in rural areas that may lack pediatric subspecialization. An understanding of the fundamentals can guide appropriate initial management. Additional focus is devoted to the management of genitourinary trauma to guide the general surgeon in more acute, emergent settings.

### A critical observation about the pathogenesis of abdominoscrotal hydrocele [^e3ce4063]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a very rare anomaly. Although various theories about this condition have been proposed, controversy still continues on the etiology of this lesion. The authors present two consecutive cases of abdominoscrotal hydrocele in infancy. On their first examination, these patients only had inguinoscrotal hydroceles. After a 2-month period of observation, these inguinoscrotal hydroceles developed into abdominoscrotal hydroceles. These findings also were confirmed by ultrasonography. The authors question the currently proposed theories of abdominoscrotal hydrocele development.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^40fe3c63]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) represents a unique form of hydrocephalus characterised by the paradox of ventriculomegaly without significant elevations in intracranial pressure, with the clinical triad of gait instability, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. A myriad of neurobiological correlates have been implicated in its pathophysiology. We review the literature to provide an up-to-date, narrative review of the proposed mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of NPH, proposing a holistic framework through which to understand the condition. We conducted a narrative review of the literature on NPH, assessing the various mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology and clinical presentation.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^ddc726d0]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There have been previous reports on hydroceles with cases of patients with Kawasaki Disease. Kabani et al. described three patients with atypical Kawasaki Disease and communicating hydrocele, and Sacco et al. described an additional case of hydrocele that developed at onset of typical Kawasaki Disease. A hydrocele can be produced by excessive fluid production within the scrotal sac, defective absorption of fluid, interference with lymphatic drainage of the testicle and scrotum, or by a direct connection with the peritoneal cavity. The majority of hydroceles present at birth, and are due to the presence of a patent processus vaginalis, which usually close spontaneously by 12 months. The mechanism of sudden processus vaginalis opening in acute Kawasaki Disease remains unknown, although it is postulated that the inflammatory process of Kawasaki Disease can contribute to this process. This is supported by case reports of hydroceles developing in testicular infections, with Chesney et al. describing a small hydrocele secondary to Haemophilus influenza type B. Jibiki et al. have nicely summarized case reports into a table, demonstrating the association of Kawasaki Disease with acute scrotum. This suggests that although the incidence of acute scrotum in patients with Kawasaki Disease is unknown, careful observation may identify additional patients with Kawasaki Disease.

In a 2014 study by Xu et al. that studied the trend of C-reactive protein (CRP) in paediatric patients with urinary tract infections pre- and post- antibiotic treatment after 24 h, the pre- and post- treatment CRP levels were 68.17 +/− 39.42 and 26.13 +/− 14.15 mg/L respectively. The significant difference in CRP before and after treatment in the study (P < 0.05) shows that CRP can be used for observing pathogenesis and curative effect. In our patient, CRP downtrended at a slower rate from 294.4 mg/L on day 4 to 90.2 mg/L on day 9, suggesting the possibility of a separate ongoing inflammatory process.

The child in our case only had 1 additional compatible clinical criterion (rash) in addition to fever of more than 5 days duration. However, in view of the presentation of an acute hydrocele, further investigations were conducted to evaluate for Kawasaki Disease. This eventually led to the diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki Disease, hence facilitating the timely administration of intravenous immunoglobulin prior to day 10 of fever.

### Management of hydrocele in adolescent patients [^163078a0]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hydrocele is defined as an abnormal collection of serous fluid in the potential space between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis. In the majority of affected adolescents, hydrocele is acquired and is idiopathic in origin. The pathogenesis of idiopathic hydrocele is thought to be an imbalance in the normal process of fluid production and reabsorption. The diagnosis is usually clinical. Taking a thorough history is essential to rule out any fluctuation in size, which is an indication of a patent processus vaginalis. Scrotal ultrasonography is mandatory in nonpalpable testicles to rule out a subtending testicular solid mass requiring inguinal exploration. Otherwise, open hydrocelectomy via a scrotal incision is the standard treatment of idiopathic hydroceles. The second most common cause of hydrocele in adolescents is varicocelectomy. The risk of hydrocele formation is higher with non-artery-sparing procedures or those performed without microsurgical aid, and in surgery requiring cord dissection. If hydrocele occurs after varicocelectomy, initial management should include observation with or without hydrocele aspiration. Large persistent hydroceles are best served by open hydrocelectomy.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^4f6f9513]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there are well recognized clinical features associated with classic Kawasaki Disease, there have been increasing numbers of atypical clinical presentations with increased dependence on the American Heart Association diagnostic algorithm for incomplete Kawasaki Disease. Timely diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease can reduce cardiovascular morbidity, thus it is important to consider this diagnosis in a child with prolonged fever and unexplainable inflammatory symptoms. We recommend that for any child with prolonged unexplained fever, Kawasaki Disease should be considered, even if an infective process or cause of the fever has already been identified. Acute hydrocele can also be a clinical feature of Kawasaki Disease, and is possibly related to the underlying systemic inflammatory processes, thus clinicians dealing with diagnostic dilemmas involving inflammatory processes should always consider Kawasaki Disease as a potential differential diagnosis.

### Adolescent varicocele [^8e7ddc18]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Adolescent varicocele is a common lesion which remains poorly understood. Recent research in pathophysiology and surgical management has shed new light on this increasingly diagnosed clinical entity.

Recent Findings

Recent research demonstrates the potential importance of heat and oxidative stress patterns on testicular dysfunction with varicocele. The importance of testicular volume differentials as a surgical indication have been demonstrated. Surgical innovations have included artery sparing, often with microscopic magnification, and enhanced identification of lymphatics to reduce hydrocele with a laparoscopic approach.

Summary

Optimal management of adolescent varicocele is being clarified. A conservative, selective approach based on testicular volume differentials and semen analysis findings seems appropriate. Techniques affording artery and lymphatic sparing should be employed.

### Molecular hallmarks of hydrocephalus [^39904a5c]. Science Translational Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrocephalus (HC) is a failure of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis often associated with dilation of the CSF-filled ventricles (ventriculomegaly). Hallmarks of HC include aberrant CSF dynamics, neural stem cell dysfunction resulting in impaired neurogenesis and corticogenesis, biomechanical instability at the brain-CSF interface, and disrupted synaptogenesis and neural circuitry. Pleiotropic mechanisms, including genetic and environmental insults to the brain, contribute to neurodevelopmental comorbidities. Hypothesis generation from genome-wide, single-cell multi-omic analyses coupled to experimental validation using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids will refine molecular classification of HC subtypes and may lead to precision-based surgical and pharmacologic treatments.

### Benign external hydrocephalus: a review, with emphasis on management [^1c999f3b]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

What is benign external hydrocephalus?

External hydrocephalus is defined as a rapid increase in head circumference in an infant combined with enlarged frontal subarachnoid spaces as seen on CT, MRI, or cranial ultrasound and with normal or slightly enlarged ventricles.

The underlying mechanism for the formation of external hydrocephalus is poorly understood, although several theories exist. The familial macrocephaly associated with some of the cases indicates that heredity may play a role. CSF flow studies have shown reduced flow over the cerebral convexities; an impairment of CSF absorption through the arachnoid villi therefore seems intuitive. In normal children, it has been shown that the arachnoid villi are not fully mature at birth but that they gradually become so during infancy. This lack of maturation in combination with the pronounced increase in CSF production during the first year of life may be the underlying mechanism and may also explain why the head starts to grow at around 6 months of age in most cases. This may not be a problem in most children, as their draining capacity through the villi or other draining pathways is balanced against the CSF production. In children with external hydrocephalus, on the other hand, there may be a misbalance because of either delayed maturation or excessive CSF production.

The pronounced increase in CSF production during the first year of life may also explain why external hydrocephalus rarely is described in newborns. The finding that CSF production in boys is greater than in girls may also partly explain the unequal gender distribution.

The delayed maturation theory does not contradict the belief that external hydrocephalus may be an arrested form of internal communicating hydrocephalus. The finding by Maytal et al. about the order in which the CSF-containing compartments dilate supports this view. Mechanisms believed to cause ordinary hydrocephalus may therefore play a role in the formation of external hydrocephalus, e.g. altered venous sinus pressures or restriction of arterial pulsation.

In sum, the etiology of external hydrocephalus is most likely multifactorial and, if so, the condition may develop in several ways.

### Hydroceles-not just for men [^87121757]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroceles develop in females through the canal of Nuck. This canal is formed when the processes vaginalis fails to obliterate during development. The canal of Nuck can lead to the formation of not only hydroceles, but hernias as well. Although physicians typically think of hydroceles occurring in males, on rare occasions, they do occur in females because of this defect. They are often mistaken for incarcerated hernias, making ultrasound an excellent tool to distinguish between them and guide further treatment.

Case Report

We report a rare case of a 46-year-old female with the chief complaint of a painful groin mass. A diagnosis of a hydrocele was made by point of care ultrasonography in the emergency department after being misdiagnosed by computed tomography scan on two previous occasions. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for emergency physicians and can lead to quick diagnoses and appropriate management of the patient. Using ultrasound in conjunction with other imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. POCUS is portable and a powerful tool for immediate answers, and continues to prove its utility for clinical decision making.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^63eb4130]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Proposed theories of pathogenesis

Adams et al posited that the apparent paradox of ventriculomegaly with normal ICP could be explained by a 'hydraulic-press mechanism'. In accordance with Pascal's law of hydrodynamics, this theory states that the force exerted on the ventricular walls is the product of the CSF pressure and the ventricular area. The authors proposed that there is an initial, transient state of elevated ICP and the ventricular dilatation seen in NPH serves to increase the surface area for CSF absorption, with a commensurate decrease in CSF pressure to a 'normal' level, such that the product of ventricular surface area and pressure remains constant.

Adams et al also proposed that the ventricular dilatation seen in NPH caused stretching of adjacent white matter tracts which may account for its clinical symptoms. However, these proposed mechanisms raise further questions. First, other forms of hydrocephalus, such as obstructive hydrocephalus (OH), are also characterised by ventriculomegaly which may also stretch these white matter tracts. However, these hydrocephalic conditions do not typically present with Hakim's triad that characterises NPH. Second, these forms of hydrocephalus are characterised by persistent elevations in ICP even in the setting of ventriculomegaly, which raises the question as to why the 'hydraulic press mechanism' would be unique to NPH. Furthermore, the responsiveness to CSF diversion is varied, and the extent of reduction in ventricular dilatation has not been demonstrated to correlate with improvement in symptomatology. Even patients with significant clinical improvement to resolution have demonstrated only a 10% reduction in Evans' index. Moreover, ventricular size and volume have not definitively been shown to correlate with the severity of disease even prior to shunting.

### Hearing loss in hydrocephalus: a review, with focus on mechanisms [^29c41d60]. Neurosurgical Review (2016). Low credibility.

While neither hydrocephalus nor cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt placement is traditionally considered in the differential diagnosis of hearing loss, there is substantial evidence that CSF circulation and pressure abnormalities can produce auditory dysfunction. Several indirect mechanisms may explain association between hydrocephalus and hearing loss, including mass effect, compromise of the auditory pathway, complications of prematurity, and genetically mediated hydrocephalus and hearing loss. Nevertheless, researchers have proposed a direct mechanism, which we term the hydrodynamic theory. In this hypothesis, the intimate relationship between CSF and inner ear fluids permits relative endolymphatic or perilymphatic hydrops in the setting of CSF pressure disturbances. CSF is continuous with perilymph, and CSF pressure changes are known to produce parallel perilymphatic pressure changes. In support of the hydrodynamic theory, some studies have found an independent association between hydrocephalus and hearing loss. Moreover, surgical shunting of CSF has been linked to both resolution and development of auditory dysfunction. The disease burden of hydrocephalus-associated hearing loss may be large, and because hydrocephalus and over-shunting are reversible, this relationship merits broader recognition. Hydrocephalic patients should be monitored for hearing loss, and hearing loss in a patient with shunted hydrocephalus should prompt further evaluation and possibly adjustment of shunt settings.

### Surgery for hydrocele in children-an avoidable excess? [^10abf152]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is little consensus over the optimal timing of ligation of a patent processus vaginalis (PPV) in boys with hydrocele. We hypothesized that a proportion of procedures may be unnecessary because they are performed at an age before which the PPV may be expected to close spontaneously. Such excess may expose the child to unnecessary surgery and have significant cost implications.

Methods

A systematic literature review relating to timing of PPV ligation and a population-based study to define number of PPV ligations performed annually in England and age at surgery were conducted.

Results

Most hydroceles resolve before 2 years of age, but their natural history beyond this age is poorly documented. Current guidelines recommend PPV ligation at 2 years of age. An average of 2878 operations for hydrocele is performed per year in children in England. Commonest age at repair is 2 years. There are no randomized controlled trials comparing PPV ligation with an observational nonoperative approach.

Conclusions

The natural history of hydrocele is poorly documented beyond the age of 2 years. There is no good evidence to support current practice. Delaying surgery may reduce the number of procedures necessary without increasing morbidity. A prospective study to investigate this is warranted.

### Genetics and molecular pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^7a7ee643]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by dilation of the cerebral ventricles without increased cerebral pressure. Patients typically present with cognitive impairment, gait abnormalities, and urinary incontinence. Despite current guidelines for diagnosis and surgical intervention, there is little consensus on the pathophysiology of iNPH. Familial cases and genomic studies of iNPH have recently suggested an underappreciated role of genetics in disease pathogenesis, implicating mechanisms ranging from dysregulated CSF dynamics to underlying neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory processes. In this paper, the authors provide a brief review of genetic insights and candidate genes for iNPH, highlighting the continued importance of integrated genetic analysis and clinical studies to advance iNPH management.

### Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor – A (VEGF-A) and VEGF – A gene polymorphism are associated with hydrocele development in lymphatic filariasis [^65b70a45]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Hydrocele is a build-up of fluid in the scrotal regions of a proportion of men infected with the filarial nematode Wuchereria bancrofti. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) are major mediators of vascular permeability and angiogenesis in the development and progression of many diseases, making them candidates in hydrocele development. We assessed the role of VEGF-A genetic polymorphisms in hydrocele development in a cohort of lymphatic filariasis patients from Ghana. Three VEGF-A promoter polymorphisms were examined. The C/C genotype at -460 was significantly higher in hydrocele patients ([P = 0.0007], OR = 3.8 [95% CI = 1.9–8.2]) than in non-hydrocele patients. Furthermore, plasma levels of VEGF-A were significantly higher in subjects with the C/C genotype than in those with other genotypes. Also, a positive correlation (R² = 0.412, P = 0.026) was observed between plasma VEGF-A and stage of hydrocele. The data suggest that the C polymorphism at -460 is a genetic risk factor for hydrocele development in lymphatic filariasis.

### Meconium-induced periorchitis [^ecee38d7]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A testicular tumour-like lesion or a solid extratesticular mass are serious postnatal problems with a broad spectrum of inflammatory or tumorous causes and possible differential diagnoses. In this case report, an extraordinary case of a newborn boy with a rare cause of a periorchitis is described. A premature boy infant (25-year-old mother with obesity) was diagnosed as having a disturbance of prosperity. A plain film of the abdomen showed a dilated intestine (no pathological findings in abdominal ultrasound, in particular, no ascites). After 3 postnatal months of clinical observation at the hospital including temporary parenteral nutrition, hydrocele at both sides was diagnosed. Therefore, the boy underwent surgical exploration. Intraoperatively, the processus vaginalis peritonei was surprisingly filled with meconium; because of that, the situs was extensively rinsed. In addition, the boy underwent an operation for the right and left hydrocele. The testes were preserved (on follow-up investigation there were no further problems). Pathohistological investigation confirmed meconium periorchitis, which is a rare postnatal disease and which can only develop in cases of former meconium peritonitis and if the processus vaginalis peritonei is open. The precise details of cause and pathophysiology in this case may significantly help in avoiding unnecessary orchiectomy.

### Infant communicating hydroceles – do they need immediate repair or might some clinically resolve? [^fd5cb804]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Infant hydroceles that are communicating by history (fluctuation in size) or examination (reducible fluid) are often repaired soon after presentation. We have followed a series of infant boys with such hydroceles and reviewed their early natural history.

Materials and Methods

Since 1998, we have followed 174 infant boys presenting with an apparent communicating hydrocele without immediate surgical repair. All boys were initially seen before 18 months of age and most (168) by 12 months. Most had been full term at delivery, although 32 had been premature (< 37 weeks' gestational age) and 11 extremely so (< 32 weeks). Most boys (120) had bilateral hydroceles at presentation.

Results

Of the 110 boys followed to disposition, 69 (62.7%) had complete resolution without surgery by a mean age of 11.7 months. Forty-one patients (37.3%) underwent surgery for correction at a mean age of 14 months because of persistence in size or development of a hernia. Six developed a hernia during observation, none of whom had any episode of incarceration. Only 2 patients with apparent resolution subsequently had recurrence with a hernia. Age at presentation and gestational age at birth showed no effect on resolution. The hydroceles of 64 boys had improved in size after a mean follow-up of 13.9 months when last seen.

Conclusions

Many infant hydroceles that are communicating by history or examination do resolve clinically without surgery and deserve observation. Progression to hernia was rare in our experience and did not result in incarceration. Consequently, little risk is taken by initial observation.

### Pathogenic implications of cerebrospinal fluid barrier pathology in neuromyelitis optica [^f992898b]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

We recently reported that obstructive hydrocephalus is found in NMO patients at a higher frequency than observed in the general adult population. On the basis of these cases, we predicted a primary involvement of ependyma in NMO and our current findings support this concept. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying hydrocephalus in NMO are not straightforward. While evidence from mice lacking AQP4 expression indicates about a 10% incidence of hydrocephalus triggered by complete obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, it is not clear why such obstructions occur. AQP4-null mice exhibit an intact blood–brain barrier but a disorganized ependymal cell layer, even in animals without hydrocephalus, supporting a model in which loss of AQP4, whether genetic or antibody-mediated, induces defects in CSF homeostasis. However, loss of AQP4 at the blood–CSF barrier in the choroid plexus may have counteracting effects on CSF production, resulting in little change in overall CSF volume. This model argues against CSF hyper-production as the cause of hydrocephalus in NMO, though it remains possible that hypo-production of CSF due to loss of choroid plexus epithelial cells could impact ventricular flow in a manner that increases the likelihood of aqueductal blockage. Such blockage and subsequent obstructive hydrocephalus may also arise as a result of ependymal cell loss induced by the NMO IgG-mediated complement deposition we observed in this study. Humans and mice with primary ciliary dyskinesia exhibit hydrocephalus, and genetic deletion or mutation of multiple specific ciliary proteins results in ependymal cilia beat defects and consequent hydrocephalus induced by reduced CSF flow. Additional evidence indicates that laminar CSF propulsion mediated by ependymal cilia is required to maintain aqueductal patency, and defects in such propulsion result in aqueduct stenosis and triventricular hydrocephalus. Ultimately, short of catastrophic loss of ependymal cells and/or choroid plexus epithelial cells or the initiation of an amplification loop that results in a rapid rise in intracerebral pressure and consequent collapse of the aqueduct, it is likely that overt hydrocephalus in NMO is at one end of a spectrum that more frequently manifests as transient pressure increases and disorganized CSF flow. Regardless, these events may contribute to pathologic events in the brain parenchyma that run in parallel to direct NMO IgG-induced astrocyte pathology. Indeed, it is possible that preventing damage at the blood–CSF and CSF–brain interfaces may substantially reduce or delay direct parenchymal damage by the NMO IgG. In light of this, it is noteworthy that we observed robust complement deposition at the choroid plexus and ependymal interfaces, suggesting that these sites may be directly protected by complement cascade blocking therapies, such as eculizumab. It would be of interest in future studies to determine if eculizumab therapy alters the imaging hallmarks of pseudo-vasogenic edema in NMO patients as a secondary outcome measure.

### Tension hydrocele: an unusual cause of acute scrotal pain [^eda65d2a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of acute scrotal pain can vary from a benign process such as mild trauma, appendicular torsion, or epididymo-orchitis to an emergent process such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, or rupture. Furthermore, testicular insult often results in a reactive hydrocele that can both cloud the diagnosis and impair the physical examination. Traditionally, the acute scrotum was managed with immediate exploration, but emergency physicians and urologists have increasingly used Doppler ultrasonography to assess vascular flow, aide in the diagnosis, and ultimately guide triage of those patients who require urgent intervention. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with 2 days of increasing testicular pain and swelling, confirmed to have a large hydrocele with compromised testicular perfusion, and was managed by emergent operative drainage and repair of a "tension hydrocele" with immediate return of testicular perfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tension hydrocele causing intratesticular vascular compromise in a pediatric patient.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5493e84]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric hydrocele (PH) is a curable pathology which can lead to early treatment and complete removal of complications following on-time diagnosis by an experienced delivery team. Untreated hydrocele can eventually lead to infertility. Currently, there are no single global statistics available regarding the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele; thus, it seems that presentation of a valid report in this regard causes the awareness of medical staff and health policymakers. This study was designed to present the global prevalence of PH in two groups of infants and children. The results of this meta-analysis study (statistical population of 349,558 cases) showed that the global prevalence of this disease in infants and children is 1 per 1000 and 3.4 per 1000, respectively. The findings showed that by the age (from infancy to childhood), the rate of pediatric hydrocele increases. This finding represented late or no diagnosis of PH pathology during labor or a few days post-labor. It is also suggested that multiple environmental factors can lead to the occurrence of PH in the post-infant period.

Provision of health solutions for early diagnosis of PH pathology seems a critical approach. Hydrocele in infants is a benign condition commonly disappears with no treatment. However, in persistent cases beyond infancy, careful screening is essential to determine the need for surgical intervention. The exact report of hydrocele's prevalence and ongoing management strategies emphasizes the importance of pediatric surveillance in early childhood health care. The studies conducted by Osifo and Osaigbovo and Imaizumi et al. provided important insights regarding the prevalence and special characteristics of hydrocele in infants, albeit from different geographical and clinical contexts. Osifo and Osaigbovo in a study entitled "Congenital hydrocele: prevalence and outcome among male children who underwent neonatal circumcision in Benin City, Nigeria" found that among 2,715 male neonates circumcised, 4.7% were diagnosed with hydrocele. This study highlighted that 83.4% of the diagnosed cases resolved spontaneously by the age of 18 months, with peak resolution occurring between 4–6 months.

### Could increased expression of aquaporin-1 be an etiological cause in childhood noncommunicating hydroceles that do not regress spontaneously? [^3ed5f3dd]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aquaporins are membrane water channel proteins that are expressed in the epithelium and endothelium. Their primary function is to control the flow of water in the membranes of the cells.

Objective

In this study, we investigated whether there is increased expression of aquaporin-1 in the tunica vaginalis of hydrocele patients in childhood that do not regress spontaneously an whether it has an effect on the etiology of hydrocele.

Study Design

Boys who were diagnosed with hydrocele and scheduled for surgery were included and formed the hydrocele group. Boys in the same age range who underwent surgery for inguinal hernia or undescended testicles were included as a control group. Aquaporin-1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical examination of capillaries in tissue samples taken from the tunica vaginalis during the operation. Aquaporin-1-positive vessels were counted by selecting 5 unrelated areas with the highest vascular density, and the average number of vessels was calculated for each case.

Results

A total of 48 male patients were included in the study. Of these, 27 constituted the hydrocele group (mean age 3.51 ± 2.59 years), and 21 constituted the control group (inguinal hernia, n = 17; undescended testicle, n = 4) (mean age 3.95 ± 3.80 years). The mean ages of both groups were statistically similar (p = 0.32). The mean numbers of aquaporin-1-positive vessels at the capillaries in the tunica vaginalis of the patients were 20.74 ± 7.10 in hydrocele group and 17.23 ± 4.07 in the control group. The expression of aquaporin-1 in the hydrocele group was significantly higher (p = 0.037).

Discussion

It was shown that aquaporin-1 expression was higher in adult cases with hydrocele. Also an increase in aquaporin-1 expression was detected in tunica vaginalis of children with hydrocele in our study.

Conclusion

It was thought that aquaporin-1 overexpression may play a role in non-communicating hydroceles in children.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eaa35273]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric hydrocele is a congenital pathology commonly diagnosed in newborns. Also, untreated pediatric hydrocele can induce adverse permanent consequences in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the global prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, as a necessary factor for health policymakers.

Methods

Databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar search engine were systematically searched for studies reporting the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children. The main keywords of " Prevalence ", " Outbreak hydrocele ", " Infant ", and " Child " were used in this regard. Screenings were applied to achieve eligible papers and a quality control process was conducted to select middle to high-quality papers. Finally, the random effect model was used to perform meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was checked by the I² index. Data analysis was applied with CMA (v.2) software.

Results

Following the assessment of 5 eligible studies with a sample size of 70,961 infants (1–2 weeks), the global prevalence of hydrocele in infants was found 0.001% (95%CI:0.00007–0.018, 1 per 1000 live births). In the review of 3 studies with a sample size of 278,597 children (7–12 years), the global prevalence of hydrocele in children was reported 0.0034% (95%CI:0.00004–0.21), 3.4 per 1000 children).

Conclusion

According to the analyzed studies, a relatively high prevalence of hydrocele in infants was reported, globally. Besides, there were undiagnosed or recurrent pediatric hydrocele cases in children which need more precise medical screening. Thus, it is necessary to implement health policies to reduce the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele and associated adverse consequences.

### Cotransporter-mediated water transport underlying cerebrospinal fluid formation [^9bd372f5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mammalian brain is bathed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is continuously produced at a rate of approximately 500 mL fluid per day in the adult human. Prior to exiting the brain, the CSF travels through the ventricular system and part of it re-enters the brain via the para-vascular route along the large arteries and penetrating arterioles. The CSF is predominantly produced by the choroid plexus, an epithelial monolayer resting on highly vascularized connective tissue and located at the base of each of the four ventricles –. The molecular mechanisms underlying this choroidal fluid production remain unresolved. Dysregulation of CSF production or clearance may lead to brain water accumulation and raised intracranial pressure, as evident in patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus most commonly occurs as a consequence of obstructed CSF outflow, and is routinely treated by insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt diverting the excessive fluid from the ventricles into the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen. However, in certain choroidal pathologies, such as choroid plexus hyperplasia, choroid plexus papilloma, and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, the increased intracranial pressure occurs, at least in part, from CSF overproduction. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathologic increase in CSF production remain elusive. Insight into the transport mechanisms underlying brain CSF accumulation could provide a rational therapeutic target to reduce this pathologic brain fluid accumulation.

The CSF production is generally assumed to take place by transport of osmotically active ions (e.g. sodium by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase,) followed by osmotically obliged, passive movement of water, partly via the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) expressed at the luminal membrane of the choroid plexus. However, several observations suggest that such a simple osmotic model may not be adequate: (1) The CSF production declined by a mere 20% in the AQP1 knock-out mice, partly ascribed to the 80% reduction of central venous blood pressure in these mice. (2) With the known osmotic water permeability across the choroid plexus, detailed calculations have demonstrated that the osmolarity of the CSF must exceed that of the plasma by as much as 250 mOsm (in contrast to the measured difference in osmolarity of 5−10 mOsm,) in order for the CSF to be produced at the observed rate by simple osmosis. (3) The choroid plexus has the ability to produce CSF against an oppositely directed osmotic gradient –. Taken together, conventional aquaporin-mediated osmotic water transport does not suffice to sustain the rates of CSF production consistently observed in mammals.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^575ac1fa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to this study, it is suggested that neonates with congenital hydrocele should be monitored for spontaneous resolution for at least 18 months before surgical intervention, as no hydrocele-associated complications were observed during follow-up period. In contrast, the study conducted by Imaizumi et al. entitled "The prevalence at birth of congenital malformations at a maternity hospital in Osaka City, 1948–1990" provided a broader epidemiological perspective on congenital malformations, including hydroceles. In this study, no special focus on hydrocele outcomes or management strategies was considered. While this study documented various congenital conditions over several decades, it lacked detailed findings on hydroceles and prevalence rates or resolution outcomes like those reported by Osifo and Osaigbovo.

Totally, while Osifo and Osaigbovo's research offered specific insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele in a Nigerian context, Imaizumi et al. contributed to a general understanding of congenital malformations without delving deeply into hydrocele specifics. The studies by Lingaji et al. Chu et al. and Nisale provided valuable insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele and hernia among children, highlighting different aspects of these conditions. Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip reported a prevalence rate of 2.5% for hydroceles among the surveyed school children. Their findings indicated that hydrocele is often associated with inguinal hernias, emphasizing the need for comprehensive screening in pediatric populations.

In contrast, the study by Chu et al. focused on the management of inguinal hernias rather than hydroceles specifically. This research analyzed data from 3,006 cases and found that individualized treatment strategies significantly reduced recurrence rates in adolescents. While this study not directly address hydrocele, it underscored the importance of tailored surgical approaches in managing related conditions, given that hydroceles can occur alongside hernias. Nisale's study reported a prevalence of 1.7% for hydroceles in their cohort study. This study highlighted the significance of early detection and intervention for both hernias and hydroceles to prevent complications and improve outcomes in pediatric patients.

Overall, while Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip emphasized the prevalence of hydrocele in a specific population, Chu et al. provided insights into surgical management strategies for hernias which may also relate to cases involving hydrocele, and Nisale and Warad contributed additional prevalence data supporting the need for vigilant screening in school-aged children.

### The challenging sonographic inguinal canal evaluation in neonates and children: an update of differential diagnoses [^f3cfc9a4]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Bulging of the inguinal region is a frequent complaint in the pediatric population and sonographic findings can be challenging for radiologists. In this review we update the sonographic findings of the most common disorders that affect the inguinal canal in neonates and children, with a focus on the processus vaginalis abnormalities such as congenital hydroceles, indirect inguinal hernias and cryptorchidism, illustrated with cases collected at a quaternary hospital during a 7-year period. We emphasize the importance of correctly classifying different types of congenital hydrocele and inguinal hernia to allow for early surgical intervention when necessary. We have systematically organized and illustrated all types of congenital hydrocele and inguinal hernias based on embryological, anatomical and pathophysiological findings to assist readers in the diagnosis of even complex cases of inguinal canal ultrasound evaluation in neonates and children. We also present rare diagnoses such as the abdominoscrotal hydrocele and the herniation of uterus and ovaries into the canal of Nuck.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3a2a800a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

In order to collect eligible and extractable data representing the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, a systematic searching was applied in 6 databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar using main keywords of " Prevalence ", " hydrocele ", " Infant ", and " Children ". Also, no time restrictions were applied for paper searching (by September 1, 2024). Citation Management Software of EndNote was used for reference arrangement. The references of collected papers were also screened manually to cover the maximum collection of eligible studies. Finally, the searching process was updated on September 16, 2024. Keywords were extracted using the MeSH concept. The search strategy (in each database) was determined using Advanced Searching Mode using (AND) and (OR) operators to reach the maximum combination. For example, the searching strategy in the PubMed database was determined as follows; (((((((Prevalence[Title/Abstract]) AND (hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Testicular Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Scrotal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Vaginal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) AND (Infant[Title/Abstract])) OR (Infants[Title/Abstract])) AND (Children[Title/Abstract]))))))).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were all studies reporting the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, with available full-text, sufficient extractable data, and papers designed in English Language. Besides, all case reports, case series, intervention studies, reviews, and papers with insufficient or unextractable data were excluded.

Study selection

The PRISMA guidelines were totally followed for selection of eligible studies. This protocol was conducted through exclusion of duplicate studies and the selection of eligible investigations based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. During paper searching, the citations were imported into the Citation Management Software (EndNote). Duplicate papers were selected and merged. During the primary screening, the Title and Abstract of the papers were assessed and irrelevant investigations were excluded. In the secondary screening process, full texts of studies were provided and re-evaluated. Eligible papers with extractable data were considered in this regard. In order to prevent the probable bias, all stages were carried out by two independent researchers. Any potential disagreements regarding the paper's selection were re-evaluated by the corresponding author.

### Misdiagnosis of scrotal and retroperitoneal lymphangioma in children [^0257777c]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations of ultrasound examination. Most patients underwent ultrasound examination within 3 months before surgery, but the results were not sufficiently accurate. If the lymphangioma was limited to the scrotum and inguinal area without protruding into the abdominal cavity (e.g. Case 1), ultrasound suggested a cystic mass and misdiagnosed it as a hydrocele. In addition, if ultrasound fails to detect if the mass extends into the abdominal cavity at the inner ring orifice, or if abdominal ultrasound is not performed, it can also lead to misdiagnosis of lymphangiomas. In some cases, such as Case 3 and in some emergency cases, preoperative ultrasound cannot be completed to determine the presence of incarceration of the intestines or other features such as time constraints, leading to a misdiagnosis of incarcerated inguinal hernia.

Lymphangioma originates from the mesoderm and represents a congenital malformation of vascular development. It is not a 'real' tumor, but rather a benign lesion composed of multiple expanded lymphatic cysts formed by the abnormal development of the lymphatic system during the embryonic period. Lymphangiomas are more common in children, with about 90% diagnosed before the age of 2 years old. The incidences are equal between males and females. The pathophysiology of lymphangioma was first proposed by Whimster in 1976, who divided it into three types: capillary lymphangioma, cavernous lymphangioma, and cystic lymphangioma. Cystic lymphangiomas mostly occur in the head, neck, and armpits (95%) and are soft, nonpulsatile, painless lumps. The surface skin is usually normal, but can have a bluish tint or pink vesicles resembling capillary malformations in some patients. Lymphangiomas in the retroperitoneum, scrotum, and inguinal areas are rare. Singh et al. reported 32 cases of cystic lymphangioma in children, among which only one was in the scrotum. In the early embryonic stage, the peritoneum of the lower abdomen in males forms a protrusion (processus vaginalis) towards the inguinal region and extends along the inguinal canal to the bottom of the scrotum. If the processus vaginalis is not closed, a lymphangioma in the abdominal cavity can reach the scrotum through the inguinal canal, and is thus often misdiagnosed as an indirect inguinal hernia, hydrocele, testicle torsion, or varicocele.

### Measurement of hydroxyproline and nitric oxide, and comparison of sac fluid acidity in different inguinal pathologies [^ae238fed]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare hydroxyproline and nitric oxide levels, and fluid acidity between sac tissues from inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis patients.

Material and Method

Thirty patients were in the inguinal hernia group, 11 patients in the hydrocele group and 5 patients in the undescended testis with inguinal hernia group. Intrasaccular fluid acidity, and nitric oxide and hydroxyproline levels in sac tissues were measured and analyzed statistically between groups.

Results

Intrasaccular fluid could be obtained from 24 inguinal hernia and 6 hydrocele patients. Acidity level (pH) was 7.5 ± 0.74 in the hernia group and 7.86 ± 0.63 in the hydrocele group (p < 0.05). All patients in the three groups were evaluated for nitric oxide and hydroxyproline. Results for hydroxyproline (mg/g dry tissue)/nitric oxide (nmol/g wet tissue) were 3.53 ± 0.54/2.02 ± 0.39 for inguinal hernia, 2.89 ± 0.9/1.92 ± 1.05 for hydrocele and 3.02 ± 1.23/2.86 ± 1.09 for undescended testis group (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Hydroxyproline and nitric oxide pathways do not seem to be responsible for the different characteristics of inguinal diseases. However, differences in the acidity of sac fluid may be evidence of the different mechanisms of hernia and hydrocele formation.

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^de77834e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

### Hernias and hydroceles [^12b616b9]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Inguinoscrotal abnormalities in children are best understood by understanding the embryology of testicular descent and the failure of the processus vaginalis to properly obliterate. The inguinal hernia, communicating hydrocele, hydrocele of the spermatic cord, and scrotal hydrocele should be differentiated based on a history and physical examination in most cases, with selective use of ultrasonography. The urgency to surgically correct these entities depends on the nature of the hernia or hydrocele and the likelihood of incarceration or spontaneous resolution. Open standard herniorrhaphy remains the most common surgical approach, and concurrent transinguinal laparoscopy allows quick and accurate inspection of the contralateral internal inguinal ring and the need for bilateral repair of an inguinal hernia.

### Side predilection in congenital anomalies of the kidney, urinary and genital tracts [^febe6e8c]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There appear to be various patterns of sidedness with relation to the common urogenital malformations observed in pediatric urology. The objective of this statistical review was to synthesize this data and to assess if these patterns are significant.

Materials and Methods

Eighteen urogenital conditions were investigated and for each condition the five largest studies that noted laterality were included. The sidedness of each condition was then analysed for statistical significance.

Results

Three conditions had a statistically significant higher proportion on the right side: palpable undescended testis (63%, p = 0.0002), inguinal hernia (59%, p = 0.0001) and hydrocele (60%, p = 0.003). Three conditions were significantly more common on the left side: impalpable undescended testis (59%, p = 0.0008), renal agenesis (54%, p = 0.02) and vesico-ureteric junction obstruction (71%, p < 0.0001) while both pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (62%, p = 0.09) and absent vas deferens (61%, p = 0.11) were trending towards significance.

Conclusions

Various urogenital malformations display a predilection for one side. Proximal malformations tend to be more frequently seen on the left side, where as inguinoscrotal malformations are more frequently observed on the right. There is an increasing body of literature regarding aetiological factors for these conditions. However, our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions does not completely explain this pattern of observation.

### Pressure, fluid and anatomical characteristics of abdominoscrotal hydroceles in infants [^3f4ef322]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a poorly understood entity and multiple theories attempt to explain its occurrence. To our knowledge the factors contributing to the formation of abdominoscrotal hydrocele are unknown, as are its cellular, biochemical and hydrostatic properties. We prospectively evaluated abdominoscrotal hydrocele at surgery to define its cause and its effects on the testicle.

Materials and Methods

Six patients (9 abdominoscrotal hydroceles) were prospectively evaluated at surgery. Hydrocele volume was recorded as well as simultaneous hydrocele and bladder pressure. Fluid at surgery was sent for biochemical and cellular analysis. Testicular and epididymal abnormalities were noted and testicular length was measured. All abdominoscrotal hydroceles were exteriorized and excised. Processus vaginalis patency was documented at repair.

Results

Mean patient age was 7.17 months (range 5 to 12). The mean volume recorded was 212.78 mL (range 80 to 320). Mean corrected hydrocele pressure was 15.44 cm H₂O (range 7 to 28). Mean testicular length was 3.6 cm (range 2.2 to 5.5). All patients had epididymal anomalies and 2 of the 3 unilateral abdominoscrotal hydroceles had abnormal contralateral scrotal findings. In no case was a peritoneal communication identified. Fluid analysis revealed a high protein concentration (mean 4.94 gm/dl), low triglyceride concentration (mean 20.29 mg/dl) and lactate dehydrogenase levels comparable to those in normal serum (mean 99.14 U/l). Cytological analysis revealed a sterile, low cellularity fluid with a macrophage predominance (mean 84.71%).

Conclusions

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele occurs as a result of increased intraluminal pressure confined in a proximal closed processus vaginalis. Increased hydrocele pressure allows expansion into the retroperitoneal space through the internal inguinal ring. This increased pressure is associated with testicular elongation and epididymal abnormalities. The exudative fluid is of a noninfectious etiology and it suggests an altered filtration process. To our knowledge the effects on future fertility are unknown.

### Genome-wide analysis of 944 133 individuals provides insights into the etiology of haemorrhoidal disease [^e4616855]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Haemorrhoids are normal anal vascular cushions filled with blood at the junction of the rectum and the anus. It is assumed that their main role in humans is to maintain continencebut other functions such as sensing fullness, pressure and perceiving anal contents have been suggested given the sensory innervation. Haemorrhoidal disease (hereafter referred to as HEM) occurs when haemorrhoids enlarge and become symptomatic (sometimes associated with rectal bleeding and itching/soiling) due to the deterioration or prolapse of the anchoring connective tissue, the dilation of the haemorrhoidal plexus or the formation of blood clots. Severe forms of HEM often require surgical treatment and the removal of abnormally enlarged and/or thrombosed haemorrhoids.HEM prevalence increases with age and shows staggering figures worldwide (up to 86% prevalence in some reports), whereby a large proportion of cases remain undetected as asymptomatic or mild enough to be self-treated with over-the-counter treatment. HEM represents a considerable medical and socioeconomic burden with an estimated annual cost of US$800 million in the USA alone, mainly related to the large number of haemorrhoidectomies performed every year.

A number of HEM risk factors have been suggested, including human erect position. The tight anal sealing provided by the elaborated haemorrhoidal plexus may have developed during human evolution co-occurring with permanent bipedalism, as shown by our histology comparison of four different mammals (human, gorilla, baboon, mouse; online supplemental figure 1, online supplemental material 1). Other suggested risk factors are a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, reduced dietary fibre intake, spending excess time on the toilet, straining during defecation, strenuous lifting, constipation, diarrhoea, pelvic floor dysfunction, pregnancy and giving natural birth, with several being controversially reported. The hypothetical model shown in online supplemental figure 2 summarises the contemporary concepts regarding the pathophysiology of HEM development. Until today, HEM aetiopathogenesis is poorly investigated, and neither the exact molecular mechanisms nor the reason(s) why only some people develop HEM are known. Genetic susceptibility may play a role in HEM development, but no large-scale, genome-wide association study (GWAS) for HEM has ever been conducted. To evaluate the contribution of genetic variation to the genetic architecture of HEM, we carried out a GWAS meta-analysis in 218 920 affected individuals and 725 213 population controls of European ancestry.

### Emergency ultrasound of the scrotum: a review of the commonest pathologic conditions [^9a4d864c]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the first imaging modality to be performed in emergency conditions of the scrotum. The commonest pathologic entities are divided into the 4 following groups: torsion, trauma, infection, and tumors. Sonographic examination should be performed as soon as possible to ensure fast diagnosis and treatment. Less acute conditions can also be noted while scanning on an emergency basis, such as anatomic variants, hydrocele, oscheocele, clinically evident varicocele, calcifications, etc. Although not threatening for scrotal integrity, they should be assessed during an emergency examination or later on. In this article, complex scrotal anatomy is reviewed and the basic examination technique is described. The commonest emergency conditions are analyzed, along with their pathophysiological basis. Nonemergent entities are also briefly mentioned. Ultrasound images of the commonest emergency conditions are demonstrated.

### Natural history and conservative treatment outcomes for hydroceles: a retrospective review of one center's experience [^8bcb954b]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To elucidate epidemiological data and hydrocele progression, we reviewed pediatric patients diagnosed with hydroceles in our institution retrospectively.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed data from 355 pediatric patients with hydroceles. Questionnaires regarding age at diagnosis, time of delivery, presence of hydroceles in the father and brothers, age at recovery, age at surgery, cause of hydrocele (if present), type of hydrocele, associated pathologies, treatments, and posthydrocelectomy complications were completed by reviewing patients' medical records and interviewing their families.

Results

Patients with congenital hydroceles were more frequently born prematurely (32.5%) than were patients with noncongenital hydroceles (15.9%; P = 0.001). Fathers of 10 patients (3.7%) and brothers of 21 patients (7.7%) also had hydroceles. Hydroceles were associated with inguinal hernias on the same side (12.2%), cryptorchidism (7.5%), varicoceles (6.0%), and testis torsion (0.5%). Among patients aged > 1 year (n = 185), 27 did not undergo operations and healed spontaneously at an average of 5.30 ± 3.36 months. For children aged > 1 year who did not undergo surgery, the rate of spontaneous recovery within 6 months was 77.8% and that within 1 year was 96.3%.

Conclusion

Until strong evidence of hydrocele-induced testicular damage in children arises, we recommend following up congenital hydroceles until at least 1 year and preferably 2 years of age. We recommend following up noncongenital hydroceles for at least 6 months and preferably 1 year if there is no associated pathology indicating the need for earlier surgery such as an inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, tense hydrocele, testis torsion, or testis mass.

### Amniotic band syndrome: head-to-toe manifestations and clinical management guidelines [^a63601b9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand and describe the basic principles underlying the intrinsic versus extrinsic proposed mechanisms for the development of amniotic band syndrome (ABS). 2. Discuss risk factors and conditions that are associated with the development of ABS. 3. Understand the various presentations and associated clinical implications of ABS by anatomic location. 4. Describe the basic tenets underlying various repair technique options for ABS of the extremities. 5. Discuss the common manifestations of ABS in the face and trunk. 6. Understand clinical implications of fetoscopic surgery as it relates to ABS treatment as a novel method for limb salvage in utero.

Summary

Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) refers to the development of constrictive bands of fibrotic tissue in utero. It can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations after delivery. There is much debate in the plastic surgery community regarding the exact pathophysiologic mechanism for the development of ABS, and the most appropriate management. This CME article aims to provide an overview of ABS manifestations throughout the body, and to expound on the most recent advances in anticipatory and definitive management of the condition.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a rare cause of a cystic abdominal mass in children [^31569c82]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a rare cause of cystic lower abdominal masses in children. A timely diagnosis is important because early surgical treatment is curative. Graded compression during the ultrasound evaluation might better demonstrate the communication between the abdominal and scrotal components of the fluid collection, thereby avoiding the use of ionizing radiation and/or the sedation required with alternative imaging modalities.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a systematic review [^12286fad]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon condition characterized by a fluid-filled mass with inguinoscrotal and abdominal components. Controversy exists regarding the best management. We conducted a systematic review of the literature with special interest in presentation, management and outcomes.

Methods

A search was conducted of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in each study.

Results

We found 18 case series that met selection criteria, describing 116 patients with 146 hydroceles. Unilateral ASH was found in 59% of cases with almost even distribution between left and right-sided hydroceles. Ipsilateral undescended testicle, testicular dysmorphism, and contralateral pathology (inguinal hernia) often accompanied ASH. Management was always surgical. The most common approaches were inguinal (67.2%), combined laparoscopic + inguinal (11.2%), and scrotal (10.3%). Complications were poorly reported, but were generally minor. There were a decreased number of complications with the scrotal approach because of avoidance of a difficult inguinal dissection.

Conclusions

ASH is a rare entity treated most commonly via an inguinal approach. However, consideration should be given to combining with an extraperitoneal or laparoscopic approach given coexisting pathology, or to the scrotal approach for reducing morbidity.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^f1f2d1ef]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema pathophysiology and the role of venous disease — Contemporary physiology indicates that "there was no steady state venous reabsorption of microvascular fluid but rather steady, dwindling filtration", and "the lymphatics, not the venules, are predominantly responsible for maintaining tissue fluid balance by absorbing interstitial fluid and ultimately returning it into the circulation". Expert statements note that "lymphatic failure is responsible for all forms of peripheral edema" and that "all chronic edema indicates an inadequacy or failure of lymph drainage", and the panel acknowledges "the significant contribution from CVI". Accordingly, "The edema associated with CVI (C3–C6) represents lymphatic failure or phlebolymphedema".

### New insights on the basic science of bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex [^0c471400]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The exstrophy-epispadias complex is a rare congenital anomaly presenting as a wide spectrum of disorders. The complex nature of this malformation leads to continuous investigations of the basic science concepts behind it. Elucidating these concepts allows one to fully understand the mechanisms behind the disease in order to improve diagnosis, management, and treatment ultimately leading to improvement in patient quality of life. Multiple technological advancements within the last 10 years have been made allowing for new studies to be conducted. Herein, the authors conduct a literature review of studies from 2009 to 2019, considering novel theories regarding the genetics, embryology, bladder, bony pelvis, prostate, and genitalia of patients with bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex.

### Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces and subdural collections-when to evaluate for abuse [^ef37218a]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces (BESS) has also been called benign familial hydrocephalus, benign external hydrocephalus, benign enlargement of the extra-axial spaces, idiopathic external hydrocephalus, benign extra-axial/extracerebral collections of infancy, extra-ventricular hydrocephalus, pseudo-hydrocephalus, benign communicating hydrocephalus, and extra-ventricular obstructive hydrocephalus. Subdural hygroma, benign subdural effusion, benign hygroma of infancy, although they are currently used for collections in a different space, the subdural space, are sometimes inappropriately used to describe BESS, adding to the confusion.

Hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of BESS include a delayed maturation of arachnoid villi leading to defective absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and consequent CSF accumulation in the subarachnoid spaces, and/or amplification of the physiologic imbalance between the skull and brain growth in infants between 3 months and 1 year of age. Subarachnomegaly-venous congestion of infancy has recently emerged as a term to indicate the correct location of prominent CSF space and implicates venous outflow impairment as a possible pathogenetic mechanism. Magnetic resonance (MR) venogram may show hypoplasia of transverse sinuses in subarachnomegalic patients. In infants, arachnoid granulations are not completely developed and the intradural vascular plexus is larger; these, together with meningeal lymphatic vessels in the dura matter appear to play a role in CSF absorption, although further studies are required to demonstrate age-related changes of CSF outflow in humans.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^44391b97]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

It remains unclear why hydrocephalus should develop in craniofacial malformations. Two mechanisms have been suggested: high liquid pressure owing to impaired venous drainage; and too small posterior cranial fossa with poor liquid drainage from the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus often co-occurs with Chiari I malformation. As Chiari I malformation develops earlier than the hydrocephalus, it is plausible that the small posterior cranial fossa should cause Chiari I malformation, which in turn may give rise to hydrocephalus. – The progression rate of hydrocephalus also seems to be determined by the severity of the Chiari I malformation.

Indications for aqueduct stenosis are not found.

Hydrocephalus also occurs, however, in the absence of Chiari I malformation, or may persist after decompression of the Chiari I malformation. In these patients, the hydrocephalus is perhaps the result of impairment of fluid resorption associated with impaired venous drainage. Angiography and CT-V can show the presence of extensive venous collaterals in syndromic craniosynostosis. The presence of these collaterals is suggestive of impaired venous drainage. Cinallireported jugular vein stenosis.

Hydrocephalus is defined as a progressive increase of ventricle width, associated with signs of ICP. This should be distinguished from ventriculomegaly without ICP. The cause of ventriculomegaly is unknown as well. Brain maldevelopment has been suggested, or either atrophy or adaptation of the ventricular system to the abnormal head shape. – The latter theory is also supported by the finding of a wider subarachnoid space at the level of the largest cranial deformation.

The clinical symptoms of hydrocephalus in craniosynostosis may cause confusion. Often the classic symptoms are absent and is only gradually developing papilledema seen.

The literature does not provide recommendations on the systematic screening for hydrocephalus. Collmann proposes a pragmatic approach in which routine MRI and MR venography are performed on the guidance of risk factors present, that is complex syndromic craniosynostosis, notably the Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes, lambdoid suture stenosis, crowded posterior fossa, and Chiari I malformation. Patients showing tonsillar herniation or increased ventricle width should be regularly monitored for signs of high pressure, notably papilledema. Frequency of monitoring is not mentioned.

### Testicular descent, cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia: the melbourne perspective [^08b104a3]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism is the commonest congenital genitourinary anomaly in males and results when the testis does not descend into its normal intrascrotal position during development. In full-term infants, the incidence is approximately 3% at birth. Cryptorchidism results in several abnormalities, including attenuated spermatogenesis, infertility and a greater risk of malignancy. The normal mechanism of testicular descent appears to be multi-staged, with various anatomical factors and hormonal influences, but the exact process is still unclear. In this article we review the current theories of normal testicular descent, with a focus on the hormones and anatomical factors, and current treatments for undescended testis.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele… [^cea844d1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There probably have been a good many abdominoscrotal hydroceles operated on, but very few cases are recorded in the literature. The condition is sufficiently uncommon to be reported, if for no other reason than in an effort to avoid errors in opening the abdomen for removal of these tumors, which are always extraperitoneal. Hydrocele of the cord and of the tunica vaginalis combined seems to me to be, without much question, the etiology. A hydrocele of the inguinal cord with a competent external inguinal ring could develop in no other location than within the inguinal canal until its size made it imperative that it expand elsewhere. The normal inguinal canal, to an expansive force within the canal itself, is weakest posteriorly. A developing tumor within the canal could most easily extend posteriorly by separating the peritoneum and preperitoneal tissues from the internal surface of the transversalis muscle.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8bf777f3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Global prevalence of hydrocele in children

In the review of 3 studies with a sample size of 278,597 children (7–12 years), the I² index showed a high heterogeneity level (I²:99.7); accordingly, the random effect model was used to analyze the data. The global prevalence of hydrocele in Children was reported 0.0034% (95%CI:0.00004–0.21, 3.4 per 1000 children) (Fig. 3 A). Publication bias was assessed through the Begg and Mazumdar correlation test and no statistical differences were detected in this regard (p:1.000) (Fig. 3 B). The highest prevalence of hydrocele in Children was related to the study of Chu et al. (2019, China, 3006 participants) at 6.85% with a mean age of 6.04 ± 4.32 years. Also, the lowest prevalence of hydrocele in Children was reported by Shobha S. Nisale et al. (2016, India) as 0.01% among 274,591 school-age participants (Table 1). In this regard, another study was associated with Thorat Sukdeo Lingaji et al. (2016).

In order to investigate the effects of potential factors (sample size and year of the paper publication) affecting heterogeneity index, meta-regression analysis was used. According to Fig. 4, the global prevalence of hydrocele in infants decreased with increasing the sample size (Fig. 4 A), this value was also increased following acceleration of study year (Fig. 4 B). Also, according to Fig. 5, the global prevalence of hydrocele in children decreased following the increase in sample size (Fig. 5 A) and increased with the acceleration of the year of paper publication (Fig. 5 B).

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele in an infant boy [^7703ef29]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is the rarest type of hydrocele. This condition is characterised by a large abdominal and scrotal component connected by an isthmus within the inguinal canal. The incidence among the paediatric population is reported to be less than 3%, although it might be underdiagnosed. Several theories have been proposed in the literature but the aetiology of ASH remains unknown. Diagnosis can be made clinically and confirmed by ultrasound. Spontaneous resolution is rare and long-standing ASH may lead to complications, thus early surgical intervention is recommended. Different techniques have been described, but dissection remains challenging due to the tunica vaginalis adherence to the testis and the distal cord. We present a male infant with ASH who underwent inguinal repair. The procedure was facilitated by needle decompression of the mass. Identification and preservation of the vessels and vas deferens was done successfully without compromising the testis.

### Mechanism of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage formation: an anatomical specimens-based study [^ee0c70ed]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

As the most prevalent subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) accounts for ≈15% of all strokes and is related to high morbidity and mortality of about 40%. Despite advances in understanding various prognostic and risk factors as well as neural tissue response to the hematoma, – the prognosis remains poor, the therapy is mainly supportive and surgical interventions are limited to selected patients with signs of excessive mass effect, herniation, or hydrocephalus. – The scientific community is incrementally building knowledge about ICH pathophysiology to select potential treatment targets.

A ruptured cerebral perforator is thought to be the primary source of bleeding. Interestingly, further studies revealed secondary bleeding sites, and a theory was adapted that a growing spherical hematoma stretches surrounding vessels and makes them rupture. – However, currently exploited experimental models are based on intracerebral injection of autologous blood or collagenase, which does not reflect in vivo conditions of hematoma initiation.

In this study, we describe a novel model of basal ganglia ICH initiation based on anatomic specimens and present observations regarding hematoma initiation and formation.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^47cc1306]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Qualitative assessment of included papers

To validate the quality of included articles, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist was used. All aspects of the included papers were assessed including Title, Abstract, Introduction, Statement of the problem, Study objectives, Methods, type of study, statistical population, sampling method, data collection tools, Results, and Discussion. Finally, middle to high-quality papers were included for data extraction. For paper scoring, the values of 1 and 0 were assigned to each approved and rejected item, respectively. The total score was 0–32 on the STROBE checklist. Papers ≥ 16 were considered moderate to high-quality studies (included for data extraction); besides, the articles < 16 were low-quality investigations (excluded).

Data extraction

In this regard, two researchers extracted data using a previously prepared checklist including the "Name of the first author", "Year of paper publication", "Country", "Type of study", "Sample size", "Age group", "Statistics of cases", "Hydrocele prevalence", and "Study tools".

Statistical analysis

Whole statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (v.2). I² test was used to check the heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. The Funnel plot and Begg and Mazumdar correlation test was used for publication bias. Based on the results of the heterogeneity study, factors such as Sample size and Year of paper publication were detected as effective factors in the heterogeneity index; thus, meta-regression analysis was used to examine in this regard.

### Early surgery versus watchful waiting strategy for infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele [^3bc8a85b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele is generally managed with early surgery. However, whether these patients actually benefit from an initial watchful waiting strategy is yet to be determined.

Methods

This single-center, comparative observational analysis included 36 consecutive patients (9 bilateral cases) diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2019. Initial 16 patients (21 lesions) underwent surgical repair shortly after diagnosis (Group A) at a mean (SD) age of 8 (4) months. Remaining 20 patients (24 lesions) underwent initial nonoperative management (Group B). Overall follow-up was 82.74 (63.84) months.

Results

Six lesions of Group B spontaneously regressed at a mean age of 23.8 (7.8) months. Remaining 18 hydroceles underwent surgical management at a mean age of 18.7 (12.6) months. Early postoperative morbidity was high (43%) in both groups (Clavien-Dindo grade I-II). During follow-up, there were 1 recurrent hydrocele and 1 testicular atrophy, both events occurring in Group A patients. Group B patients required a higher need for concomitant ipsilateral orchidopexy (61% versus 14%; p = 0.001), and developed a higher rate of ipsilateral inguinal hernia (39% versus 5%; p = 0.01), occurring within 8.3 (3.53) months of surgery. On multivariable analysis, nonoperative management was associated with unplanned second surgery (odds ratio 5.5, 95% CI 1.25–24.17, p = 0.02), regardless of the type of hydrocelectomy performed.

Conclusions

Nonoperative management provides effective spontaneous resolution in about 25% of infantile abdominoscrotal hydrocele. Clinicians must balance the potential benefits of such strategy against the impact of pressure induced detrimental effects on the success of future surgery when dealing with longstanding lesions.

### A comparative study of smooth muscle cell characteristics and myofibroblasts in processus vaginalis of pediatric inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis [^4193cd75]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the defective closure of processus vaginalis results leads to varied presentations in inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis; the histopathology, immunohistochemical features and electron microscopic examination would differ between these entities. Therefore, a study was planned to evaluate the processus vaginalis from inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis to elucidate the reason for the varied clinical presentation of defective closure of processus vaginalis in these three conditions to provide insight into the role of differentiation of smooth muscle cells.

### A comparative study of smooth muscle cell characteristics and myofibroblasts in processus vaginalis of pediatric inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis [^94dfab39]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights the differences in tissue composition in the processus vaginalis sacs in inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT, thereby resulting in the varied clinical presentation. Inguinal hernia and hydrocele sacs contain more smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts and express desmin and SMA in greater magnitude than the sacs from UDT. Newer studies have shown the role of cytokines such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in the closure of processus vaginalis. The presence of HGF receptors in the processus vaginalis may indicate the role of HGF in triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transformation during inguinal hernia closure. TGF-b1 is a potent fibrogenic agent and stimulates fibrosis of processus vaginalis. Mosavi, et al. have observed that the amount of TGF-β1 was higher in communicating hydrocele fluid than in non-communicating hydrocele. Further studies on the role of cytokines may provide insight into the exact mechanism of obliteration of processus vaginalis.

Ours is the first study to analyze the processus vaginalis sacs of inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT using histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy simultaneously. We evaluated the presence and maturity of smooth muscle cells using histology and immunohistochemistry and confirmed the presence of myofibroblasts using electron microscopy in all the specimens. We also analyzed the processus vaginalis sacs from female hernia patients; albeit in a smaller number. Due to the implementation of uniform protocol and accurate tests employed to evaluate the stated objectives, our study carried out in a larger sample size adds significantly to the available literature on the characteristics of the processus vaginalis in inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT. However, there are a few limitations of our study. The sample size of female inguinal hernia patients was small. Therefore, the validity of our results need to be studied in a larger sample before generalizing the results in this subset. We conducted a qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis on the smooth muscle presence in the processus vaginalis specimens due to technical limitations. In spite of these limitations, our study highlights the differences in the characteristics of the smooth muscle cells in inguinal hernia, hydrocele and UDT which lead to the variation in presentation in these conditions.

Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants

Following the assessment of 5 eligible studies with a sample size of 70,961 infants (1–2 weeks), the heterogeneity index was found high (I²:99.3). Thus, a random effect model was used for meta-analysis. The global prevalence of hydrocele in Infants was found 0.001% (95%CI:0.00007–0.018, 1 per 1000 live births) (Fig. 2 A). Also, the Begg and Mazumdar correlation test showed no publication bias in eligible studies (p:0.806) (Fig. 2 B). The highest prevalence of hydrocele in Infants was reported by Osifo et al. (2008, Nigeria) at 6% (2716 cases with the age of 8.9 ± 4.2 years). Also, the lowest prevalence of hydrocele in Infants was associated with the study of Yoko Maizumi et al. (1948–1958, Japan) as 0.02% with a sample size of 20,919 participants (Table 1).

### Hydrocele after ventriculoperitoneal shunting… [^6b561510]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Hydroceles were noted in six patients who had ventriculoperitoneal shunts at less than 1 year of age. These took a few days to several months to develop. The incidence was 7% in girls and 23% in boys less than 1 year of age. Hydrocephalus was especially severe in the older patients in the group. In one case, the hydroceles cleared spontaneously when a peritoneal catheter was removed. A patent processus vaginalis may allow development of a hydrocele in the face of increased intra-abdominal fluid and pressure. The catheter position may be important, and it is possible that CSF alters the absorbing properties of the peritoneum and also prevents closure of the processus vaginalis. Kaufman HH, Carmel PW.

Pediatric inguinal hernias are extremely common, and can usually be diagnosed by simple history taking and physical examination. Repair is elective, unless there is incarceration or strangulation. Hydroceles are also quite common, and in infancy many will resolve without operative intervention. Undescended testicles harbor an increased risk of infertility and malignancy, and require orchiopexy in early childhood.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for treating hydrocoeles [^fec387ee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrocoeles are common cystic scrotal abnormalities, described as a fluid-filled collection between the visceral and parietal layers of the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum. There are two approaches for treatment of hydrocoeles: surgical open hydrocoelectomy and aspiration followed by sclerotherapy.

Objectives

We compared the benefits and harms of aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 2 August 2014 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aspiration and sclerotherapy versus hydrocoelectomy for the management of hydrocoeles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We found four small studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles). All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions. Blinding for statisticians was not reported in any of included studies. There were no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 95%). On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity. This could be due to the agent used or perhaps due to the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis. When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery) (2 studies, 136 participants: RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85). There was a significant increase in recurrence in those who received sclerotherapy compared with surgery (3 studies, 196 participants: RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.83 to 48.4). One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever in the sclerotherapy group (60 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08). There was an increased number of infections in the surgery group however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.05; I² = 0%). Three studies reported the frequency of pain in the surgery group was higher than aspiration and sclerotherapy group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies, we could not pool the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in haematoma formation between the two groups (3 studies, 189 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; I² = 0%). Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Postoperative complications as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher. The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity. There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period. Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain, recurrence, satisfaction, complications and cure using validated instruments. The protocols for all studies should be registered in clinical trial registries and the reports of these studies should conform with international guidelines of trial reporting such as CONSORT. Cost-effectiveness studies should also be undertaken.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^8c54451f]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — physical examination: The physical examination should include an abdominal, pelvic, and genital examination, with examination of the external genitalia and scrotum performed to rule out masses, induration, hydrocele, hernia, or cutaneous lesions. A DRE may be performed to evaluate for prostatic nodules or tenderness, including palpating the pelvic floor for the presence and location of PFM tenderness. A focused neurological examination should assess for neurologic causes of pain and should include observation of dermatomal distribution of pain, patient posture, and gait, at minimum.

### A giant heterogeneous abdominoscrotal mass: haemorrhagic hydrocele [^fa9d0818]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A hydrocele is a collection of fluid in the space surrounding the testicle between the layers of the tunica vaginalis. Occasionally the scrotal hydrocele may extend through the inguinal canal, deep inguinal ring, and into the abdomen as an abdominoscrotal hydrocele. Traditionally, abdominoscrotal hydrocele have been evaluated and diagnosed with US. However if a relationship between the abdominal mass and the hydrocele is not clearly defined by sonography, the traditional modality for imaging the abdomen and the scrotum such as CT or MRI, should be considered because it can be difficult to clearly delineate the anatomy and the full extent of the abnormality. We present a rare case of a giant hemorrhagic abdominoscrotal hydrocele in a 24 year old man that required an elective operative laparotomy for complete excision of the abdominolscrotal mass.

### Benign intrascrotal lesions [^f889a8a6]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We summarize important clinical, pathological and diagnostic features of benign intrascrotal lesions, including paratesticular lesions (adenomatoid tumors, fibrous pseudotumors, cystadenomas, spermatoceles, hydroceles, varicoceles and hernias) and intratesticular lesions (tunica albuginea cysts, testicular simple cysts, epidermoid cysts, cystic ectasia of the rete testis, intratesticular varicocele, adrenal rest tumors and splenogonadal fusion). This review provides the reader with a better understanding of benign lesions that occur in the scrotum.

Materials and Methods

A directed MEDLINE literature review of benign scrotal lesions and of each individual lesion was performed. This information was enhanced with relevant information from select journals and texts. Particular emphasis was placed on clinical, pathological and diagnostic features.

Results

Intrascrotal lesions continue to provide a diagnostic challenge for physicians. A diagnosis can be made with a thorough history, physical examination and understanding of the pathophysiological processes of the structures contained within the scrotum. Lesions that are suspicious for malignancy should prompt urological consultation and radiological imaging. Ultrasound aids in the diagnosis in instances of uncertainty. Ultimately surgery may be necessary to make a histological diagnosis.

Conclusions

Clinical assessment, physical examination and an understanding of benign intrascrotal processes are key to making a diagnosis. Ultrasound has an important role and adds essential information. If surgery is necessary and a benign process is recognized, a testis sparing procedure should be performed.

### Second' pop-off' of fetal giant urinoma: case report and review [^b7c2acbe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary extravasations in fetuses can not only manifest as urinoma, but also as ascites and pleural effusion. Fetal urinary ascites is a rare phenomenon, most commonly associated with LUTO, such as PUV. Currently, only two cases secondary to UPJO have been well documented. Both cases presented with a small amount of ascites, with one spontaneously absorbing before delivery and the other undergoing drainage during laparoscopic kidney repair after birth. In our case, fetal urinary ascites persisted for nearly 7 weeks and urinoma rupture exacerbated ascites after birth. No complications linked to the presence of fetal urinary ascites were found. This indicates that fetal urine does not harm intra-abdominal organs and that the circulation of urine from the kidneys to the abdominal cavity is not harmful to the fetus. Fetal urine is hypotonic and is therefore less likely to cause inflammation or peritonitis if it leaks into the retroperitoneum or peritoneal cavity. In a fetus, creatinine, urea, and other components of the urinary ascites are likely to equilibrate with the fetal blood which in turn equilibrates with maternal blood in the placenta and thereafter is excreted via mother's kidneys. However, neonatal urinary ascites can be life-threatening. The fetal kidneys and peritoneum lack the placental correction mechanism after birth. As a result, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated serum creatinine and urea will progressively develop due to peritoneal autodialysis. Our patient's serum creatinine showed a significant increase on the 4th postpartum day. A rapid increase in creatinine typically indicates a deterioration in renal function. In this case of urinoma, the elevated levels of creatinine and other biomarkers may also result from the reabsorption of urinary ascites. The normal urine output also suggests that renal function may not be severely compromised. Our experience showed that prompt drainage is effective for administration of urinary ascites and reducing creatinine levels, which aligns with that of other authors. Additionally, fetal urinary extravasation manifesting as testicular hydrocele has not been previously documented, signifying the severity of urine extravasation in our case. Fetal testicular hydroceles arise from the incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis peritonei, a peritoneal tubular fold connecting the abdominal cavity and scrotum.

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^66d67487]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Moreover, this impairment in glymphatic flow has been implicated in experimentally observed retrograde aqueductal flow in NPH patients, which reverts to anterograde flow following CSF diversion via shunting. Shunting, therefore, has also been interpreted as providing another conduit to bypass the impairments in glymphatic drainage, and this may account, in part, for the improvement in cognitive symptoms following CSF diversion.

Therefore, the combination of reduced arterial pulsatility and reduced expression of AQP4 in NPH patients has implicated glymphatic impairment as being part of the complex pathophysiology of this condition.

Compromised BBB integrity

The BBB consists of endothelial tight junctions, astrocyte foot processes and pericytes and serves as a selective barrier to maintain a homoeostatic, metabolic milieu for the CNS, through which critical metabolites can enter the CNS while also preventing potentially neurotoxic bloodborne substances from entering. Therefore, any perturbation of this BBB may introduce pathological changes in the CNS with subsequent neurological dysfunction, as has been implicated in various neurological disorders such as ischaemic stroke, epilepsy and AD.

With respect to NPH, the reduced expression of aquaporins in the astrocytic foot processes represents one such perturbation to the BBB as outlined above. Moreover, authors have noted a high prevalence of degenerated pericytes in biopsies of NPH patients, which may account for increased BBB leakage. This has been further corroborated by Eide and Hansson, who noted a significantly higher rate of extravasation of fibrinogen, a higher molecular weight protein otherwise not present in normal adult parenchyma, in NPH patients than normal control patients.

The subsequent questions would be why and how BBB dysfunction may be implicated in NPH pathophysiology. The elevation in fibrinogen noted experimentally in NPH patients has been correlated with increased astrogliosis, which may subsequently decrease vascular compliance and further compromise the intracranial dynamics of intracranial pulsatility as outlined above. Additionally, pericytes have been experimentally demonstrated to regulate expression of aquaporins, and their degeneration may contribute, in part, to impairments in the glymphatic system. Pericytes have also been shown to regulate blood flow in the cerebral vasculature, as well as promote erythrogenesis in states of hypoxia, and their compromise may induce hypoperfusion and ischaemic changes, thus contributing to the impairments of CBF also noted in this condition.

Therefore, BBB dysfunction may also provide, in part, a mechanism through which the various pathological processes outlined above may contribute to NPH. It is an avenue that requires further investigation.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Role of bone marrow-derived lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells for lymphatic neovascularization [^13cee4a6]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The lymphatic vasculature plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance, and lipid uptake in the gastrointestinal organs. Therefore, impaired function of the lymphatic vessels caused by genetic defects, infection, trauma, or surgery leads to the abnormal accrual of lymph fluid in the tissue and culminates in the swelling of affected tissues, known as lymphedema. Lymphedema causes impaired wound healing, compromised immune defense, and, in rare case, lymphangiosarcoma. Although millions of people suffer from lymphedema worldwide, no effective therapy is currently available. In addition, recent advances in cancer biology have disclosed an indispensable function of the lymphatic vessel in tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, understanding the detailed mechanisms governing lymphatic vessel formation and function in pathophysiologic conditions is essential to prevent or treat these diseases. We review the developmental processes of the lymphatic vessels and postnatal lymphatic neovascularization, focusing on the role of recently identified bone marrow-derived podoplanin-expressing (podoplanin(+)) cells as lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells.

Hydrocele Surgery and Morbidity Management

We projected that hydrocelectomies are typically very cost-effective. Currently, only about one-third of national programs have reported activities to manage morbidity and prevent disability in people suffering from LF. These results give a strong indication that hydrocele surgeries are cost-effective and further support the importance of efforts to encourage and assist all endemic countries to build capacity in this area. This highlights the need for further research in this area so that more cost and effectiveness data can be collected and more advanced analyses conducted.

Limitations

An important limitation of this preliminary analysis is that very few studies have reported the rates of complications and recurrence following LF-related hydrocelectomy, and there is little data that is not anecdotal in nature regarding the degree and time frame to which hydrocelectomy improves morbidity/productivity. Furthermore, there is an absence of cost data and therefore little understanding regarding how the costs vary in different settings. The absence of data on outcomes and costs makes it impossible to compare the cost-effectiveness of one surgical technique to another. However, it should be noted that the overall conclusion that hydrocelectomy is cost-effective was robust to a wide range of assumptions regarding its costs and effectiveness.

It is also important to highlight that lymphedema management is an important component of LF morbidity management programs. Due to the absence of data regarding the different methods used, their cost, clinical effectiveness, and how variable these are across different settings, it was not possible for us to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of these programs. However, it is noteworthy that Stillwaggon et al recently estimated that the economic benefits over a patient's lifetime resulting from a lymphedema management program in India were more than 130 times its costs, highlighting how cost-effective these programs can be.

To allow for more thorough cost-effectiveness analyses of LF morbidity management strategies (across a range of settings), more data relating to their costs, resource requirements, clinical effectiveness, and incidence of complications/relapse for the different potential techniques/methods are urgently needed.

It should be noted that we are modeling the impact and cost of a typical hydrocelectomy/case of hydrocele. For more extreme clinical cases, a hydrocelectomy may be less likely to be successful or more likely to result in complications, and individuals may require more post-operative care. While surgeries for more extreme clinical cases are likely to be more expensive, the corresponding benefit and gain for the patient would also be larger.

### Testicular-sparing excision for benign paratesticular IgG4-related disease [^d367ec46]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

PFP is a benign reactive fibrous lesion that may arise from tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea or the epididymis.PFP is uncommon and represents around 6% of paratesticular tumours. They typically present with palpable, mobile, multinodular, painless scrotal mass. Microscopically, the nodules usually comprise dense fibrous tissue and fibroblasts with the presence of inflammatory cells and varying degrees of calcifications. Miyamoto et al categorised PFP into three subtypes, namely, those with myofibroblastic changes, those with inflammatory sclerotic changes and those with plaque-like appearance without significant inflammation. Although the pathophysiology remains unclear, it was thought that PFP might be clinically correlated with a history of hydrocele, trauma or infection. This was demonstrated by Mostofi et al, which identified 30% and 45% of PFP cases to be associated with trauma and hydrocele, respectively. Similarly, Miyamoto et al showed 46% of their cases have prior or concurrent evidence of hydrocele.

Bösmüller et al introduced the idea of reclassifying PFP as a localised manifestation of IgG4-RD based on the abundance of IgG4-positive plasma cells and elevated IgG4/IgG ratio of 44%–48%. This was further supported by Hart et al, who reported a case of PFP 6 years following completion of long-term corticosteroids for autoimmune pancreatitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis with elevated serum IgG4. Similar to PFP, IgG4-RD is a rare disorder with varying organ involvements, which now include sclerosing autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, Riedel's thyroiditis, interstitial pneumonitis and others. The incidence of IgG4-RD was estimated to be around 0.28–1.08 per 100 000 people. Those affected are more commonly middle-aged to elderly men with a median age at time of diagnosis of 58.8 years. Less than 10% of cases were diagnosed before 40 years of age. Patients typically present subacutely, some with relapsing-remitting course or long plateau. Uchida et al proposed the diagnostic criteria for definite IgG4-RD to include (1) the presence of mass, nodule, organ enlargement and/or dysfunction; (2) elevated serum IgG4 concentration > 135 mg/dL; and (3) the presence of > 10 IgG4 cells in high-power field and an IgG4/IgG cell ratio of > 40%.

### Unbiased CSF proteomics in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus to identify molecular signatures and candidate biomarkers [^d397475c]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

iNPH is a reversible neurologic disorder where the underlying pathophysiology remains remarkably underexplored. In this study, we used unbiased CSF proteomics in a real-world clinical cohort to elucidate mechanistic differences in patients with iNPH compared with patients with AD and CU individuals and highlight a panel of potentially relevant molecular biomarkers to aid in diagnosis. iNPH is characterized by the enlargement of CSF spaces in the brain. In this study, most of the DE proteins were decreased in abundance in CSF in iNPH. A potential reason for these large decreases may be a dilution effect of all CSF contents. Although we show that substantially more proteins were decreased in iNPH, the total protein content of all samples was normalized before analysis by MS. Previous studies have shown no differences in total protein concentration in CSF from patients with iNPH. It is possible in our study that the general downregulation of many proteins observed in iNPH does not change total protein content because of significant upregulation of immune proteins.
