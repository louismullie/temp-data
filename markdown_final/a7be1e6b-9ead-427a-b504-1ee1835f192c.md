## Question

Do hemoglobinopathies causes elevated ldh or decreased haptoglobin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hemoglobinopathies cause elevated LDH or decreased haptoglobin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what hemoglobinopathies are and whether they are hemolytic. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology linking hemolysis to LDH release and haptoglobin consumption. Next, I will review direct evidence in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. After that, I need to check for exceptions and confounders that could blunt or mask these changes. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any caveats for interpretation in practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia are hereditary disorders of hemoglobin synthesis that result in chronic hemolysis, which places them squarely within the spectrum of hemolytic anemias, so I should expect the classic hemolysis laboratory pattern to apply here.

> Now, I need to verify the mechanistic link to LDH. Hemolysis liberates intracellular LDH from red cells into plasma, and in intravascular hemolysis in particular, LDH rises because erythrocyte LDH isoforms enter the circulation; this is why LDH is a standard marker of hemolysis alongside reticulocytosis and unconjugated bilirubin, and it is repeatedly emphasized in clinical reviews and device-related hemolysis guidance as a sensitive, albeit nonspecific, indicator of hemolysis [^115GA3cG] [^115GA3cG] [^115aCqM2].

> Next, I should review the haptoglobin side of the equation. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin released during hemolysis and is rapidly cleared with the haptoglobin–hemoglobin complex, so sustained hemolysis depletes haptoglobin and drives levels down, often to undetectable ranges; this is precisely why low haptoglobin is considered one of the most specific single markers of hemolysis in general clinical practice, despite being an acute-phase reactant that can be confounded by inflammation [^117JdVWw] [^117Cs3Ns] [^111kLtJd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm direct evidence in sickle cell disease. Multiple cohorts and mechanistic studies in SCD show elevated LDH correlating with hemolysis severity and vasculopathy risk, and decreased haptoglobin reflecting consumption; for example, steady-state SCD patients demonstrate elevated LDH and low or undetectable haptoglobin, and the HP1 allele is associated with higher haptoglobin and lower cell-free hemoglobin, reinforcing the causal relationship between hemolysis and haptoglobin depletion in this disease [^114Bw26b] [^1176nzjw] [^111yvmkM].

> I will now examine thalassemia. Transfusion-dependent thalassemia cohorts consistently show increased cell-free hemoglobin and LDH with reduced haptoglobin, consistent with chronic hemolysis; importantly, even when extravascular hemolysis predominates, haptoglobin remains low due to ongoing free hemoglobin binding and clearance, and LDH remains elevated as a marker of total hemolytic turnover, aligning with the general hemolysis paradigm [^1133Zgbp] [^111g67dW].

> But wait, what if confounders obscure these patterns. I need to ensure I account for exceptions: haptoglobin is an acute-phase reactant and may be normal or elevated in inflammation, liver disease can reduce haptoglobin synthesis, and in infants haptoglobin is physiologically low, so a normal haptoglobin does not exclude hemolysis; conversely, LDH is nonspecific and can rise with tissue injury, so isolated LDH elevation needs clinical correlation, and in SCD specifically, haptoglobin is often so depleted that genotype-related differences can be hard to detect at the population level, which means absence of a low haptoglobin in a single sample does not reliably exclude hemolysis in these diseases [^117JdVWw] [^115qaYJy] [^112BF6RL].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes — hemoglobinopathies characteristically cause elevated LDH and decreased haptoglobin due to chronic hemolysis, with both intravascular and extravascular components contributing; LDH reflects total red cell destruction and haptoglobin reflects consumption of the hemoglobin-scavenging capacity, and this pattern is well documented in SCD and thalassemia cohorts, though clinicians must interpret results in the context of inflammation, liver function, age, and concurrent conditions to avoid false reassurance or misattribution [^111kLtJd] [^114Bw26b] [^1133Zgbp] [^117JdVWw].

Hemoglobinopathies cause **elevated LDH** and **decreased haptoglobin** due to chronic hemolysis [^115DmKz2]. LDH rises because it is released from lysed RBCs [^115n61Ce], while haptoglobin falls as it binds and clears free hemoglobin, becoming depleted with ongoing hemolysis [^117JdVWw]. These changes are most pronounced in **sickle cell disease** [^111g67dW] and **thalassemia**, and are useful for monitoring disease severity and treatment response [^114Bw26b].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

- **LDH release**: LDH is abundant in RBCs and released during hemolysis, causing elevated serum LDH [^114Bw26b].
- **Intravascular hemolysis**: SCD and thalassemias cause intravascular hemolysis, releasing LDH directly into plasma [^notfound].
- **Extravascular hemolysis**: Macrophage-mediated RBC destruction also releases LDH, contributing to elevated levels [^notfound].

---

### Decreased haptoglobin

- **Haptoglobin function**: Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, preventing renal loss and oxidative damage [^112QGqum].
- **Depletion**: Chronic hemolysis exceeds hepatic haptoglobin synthesis, causing low or undetectable levels [^117Cs3Ns].
- **Specificity**: Low haptoglobin is a sensitive marker of intravascular hemolysis [^115qaYJy].

---

## Clinical evidence in hemoglobinopathies

### Sickle cell disease (SCD)

In SCD, **LDH** is chronically elevated and correlates with hemolysis severity and complications such as pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers [^114Bw26b]. Haptoglobin is typically low or undetectable due to sustained hemolysis [^112BF6RL].

---

### Thalassemia

In thalassemia, **LDH** is elevated — especially in transfusion-dependent forms — reflecting chronic hemolysis [^1133Zgbp]. Haptoglobin is decreased due to ongoing hemolysis and consumption [^111g67dW].

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic utility

- **Disease severity**: Elevated LDH and low haptoglobin indicate active hemolysis and correlate with disease severity [^114Bw26b].
- **Treatment monitoring**: These markers help assess response to therapies (e.g. hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, stem cell transplantation) [^115GA3cG].
- **Complications**: Persistent elevation of LDH and low haptoglobin are linked to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and gallstones [^114Bw26b] [^114PF8z3].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **LDH nonspecificity**: LDH can rise with tissue injury, liver disease, or malignancy, so results must be interpreted in context [^115qaYJy].
- **Haptoglobin variability**: Haptoglobin is an acute-phase reactant and may be normal or elevated in inflammation, potentially masking hemolysis [^115GA3cG].
- **Additional tests**: Reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and peripheral smear help confirm hemolysis and characterize its type [^111kLtJd].

---

Hemoglobinopathies cause **elevated LDH** and **decreased haptoglobin** due to chronic hemolysis, providing valuable markers for diagnosis, severity assessment, and treatment monitoring [^111kLtJd].

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

The triad signs of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia

Haemolysis, one of the major characteristics of the disorder, is due to a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). Red cell fragmentation caused by high-velocity passage through damaged endothelium appears to represent the extent of small vessel involvement with intima damage, endothelial dysfunction and fibrin deposition. Presence of fragmented (schizocytes) or contracted red cells with spicula (Burr cells) in the peripheral blood smear reflects the haemolytic process and strongly suggests the development of MAHA. Polychromatic red cells are also seen in blood smears, and increased reticulocyte counts reflect the compensatory release of immature red cells into peripheral blood. Destruction of red blood cells by haemolysis causes increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and decreased haemoglobin concentrations. Haemoglobinaemia or haemoglobinuria is macroscopically recognizable in about 10% of the women. Liberated haemoglobin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin in the spleen or may be bound in the plasma by haptoglobin. The haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is cleared quickly by the liver, leading to low or undetectable haptoglobin levels in the blood, even with moderate haemolysis. Low haptoglobin concentration (< 1 g/L – < 0.4 g/L) can be used to diagnose haemolysis and is the preferred marker of haemolysis. Thus, the diagnosis of haemolysis is supported by high LDH concentration and the presence of unconjugated bilirubin, but the demonstration of low or undetectable haptoglobin concentration is a more specific indicator.

### Haptoglobin testing in hemolysis: measurement and interpretation [^117JdVWw]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin is primarily produced in the liver and is functionally important for binding free hemoglobin from lysed red cells in vivo, preventing its toxic effects. Because haptoglobin levels become depleted in the presence of large amounts of free hemoglobin, decreased haptoglobin is a marker of hemolysis. Despite its ubiquity and importance, a paucity of literature makes testing difficult to interpret. This review highlights the many physiological roles that have been recently elucidated in the literature. Different methodologies have been developed for testing, including spectrophotometry, immunoreactive methods, and gel electrophoresis. These are covered along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. As there is no single gold standard for hemolysis, validation studies must rely on a combination of factors, which are reviewed in this article. Pitfalls and limitations of testing are also addressed. False positives can occur in improper specimen preparations, cirrhosis, elevated estrogen states, and hemodilution. False negatives can occur in hypersplenism and medications such as androgens and corticosteroids. Haptoglobin testing in the setting of inflammation is additionally discussed as interpretation can be difficult in this setting. Given the widespread use of haptoglobin testing, it is vital that clinicians and laboratory staff understand the principles and correct interpretation of this test.

What initial laboratory tests may be useful in aiding a diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and what might you expect from these investigations?

A haemolytic screen should be carried out and its result interpreted collectively: full blood count (FBC) and film, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), split bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), reticulocytes, haptoglobin and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy). Typical findings and limitations in interpretation are noted in figure 7. Laboratory results in extravascular haemolysis are generally less severe, as haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, with fewer degradation products released into the circulation.

Figure 7
Comparison between the typical laboratory findings in an extravascular versus an intravascular haemolysis. Note: Haptoglobin is not produced efficiently in children under 2 years or those with liver disease (levels are artificially low) and rises with acute inflammation, so it may be misleadingly normal in infection/inflammation despite haemolysis. LDH is non-specifically elevated in tissue damage and may remain low in extravascular haemolysis as red cells are mopped up by the reticuloendothelial system. Reticulocytes may be depressed initially because infection is often myelosuppressive and then rebound. ↑↑, significantly increased; ↑, increased; ↓, decreased; ↓↓, significantly decreased; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

Haemolysis causes anaemia if the bone marrow RBC production cannot compensate for increased RBC destruction. Haemoglobinuria should be suspected if the urine dipstick is positive for blood but urine microscopy shows minimal red cells. Haptoglobin, the most sensitive laboratory indicator of haemolysis and last marker to normalise, is significantly decreased due to free haemoglobin (Hb) exceeding the Hb-binding capacity of the circulating haptoglobins. A reticulocytosis is usually seen, although with AIHA reticulocytopenia can commonly occur in the acute phase due to myelosuppression secondary to a recent infection or inadequate compensatory reticulocytosis. The patient's blood results are shown in figure 1.

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^1176nzjw]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Association of HP 1 allele with lower cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP concentration and multiorgan failure risk in SCD. (A-C) Serum concentrations of (A) HP, (B) cell-free hemoglobin (hgb), and (C) cell-free hgb-to-HP ratio by the HP genotype in patients with SCD at steady state (n = 243), VOE (n = 42), and acute chest syndrome (n = 9). Test for linear trend P values are provided. (D-F) Proportion of patients who developed (D) acute chest syndrome, (E) rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome, and (F) acute chest syndrome complicated by multiorgan failure by the HP genotype on longitudinal follow-up. (G) The proportion of patients with acute organ injury by the HP genotype. (H) The risk for developing acute chest syndrome complicated by multiorgan failure was lower in patients with the HP 1 allele. Log-rank P value provided.

Cell-free hemoglobin concentrations were lower in patients with SCD with the HP 1 allele at steady state (Figure 1 B). The HP 1 allele was an independent predictor for baseline cell-free hemoglobin (β −0.14 ± 0.05; p = 0.007) in the fully adjusted model. Cell-free hemoglobin concentrations trended lower in patients with SCD with the HP 1 allele during a VOE and during an acute chest syndrome episode (Figure 1 B). The ratio of cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP was lower in patients with SCD with the HP 1 allele at steady state (Figure 1 C). In the fully adjusted model, independent variables associated with the cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP ratio included the hemoglobin SS/Sβ 0 -thalassemia genotype (β 1.8 ± 0.4; P < .001), preceding VOE time interval (β 0.011 ± 0.004; p = 0.007), hydroxyurea use (β −0.65 ± 0.29; p = 0.03), HP 1 allele (β −0.40 ± 0.19; p = 0.04), and LDH (natural log β 0.69 ± 0.41; p = 0.09). The cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP ratio was also significantly lower during VOE or acute chest syndrome episodes in those with the HP 1 allele (P ≤ .01) (Figure 1 C).

4.1 Laboratory confirmation of hemolysis

Initial testing should include: complete blood count with peripheral blood smear examination, reticulocyte count, LDH, bilirubin, and haptoglobin levels. The normal values, accuracy, and pitfalls of these tests are summarized in Table 1.

(a) Blood smear examination: erythrocyte fragments (eg, Schistocytes) are common in "mechanical" hemolytic anemia. These fragments, however, are not specific to CPHA (Table 1). (b) Reticulocytes: an elevated reticulocyte count is a typical feature of hemolysis. However, reticulocytes can be elevated in other causes of accelerated red cells production (Table 1). In addition, normal or low reticulocyte counts do not preclude hemolysis. A blunted bone marrow response can be seen with myelodysplasia, alcoholism, or iron and folate deficiency. (c) LDH: this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of lactate into pyruvic acid, and its iso‐enzymes LDH‐1 and 2 are therefore increased in hemolysis. Although non‐specific, an elevated LDH > 2.5‐folds strongly suggests hemolysis. Temporal trends in LDH are also useful in assessing treatment success in patients with PVL and LVAD dysfunction. (d) Haptoglobin: this scavenger binds free circulating hemoglobin released with RBC turnover, and it hence becomes diminished or undetectable in significant hemolysis. A haptoglobin level < 25 mg/dL provides an 87% probability of having hemolysis. 65 A combination of haptoglobin < 25 mg/dL and elevated LDH increases the predictive value to > 90%. However, haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant and its level can hence be normal or elevated in systemic inflammation or acute infection. (e) Bilirubin: indirect bilirubin is a product of hemoglobin catabolism, and its levels are thus increased in hemolysis. Although severely elevated unconjugated bilirubin can occur with acute massive hemolysis, levels > 4 mg/dL in non‐acute hemolysis typically indicate a concomitant liver pathology impairing the conjugation of bilirubin or its hepatic uptake.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113vNEAk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 DEFINITION OF HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

There is no single specific definition of hemolytic anemia. However, the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is usually established if three major criteria are present: (a) unexplained anemia, and (b) signs of accelerated right blood cells (RBCs) production in the bone marrow (eg, high reticulocyte count), and (c) signs of RBCs destruction (eg, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], low haptoglobin). The term "sub‐clinical hemolysis" is used to describe patients who meet the latter two criteria but do not have anemia. In these patients, the bone marrow adequately compensate for the hemolysis, maintaining normal hemoglobin. Prosthesis‐related hemolytic anemia can then be assumed if new hemolysis is diagnosed in patients with cardiac prostheses, and/or mechanical assist devices in the absence of other causes of hemolysis.

Key Points

- Adults with SCD and HP 1 allele have lower cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP ratios at steady state and during a vaso-occlusive episode.
- The HP 1 allele is associated with a twofold lower risk of multiorgan failure on longitudinal follow-up.

### Lactate dehydrogenase to carboxyhemoglobin ratio as a biomarker of heme release to heme processing is associated with higher tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and early death in sickle cell disease [^114BiQzt]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Chronic hemolysis is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Prior estimates of intravascular hemolysis as a proportion of the total hemolytic rate ranged from less than 10% to more than 30%. Chronic intravascular hemolysis is associated with severe vasculopathic complications including pulmonary hypertension and early mortality in SCD. Intravascular hemolysis leads to release of cellular free hemoglobin and heme. Normally, these are scavenged by respectively haptoglobin and hemopexin. However, in SCD patients the availability of scavenging proteins in plasma is typically decreased because of rapid consumption by the prodigious amount of intravascular hemolysis. Both cellular free hemoglobin and heme, devoid of anti‐oxidant buffering mechanisms normally present in red cells, are recognized as erythroid damage‐associated molecular pattern molecules (e‐DAMPs) and contribute to development of chronic vasculopathy, platelet activation and pulmonary hypertension in SCD. Intravascular heme release is associated with elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). All heme metabolized either via extravascular hemolysis or cleared from the plasma via scavenger proteins, will lead to endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) production by heme‐oxygenase 1 (HO‐1). In contrast to heme, CO has many protective effects including inhibition of polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, increased red blood cell hydration, anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects. Theoretically, the balance of detrimental intravascular hemolysis to beneficial CO production (total hemolysis) could be a prognostic biomarker in SCD. Because the vast majority of endogenous CO is cleared by exhalation, end‐alveolar CO (EACO) in morning first breath is an accepted biomarker of endogenously produced CO, and thereby an accepted proxy marker of overall hemolysis. Before exhalation, CO is transported primarily as the conjugate carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO).

Results and discussion

The median age of the cohort was 32 years (IQR, 24–43 years), 57% were female, 76% were SS/Sβ 0 -thalassemia genotype, and 46% were on hydroxyurea at enrollment. The prevalence of the HP genotypes was HP 1–1, 30% (129 of 431); HP 2–1, 47% (203 of 431); and HP 2–2, 23% (99 of 431). The distribution of these genotypes was similar to what has been reported in the general African population (HP 1–1, 29%; HP 2–1, 40%; and HP 2–2, 22%). There were no statistically significant clinical differences at baseline by the HP genotype (Table 1). The mean time interval between biosample collection and the preceding VOE (HP 1–1, 103 ± 3 days; HP 2–1, 107 ± 2 days; and HP 2–2, 112 ± 3 days) or red blood cell transfusion (HP 1–1, 113 ± 2 days; HP 2–1, 111 ± 2 days; and HP 2–2, 115 ± 2 days) were similar between the HP genotypes (P = 0.3).

Table 1.
Patient characteristics at the time of enrollment

In univariate analysis, steady-state serum HP concentrations trended higher in those with the HP 1 allele (Figure 1 A). Independent variables associated with HP levels at steady state included hemoglobin SS/Sβ 0 -thalassemia genotype (β −1.8 ± 0.4; P < .001), preceding VOE time interval (β −0.012 ± 0.004; p = 0.001), LDH (natural log β −0.84 ± 0.37; p = 0.03), hydroxyurea use (β 0.51 ± 0.26; p = 0.05), and a trend for the HP 1 allele (β 0.25 ± 0.17; p = 0.1), adjusting for age, sex, and preceding red blood cell transfusion time interval. The HP 1 allele was associated with higher serum HP concentrations during a VOE and during an acute chest syndrome episode (Figure 1 A).

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^111Tun1y]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is very common in people with glycogen storage disease type 1, and is frequently multifactorial with causes including iron deficiency, renal impairment, anemia of chronic disease and hepatic adenomas. Iron deficiency is particularly common, possibly due to the restrictive nature of the diet, along with increased losses due to bleeding diathesis. Some patients with hepatic adenomas were observed to have severe anemia refractory to oral iron therapy. Increased hepcidin expression was demonstrated in hepatic adenoma tissue, and one patient experienced resolution of anemia with resection of the adenoma. It was postulated that aberrant hepcidin expression from the hepatic adenomas was the cause of the anemia.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the TMPRSS6 gene, leading to a deficiency in an enzyme called Matriptase-2. This results in up-regulation of hepcidin which is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, leading to a clinical picture of iron deficiency which responds poorly to oral iron. The condition can be treated with intravenous iron supplementation.

Hemolytic anemia can present with a normocytic or macrocytic anemia. An elevated reticulocyte count or blood film examination showing polychromasia is often the first clue towards a hemolytic anemia. An elevated LDH and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia provide further evidence of hemolysis, as does a low haptoglobin, although it should be noted that haptoglobin is unreliable in the first year of life and in liver disease.

Of the inherited causes of hemolytic anemia, disorders of the red cell membrane and hemoglobinopathies are most commonly implicated. Disorders of red cell enzymes (commonly termed "enzymopathies") are also an important cause of hereditary hemolytic anemia; patients with these IMDs are predominantly looked after by hematologists. Mature red cells contain no mitochondria and are totally dependent on anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway for their energy needs. Deficiencies of enzymes within these pathways can cause a hemolytic anemia as a result of deficiency of ATP or reducing equivalents. The diagnosis of these disorders is often suggested by the clinical features and blood film examination; however, exact diagnosis usually requires measuring the enzyme in question, or more commonly now, genetics panels using next generation sequencing (NGS).

### Lactate dehydrogenase as a biomarker of hemolysis-associated nitric oxide resistance, priapism, leg ulceration, pulmonary hypertension, and death in patients with sickle cell disease [^114Bw26b]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is prevalent in adult patients with sickle cell disease and is strongly associated with early mortality and markers of hemolysis, in particular, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Intravascular hemolysis leads to impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), mediated by NO scavenging by plasma oxyhemoglobin and by arginine degradation by plasma arginase. We hypothesized that serum LDH may represent a convenient biomarker of intravascular hemolysis and NO bioavailability, characterizing a clinical subphenotype of hemolysis-associated vasculopathy. In a cohort of 213 patients with sickle cell disease, we found statistically significant associations of steady-state LDH with low levels of hemoglobin and haptoglobin and high levels of reticulocytes, bilirubin, plasma hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, arginase, and soluble adhesion molecules. LDH isoenzyme fractionation confirmed predominance of LD1 and LD2, the principal isoforms within erythrocytes. In a subgroup, LDH levels closely correlated with plasma cell-free hemoglobin, accelerated NO consumption by plasma, and impaired vasodilatory responses to an NO donor. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical subphenotype of pulmonary hypertension, leg ulceration, priapism, and risk of death in patients with sickle cell disease. We propose that LDH elevation identifies patients with a syndrome of hemolysis-associated NO resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and end-organ vasculopathy.

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^113PAnJc]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

We examined the association of the HP genotype with laboratory and clinical variables using an additive allelic model based on previous studies. Baseline variables were compared by the HP genotype (1–1, 2–1, or 2–2) using the Cochran-Armitage trend test for categorical variables and the test for linear trend for linear variables. The following variables were log transformed to approximate normal distribution for the analyses: systolic blood pressure, body mass index, white blood cell count, hemoglobin F%, absolute reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, serum HP, cell-free hemoglobin, cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP ratio, and VOE and acute chest syndrome incidence. Serum HP, cell-free hemoglobin, and cell-free hemoglobin-to-HP ratio were compared by the HP genotype at steady state by linear regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, SCD genotype, hydroxyurea use, LDH concentration, and time intervals between sample collection and preceding VOE and prior red blood cell transfusion; comparisons during a VOE or an acute chest syndrome event were performed using the test for linear trend. A time duration of > 4 months for preceding VOE or red blood cell transfusion was assigned a value of 120 days. The associations of the HP genotype with VOE incidence, acute chest syndrome, rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome, and multiorgan failure were performed using linear or logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, SCD genotype, hydroxyurea use, asthma, and tobacco history. The association of the HP genotype with multiorgan failure was also assessed using the log-rank method to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models, with similar adjustments. Analyses were performed using Systat 13 (Systat Software Corporation; Chicago, IL). Median and IQR or mean ± standard error of mean values are provided.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111MCERg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.

### Carboxyhemoglobin, a reliable diagnosis biomarker for hemolysis in intensive care unit: a retrospective study [^113UiP7C]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In anemic adult patients admitted in ICU, we found that carboxyhemoglobin was a reliable diagnostic biomarker of hemolysis. Diagnostic accuracy of HA was better using carboxyhemoglobin than LDH and unconjugated bilirubin, when an optimal threshold of 2.0% was used. A similar threshold of carboxyhemoglobin at 2.2% has recently been reported in a cohort of term newborns. In critically ill patients with comorbidities and multiple organ failures, classical hemolysis biomarkers as LDH and unconjugated bilirubin may lack specificity. Haptoglobin is another biomarker for hemolysis, but its level may change in several critical conditions including sepsis or red blood cell transfusion. Unfortunately, in our study, haptoglobin was not available in patients with non-HA. We also found a significant relationship between plasma carboxyhemoglobin and hemoglobin levels, meaning that the higher the carboxyhemoglobin, the more severe the hemolytic anemia. Carboxyhemoglobin has to be analyzed after evaluation of confounding factors that potentially increase (heavy smoker, sepsis, carbon monoxide chronic sub-intoxication) or decrease (hyperoxia) its levels.

5.9 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia not related to the disease and in the absence of other causes, discontinue SIKLOS.

### Hemolysis, free hemoglobin toxicity, and scavenger protein therapeutics [^114PF8z3]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

During hemolysis, erythrophagocytes dispose damaged red blood cells. This prevents the extracellular release of hemoglobin, detoxifies heme, and recycles iron in a linked metabolic pathway. Complementary to this process, haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge and shuttle the red blood cell toxins hemoglobin and heme to cellular clearance. Pathological hemolysis outpaces macrophage capacity and scavenger synthesis across a diversity of diseases. This imbalance leads to hemoglobin-driven disease progression. To meet a void in treatment options, scavenger protein-based therapeutics are in clinical development.

Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration:
Red blood cell indices:
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]
Mean corpuscular volume [MCV]
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])
White blood cell count and differential count
Platelet count
Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated)

### Hemolysis contributes to anemia during long-duration space flight [^114mTdhU]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory analyses

Various markers of increased erythrocyte destruction intravascular or extravascular are used clinically, including the presence of schistocytes on a blood smear, free hemoglobin in blood, decreased haptoglobin for its high affinity with free hemoglobin, increased bilirubin (indirect or direct), increased ferritin, increased LDH, d-dimer and hemosideruria. However, for different reasons, these markers are not precise, quantitative or direct markers of hemolysis. Iron and transferrin saturation may rise with many types of anemia, including hypoproliferation/hypoplasia when iron is not cleared from the plasma. Similarly, serum ferritin can increase with any cause of anemia other than iron deficiency and/or bleeding. The iron in circulating RBCs is transferred to reticuloendothelial stores, which release a proportional amount of ferritin. For these reasons, we chose endogenous CO elimination as a precise, direct and quantitative marker of hemolysis as the primary outcome measure of the study. We measured CO elimination following the methods of Shahin et al. Briefly, upon waking up, after a 20-s breath hold, astronauts exhaled through a mouthpiece connected to a one-way valve sequentially discarding 400 mL of air from airways and filling a 750-ml collection bag with alveolar air (Supplementary Video 1). The alveolar air was immediately transferred to a vacuumed 200-ml canister. Concurrently, the astronauts filled a second canister with ambient air. Canisters sampled on the ISS were stowed and boarded the next Earth-bound reentry vehicle. These methods accommodated for changes in pressure, temperature and vibration and maintained stable [CO] for at least 11 months. Both air samples were extracted from the canisters and run through a gas chromatograph with a reduction gas detector. Subtracting the ambient air [CO] from the alveolar air [CO] provided the CO elimination.

### Hydroxyurea (Xromi) [^111VjSNP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Do not initiate treatment with XROMI in patients if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.

Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression.

Evaluate hematologic status (CBC, reticulocyte count) prior to and every 2 weeks during dose-escalation period of XROMI treatment. Once a stable dose of XROMI is achieved, monitor every 4 weeks. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue XROMI as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue XROMI.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders (a condition for which XROMI is not approved), secondary leukemia has been reported.

Secondary leukemia has also been reported in patients treated with long-term hydroxyurea for sickle cell anemia. Leukemia has also been reported in patients with sickle cell anemia and no prior history of treatment with hydroxyurea.

All patients using XROMI should be followed up on a long-term basis with regular blood counts to detect development of leukemia.

Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

### Carboxyhemoglobin, a reliable diagnosis biomarker for hemolysis in intensive care unit: a retrospective study [^115DbPGX]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Hemolytic anemia (HA) is a common condition in intensive care units (ICU) responsible for life-threatening organ failure in severe cases. HA needs urgent treatment initiation, but its diagnosis remains challenging as none of the biological diagnostic parameters, including bilirubin, LDH and haptoglobin, are specific. During hemolysis, free hemoglobin released by red blood cells is catabolized by heme-oxygenase 1, leading to formation of iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide. Next, carbon monoxide binds to free hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is routinely measured in ICU and available within a few minutes by CO-oximetry, a point of care testing (GEM® Premier™ 4000, Werfen, Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, France). Our objective was to evaluate carboxyhemoglobin as a diagnostic tool for HA in adult patients admitted in ICU.

Safety

Safety was evaluated through clinical and laboratory assessments. Safety data were collected throughout the study. The adverse events (AEs) that occurred during infusions at the study site (every 8–12 weeks) were recorded by the investigator. All investigators were trained specifically on symptoms of potential AEs. All patients received a diary to record home treatments, AEs and additional information continuously as they occurred. The investigator provided guidance for the patient/caregiver regarding identification and documentation of local and systemic AEs, including signs of haemolysis such as fever, chills, back pain, fatigue and dark urine. All patients were instructed to inform the investigator/site immediately in case of such an event. In addition, the patient was contacted by the investigator within 3–5 days after each infusion, either at the study site or at their home for follow‐up to ensure appropriate documentation of AEs. The investigators reviewed patients' diary entries at every site visit. All AEs were assessed by the investigator using comprehensive data collection systems – including the patient's diary – for seriousness, severity, temporal association and possible causal relatedness to the immunoglobulin treatment.

Monitoring for potential cases of haemolysis included routine haematology screening and haemolysis screening as recommended by the FDA Guidance for Industry (June, 2008 17). If a decrease of haemoglobin (≥ 2g/dl) was measured during either the haematology or haemolysis screening, the assessments to monitor for potential cases of haemolysis were to be performed within 48–72 h of being informed of the haemoglobin level, unless there was a clear alternative explanation. These assessments included: direct anti‐globin (Coomb's) test, plasma‐free haemoglobin, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum haptoglobin and urine haemosiderin.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Effect of a red blood cell transfusion on biological markers used to determine the cause of anemia: a prospective study [^1145nzNS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Blood test results required for the evaluation of anemia are considered difficult to interpret after red blood cell transfusion. However, this hypothesis is neither supported by a strong physiological rationale nor is it evidence based.

Methods

We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the values of key assays prior to and after a course of red blood cell transfusion in the emergency or internal medicine units in 4 university hospitals. The following parameters were measured prior to and within 48 to 72 hours after transfusion: complete blood count with reticulocyte count, direct Coombs' test, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, serum and erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein. We investigated the impact of transfusion on these parameters and assessed whether abnormal values prior to the transfusion became normal after transfusion (or conversely).

Results

There were 77 patients included in the study. Changes in mean values of mean corpuscular volume, soluble transferrin receptor, erythrocyte folate, cobalamin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and direct Coombs' test were not statistically significant. Changes in reticulocyte count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum folate, and total bilirubin concentrations were statistically significant, but they remained in the same diagnostic category (normal or abnormal) in 79% to 98% of the cases; 97% of patients with iron deficiency still had low ferritin or transferrin saturation after a transfusion.

Conclusion

Blood tests performed after a one-time red blood cell transfusion can be used to establish the cause of anemia when they have not been performed before.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^11728TYV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome

Although the idea is controversial, some propose that HELLP is a severe form of preeclampsia. Others believe that it is an entity of is own. HELLP syndrome is defined by the presence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. It occurs in 0.17–0.85% of all pregnancies, more frequently in older multiparous Caucasian women (> 34 years). Seventy percent of cases are diagnosed antepartum, most frequently between the 27 th and 37 th week of gestation. The other 30% are diagnosed after delivery. Of these, 90% had preeclampsia during pregnancy. Approximately 5–10% of women with severe preeclampsia develop HELLP. The pathogenesis seems to be similar to preeclampsia, with generalized endothelial and microvascular injury resulting in microangiopathic anemia, periportal hepatic necrosis and thrombocytopenia.

Most of the patients complain of headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disorders and epigastric pain, and physical examination reveals pain in the right upper abdominal quadrant, weight gain and generalized edema. Early laboratory findings include hemolysis, characterized by high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (> 600 IU/L) with decreased haptoglobin values, non-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated aminotransferases and thrombocytopenia.

The Mississippi Classification was developed to categorize the severity of HELLP syndrome (Table 3). If the platelet count is lower than 50,000/mm 3, an association with disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur. The lack of an increase in platelet levels 96 h from delivery indicates a worse prognosis with possible evolution to multiple organ failure. PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are normal in the early stages. As a consequence of secondary fibrinolysis and platelet aggregation, levels of fibrin products, d-dimers and thrombin–antithrombin complexes may be high. Some patients have renal involvement.

Evaluation of complement pathway during acute sickle cell crises.

Figure 1.
A graphic representation of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, vaso-occlusive crisis and drug induced immune hemolytic anemia episode. (1A) DHTR (delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction): the patient received a transfusion (black arrows) on day one and presented with DHTR on day 7 with a hemoglobin (HGB) of 9.4 g/dL, which dropped to a nadir of 5.6 g/dL by day 8 along with absolute reticulocytopenia, as expected in DHTR. Thrombocytopenia coincided with this severe anemia and elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (T. Bili), and aspartate transaminase (AST). Other evidence for intravascular hemolysis included reduced haptoglobin (< 14; reference 30–120 mg/dL) and elevated plasma free HGB (120; reference < 30 mg/dL) not shown. Eculizumab (E) 600 mg was initiated on day 8 and given weekly for a total of four doses. The patient developed acute chest syndrome (ACS) and received one unit of crossmatch compatible, U-negative red blood cells (RBC) after a dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on day 9. The resolution of hemolysis was evidenced by improvement in LDH and HGB following the first dose of eculizumab and maintained throughout the hospital stay. Thrombocytopenia recovered within 1 week of complement inhibition. The patient required an additional transfusion on day 19 from rebound anemia likely secondary to frequent blood draws, since markers of hemolysis and complement activation on day 22 did not worsen. Immunohematology work-up during this DHTR episode: direct antiglobulin test (DAT) negative, historical anti-U detected. Note: the initial three LDH values were greater than 4,000 U/L (upper limit of our clinical laboratory detection). Eculizumab was dosed based on the weight of the patient, as per the guidelines for loading dose for children with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). (1B) Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC): grey colored dotted bars depict the time points when the patient presented with VOC and also corresponds to complement testing (numbered #1 through #5). Eculizumab was administered for episodes #3 and #4 as described. Lower graph represents episode #4 of VOC and shows an initial drop in HGB and platelets by day 4, when erythropoietin (P) 210 IU/kg was commenced along with a dose of IVIG (I) 1 g/kg on days 4 and 5, respectively. Given the continued deterioration in HGB to a nadir of 3.6 g/dL along with severe headache and worsening hypoxia, eculizumab (E) 900 mg was administered on day 7 after the blood for complement function analyses was collected. Rapid improvement in hemolysis and clinical status was observed within 48 hours of a single eculizumab dose. Eculizumab was dosed based on the weight of the patient, as per the guidelines for loading dose for children with aHUS. (1C) Drug induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA): the patient presented on day 0 to the hospital with fever and received ceftriaxone; HGB dropped within 3 hours to 4 g/dL. Black arrows on the graph denote blood transfusions. Additional laboratory workup showed evidence of intravascular hemolysis, confirmed by elevated LDH > 4,000 U/L, presence of schistocytes on blood smear and elevated plasma free HGB (not shown). Multiorgan failure was evident with a peak of creatinine at 2.36 mg/dL (baseline 0.3 mg/dL), and AST/alanine transaminase at 1,002/70 U/L along with rise in T. Bili. Black colored bars at the bottom of the graph depict the time points when various supportive care measures and eculizumab were administered. Shortly after the initiation of eculizumab, hemolysis decreased, as shown by the rapid drop in LDH, and the patient required less transfusion support. Thrombocytopenia improved. He had initial improvement in creatinine on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), with a brief increase when CRRT was weaned. This rise was not sustained, and creatinine levels decreased promptly without any additional intervention except continued eculizumab therapy. By day 25, blood counts and chemistry were within normal limits. The rebound thrombocytosis persisted for few weeks before trending back to the patient's baseline. Note: the initial three LDH values were greater than 4,000 U/L (upper limit of our clinical laboratory detection). Eculizumab was dosed based on the weight of the patient, as per the guidelines for loading dose for children with aHUS.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^115yEk6F]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Iptacopan (LNP023) is a novel, oral selective inhibitor of complement factor B under clinical development for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In this ongoing open-label phase 2 study, PNH patients with active hemolysis were randomized to receive single-agent iptacopan twice daily at a dose of either 25 mg for 4 weeks followed by 100 mg for up to 2 years (cohort 1) or 50 mg for 4 weeks followed by 200 mg for up to 2 years (cohort 2). At the time of interim analysis, of 13 PNH patients enrolled, all 12 evaluable for efficacy achieved the primary endpoint of reduction in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels by ≥ 60% by week 12 compared with baseline; mean LDH levels dropped rapidly and durably, namely by 77% and 85% at week 2 and by 86% and 86% at week 12 in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Most patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and all but 1 patient remained transfusion-free up to week 12. Other markers of hemolysis, including bilirubin, reticulocytes, and haptoglobin, showed consistent improvements. No thromboembolic events were reported, and iptacopan was well tolerated, with no severe or serious adverse events reported until the data cutoff. In addition to the previously reported beneficial effect of iptacopan add-on therapy to eculizumab, this study showed that iptacopan monotherapy in treatment-naïve PNH patients resulted in normalization of hemolytic markers and rapid transfusion-free improvement of Hb levels in most patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03896152.

### Drug-induced haemolysis: another reason to be cautious with nitrofurantoin [^112FX1CN]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We report the case of a previously healthy woman in her 60s who presented to the emergency department with acute confusion, vomiting and fever. She was recently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection as an outpatient and had completed the fifth day of a 7-day course of treatment with nitrofurantoin. We maintained a wide differential diagnosis including infectious, metabolic, autoimmune and medication-related causes. She developed an acute normocytic anaemia in hospital with a haemoglobin drop from 121 g/L to 89g/L. Further investigation revealed evidence of haemolysis with an elevated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. She was worked up for both inherited and acquired causes of haemolysis and found to have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Her presentation was thought to be secondary to nitrofurantoin-induced haemolysis and she recovered completely with conservative management through intravenous fluids and discontinuation of nitrofurantoin.

### Revolution of AAV in drug discovery: from delivery system to clinical application [^112qBFkx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

9.2 Off‐Target Effects

Off‐target effects refer to unintended gene modifications or interactions occurring outside the intended target site, posing significant challenges in AAV‐based gene therapy. These effects include oncogenesis, inflammation, immune‐mediated tissue damage, toxicity or dysfunction in non‐target tissues, silencing or activation of non‐target genes, and loss of therapeutic efficacy. Self‐complementary AAV (scAAV) can achieve faster transgene expression, potentially reducing the required dose and minimizing off‐target effects. Optimizing AAV delivery methods, such as intravenous, intramuscular, intraocular, intrathecal, intranasal, and local administration, can enhance tissue targeting and reduce off‐target expression. AI/ML computational tools can predict potential off‐target sites and refine vector design, which can then be validated in cell cultures and animal models. Developing biomarkers can aid in early detection of off‐target activity, allowing for timely adjustments to treatment strategies. For AAV‐delivered CRISPR/Cas9 components, the risk of off‐target DNA cleavage can be reduced by using high‐fidelity Cas variants, base editing, and prime editing. Long‐term patient monitoring, follow‐up, and risk‐benefit analysis are essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of AAV‐based gene therapies.

9.3 Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA)

TMA is a rare but severe complication associated with AAV‐based gene therapies, characterized by thrombocytopenia, microvascular thrombosis, hemolytic anemia, and end‐organ damage, particularly affecting the brain and kidneys. TMA following AAV gene therapy is linked to immune activation, complement dysregulation, and endothelial injury triggered by the vector or transgene product. This can lead to a range of clinical and laboratory presentations, including hemolytic anemia (decreased hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and increased bilirubin), thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count), renal dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and hematuria), acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria), and neurological symptoms (confusion, headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits). Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes, with monitoring of platelet counts, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and renal function being essential. Preventive measures to reduce the risk of TMA in patients receiving AAV gene therapy include assessing pre‐existing immunity, optimizing vector doses, providing supportive care, inhibiting complement activation, performing plasma exchange, administering immunosuppressive therapy, and conducting post‐treatment monitoring.

### Hydroxyurea [^114hkt7v]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with hydroxyurea should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia. Bone marrow depression is more likely in patients who have previously received radiotherapy or cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents; use hydroxyurea cautiously in such patients.

Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with hydroxyurea capsules. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue hydroxyurea as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue hydroxyurea.

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported. Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, hydroxyurea can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Hydroxyurea was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 1 year after therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Hydroxyurea (Droxia) [^116ypddp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with DROXIA should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia.

Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression.

Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with DROXIA. Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue DROXIA as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

5.2 Hemolytic Anemia

Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening of anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g., measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue DROXIA.

5.3 Malignancies

Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported.

Secondary leukemia has also been reported in patients treated with long-term hydroxyurea for sickle cell disease. Leukemia has also been reported in patients with sickle cell disease and no prior history of treatment with hydroxyurea.

All patients using DROXIA should be followed up on a long-term basis with regular blood counts to detect development of leukemia.

Skin cancer has also been reported in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea. Advise protection from sun exposure and monitor for the development of secondary malignancies.

Pump thrombosis in ventricular assist device patients — recognition and initial management are summarized as follows: Suspect pump thrombosis with lasting increases in pump power by > 50% accompanied by elevated, inaccurate flow estimates, and hemolysis manifested as an LDH elevation, and note that hemolysis may present as hemoglobinuria with dark, "tea-colored" or frankly bloody urine, and urinalysis may be positive for blood without red blood cells. Hemolysis may be detected by elevations in serum LDH (> 600 mg/dl or 2.5 times baseline depending on the assay used) and elevated free hemoglobin (> 40 mg/dl), with additional markers including increased total and indirect bilirubin or reduced haptoglobin levels, and non-occlusive thrombi can result in significant hemolysis in the absence of hemodynamic instability. When pump thrombosis is suspected or diagnosed, patients should be transported as soon as possible to the nearest VAD center where pump exchange or lysis can be performed if urgently required; proper management begins with hospitalization and systemic anti-coagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor, and admission to an intensive care unit with inotropic support and diuretic therapy may be appropriate during a period of watchful waiting to determine if the situation reverses.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^115QJQKD]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Clinical Diagnostic Criteria

A diagnosis (possible/probable or definite) of mixed AIHA requires demonstration of AIHA [anemia (hemoglobin and/or hematocrit below the established reference range) secondary to an immune‐mediated cause involving both warm and cold autoantibodies].

All cases (probable/possible and definite) required the hemolytic component to comprise at least two of: elevated indirect bilirubin; elevated lactate dehydrogenase; decreased haptoglobin; elevated urobilinogen; hemoglobinuria; and increased spherocytes on peripheral blood smear.

The immune component must have comprised a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with both IgG and complement bound to the red cell surface via any standard method (standard tube methods, column agglutination, solid phase red cell adherence). To be classified as a "definite" case of mixed‐type AIHA required demonstration of IgG bound to the RBC surface in the DAT and a positive elution study (i.e. either a pan‐reactive eluate or an eluate with an antibody with apparent specificity for an antigen expressed by the patient, e.g. auto‐anti‐e) with a concomitant pathologic cold agglutin. If the elution was not reported, the case could still be considered "definite" if RBC transfusion had not occurred in the prior 3 months, the patient had no known alloantibodies, and the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was pan‐reactive or demonstrated an autoreactive pattern with anti‐human globulin (AHG). If elution and IAT results were not reported, the case could be considered "possible or probable" if RBC transfusion had not occurred in the prior 3 months. If RBC transfusion had occurred in the previous 3 months but the IAT was pan‐reactive, the case was considered "possible or probable".

### Hemolysis after oral artemisinin combination therapy for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria [^113a3Jr3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted at the University Hospital of Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin (Berlin, Germany). The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin and is registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (DRKS00007104). All laboratory analyses and parasitologic examinations were performed in accredited laboratories at Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin.

All patients who sought treatment at the hospital and were found to have microscopically confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were included in the study after written informed consent was obtained. Patients were excluded if they had received antimalarial treatment (excluding prophylaxis) within 12 weeks before inclusion; had medical conditions that potentially cause hemolysis (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemoglobinopathy, mechanical heart valve, lymphoproliferative disease); or were taking medication that potentially causes hemolysis.

Patients were seen for study visits at admission before treatment (day 0). After the first treatment, they were seen again after the last treatment dose on day 3, on day 7 (range day 6–day 10), and on day 14 (range day 14–day 20). If symptoms or signs of hemolysis were detected, patients were seen on day 30 (range day 27–day 31) and thereafter if clinically indicated.

Study visits included obtaining a medical history and conducting a physical examination. Laboratory investigations were parasitologic (thick and thin blood smears), hematologic (differential blood count), and biochemical (haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], C-reactive protein, potassium, and sodium levels and renal and liver function tests) examinations; screening for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; and immunohematologic examinations (direct and indirect antiglobulin test, including testing with enzyme-treated erythrocytes).

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Haptoglobin, α-thalassaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphisms and risk of abnormal transcranial Doppler among patients with sickle cell anaemia in tanzania [^115UaonA]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin (HP) is an acute phase protein that removes free haemoglobin (Hb) from the circulation after haemolysis or tissue damage, and is therefore an important anti‐oxidant. HP is encoded by the co‐dominant alleles, HP✱1 and HP✱2, resulting in three distinct phenotypes HP11, HP12 and HP22. Plasma concentrations of HP, and its binding affinities for free Hb, vary by phenotype, with HP22 reported to have reduced overall Hb affinity (Langlois & Delanghe, 1996), less efficient antioxidative capacity, (Langlois & Delanghe, 1996; Melamed‐Frank et al, 2001) and reduced clearance rates of HP2‐Hb complexes by macrophages (Asleh et al, 2003). This is suggested to result in increased nitric oxide scavenging by HP2‐Hb complexes (Azarov et al, 2008), with reduced downstream anti‐inflammatory signalling after macrophage endocytosis of HP2‐Hb complexes (Landis et al, 2013), weaker inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and a stronger angiogenic effect (Cid et al, 1993). There is strong evidence that the HP22 phenotype is associated with increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular events in diabetic patients (Vardi et al, 2012). Furthermore, several reports demonstrate an association between the HP✱2 allele with vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage; as determined by high CBFv (Borsody et al, 2006), angiographically (Ohnishi et al, 2013), and in a mouse model (Chaichana et al, 2007). Vasospasm after sub‐arachnoid haemorrhage is thought to result from inflammation, oxidative stress, nitric oxide scavenging, leucocyte migration and endothelial‐leucocyte interactions (Chaichana et al, 2010), all from extracellular Hb. In HP22 mice with sub‐arachnoid haemorrhage, treatment with an anti‐oxidant (Froehler et al, 2010) or controlled nitric oxide (Momin et al, 2009) reduces vasospasm, which is supportive evidence that these mechanisms are important. The HP✱2 allele is also associated with increased severity and adverse outcomes in various infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV and malaria (Cox et al, 2007; McDermid & Prentice, 2006). Effects of HP phenotype on cerebrovascular outcomes in non‐diabetic patients, e.g. those with SCA, have not been reported.

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^1132b7pB]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Haptoglobin (HP) is an acute-phase protein and the main scavenger of cell-free hemoglobin. When HP is depleted, as observed in hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease (SCD), cell-free hemoglobin can lead to acute organ damage. The impact of the HP 1–1, 2–1, and 2–2 isoforms on HP and cell-free hemoglobin concentrations and SCD-related complications is unclear. In a longitudinal cohort of patients with SCD, the HP 1 allele was associated with higher HP and lower cell-free hemoglobin concentrations at a routine clinic visit as well as during hospitalization for a vaso-occlusive episode or acute chest syndrome. With a median follow-up of 6.8 years, acute chest syndrome occurred in 42% (n = 163) and multiorgan failure in 14% (n = 53) of 391 patients with SCD with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The HP 1 allele was independently associated with lower risk of developing multiorgan failure during acute chest syndrome (additive model hazard ratio, 0.5; P < .001). Future studies assessing the regulation of HP concentrations and ability to bind cell-free hemoglobin according to the HP genotype may help to identify patients with SCD at high risk for multiorgan failure and to guide interventions, such as rapid initiation of exchange transfusion or HP replacement therapy.

### Sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease: results of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 CADENZA trial [^11132wFg]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemolysis

Sutimlimab treatment led to rapid (within 1–3 weeks) control of hemolysis that was sustained throughout the study. Mean total bilirubin normalized within 1 to 3 weeks of sutimlimab and was maintained at levels below the upper limit of normal to week 26 (Figure 3A). Fifteen (88.2%) patients in the sutimlimab arm and 4 (22.2%) patients in the placebo arm achieved normal total bilirubin levels at treatment assessment timepoint. Mean (SE) change from baseline in total bilirubin at treatment assessment timepoint (excluding patients with positive/unknown Gilbert syndrome test result) was −22.1 µmol/L (2.5) in the sutimlimab arm and −1.8 µmol/L (3.3) in the placebo arm.

Figure 3.
Effect of sutimlimab on markers of hemolysis from baseline to week 26. (A) Analysis of the change from baseline in bilirubin excluded patients with either a positive Gilbert syndrome genetic test or no test result. Overall, 21 of 22 patients in the sutimlimab arm and 18 of 20 patients in the placebo arm consented to receive Gilbert syndrome testing. Of these, no patient had a positive result, and 1 patient had unknown result and was excluded from the analyses. The normal range for bilirubin was defined as 5.1 to 20.5 µmol/L. (B) Normalization of haptoglobin was defined as greater than the level of haptoglobin detection. (C) Parameters for reticulocyte normalization were not defined for this study. (D) The normal range for LDH was defined as 120 to 246 U/L. B, baseline.

Similar results were obtained for additional markers of hemolysis (Figure 3B-D). Eleven (57.9%) patients in the sutimlimab arm and 6 (30.0%) patients in the placebo arm achieved normalized LDH levels at treatment assessment timepoint. A decrease in reticulocyte count coincided with the increased Hb level in sutimlimab-treated patients; reductions in reticulocyte count were not observed in placebo-treated patients. In the sutimlimab arm, an increase in the haptoglobin level corresponded to a decrease in the bilirubin level, whereas no change occurred in the placebo arm. Twelve (63.2%) patients in the sutimlimab arm and 3 (15.0%) patients in the placebo arm achieved normalized haptoglobin levels at treatment assessment timepoint.

### Hemolysis and free hemoglobin revisited: exploring hemoglobin and hemin scavengers as a novel class of therapeutic proteins [^114Z5kwM]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Hemolysis occurs in many hematologic and nonhematologic diseases. Extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) has been found to trigger specific pathophysiologies that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with hemolysis, such as acute and chronic vascular disease, inflammation, thrombosis, and renal impairment. Among the molecular characteristics of extracellular Hb, translocation of the molecule into the extravascular space, oxidative and nitric oxide reactions, hemin release, and molecular signaling effects of hemin appear to be the most critical. Limited clinical experience with a plasma-derived haptoglobin (Hp) product in Japan and more recent preclinical animal studies suggest that the natural Hb and the hemin-scavenger proteins Hp and hemopexin have a strong potential to neutralize the adverse physiologic effects of Hb and hemin. This includes conditions that are as diverse as RBC transfusion, sickle cell disease, sepsis, and extracorporeal circulation. This perspective reviews the principal mechanisms of Hb and hemin toxicity in different disease states, updates how the natural scavengers efficiently control these toxic moieties, and explores critical issues in the development of human plasma-derived Hp and hemopexin as therapeutics for patients with excessive intravascular hemolysis.

### Lactate dehydrogenase to carboxyhemoglobin ratio as a biomarker of heme release to heme processing is associated with higher tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and early death in sickle cell disease [^1157X4JA]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

One limitation of our study is the presentation of HbCO values in relation to other hemolytic parameters in two cohorts that differ in regard to patient selection and size. The EACO cohort (A) was prospective and smaller; and, the HbCO cohort (B) was larger but retrospective and, therefore, may be biased toward a more acutely or chronically affected subpopulation for whom HbCO data were available. Altogether, HbCO results must be considered exploratory and in need of additional validation. The results here do not invalidate previously published correlations of serum LDH from larger studies with greater statistical power. Our new results highlight the potentially greater strength of the LDH/HbCO ratio.

In conclusion, a ratio of two readily available clinical laboratory markers, LDH and HbCO, representative of the intravascular fraction of total hemolytic rate, is promising as biomarker in SCD. Increased LDH/HbCO ratios are strongly associated with increased risk on pulmonary hypertension, the pathophysiologic complication of intravascular hemolysis, and all‐cause mortality. And thereby may add to individual risk prediction in SCD patients. We suggest inclusion of these markers in future prospective trials in SCD for validation.

### Hemolytic anemia associated with intravenous immunoglobulin in Kawasaki disease [^1111v1x3]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with hemolytic anemia in KD

KD Kawasaki disease, WBC white blood cell count, ANC absolute neutrophil count, CRP C-reactive protein, AST aspartate aminotransferase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, NT pro-BNP nitrogen terminal, pro b-type natriuretic peptide, Hb hemoglobin, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, Indirect bilirubin (mg/dL) *, Indirect bilirubin blood level in follow-up, MP methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for consecutive three days, PD prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day

All patients received initial treatment for KD with 10% IVIG. They received a second dose of IVIG because their fever persisted for 36 h after completion of the IVIG infusion. Patients 2 and 5 became afebrile after the second dose of IVIG, and the remaining patients required further treatment. Patients 3 and 6 received pulse therapy with methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days, patient 1 received methylprednisolone at 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and patients 4 and 5 received oral steroids at 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days as an adjunct treatment for KD. The choice of adjunctive therapy was based on the judgment of the clinician. Serum haptoglobin levels in our patients were variable, and haptoglobin is not always decreased in IVIG-related hemolysis; it is an acute phase reactant and may be increased in the presence of inflammatory conditions. When adjusted for hemoglobin levels, patients 2, 6, and 7 appear to have normal/near normal reticulocyte counts. The reason for this is not clear, but it is possible that the compensatory activity of the bone marrow does not reach an adequate level in KD due to immunological reasons.

### Haptoglobin levels are associated with haptoglobin genotype and alpha +-thalassemia in a malaria-endemic area [^111PRt3r]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acute phase protein that removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis. Hp has also been shown to be toxic for malaria parasites. alpha(+)-Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that results in subclinical hemolytic anemia. alpha(+)-Thassemia homozygosity confers protection against severe malarial disease by an as yet unidentified mechanism. Hp levels were measured in a serial cross-sectional survey of children in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Hp levels were related to age, Hp genotype, Hb levels, parasitemia, splenomegaly, and alpha(+)-thalassemia genotype. Surprisingly, children who were homozygous for alpha(+) -thalassemia had significantly higher levels of Hp than did heterozygotes, after controlling for relevant confounders. We suggest that this is the result of either reduced mean cell Hb associated with alpha(+) -thalassemia homozygosity or an elevated IL-6-dependent acute phase response.

### Evaluation of hemolysis in patients supported with impella 5.5: a single center experience [^1167p8Wn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolysis, defined as the lysis of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), is associated with mortality and poor outcomes. A low level of hemolysis exists by default in patients on mechanical circulatory support (MCS) when mechanical injury is incurred to RBCs, with causative factors comprised of shear stress, flow acceleration, and RBC contact with device surfaces. There is no universally accepted algorithm or definition to establish clinically significant hemolysis in the setting of MCS. Furthermore, hemolysis is particularly understudied in percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).

Studies and guidelines have previously used various laboratory markers in attempts to define hemolysis, which include plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, bilirubin, and hemoglobinuria. Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) guidelines have suggested that PfHb > 20 and LDH > 2.5 times the normal value are indicative of hemolysis. Other studies have suggested that a slightly higher level of PfHb (> 40), with the addition of either LDH > 2.5 times normal, hemoglobinuria, or clinical signs such as anemia in the absence of active bleeding or renal failure would appropriately define hemolysis on MCS. Of note, LDH, also an inflammatory marker, is known to be nonspecific and has been thought to be an unreliable definer of hemolysis.

In recent years, certain characteristics that could contribute to hemolytic events in percutaneous devices have been recognized, for example pump malfunction or thrombosis, positional problems (triggering "suction alarms"), and insufficient preload. A consensus statement of the MCS academic research consortium published in 2020 categorized hemolytic events into "major" and "minor", using some of these abovementioned mechanical characteristics but still employing the previous INTERMACS reported PfHb level > 20 or LDH > 2.5x normal as a qualifying criteria for an "adverse event".

One study, with hemolysis defined as PfHb > 40, aimed to examine the predictive value of these INTERMACS markers among cardiogenic shock patients receiving an Impella device (a percutaneous LVAD manufactured by Abiomed, Danvers, MA) and found that while an increase in delta PfHb was highly predictive of hemolysis, an increase in delta LDH was not. Of note, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved study protocol definitions of hemolysis for percutaneous MCS devices have specifically required PfHb > 40 to be recorded at two different points in time.

### When you think you should transfuse… don't! [^115huWZ8]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. Admission laboratory test results were hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL, platelet count 287,000/μL, and white blood cell count 25,200/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 898 U/L, haptoglobin was markedly decreased (< 31 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin was elevated (5.3 mg/dL), and the absolute reticulocyte count was low at 0.0050/μL. A sample was sent to the immunohematology reference laboratory. The direct antiglobulin test immunoglobulin G was negative; C3 was 1+. All cells were reactive at immediate spin phase, indirect antiglobulin testing (IAT) with polyethylene glycol, with low ionic strength saline, neat, prewarm, and in the solid phase. All cells were nonreactive at IAT-ficin. Additional testing included a cold antibody titer that was 1:4096 and thermal amplitude studies demonstrating reactivity of 2+ at 37°C. These results were consistent with a clinically significant anti-Pr and cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Although rituximab is effective in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, this may take weeks. The patient was treated with pegcetacoplan, a pegylated peptide that targets C3 inhibiting hemolysis. The patient was discharged on day 29 with a hemoglobin of 8 g/dL.

### Primaquine-induced severe hemolysis in the absence of concomitant malaria: effects on G6PD activity and renal function [^11346nZB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
The patient's urine on the day of presentation to hospital (sixth day of primaquine prophylaxis).

On the day of presentation, the patient's hemoglobin was 88 g/L (reference range: 135–185 g/L), hematocrit 0.26 (0.4–0.54), and mean cell volume 96 fL (78–100 fL). Microcytic spherocytes, bite cells, and polychromasia were noted on blood film. Serial microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests for P. falciparum and common Plasmodium antigens were negative. Unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated (97 µmol/L [0–19 µmol/L] and 781 U/L [120–250 U/L], respectively), and haptoglobin was subnormal (< 0.10 g/L [0.36–1.95 g/L]). A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Spectrophotometry confirmed deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (2.2 U/g Hb; reference range: 5.0–13.0 U/g Hb), and hemoglobin electrophoresis did not show any concomitant hemoglobinopathies. Plasma cell-free hemoglobin concentration was elevated (120,004 ng/mL [< 50,000 ng/mL]). He had albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 7.4 [< 2.5]), increased urinary glycocalyx metabolite excretion (11.16 total glycosaminoglycans/mol creatinine)and markedly elevated urinary beta-2-microglobulin (40,019 µg/L; normal range < 300). Plasma creatinine and urea were normal (66 µmol/L [60–110 µmol/L] and 7.0 mmol/L [3.0–7.5 mmol/L], respectively).

### Haptoglobin 1 allele predicts higher serum haptoglobin concentration and lower multiorgan failure risk in sickle cell disease [^114toHTx]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations of our study include only capturing VOE and acute chest syndrome events at our institution and the relatively small sample size. The small sample size limits our ability to perform subgroup analyses, such as the effects of the HP genotype on clinical outcomes in the different SCD genotypes. We expanded our protocol to collect biosamples in hospitalized patients with SCD after September 2020, resulting in a smaller number of biosamples collected during an acute chest syndrome event. Another limitation of our study is that circulating concentrations of HP and cell-free hemoglobin are dynamic, and we used single time points for steady-state, VOE, and acute chest syndrome episodes. Although our findings demonstrate that the HP genotype is associated with concentrations of HP in circulation at steady state and during hospitalization, functional differences in cell-free hemoglobin scavenging and HP-hemoglobin complex clearance by the HP genotype are also plausible. Future studies investigating the regulation of HP concentrations and scavenging function based on the HP genotype and serially measuring HP concentrations during hospitalization for VOE or acute chest syndrome may contribute to identifying patients with SCD for aggressive measures, such as rapid initiation of red blood cell exchange transfusions or exogenous administration of HP.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^111v63C9]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the absence of a placebo response for LDH has previously been demonstrated in this patient population, this proof-of-concept study was designed as a nonplacebo-controlled trial. Iptacopan monotherapy in anti-C5 naive PNH patients with active hemolysis resulted in a rapid and durable reduction of hemolytic markers, including LDH, bilirubin, reticulocytes, and haptoglobin, as well as C3 fragment deposition on RBCs, resulting in stabilization and a dramatic increase in the proportion of PNH-type RBC. Consistently, a more gradual but clinically meaningful and durable increase in Hb levels was observed in most patients, with all but 1 remaining transfusion-free from the start of iptacopan treatment until the data cutoff. These results complement data from a previous phase 2 study in adult PNH patients with persistent hemolysis despite ongoing treatment with eculizumab, where iptacopan add-on resulted in similar hematological improvements that persisted even when eculizumab was discontinued. Together, both studies provide evidence that complement inhibition with iptacopan effectively controls both intra- and extravascular hemolysis and leads to significant, transfusion-free improvement in Hb levels in most patients with PNH. These findings are consistent with results from clinical trials of other proximal complement inhibitors, including pegcetacoplan and the factor D inhibitors, danicopanand BCX9930, which have demonstrated similar inhibition of both intra- and extravascular hemolysis.

Consistent with the previous phase 2 study findings, iptacopan treatment was safe and well-tolerated. Up until the data cutoff, no serious nor severe AEs, including none of infectious nature, were reported, and the majority of AEs suspected by the investigator to be drug-related, affecting roughly one-third of the patients, were transient and of mild intensity. Two patients discontinued iptacopan treatment, 1 due to nonsevere, though suspected-to-be-related headache after 2 days of dosing, the other by patient preference and upon physician decision. Importantly, up until the data cutoff for this interim analysis, no thromboembolic events or breakthrough hemolysis were reported. The absence of significant breakthrough hemolysis to date is particularly notable considering the significant increase in PNH clone size achieved with iptacopan treatment, although this observation remains to be confirmed with more patients, longer-term data, and upon the occurrence of complement-amplifying conditions such as surgical interventions or severe infections.

Acute MCS hemolysis — surveillance and escalation: Patients with acute MCS should be monitored and treated for hemolysis (see text for device specifics); Hemolysis surveillance - monitor markers of hemolysis (LDH, plasma free Hgb, haptoglobin, bilirubin, urine color change, hematocrit decrease), and if hemolysis cannot be controlled, device removal should be considered.

### Thrombocytopenia and anemia after cardiac surgery [^117CbpMg]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A falling hemoglobin value in a postoperative patient always raises concern regarding bleeding, either from wound sites or bleeding potentially related to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Indeed, bleeding is a not uncommon complication of anticoagulant therapy for HIT. Evaluation of anticoagulant drug levels can be appropriate. In this case, the apparent stable left groin/thigh hematoma (likely indicating early postoperative bleeding), as well as the clear onset of progressive anemia that began at POD7, also raise the issue of possible immune‐mediated hemolysis, for example, secondary to alloantibodies formed in relation to the 6 units of RBCs transfused, or perhaps to drug‐dependent immune hemolysis (e.g. ciprofloxacin).

Peripheral blood examination showed polychromasia, normoblastemia, and spherocytosis. The absolute reticulocyte count was markedly elevated at 500 × 10 9 /L (RR, 10–86), with free serum hemoglobin and reduced haptoglobin; her direct antiglobulin test was positive (both for IgG and C3); elution studies showed anti‐Jk b coating her red cells. Her serum contained both anti‐Jk b and anti‐S alloantibodies. Total bilirubin levels were elevated (total bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL [RR, 0.3–1.0]), with the majority (2.2 mg/dL) representing unconjugated bilirubin. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level on POD16 was 840 U/L (RR, 100–220). Further history showed no remote transfusion history, but the patient had borne several children.

### U2AF1 and EZH2 mutations are associated with nonimmune hemolytic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes [^113ctQMS]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Hemolysis is a well-recognized but poorly characterized phenomenon in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Its pathobiological basis seems to underpin a nonimmune etiology whose clinical significance has not been adequately characterized. Hemolysis in MDS is often attributed to either ineffective intramedullary erythropoiesis or acquired hemoglobinopathies and red blood cell (RBC) membrane defects. These heterogeneous processes have not been associated with specific genetic subsets of the disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of hemolysis among patients with MDS, their baseline characteristics, molecular features, and resulting impact on outcomes. We considered baseline serum haptoglobin < 10 mg/dL a surrogate marker for intravascular hemolysis. Among 519 patients, 10% had hemolysis. The baseline characteristics were similar among both groups. Only 13% of patients with hemolysis were Coombs-positive, suggesting that hemolysis in MDS is largely not immune-mediated. Inferior survival trends were observed among lower-risk patients with MDS undergoing hemolysis. Decreased response rates to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and higher responses to hypomethylating agents (HMA) were also observed in the hemolysis group. U2AF1 and EZH2 hotspot mutations were more prevalent among those undergoing hemolysis (P < .05). U2AF1 mutations were observed in 30% of patients with hemolysis and occurred almost exclusively at the S34 hotspot. Somatic mutations encoding splicing factors may affect erythrocyte membrane components, biochemical properties, and RBC metabolic function, which underpin the development of atypical clones from erythroid precursors in MDS presenting with hemolysis. Future studies will explore the contribution of altered splicing to the development of acquired hemoglobinopathies.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^113UDw1m]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Investigations

At the time of referral, blood tests showed Hb 12.2 g/dL (11.5–16.0 g/dL), haematocrit 0.354 (0.370–0.470), mean cell volume 86.6 fL (78.0–100.0 fL), red cell distribution width (RDW) 17.2% (11%–16%), reticulocytes 488×10 (10–100×10) with a reticulocyte percentage of 11.9%. MCHC had previously been elevated, but at time of referral was 345 g/L (310–350 g/L). Urea and electrolytes were unremarkable. Liver enzymes were normal, but total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 22 μmol/L (0–21 μmol/L). Folate had been low in the past, but at the time of referral measured 3.6 μg/L (3.1–20.5 μg/L).

The haemolysis screen was positive: haptoglobin < 0.08 g/L (0.40–1.60 g/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 277 U/L (125–243 U/L). Direct Coombs test was negative.

The peripheral blood film showed numerous spherocytes and marked polychromasia.

Elevated morning glucose results had been recorded on a number of occasions, for over 2 years prior to diagnosis of diabetes: 6.3–8.3 mmol/L (reference range 3.3–6.0 mmol/L).

HbA1c had been measured multiple times in the preceding 3 years. It had been as low as 11 mmol/mol in 2015, and was 19 mmol/mol (20–41 mmol/mol) at the time of referral.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed splenomegaly of 14.5 cm.

A blood sample was sent to Sheffield Children's Hospital in a potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) container, and subjected to the eosin-5-maleimide binding test. A fluorescence ratio of 0.69 was recorded (ratio consistent with a diagnosis of HS < 0.85).

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Immunotherapy-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113S6Jk8]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Immunotherapy has been widely used in the treatment of several solid and hematologic malignancies. Checkpoint inhibitors have been the forefront of cancer immunotherapy in recent years. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway are the prototypic checkpoint targets for immunotherapy. When combined, CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors work synergistically, but with increased probability of toxicity. The following case represents an unusual adverse effect of combined treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab used for treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma presented with severe generalized weakness and fatigue. She has received two cycles of ipilimumab and nivolumab, last administered 3 weeks prior to her presentation. Initial investigations revealed severe anemia with appropriate reticulocytosis, severely elevated lactate dehydrogenase, undetectable haptoglobin level and positive direct coombs test. Patient was diagnosed with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia secondary to ipilimumab and nivolumab. She was successfully treated with high dose steroids and rituximab.

Conclusions

In our case, we present a rare but serious adverse effect of immunotherapy. We illustrate the clinical presentation and management of immunotherapy associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many malignant conditions; therefore, it is imperative for health care professionals caring for cancer patient to be familiar with the adverse effects of immunotherapy, which allow for early recognition and management of these potentially lethal side effects.

### Haptoglobin, α-thalassaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polymorphisms and risk of abnormal transcranial Doppler among patients with sickle cell anaemia in tanzania [^112BF6RL]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

It is unlikely that the lack of an effect of the HP✱2 allele was due to a type II error as a result of a lack of power, as evidenced by our adequate sample size of 83 HP22 and 103 HP11 compared to our sample size estimate of 90 per group to detect an effect equivalent to half a standard deviation (SD) in CBF v. Thus although there was a probable increased variance in our data due to different observers between survey years, a similar effect size was observed for alpha‐thalassaemia in this study (α‐/α‐ (N = 94) vs. αα/αα (N = 258), β‐coefficient −16.14 cm/s = 0.4 SD of CBFv). However, the 95% CIs of the observed effect of HP22 did just include the effect size in the sample size calculation (−15.3 cm/s vs. 0.5 × SD = 20.9). Thus, it remains a possibility that small effects of the HP✱2 allele exist, reducing risk of either both or the lower extremes of CBF v, not captured in the multinomial logistic model, which was not included in pre‐study sample size calculations. Thus despite the strong evidence for a mechanism whereby the HP22 variant could be expected to increase vascular activation and vasoconstriction in the inflammatory and haemolytic condition of SCA, our data does not support this suggestion. An explanation for this could be that HP is overwhelmed in SCA, such that phenotypic variations in its functions cease to be relevant. This scenario is supported by our observation that during well, steady‐state clinic visits, HP levels were non‐detectable in 96% of our patients (lower limit of detection = 0.04 g/l, N = 838) compared to 17% of non‐SCA controls and not affected by genotype (S. E. Cox, J. Makani & A. M. Prentice, unpublished data). A possible alternative explanation is that in HP22 individuals the haem‐oxygenase‐1 compensatory pathway may be more successfully up‐regulated in response to haem exposure, demonstrated to have powerful anti‐inflammatory and anti‐stasis effects (Jison et al, 2004; Belcher et al, 2006).

### Cellular and biochemical heterogeneity contributes to the phenotypic diversity of transfusion-dependent î ²-thalassemia [^1133Zgbp]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Control concentrations of larger than normal EVs are present in thalassemic plasma

Slightly increased mean platelet (PLT) count (supplemental Table 1) and clotting times (Figure 1 D) were measured compared with control. Fibrinogen, D-dimers, antithrombin III, coagulation factors, protein S, and ADAMTS-13 exhibited normal concentration and/or activity, whereas protein C activity was slightly reduced (supplemental Table 2). Normal mean concentration of small EVs (sEVs) was measured in plasma (Figure 1 E) that correlated with splenectomy, leukocyte count (r = 0.643; P < .01), and plasma dimethyl — arginine (r = −0.506; P < .01). Of note, TDT sEVs were of higher average diameter than control (165.8 ± 54.1 vs 121.9 ± 26.5 nm; Figure 1 F) and exhibited inverse correlation to plasma levels of normetanephrine (r = −0.533). Moreover, TDT EVs were not more procoagulant than control (Figure 1 G). Markers of endothelium dysfunction (thrombomodulin and ET-1) were also normal (supplemental Table 2).

TDT RBCs are highly susceptible to oxidative insults and exhibit diminished proteolytic proteasome activity

TDT plasma exhibited slightly elevated cell-free Hb (Figure 1 H), consistent with the lactate dehydrogenase levels (supplemental Table 2). Erythropoietic activity correlated with cell-free Hb and plasma haptoglobin (supplemental Figure 2), as previously reported.TDT RBCs were resistant to osmotic stress (Figure 1 I). Osmotic hemolysis was inversely linked to erythropoietic activity (Figure 1 J) and influenced by PS exposure and plasma antioxidant capacity (supplemental Figure 3; ANCOVA, P < .05). Mechanical hemolysis was within the control range (supplemental Figure 2); however, TDT RBCs were susceptible to oxidant-induced hemolysis (Figure 1 K). Low levels of chymotrypsin- and caspase-specific PPA (Figure 1 L; but not trypsin-specific; supplemental Figure 4) were found in TDT RBC cytosol, whereas membrane-associated PPA was normal. Multivariate analysis linked cytosolic and membrane PPA to mechanical (positive) and osmotic (negative) hemolysis (supplemental Figure 3). High PS exposure was detected on RBCs, which exhibited significant intragroup variation (Figure 1 M) and positive correlations with the monocyte (r = 0.504; P < .01) and reticulocyte counts (r = 0.574; P < .01).

### Hemolysis after oral artemisinin combination therapy for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria [^116CtYr9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of delayed hemolysis 2–6 weeks after treatment of severe malaria with intravenous artesunate have been described. We performed a prospective observational study of patients with uncomplicated malaria to investigate whether posttreatment hemolysis also occurs after oral artemisinin-based combination therapy. Eight of 20 patients with uncomplicated malaria who were given oral artemisinin-based combination therapy met the definition of posttreatment hemolysis (low haptoglobin level and increased lactate dehydrogenase level on day 14). Five patients had hemolysis persisting for 1 month. Patients with posttreatment hemolysis had a median decrease in hemoglobin level of 1.3 g/dL (interquartile range 0.3–2.0 g/dL) in the posttreatment period, and patients without posttreatment hemolysis had a median increase of 0.3 g/dL (IQR -0.1 to 0.7 g/dL; p = 0.002). These findings indicate a need for increased vigilance for hemolytic events in malaria patients, particularly those with predisposing factors for anemia.

### Effect of percutaneous paravalvular leak closure on hemolysis [^111zkev3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study the effect of percutaneous paravalvular leak closure on hemolysis.

Background

Although transcatheter PVL closure reduces heart failure and mortality in symptomatic patients with paravalvular leaks (PVL), little is known about its effect on hemolysis.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing transcatheter mitral or aortic PVL closure (January 2005-December 2016) at Mayo Clinic. Patients with anemia or abnormal hemolysis markers (LDH, haptoglobin) were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was defined as hemoglobin increase ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, decrease in LDH above median or improvement in haptoglobin. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression modeling were used to determine predictors of successful treatment of hemolysis.

Results

Final study population included 168 patients (130 [77%] mitral, 38 [23%] aortic PVL). Primary outcome occurred in 70 patients (42%). Hemoglobin increased by 1.74 ± 1.69mg/dL in patients who reached primary outcome. 57/168 (34%) patients required blood transfusion prior to PVL closure compared to 35/168 (21%) postprocedure. The mean reduction in LDH was 403U/L. Multivariate regression showed that patients with mechanical valves were more likely to have successful outcome (P = 0.044).

Conclusion

Percutaneous PVL closure is associated with modest improvement in hemolysis markers, increase in hemoglobin levels and reduction in blood transfusion requirements. This benefit is most significant in patients with mechanical valves.

Pump thrombosis (PT) in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients — epidemiology, indicators, and management: Symptoms of hemolysis include scleral icterus, dark urine (hemoglobinuria), and fatigue with laboratory signs of elevated LDH, elevated plasma free hemoglobin, and low haptoglobin; adult PT rates are 4–8% in HeartMate II and HeartWare and 1% in the HM3 device, while pediatric continuous-flow VAD patients have PT in 11% - 46% with the largest series reporting 15%; management has largely been based on expert opinion with algorithms including augmentation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, thrombolytic therapy, and surgical strategies (pump exchange, heart transplant, or explantation); in pediatrics, heparin or Bivalirubin with rising LDH may be initiated, and if no response, low dose systemic tPA could be considered if no contraindications exist, with pump exchange considered when tPA is contraindicated, progressive, or unresponsive, and in some institutions pump exchange occurs without a trial of tPA.

Special situations

Pregnancy in pyruvate kinase deficiency

CASE: A 24-year old woman (gravida 1, parity 0) with a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to menorrhagia (hemoglobin 9.5–11.0 g/dL) and a clinical diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome presents in the 12th week of pregnancy with anemia and profound fatigue. On evaluation, physical examination is remarkable only for mild pallor and jaundice and a palpable spleen tip. Laboratory testing demonstrates hemoglobin 8.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 99 fL, absolute reticulocyte count 225x109/L, haptoglobin < 20 mg/dL (reference range 30–200 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 267 U/L (reference range 135–214 U/L), negative direct antiglobulin testing, and unremarkable red cell morphology on a peripheral blood film. Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity was reduced (3.9 U/g Hb [11–15.6]) and genetic testing revealed the presence of two missense mutations: c.1456C > T (p. Arg486Trp) and c.994G > A (p. Gly332Ser). Other congenital and acquired hemolytic conditions were ruled out by normal osmotic fragility, eosin-5-maleimide binding, ektacytometry, erythrocyte membrane protein content, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and CD55/59 antigen expression. During pregnancy the patient was closely followed by hematology and obstetrics staff. Because of severe fatigue, she was given a total of 15 units of packed erythrocytes during pregnancy (on average, a transfusion every 2 weeks) and four additional units at the time of delivery because of postpartum bleeding complications. Following delivery of a preterm but healthy infant, the mother's anemia improved to a hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL.

### Anemia and transfusion requirements among Ugandan children with severe malaria treated with intravenous artesunate [^115enHUn]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Parenteral artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria in non-immune travelers is associated with late-onset hemolysis. In children in sub-Saharan Africa, the hematologic effects of malaria and artesunate are less well documented. Here we report a prospective case series of 91 children with severe malaria treated with parenteral artesunate, managed at a resource-poor hospital in Africa, with longitudinal data on hemoglobin (Hb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and erythrocyte morphology. The median (range) age was 2 (1–8) years and 43 (47%) were female. The median (IQR) admission Hb level was 69 (55–78) g/L and 20 patients (22%) had severe malarial anemia (Hb < 50g/L). During hospitalization, 69 patients (76%) received one or more blood transfusions. Fatal outcome in 8 patients was associated with severe anemia in 6/8 cases. Follow-up Hb measurement was performed on 35 patients (38%) at day 14 after initial hospital admission; the remaining patients had no clinical evidence of anemia at the follow-up visit. The convalescent Hb was median (range) 90 (60–138) g/L, which was significantly higher than the paired admission levels (median increase +28g/L, p < .001). Evidence of hemolysis (elevated LDH and low haptoglobin) was common at admission and improved by day 14. No patient met the standardized definition of post-artemisinin delayed hemolysis (PADH). In this cohort of young children with severe malaria treated with artesunate, anemia was common at admission, required one or more transfusions in a majority of patients, and markers of hemolysis had normalized by day 14.

### Atypical presentation of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in a child with genetically confirmed susceptibility to C3-glomerulopathy: a case report and brief review of the literature [^114oAktA]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is an interesting case that highlights the difficulty of classifying and diagnosing atypical types of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis at onset, as all may share similar pathomorphological features. In our case, the patient presented with nephritic nephrotic syndrome, while having a positive ASOT titre and low C3 and C4 levels, signs highly suggestive of PSGN.

However, during her stay she developed progressively severe direct Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is definitely an unexpected finding in typical PSGN cases. Her Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) did not detect anti-IgG antibodies but demonstrated concurrent activation of C3b and C3d, as illustrated in Table 1, thereby supporting the clinical suspicion of cold-autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA). Upon admission, her haptoglobin level was unexpectedly elevated, measuring 280 mg/dL with concomitant increase of her LDH titer. It is well established that in hemolytic anemia, haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin and is subsequently consumed. Additionally, haptoglobin represents also an acute-phase protein, with production increasing during active inflammation. Of note, our patient presented with an acute bacterial infection with concomitant elevated inflammatory markers. It is therefore plausible that the acute inflammatory response may have masked the expected reduction in haptoglobin levels in view of her AIHA. Moreover, it is well established, that these antibodies could activate the classical complement pathway [t is]. In the present case, this mechanism is notably supported by the significantly reduced C4 level observed upon admission. Of note, according to the current literature, the combination of PIGN and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is considered extremely rare with only a few cases being reported to date. Specifically, Greenbaum et al. described three PSGN paediatric cases characterized by AIHA with concomitant elevated anti-I antibody titers, while Inoue et al. suggested streptococcal enzymes like NAPlr and neuraminidase as potential triggers via molecular mimicry.

### Vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory action of unbound haemoglobin, haem and iron in transfusion-dependent patients with haemolytic anaemias [^111g67dW]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood diseases such as sickle cell disease (SCD), β‐thalassaemia (β‐thal) and hereditary spherocytosis (SPH) are hallmarked by haemolysis, leading to cell‐free haemoglobin (Hb) release in the circulation. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Mechanistically haemolysis can be extra‐ or intra‐vascular. While extra‐vascular haemolysis involves red blood cell (RBC) phagocytosis by hepatic and splenic macrophages of the reticulo‐endothelial system, and accounts for most haemolytic events in β‐thal and hereditary SPH, intravascular haemolysis occurs in the form of erythrocyte destruction within the blood vessel lumen and accounts for one‐third of the haemolytic process in SCD. 5

Previous work showed that circulating free Hb levels are increased in these diseases and haptoglobin (Hp), the Hb scavenger is reduced. Hp is part of a detoxification system in mammals that scavenges haemolysis by‐products in the circulation and promotes intracellular metabolism. 1, 2, 9 This detoxification system also includes the haem scavenger haemopexin (Hx) and the cellular enzymes haem‐oxygenases (HO‐1 and ‐2). 9, 10 Hp and Hx, by binding with high affinity Hb and haem, respectively, deliver Hb to macrophages and haem to hepatocytes, thus preventing their pro‐oxidant action in the circulation and non‐specific uptake in non‐target cells. 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Within cells, HOs degrade the haem porphyrin into iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, thus exerting primary anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant and anti‐apoptotic effects. 10, 16, 17, 18, 19 Once iron is released, the ferritin heavy chain (H‐Ferritin) oxidises ferrous iron (Fe 2+) to catalytically inactive ferric iron (Fe 3+) through its ferroxidase activity and allows iron storage inside ferritin light chain (L‐Ferritin). 20, 21, 22 Due to a high rate of haemolysis, haem detoxification systems are often saturated in haemolytic diseases. 1, 11, 23, 24, 25 While Hp is used as a clinical marker for haemolysis and its reduction in SCD, β‐thal and SPH is known; the modulation and comparison of haem‐related parameters across different haemolytic diseases is less clear.

### Delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with travel-associated severe malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013 [^111BnKx1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Nadir and last hemoglobin levels for 78 patients in a prospective analysis of delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with severe imported malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013. Gray dots, hemoglobin level for patients with the postartesunate delayed-onset hemolysis (PADH) pattern of anemia; black dots, hemoglobin level for patients with non-PADH pattern of anemia, indeterminate pattern and nonanemic patients. Dotted lines represent hemoglobin level thresholds of 8 or 7 g/dL.

With the exception of hemoglobin level, no parameters were significantly associated with a particular anemia pattern (Table 2; Technical Appendix Table 2); median hemoglobin levels at day 0 were estimated to be 11.3 g/dL (Q1–Q3: 9.6–13.1) and 13.6 g/dL (Q1–Q3: 11.6–15.4), respectively, for patients with non-PADH and PADH anemia (p = 0.002) (Tables 2, 3). The incidence of the PADH anemia did not differ between patients who received artesunate as first-line treatment and those who received quinine before being switched to artesunate (p = 0.38, Fisher exact test). During week 2, the rise in LDH levels and the drop in haptoglobin levels were consistent with hemolytic anemia in the PADH group (Figure 3); these changes lasted ≈1–2 weeks. Median LDH levels remained high at days 21 (724 IU/L [range 344–1,564] and 28 (497 IU/L [range 177–922]). Haptoglobin remained undetectable during weeks 2 and 3 (Table 3; Figure 3). During subsequent weeks, hemoglobin levels rose slowly in the non-PADH group (Table 3). Maximum reticulocyte production occurred during weeks 2 and 3 for the non-PADH and PADH groups, respectively (Figure 3; Table 3). At day 28, patients in both groups had hemoglobin levels > 11 g/dL.

### Hemolysis induced by pulsed-field ablation of atrial arrhythmias: a comparative analysis of current systems [^114SfTwt]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

When adjusting for the number of PFA applications, thereby accounting for the differences of the ablation procedures, the difference between the systems became more pronounced, with a significant difference also emerging between the VLCC and PSC systems. The VLCC system resulted in higher hemolysis per application, although this effect was counterbalanced at the procedural level by requiring fewer applications for successful PVI compared to the PSC. De Smet et al. previously reported a comparable reduction in haptoglobin levels, with both systems demonstrating a similar level of hemolysis at the procedural level, whether using the VLCC or the PSC.

Additionally, we confirmed the dose‐dependent relationship between hemolysis and the number of applications observed in previous studies for single‐shot catheters and extended this finding to focal ablation catheters. In all three systems, haptoglobin levels declined with increasing numbers of applications. However, this correlation was statistically significant only for the PSC system, likely due to the small sample size and the relatively low hemolysis induced by the LTFC. Previous studies have clearly shown that hemolysis is a class effect of PFA, but the degree of hemolysis is determined by the electric field intensity, which varies among catheters and is not publicly disclosed by manufacturers. Additionally, factors such as the number of PFA applications and catheter‐tissue contact are also important determinants. The larger and significant effect on haptoglobin levels per application observed with the PSC, compared to the other catheters, may result from a combination of these factors.

Haptoglobin was chosen for comparison as it is a well‐established marker of mild intravascular hemolysis. Its primary limitation is the inability to assess moderate to severe hemolysis, as it is entirely depleted in such cases. In contrast, bilirubin and LDH are commonly used as complementary markers. Since PFA generally causes only minor hemolysis, haptoglobin is particularly well‐suited for detecting these small changes. In addition, haptoglobin provides greater robustness compared to other indirect hemolysis markers such as LDH or bilirubin, since these parameters can be elevated due to inflammation or myocardial damage. Importantly, the inflammation induced by catheter ablation does not affect the specificity of haptoglobin for hemolysis. While the analysis of free hemoglobin and haptoglobin‐bound hemoglobin could offer a more precise assessment of hemolysis severity, practical constraints in a register‐based study limit its feasibility due to the rapid elimination of these complexes through binding and renal excretion. In vitro studies have demonstrated an inverse linear relationship between free hemoglobin and haptoglobin levels, supporting the quasi‐linear association inferred in this study.

### Published reports of delayed hemolytic anemia after treatment with artesunate for severe malaria – worldwide, 2010–2012 [^111i9wV3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

For all patients, hemolysis and worsening anemia were described after parasite clearance, 8–32 days after completion of artesunate therapy. The mean hemoglobin nadir was 6.2 g/dL (range: 4.4–8.6 g/dL) (n = 18). Other reported laboratory measurements supported the diagnosis of hemolysis including elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low or absent haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, and/or elevated reticulocyte count (n = 12). Twelve patients required transfusions, ranging from 2–24 units, after artesunate treatment. The hemolysis resolved, and hemoglobin improved in all patients within 4–8 weeks after artesunate therapy. Two patients had documented moderate anemia more than 30 days after treatment.

Two studies included information on patients with severe malaria both with and without delayed hemolysis. One reported that the six patients with hemolysis had received a higher mean cumulative dose of artesunate than the 19 patients without hemolysis (12.8 mg/kg versus 7.6 mg/kg). However, the mean cumulative dose in patients with hemolysis in the other article was 7.2 mg/kg, and no correlation between dose and hemolysis was observed. Although not specifically discussed, the reported parasitemia in the patients with delayed hemolysis was higher in both studies (mean parasitemia of 16% versus 11%, and median parasitemia of 27% versus 5%, respectively).

### Diagnostic challenges in DAT-negative autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [^114cmgYS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a rare, heterogeneous condition that poses diagnostic challenges, especially in direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative cases, where the absence of detectable autoantibodies complicates diagnosis. We report a case of a male patient in his late 60s diagnosed with a rare subtype of IgA-mediated, DAT-negative AIHA. The patient presented with painless jaundice, pruritus and laboratory evidence of haemolysis, including anaemia, reticulocytosis, elevated unconjugated bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase and decreased haptoglobins. Initial and repeated standard DATs were negative. Subsequent testing ruled out viral, autoimmune and malignancy-related causes. An extended DAT using alternative reagents for IgA and IgM confirmed an IgA-mediated AIHA. Further investigations later confirmed the diagnosis of an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder following detection of a clonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood. This case underscores the diagnostic complexity of AIHA and the value of a comprehensive diagnostic approach to finding cases of rare DAT-negative subtypes.

### Delayed-onset hemolytic anemia in patients with travel-associated severe malaria treated with artesunate, France, 2011–2013 [^115EKWzf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Case Definitions

Severe malaria was defined as malaria in persons with blood smears positive for asexual forms of Plasmodium falciparum parasites and at least 1 criterion of severity according to the definition of severe malaria used in France. Patients with mixed-species infections were excluded from analysis.

Anemia was defined as a blood hemoglobin level of < 12 g/dL in female and < 13 g/dL in male patients (reference values 12.0–16.5 and 13.0–17.5 g/dL, respectively). Hemolysis was defined as a plasma haptoglobin level of < 0.1 g/L (reference value 0.55–2.50 g/L), plasma lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level of > 390 IU/L (reference value 190–390 IU/L), or both. We defined 3 patterns of anemia as previously described: PADH, non-PADH, and indeterminate. The PADH pattern was defined by 1) a new drop in the hemoglobin level after day 8 of treatment initiation and the appearance or reappearance of hemolytic markers (> 10% drop in hemoglobin or > 10% rise in LDH levels) occurring any time between day 8 and the end of follow-up and/or 2) by any information in the medical chart referring to acute hemolysis occurring after day 8. The non-PADH pattern was defined by a hemoglobin nadir and a hemolysis peak occurring before day 8, with or without positive markers of hemolysis after day 8 and without a nadir or sudden drop of hemoglobin after day 8 as defined for the PADH pattern. The indeterminate pattern was defined as all other cases of anemia for which information was lacking or with an evolution pattern that did not fit the other patterns.

Sample Collection

Blood samples were routinely collected from the patients on days 0, 2 (± 1), 7 (± 2), 14 (± 3), 21 (± 3), and 28 (± 3) after treatment initiation. Samples were analyzed to determine the levels of hemoglobin, total bilirubin, glucose, plasma bicarbonate, lactate, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, LDH, haptoglobin, and parasitemia and the reticulocyte count.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy associated withinfection [^111uxorf]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) comprises a process of sequential endothelial damage, microvascular thrombosis, consumptive thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia that can affect several organs, including the kidney. A 36-year-old woman was presented with a petechial rash 3weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection. Laboratory results showed normocytic normochromic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and evidence of TMA with decreased haptoglobin, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and a peripheral blood smear with numerous schistocytes. Treatment included daily plasmapheresis and prednisolone, with favourable clinical evolution. Antibodies anti-ADAMTS13 were positive, establishing the diagnosis of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. There was also serological evidence of a recent infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and therefore the preceding respiratory tract infection by this agent was the most likely trigger for the disease. Due to the high mortality rate and poor outcomes, the prompt diagnostic and treatment are crucial in this rare disease. The identification of triggers related to this pathology can allow new therapeutic targets or preventive strategies.

The products of intravascular red cell lysis have shown to be of major importance in the pathophysiology of vasculopathy in SCD. Infusion of high dose hemoglobin or heme in SCD mice induces lethal vaso‐occlusive events. In contrast, low‐dose heme and subsequent induction of HO‐1 and production of the gasotransmitter CO is protective against vaso‐occlusion in SCD mice. Therefore, it is biologically plausible that the LDH/HbCO ratio, representing an increase in the amount of CO, as product of heme processing, relative to the amount of intravascular heme release, provides useful information on characterization of hemolysis in SCD and its vasculotoxicity.

Excess cell free hemoglobin and heme, not cleared from the circulation via scavenger proteins, are excreted in the urine. Indeed, hemoglobinuria is detectable in many patients with SCD, and associated with biomarkers of intravascular hemolysis. This urinary excretion of heme somewhat confounds the interpretation of CO release as an indication of total hemolysis. However, the amount of excreted heme is limited compared to total red cell turnover. Therefore, we consider that HbCO is generally reflective of the total amount of CO production due to adaptive heme catabolism.

Serum LDH has been the most widely used marker of intravascular hemolysis associated with catheterization‐proven pulmonary hypertension or elevated TRV in SCD cohorts. Elevated TRV in SCD was significantly associated with mortality in a recent meta‐analysis, but an inconsistent association was observed between LDH and mortality. Notably, the current cohort on whom we have CO, LDH and mortality data is a subset with less statistical power than some of the prior datasets. As such, this present study may be underpowered to replicate prior LDH‐mortality associations. Although all patients diagnosed with SCD were eligible for enrollment in these trials our cohort was enriched for SCD patients at risk for vasculopathic complications and/or early death. In this relatively small cohort, we show that the ratio of LDH to HbCO is superior to predict either elevated TRV or mortality as compared to LDH alone. These results suggest that the LDH/HbCO ratio may enhance the utility of LDH to identify patients at risk for vasculopathic complications and early death in SCD.

### Optimizing transfusion therapy for survivors of haemoglobin bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome: defining the targets for haemoglobin-H fraction and "functional" haemoglobin level [^112jtC8w]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Owing to the unique pathophysiology of anaemia in haemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis (HBHF), a transfusion strategy based on beta-thalassemia guidelines is suboptimal for chronically transfused HBHF patients. A more aggressive transfusion aimed at reducing the proportion of non-functional HbH and improving the "functional" haemoglobin (f-Hb) can lead to reduced haemolysis and improved tissue oxygenation. However, the optimal transfusion targets for these parameters are not yet defined. In this retrospective, longitudinal study on four chronically transfused patients with HBHF, we used receiver operating characteristic curves to find a pre-transfusion f-Hb of 106 g/l and a HbH of 16.1% to be the optimal thresholds to achieve a normal soluble transferrin receptor and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively.

### Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises [^111spiGw]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Microvessel occlusion, the main pathological process underlying the cardinal clinical manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is frequently termed as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or pain crisis. Since the description of SCD as a clinical entity nearly a century ago, investigations into the pathophysiology of VOC have been dynamic and manifold, leading to the delineation today of a complex process, encompassing interactions between sickle red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), endothelium, plasma proteins, and several other factors. Additionally, robust laboratory and animal data have further delineated the roles of hemolysis-related decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and endothelial activation in exacerbating the microvessel occlusive events of SCD.

Several lines of evidence suggest that SCD is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. In recent years there has been great interest in the role of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a stable plasma biomarker of low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation in predicting risk for cardiovascular disease in adults. In this study we evaluate a panel of biomarkers, including hs-CRP, that are representative of previously proposed mechanisms of microvessel occlusion-related clinical events in SCD for their associations with painful episodes in childhood SCD.

We have studied a cohort of children and adolescents with SCD at baseline, to ascertain if biomarker assessments done during the clinically silent 'steady state' condition correlate with hospitalization for pain, a signature clinical outcome of microvessel occlusion and indicator of sub-clinical disease burden. Key biomarkers from the panel included: total WBC Count and hs-CRP as markers of systemic global inflammatory activity; Haemoglobin (Hb), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as reflective of haemolytic status; fetal haemoglobin (HbF) level, an indicator of protection against VOC; soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (sVCAM1) and sP-selectin as indices of endothelial activation; prothrombin fragment F1.2, a marker of thrombin generation, and D-Dimer, a measure of fibrin formation and dissolution. Our aim is to measure these laboratory markers at baseline for an association with the clinical endpoint of acute VOC requiring hospitalization. Our goal is to add to the current state of knowledge regarding the clinical significance of laboratory biomarkers with respect to microvessel occlusive complications of SCD. Iterative validation of such laboratory biomarkers in the clinical setting would also result in establishing objective measures of the success or failure of novel interventions for these complications.

### Haptoglobin phenotypes in health and disorders [^112QGqum]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin is a positive acute phase protein that binds free hemoglobin and removes it from the circulation to prevent kidney injury, and iron lossfollowing hemolysis. Also, by bindingfree hemoglobin, haptoglobin functions as an antioxidant. In addition, haptoglobin acts as a potent immunosuppressor of lymphocyte function and modulates the helper T-cell type 1 and type 2 (Th1/Th2) balance within the body. Three major haptoglobin phenotypes are known to exist (Hp 1–1, Hp 2–1, and Hp 2–2). Hp 1–1 is biologically the most effective in binding free hemoglobin and suppressing inflammatory responses associated with free hemoglobin. Hp 2–2 is biologically the least active, and Hp 2–1 is moderately active. The possible association of allelic polymorphism of haptoglobin with various pathologic conditions such as coronary artery disease has been studied. This article reviews the known functions of haptoglobin and the present understanding of a possible association of haptoglobin phenotypes with pathogenesis of a number of human disorders.

Values represent mean ± SD. ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01; ✱✱✱ p < 0.001; ✱✱✱✱ p < 0.0001.

Furthermore, serum iron, Tf saturation and NTBI were highly elevated in β‐thal major and intermedia and, to a lower extent in SCD and SPH (Fig 2A–C, E –G; Figure S1). Patients with β‐thal major had the highest levels of serum iron, Tf saturation (average 80%) and NTBI, whereas patients with β‐thal intermedia and SCD had a more moderate Tf saturation (average 55–60%) and NTBI increase (Fig 2A–C). Tf saturation and NTBI were only mildly elevated in SPH and more pronounced in SCD (Fig 2E–G). Markers for iron overload were increased to similar levels in patients with SCD receiving simple and exchange transfusions (Tf saturation average 55% in SCD 1 vs. 50% in SCD 2) (Fig 2E–G). In all cohorts, NTBI showed a direct correlation with Tf saturation (Fig 2D, H).

### Eculizumab reduces complement activation, inflammation, endothelial damage, thrombosis, and renal injury markers in aHUS [^113n3AKV]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a genetic, life-threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled complement activation, systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and vital organ damage. We evaluated the effect of terminal complement blockade with the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab on biomarkers of cellular processes involved in TMA in patients with aHUS longitudinally, during up to 1 year of treatment, compared with in healthy volunteers. Biomarker levels were elevated at baseline in most patients, regardless of mutational status, plasma exchange/infusion use, platelet count, or lactate dehydrogenase or haptoglobin levels. Eculizumab reduced terminal complement activation (C5a and sC5b-9) and renal injury markers (clusterin, cystatin-C, β2-microglobulin, and liver fatty acid binding protein-1) to healthy volunteer levels and reduced inflammation (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1), coagulation (prothrombin fragment F1+2 and d-dimer), and endothelial damage (thrombomodulin) markers to near-normal levels. Alternative pathway activation (Ba) and endothelial activation markers (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) decreased but remained elevated, reflecting ongoing complement activation in aHUS despite complete terminal complement blockade. These results highlight links between terminal complement activation and inflammation, endothelial damage, thrombosis, and renal injury and underscore ongoing risk for systemic TMA and progression to organ damage. Further research regarding underlying complement dysregulation is warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01194973.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^111X9653]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Noninvasive fibrosis and steatosis tools — conditions that can falsely elevate estimates or increase liver stiffness include inflammatory condition affecting FibroTest, Fibroindex, Hepascore, and FibroMeter, which can result in increased α2-macroglobulin levels and falsely elevated Fibrotest, increased γ-globulin, and falsely elevated Fibroindex; hemolysis affects Fibrotest and decreases haptoglobin levels and increases total bilirubin, leading to falsely elevated estimation; Gilbert syndrome and other cholestatic diseases affect FibroTest and Hepascore and can result in increased total bilirubin and falsely elevated estimation; postprandial status can alter measurements, with liver stiffness increases up to 26% for TE-LSM 2 hours after a meal and a rise in postprandial glucose (> 110 mg/dL) falsely elevating NAFLD fibrosis score; gastrectomy increases hyaluronic acid resulting in falsely elevated estimation for Fibrospect, Hepascore, and ELF; extra-hepatic fibrosing conditions such as interstitial lung disease can increase collagen turnover markers resulting in elevated estimation for FibroMeter, Fibrospect, and ELF; acute sickle cell crisis is related to hemolysis and affects Fibrotest; and in critically ill settings, deceased liver donors in the ICU show elevated liver stiffness, potentially related to fluid overload and elevated aminotransferases.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^111BxnPP]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Derivation of breakthrough hemolysis definition

Because there is no consensus in the medical literature regarding the definition of BTH, the definition was derived prospectively for use in both studies based on a literature review and interviews of eight study investigators. The resulting definitionwas reviewed with and agreed upon by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency before studies started.

Literature review - the literature review revealed that several biomarkers have been used to describe BTH (Online Supplementary Table S1). Elevated LDH level was most commonly used;, however, variables such as eculizumab level, other markers of serum hemolytic activity, aspartate aminotransferase level, reticulocyte count, and bilirubin levelhave also been used. There was no consensus on whether hemoglobin levels and/or transfusion requirements should be considered when defining BTH.,

Physician interviews - parameters used by participating investigators to measure BTH included symptomatic manifestations (e.g. hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, and other PNH-related symptoms) and laboratory indicators (e.g. decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated LDH levels, increased total complement levels, and increased bilirubin levels) (Online Supplementary Table S2).

Outcomes

The key outcome of interest in this study was BTH causality. BTH events were categorized as the following: (i) temporal association that is free C5–related, defined as BTH associated with time-matched occurrence of free C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL;(ii) CAC-related, defined as BTH due to an inciting event (e.g. infection, trauma, or surgery); or (iii) BTH unrelated to elevated C5 and without a reported time-matched CAC. BTH causality was also analyzed by assessment of the correlation between serum free C5 concentrations < 0.5 mg/mL or ≥ 0.5 mg/mL and BTH.

### Carboxyhemoglobin, a reliable diagnosis biomarker for hemolysis in intensive care unit: a retrospective study [^116sPh2g]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, 187 patients were included, 94 patients with HA and 93 with non-HA (Table 1). Among patients with HA, 50 (54%) had thrombotic micro-angiopathy, 25 (26%) had auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and 19 (20%) had sickle cell disease.

Table 1
Characteristics of patients with and without hemolytic anemia

Data are expressed as number, percentage or median and interquartile ranges (IQRs)

SOFA sepsis-related organ failure assessment, AIHA auto-immune hemolytic anemia, TMA thrombotic micro-angiopathy, SCD sickle cell disease, LDH lactate dehydrogenase

Carboxyhemoglobin levels were twofold higher in patients with HA in comparison with patients with non-HA (3.0 [2.3–3.9] vs 1.6 [1.0–2.1] %, p < 0.0001). Carboxyhemoglobin level at admission was an accurate diagnostic tool for HA as the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.93 (CI 95% [0.89–0.96]), higher than LDH (AUC = 0.80, CI 95% [0.73–0.86]), unconjugated bilirubin (AUC = 0.77, CI 95% [0.71–0.84]) and methemoglobin (AUC = 0.71, CI 95% [0.64–0.79]) (Fig. 1). A threshold of carboxyhemoglobin of 2.0% for detection of hemolysis, yielded a sensitivity of 85% (CI 95% [77–90]) and specificity of 86% (CI 95% [80–90]). Specificity of carboxyhemoglobin for hemolysis detection was ≥ 99% for levels ≥ 2.7%. Using a logistic regression, we adjusted the analysis of carboxyhemoglobin for age and SOFA and we found that carboxyhemoglobin remained strongly associated with hemolysis: crude OR 74 (CI 95% [19–281]), adjusted OR 53 (CI 95% [12–240], p < 0.001 (both Wald and LR test). Focusing on patients with HA, we found that carboxyhemoglobin levels inversely correlated with hemoglobin levels (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001).

### Whole blood viscosity and red blood cell adhesion: potential biomarkers for targeted and curative therapies in sickle cell disease [^116pvKy3]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 4
Summary of key findings and multiple factors that affect endothelial health in SCD. Increased hemolysis in SCD is linked to elevated heme levels, lower hematocrit, lower RBC count, and may have differential effects on endothelial health under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Free heme is toxic to the endothelium and leads to activation and abnormal RBC adhesion, while hypoxia can further increase RBC adhesion due to hemoglobin polymerization. Lower WBV in normoxia, as shown in this work, could lead to reduced endothelial shear stress, which has been linked to endothelial activation. This study also highlights that hypoxia acutely increases WBV and RBC adhesion in subjects with HbSS, which could plausibly contribute to local occlusion and ischemia [Color figure can be viewed at]

In this work, we integrated analyses of WBV and RBC adhesion. We found an inverse association between RBC adhesion and WBV in subjects with HbSS. A lower WBV strongly associated with a lower HCT. Similarly, LDH levels and absolute reticulocyte counts were significantly higher in subjects with a higher RBC adhesion profile, as we reported previously. 26, 49, 50 Based on these findings, we speculate that a hemolytic environment associates with RBC adhesion and also leads to a lower WBV due to reduced HCT, which explains the inverse relationship between RBC adhesion and WBV. Further, a hemolytic environment has been reported to damage the endothelium, 71, 72 while a lower WBV and thus lower endothelial shear stress may mediate activation and adhesive interactions between endothelial cells and blood cells in vivo, since cellular adhesion is strongly governed by applied shear force (Figure 4). Our integrated viscosity and adhesion analyses highlight a range of deleterious effects on the microvasculature that may arise in a patient with HbSS and hemolysis, from the cumulative effects of heme toxicity, abnormal cellular adhesion, and the impact of a low HCT and subnormal WBV on endothelial health. Further, acute, hypoxia‐induced increases in viscosity and in RBC adhesion may together have a deleterious impact on the local environment of the microvasculature (Figure 4). Patients with low WBV and high cellular adhesion may represent an especially at‐risk subpopulation, and we are evaluating this prospectively.

### Transfusion of stored autologous blood does not alter reactive hyperemia index in healthy volunteers [^116AAywh]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusion of human blood stored for more than 2 weeks is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. During storage, packed erythrocytes progressively release hemoglobin, which avidly binds nitric oxide. We hypothesized that the nitric oxide mediated hyperemic response after ischemia would be reduced after transfusion of packed erythrocytes stored for 40 days.

Methods and Results

We conducted a crossover randomized interventional study, enrolling 10 healthy adults. Nine volunteers completed the study. Each volunteer received one unit of 40-day and one of 3-day stored autologous leukoreduced packed erythrocytes, on different study days according to a randomization scheme. Blood withdrawal and reactive hyperemia index measurements were performed before and 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after transfusion. The reactive hyperemia index during the first 4 h after transfusion of 40-day compared with 3-day stored packed erythrocytes was unchanged. Plasma hemoglobin and bilirubin concentrations were higher after transfusion of 40-day than after 3-day stored packed erythrocytes (P = 0.02, [95% CI difference 10–114 mg/l] and 0.001, [95% CI difference 0.6–1.5 mg/dl], respectively). Plasma concentrations of potassium, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and cytokines, as well as blood pressure, did not differ between the two transfusions and remained within the normal range. Plasma nitrite concentrations increased after transfusion of 40-day stored packed erythrocytes, but not after transfusion of 3-day stored packed erythrocytes (P = 0.01, [95% CI difference 0.446–0.66 μM]).

Conclusions

Transfusion of autologous packed erythrocytes stored for 40 days is associated with increased hemolysis, an unchanged reactive hyperemia index, and increased concentrations of plasma nitrite.

### Eculizumab prevents intravascular hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and unmasks low-level extravascular hemolysis occurring through C3 opsonization [^111bZfAt]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hemolytic anemia characterized by intravascular hemolysis which has been demonstrated to be effectively controlled with eculizumab. However, lactate dehydrogenase levels remain slightly elevated and haptoglobin levels remain low in some patients suggesting residual low-level hemolysis. This may be due to C3-mediated clearance of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red blood cells through the reticuloendothelial system.

Design and Methods

Thirty-nine samples from patients not treated with eculizumab and 31 samples from patients treated with eculizumab were obtained (for 17 of these 31 samples there were also samples taken prior to eculizumab treatment). Membrane bound complement was assessed by flow cytometry. Direct antiglobulin testing was carried out using two methods. Lactate dehydrogenase was assayed to assess the degree of hemolysis.

Results

Three of 39 patients (8%) with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria not on eculizumab had a positive direct antiglobulin test, while the test was positive in 21 of 31 (68%) during eculizumab treatment. Of these 21 patients who had a positive direct antiglobulin test during eculizumab treatment, 17 had been tested prior to treatment; only one was positive. Flow cytometry using anti-C3 monoclonal antibodies was performed on the 21 direct antiglobulin test-positive, eculizumab-treated patients; the median proportion of C3-positive total red blood cells was 26%. Among the eculizumab-treated patients, 16 of the 21 (76.2%) with a positive direct antiglobulin test received at least one transfusion compared with one of ten (10.0%) of those with a negative test (P < 0.01). Among the eculizumab-treated patients, the mean hemoglobin value for the 21 with a positive direct antiglobulin test was 9.6 ± 0.3 g/dL, whereas that in the ten patients with a negative test was 11.0 ± 0.4 g/dL (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate a previously masked mechanism of red cell clearance in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and suggests that blockade of complement at C5 allows C3 fragment accumulation on some paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria red cells, explaining the residual low-level hemolysis occurring in some eculizumab-treated patients.

### Fostamatinib for the treatment of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia: phase 2, multicenter, open-label study [^117G3NUk]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with relapsed warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) have limited treatment options. Fostamatinib is a potent, orally administered spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This phase 2 study evaluated the response to fostamatinib, administered at 150 mg BID orally with or without food in adults with wAIHA and active hemolysis with hemoglobin (Hgb) < 10 g/dL who had failed at least one prior treatment. Hemoglobin levels and safety assessments were performed at visits every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was Hgb > 10 g/dL with an increase of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline by week 24 without rescue therapy or red blood cell transfusion. Eleven of 24 (46%) patients achieved the primary endpoint. Increases in median Hgb were detected at week 2 and sustained over time. Median lactate dehydrogenase levels and reticulocyte counts generally declined over time with little change in median haptoglobin levels. The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (42%), fatigue (42%), hypertension (27%), dizziness (27%), and insomnia (23%). AEs were manageable and consistent with the fostamatinib safety database of over 3900 patients across multiple diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, B‐cell lymphoma, COVID‐19, and ITP). No new safety signals were detected. Fostamatinib may be a promising therapeutic option for wAIHA. A randomized, double‐blind, phase 3 study is nearing completion.

2028. doi: 10.1001/jama.1981.03310450022012 To the Editor — The article by Marchand et al provides too much hope for a resurrection of haptoglobin determinations as a reliable indicator of hemolytic diseases. First, the introduction of any new or renewed diagnostic measurement should be based on a reliable diagnosis. In the case of hemolysis, the standard reference method to establish the firm diagnosis of a reduction in the RBC survival relies on studies with radiolabeled autologous erythrocytes. Since the reticulocyte count, on which Marchand et al based their diagnosis, is an unreliable method for establishing a hemolytic process, 1 at least in its milder form, their data lack the important prerequisite, and any conclusions derived thereof must remain in doubt.

Second, even using the most sensitive assay for haptoglobin determination, one has to respect the fact that hemolytic diseases are often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Being an acute-phase reactant protein, increased haptoglobin levels are — in our Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Alterations in haptoglobin levels… [^117Cs3Ns]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE HAPTOGLOBINS are a family of serum proteins which bind hemoglobin. The early studies of Jayle and his co-workers1 demonstrated that the haptoglobin levels are elevated in a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. In some illnesses associated with hemolysis, the hemoglobin released from the breakdown of the red blood cells combines with the haptoglobin to form a strong complex which appears to be removed in the reticuloendothelial system. If the rate of breakdown of red blood cells is greater than the production of haptoglobin, the serum haptoglobin level will decrease, in some cases to undetectable levels. If the hemolytic process is arrested, the haptoglobin can be regenerated and the serum levels may return to normal. When starch gel is used as a supporting medium for electrophoresis, 2, 3 human sera can be separated according to haptoglobin types. Three major types, 1–1, 2–2, and 2–1, were Blumberg BS, Kuvin SF, Robinson JC, Teitelbaum JM, Contacos PG.
