## Question

54 yo M with history of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B), mild edema, and long-standing back pain presents with new onset atrial fibrillation (rate 120, BP 118/68, no chest pain, no heart failure symptoms). Home meds: ibuprofen 600 mg TID, furosemide 40 mg daily. Labs: Na 132, K 3.5, Cr 0.9, LFTs stable, INR 1.4. Plan: start amiodarone loading dose IV for rate control and possible conversion — okay to proceed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe and appropriate to give intravenous amiodarone for acute rate control and possible pharmacologic cardioversion in a 54-year-old man with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in hepatic impairment. Then, I should verify the boxed warnings and monitoring requirements. Next, I will review guideline positions on amiodarone for acute AF rate control, especially in cirrhosis. After that, I need to check for safer alternatives and their dosing in liver disease. Finally, I will weigh risks versus benefits and outline a practical, safer plan with monitoring if amiodarone is unavoidable, and confirm whether any dose adjustment is needed in Child-Pugh B.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetics in cirrhosis, because that will anchor risk. Amiodarone is extensively hepatically metabolized and biliary excreted, and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone accumulates with prolonged half-lives, meaning effects persist weeks after discontinuation; importantly, after a single IV dose in cirrhotic patients, amiodarone exposure is unchanged while desethylamiodarone exposure is lower, so there is no straightforward dose reduction to mitigate toxicity, and close monitoring is prudent rather than dose adjustment [^6da26dcb] [^0fef213f] [^e37c924e].

> Wait, let me verify the boxed warnings and monitoring mandates before jumping to dosing. The FDA carries prominent boxed warnings for pulmonary, hepatic, and proarrhythmic toxicity; for hepatic injury, it advises obtaining baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinuing or reducing dose if ALT/AST exceed three times the upper limit of normal or double in someone with an elevated baseline, which is directly relevant in cirrhosis where baseline LFTs are often abnormal [^fd1be9f5] [^ee058f98] [^a9a151f1]. I should also confirm that IV amiodarone is not first-line for AF rate control and requires continuous ECG monitoring during initiation due to bradycardia, hypotension, and QT effects, which adds complexity in a non-ICU setting [^300e2696] [^fd1be9f5].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning for acute AF rate control and where amiodarone fits. Contemporary guidelines prioritize beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for acute and chronic rate control; amiodarone is reserved for highly selected scenarios such as significant LV dysfunction, decompensated heart failure, or when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, and even then it is not the preferred initial choice for acute rate control in stable patients without heart failure [^001acd34] [^f6169921] [^37bfdfa3]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline endorses routine IV amiodarone loading for new-onset AF in compensated cirrhosis; I do not find such endorsement, reinforcing that this plan is off-label and higher risk here [^notfound].

> I will now examine hepatotoxicity risk specifically in cirrhosis, because that is the crux. Although asymptomatic LFT elevations are common with amiodarone, clinically significant hepatitis or cirrhosis progression occurs in a minority but is more likely with prolonged therapy and higher doses; importantly, there are case reports of acute liver injury after IV loading and even pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis with chronic low-dose therapy, and cirrhotic patients may have impaired drug clearance and heightened susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury, so the margin for safety is thinner in Child-Pugh B [^16034e68] [^952e39a5] [^f534eb84] [^6cf9f7b4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the pharmacokinetic note about unchanged amiodarone levels might imply no extra risk, but that would be misleading; unchanged parent exposure with altered metabolite handling and preexisting liver disease still elevates hepatotoxic risk and warrants caution rather than reassurance [^6da26dcb] [^16034e68].

> Let me consider safer alternatives for acute rate control in this stable, non-heart-failure patient. Beta-blockers or diltiazem are first-line for acute rate control in AF without decompensated HF; neither requires hepatic dose adjustment in Child-Pugh B, and both are guideline-preferred over amiodarone for this indication, which materially improves the risk–benefit balance here [^001acd34] [^f6169921]. I should double-check that neither metoprolol nor diltiazem has a Child-Pugh B–specific contraindication or adjustment; I do not find such restrictions, supporting their use as initial therapy in this scenario [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the team is concerned about conversion and is implicitly targeting rhythm control with the IV amiodarone load. I need to ensure we separate rate control from pharmacologic cardioversion. For acute pharmacologic conversion, guidelines list amiodarone as an option, yet that is a different goal than rate control and still carries the same hepatic and proarrhythmic risks; given cirrhosis and the absence of compelling reasons to prefer amiodarone over safer rate-control agents, choosing amiodarone solely for conversion in this stable patient is not justified [^56e38f38] [^b81edaba]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline prioritizes amiodarone for conversion in compensated cirrhosis; again, I find no such endorsement, reinforcing the risk signal [^notfound].

> I should confirm whether any dose adjustment is advised in Child-Pugh B. The FDA labeling notes no defined dosage adjustment for renal, hepatic, or cardiac abnormalities during chronic oral therapy, but it emphasizes close clinical monitoring; for IV use, no Child-Pugh–specific adjustment is provided, and given unchanged parent drug exposure with altered metabolite handling, the practical implication is vigilance rather than dose reduction, which does not mitigate toxicity risk in cirrhosis [^6da26dcb] [^0fef213f]. Let me reconsider whether a lower IV load could help; because of the long half-life and tissue accumulation, any reduced load still risks delayed hepatotoxicity, so dose tapering is not a reliable safety strategy here [^e37c924e].

> Next, I should review what to do if, despite these concerns, amiodarone is absolutely necessary due to contraindications to first-line agents. If used, it should be initiated with continuous ECG monitoring, strict attention to electrolytes with correction of potassium and magnesium, baseline and serial liver enzymes, and a plan to reassess within 24–48 hours for efficacy and hepatic signals; given the long half-life, any toxicity may persist after discontinuation, so early detection is critical [^fd1be9f5] [^ee058f98] [^e37c924e]. I need to ensure we also account for drug interactions; amiodarone inhibits CYPs and P-gp, so if anticoagulation is initiated, warfarin requirements typically drop by about 30–50% and digoxin levels can rise, necessitating proactive dose management and INR or digoxin monitoring if applicable [^ea6a372f] [^24f612a0].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, it is not advisable to proceed with IV amiodarone loading for acute AF rate control in a patient with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis; the hepatotoxic risk is nontrivial, there is no supportive guideline endorsement for this use-case, and safer, guideline-preferred alternatives exist. The better course is to use a beta-blocker or diltiazem for rate control, address anticoagulation for stroke prevention in accordance with AF and cirrhosis guidance, and reserve amiodarone only for exceptional circumstances with close monitoring if first-line agents are contraindicated or fail [^001acd34] [^f6169921] [^da156eff] [^fd1be9f5].

---

Do not use IV amiodarone for rate control in this patient with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis because of **high risk of hepatotoxicity** and **lack of dose-adjustment guidance** [^fd1be9f5] [^6da26dcb]. Use beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first-line rate control [^001acd34], and consider digoxin if needed [^f6169921]. If amiodarone is absolutely necessary, monitor LFTs closely and stop if ALT/AST rise > 3× ULN or double from baseline [^fd1be9f5]. Avoid ibuprofen due to GI bleeding risk; use acetaminophen for pain and correct electrolytes before any antiarrhythmic therapy [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in hepatic impairment

- **Metabolism**: Amiodarone is extensively hepatically metabolized to desethylamiodarone (DEA); both have long half-lives (15–142 days for amiodarone, 14–75 days for DEA) [^e37c924e], causing prolonged drug effects even after discontinuation [^1b4962e6].

- **Cirrhosis effects**: In Child-Pugh B, amiodarone exposure is unchanged, but DEA exposure is reduced; no dose adjustment is defined, but close monitoring is advised [^6da26dcb] [^0fef213f].

- **Hepatotoxicity risk**: Amiodarone can cause severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure; risk is higher with pre-existing liver disease and prolonged use [^fd1be9f5] [^16034e68].

---

## Clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity in cirrhosis

- **Case reports**: Acute liver injury after IV amiodarone has been reported, including fatal hepatocellular necrosis, especially with rapid or high-dose infusions [^952e39a5] [^52296ee4].

- **Chronic toxicity**: Chronic amiodarone can cause steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, sometimes irreversible, even at low doses [^f534eb84] [^16034e68].

- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic LFTs are required; discontinue or reduce dose if ALT/AST exceed 3× ULN or double from an elevated baseline [^fd1be9f5] [^ee058f98].

---

## Guideline recommendations

Current guidelines do not provide **specific dosing adjustments** for amiodarone in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, but they emphasize caution and close monitoring due to hepatotoxicity risk [^6da26dcb]. For **rate control**, beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred first-line agents; amiodarone is reserved for refractory cases or when other agents are contraindicated [^001acd34] [^f6169921].

---

## Alternative rate control strategies

| **Medication** | **Considerations in cirrhosis** |
|-|-|
| Beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol) | - Safe and effective <br/> - No dose adjustment required <br/> - Preferred first-line [^001acd34] |
| Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) | - Safe and effective <br/> - No dose adjustment required <br/> - Preferred first-line [^001acd34] |
| Digoxin | - Useful if beta-blockers/CCBs contraindicated <br/> - Monitor for toxicity <br/> - Adjust dose for renal function [^81abacb4] |

---

## Clinical management considerations

- **Electrolytes**: Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia before antiarrhythmic therapy to reduce arrhythmia risk [^7f7cc4ce].

- **Pain management**: Avoid NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) due to GI bleeding risk; use acetaminophen with caution [^notfound].

- **Anticoagulation**: Consider anticoagulation for stroke prevention, balancing bleeding risk in cirrhosis [^da156eff] [^9efd45c4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

IV amiodarone is **not recommended** for rate control in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis due to hepatotoxicity risk and lack of dosing guidance. Use beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers first-line, and consider digoxin if needed. If amiodarone is absolutely necessary, monitor LFTs closely and discontinue if significant elevations occur [^fd1be9f5].

- **Renal impairment**: Monitor renal function periodically
- **Hypotension**: Patients with other heart or renal diseases have increased risk, monitor blood pressure after initiation
- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor serum potassium periodically
- **Cholestatic jaundice and hepatic failure**: Monitor for jaundice or signs of liver failure.

1. 2 Heart Failure Lisinopril tablet USP is indicated to reduce signs and symptoms of systolic heart failure.
2.

2 Heart Failure The recommended starting dose for lisinopril, when used with diuretics and digitalis as adjunctive therapy for systolic heart failure, is 5 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose in these patients with hyponatremia is 2. 5 mg once daily. Increase as tolerated to a maximum of 40 mg once daily.
2. 3 Reduction of Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, give lisinopril tablets USP 5 mg orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg once daily. Dosing should continue for at least six weeks. Initiate therapy with 2. 5 mg in patients with a low systolic blood pressure during the first 3 days after the infarct.

If hypotension occurs a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2. 5 mg if needed. If prolonged hypotension occurs lisinopril should be withdrawn. Angioedema Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx, including some fatal reactions, have occurred in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, at any time during treatment. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Lisinopril should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms of angioedema has occurred. Intestinal angioedema has occurred in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.

These patients presented with abdominal pain; in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. In some cases, the angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Sudden and potentially life threatening anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent.

### Acute liver injury after intravenous amiodarone: a case report [^952e39a5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially fatal complication of amiodarone use. Although oral long-term use of the drug is frequently complicated by an asymptomatic rise in serum aminotransferase concentrations, acute hepatotoxicity during intravenous loading is much less frequent and potentially fatal. We report a case of liver injury after intravenous administration in a patient with atrial fibrillation.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage must be individualized based on severity of arrhythmia and response. Use the lowest effective dose. Obtain baseline chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and liver aminotransferases. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment

Recommended Dosage:

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Administration:

Administer amiodarone hydrochloride tablets consistently with regard to meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Administration of amiodarone hydrochloride tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.

Initiate treatment with a loading doses of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce amiodarone hydrochloride dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with chronic liver disease, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating oral anticoagulation in patients with AF at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) in the absence of clinically significant liver disease-induced coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

---

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^8d6ba648]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs — sotalol may be initiated in outpatients with little or no heart disease as long as the baseline uncorrected QT interval is less than 450 ms, serum electrolytes are normal, and risk factors associated with class III drug–related proarrhythmia are considered, and it is safest to start sotalol when the patient is in sinus rhythm; amiodarone can also usually be given safely on an outpatient basis, with loading regimens of 600 mg daily for 4 wk or 1 g daily for 1 wk followed by lower maintenance doses; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide should not be started out of hospital and out-of-hospital initiation of dofetilide is not permitted; amiodarone, class IA or IC agents, or sotalol can be associated with bradycardia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, which is more frequent with amiodarone and more common in women than in men.

### "Torsade de pointes" during amiodarone infusion in a cirrhotic woman with a prolonged QT interval [^7884ffbc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

We describe an interesting case of a woman with decompensated cirrhosis, ischaemic heart disease and prolonged QT interval, who developed a new-onset atrial fibrillation. During amiodarone infusion a torsade de pointes occurred, which was immediately converted to sinus rhythm by synchronized cardioversion. A new episode of atrial fibrillation was treated with infusion of a beta-blocker (metoprolol) that restored sinus rhythm and normalized the QT interval. Delayed repolarization, frequently observed in ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis and pro-arrhythmic drugs administration, represents the background for the development of torsade de pointes. Our report underlines that the potential harmfulness of a prolonged QT interval in cirrhotic patients is currently not perceived in its entirety, so that various categories of drugs affecting ventricular repolarization are rather thoughtlessly used in clinical practice without monitoring the QT interval. Thus, amiodarone should be avoided, if possible, or used with extreme care in arrhythmic patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover, beta-blockers may be considered the first-line treatment for rate-control during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in cirrhotic patients with delayed repolarization.

### Hepatic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a patient receiving long-term low-dose amiodarone therapy [^d0afe3b8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Much of the literature focuses on the toxic effects of this medication in the setting of rapid loading or long-term therapy with high maintenance doses. However, patients have been known to develop multi-organ toxicities with long-term low-dose therapy.

Case Report

We present a 90-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing low-dose amiodarone therapy for a period of 18 months without medical follow-up who developed signs and symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in association with hyperammonemia. Upon discontinuation of the medication and treatment of the hyperammonemia, the patient had a rapid decline in symptoms and a return to his baseline status.

Conclusion

Identifying toxicity early and correcting it rapidly may prevent life-threatening sequelae associated with amiodarone toxicity.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^24a80b0c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

### Gastrointestinal and liver diseases and atrial fibrillation: a review of the literature [^16034e68]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone and liver injury

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug used in the treatment of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, including AF, which is associated with asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemical tests in up to 30% of patients after intravenous administration, or among those who use amiodarone long term. Symptomatic hepatitis or liver failure and cirrhosis from amiodarone is fortunately very rare (0–3% of amiodarone users), but the risk is higher for prolonged users and with high doses. In a meta-analysis of approximately 740 patients on low-dose amiodarone for at least 1 year, there were no statistically significant increases in gastrointestinal or liver-related adverse events compared with placebo. Amiodarone-induced liver injury includes steatosis and steatohepatitis and can be difficult to distinguish from NAFLD. Because amiodarone concentrates in the liver and has a relatively long half-life, amiodarone-induced liver injury can take time to resolve and may even become apparent after amiodarone has been discontinued.

### Amiodarone hci [^41587a98]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

The acute effectiveness of amiodarone HCl injection in suppressing recurrent VF or hemodynamically unstable VT is supported by two randomized, parallel, dose-response studies of approximately 300 patients each. In these studies, patients with at least two episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT in the preceding 24 hours were randomly assigned to receive doses of approximately 125 or 1000 mg over the first 24 hours, an 8-fold difference. In one study, a middle dose of approximately 500 mg was evaluated. The dose regimen consisted of an initial rapid loading infusion, followed by a slower 6-hour loading infusion, and then an 18-hour maintenance infusion. The maintenance infusion was continued up to hour 48. Additional 10-minute infusions of 150 mg amiodarone HCl injection were given for "breakthrough" VT/VF more frequently to the 125 mg dose group, thereby considerably reducing the planned 8-fold differences in total dose to 1.8- and 2.6-fold, respectively, in the two studies.

The prospectively defined primary efficacy end point was the rate of VT/VF episodes per hour. For both studies, the median rate was 0.02 episodes per hour in patients receiving the high dose and 0.07 episodes per hour in patients receiving the low dose, or approximately 0.5 versus 1.7 episodes per day (p = 0.07, 2-sided, in both studies). In one study, the time to first episode of VT/VF was significantly prolonged (approximately 10 hours in patients receiving the low dose and 14 hours in patients receiving the high dose). In both studies, significantly fewer supplemental infusions were given to patients in the high-dose group. Mortality was not affected in these studies; at the end of double-blind therapy or after 48 hours, all patients were given open access to whatever treatment (including amiodarone HCl injection) was deemed necessary.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^36022556]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I² = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I² = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I² = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis [^a21235eb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained heart arrhythmia in adults worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 2–4% and steadily increasing rates annually. It is associated with greater morbidity and mortality compared to healthy individuals, resulting in a significant burden on healthcare systems.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^1117aa44]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications [^bc37a3a3]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration only for refractory ventricular arrhythmias, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic medications in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding optimal use of amiodarone for various arrhythmias.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies with clinical pertinence. The search was limited to human-participant, English-language reports published between 1970 and 2007. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, electrical storm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and Wolff-Parkinson-White. Bibliographies of identified articles and guidelines from official societies were reviewed for additional references. Ninety-two identified studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Evidence Synthesis

Amiodarone may have clinical value in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation, though other agents are available. Amiodarone is useful in acute management of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmias, regardless of hemodynamic stability. The only role for prophylactic amiodarone is in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Amiodarone may be effective as an adjunct to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce number of shocks. However, amiodarone has a number of serious adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits (> 90%), optic neuropathy/neuritis (≤ 1%-2%), blue-gray skin discoloration (4%-9%), photosensitivity (25%-75%), hypothyroidism (6%), hyperthyroidism (0.9%-2%), pulmonary toxicity (1%-17%), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% annually), and hepatotoxicity (elevated enzyme levels, 15%-30%; hepatitis and cirrhosis, < 3% [0.6% annually]).

Conclusion

Amiodarone should be used with close follow-up in patients who are likely to derive the most benefit, namely those with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction, those with acute sustained ventricular arrhythmias, those about to undergo cardiac surgery, and those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and symptomatic shocks.

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Amiodarone hydrochloride is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue amiodarone hydrochloride if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions 5.2)].

Pacerone can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue Pacerone if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pacerone can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Reserve Pacerone for patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity, some also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents first. (1)
Pacerone' s life-threatening toxicities include pulmonary (5.2), hepatic (5.3), and proarrhythmic (5.4).
Initiate under hospital or specialist supervision. (5)

### Single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone for the prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery [^ee987db1]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Various regimens have been proposed for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation, including the use of intravenous and oral amiodarone. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone in prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation during the 7 days after coronary artery bypass surgery.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study encompassing 315 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. They received either amiodarone (159 patients) or placebo (156 patients). Therapy consisted of a single oral loading dose of 1200 mg of amiodarone 1 day before surgery, followed by the maintenance dose of 200 mg daily during the next 7 days. Only episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting more than 1 hour or associated with hemodynamic compromise were taken into consideration.

Results

Overall, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was similar in patients who received amiodarone (31/159, 19.5%) and placebo (33/156, 21.2%) (P = 0.78). However, amiodarone reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years): it occurred in 20 of 75 (26.7%) patients on amiodarone and in 28 of 65 (43.1%) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.05). There were no differences between the study groups regarding the postoperative intrahospital morbidity and mortality and the duration of hospital stay.

Conclusions

A single-day loading dose of oral amiodarone (1200 mg) does not prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation in a general population of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. However, it appears that this regimen reduces the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in elderly patients.

Arrhythmias

New‐Onset and Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation

The mechanism of action of ranolazine has been proposed to reduce atrial excitability and prolong the atrial refractory period. 42 The role of ranolazine as an adjunctive anti‐arrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation (AF) has been evaluated in several studies. A randomized study of 121 patients with recent onset AF (< 48 hours) evaluated the effect of amiodarone infusion (loading dose 5 mg/kg followed by maintenance of 50 mg/h) plus ranolazine (1500 mg single dose) versus amiodarone infusion alone for conversion to sinus rhythm. A significantly higher conversion rate at 24 hours (87% versus 70%, respectively; P = 0.024) and at 12 hours (52% versus 32%; P = 0.021) in the ranolazine plus amiodarone infusion group was observed. 43

In the recent Combined Ranolazine and Dronedarone in the Management of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Mechanistic and Therapeutic Synergism (HARMONY) trial, 134 patients with paroxysmal AF and implanted pacemakers were randomized to ranolazine 750 mg BID, dronedarone 150 mg BID, dronedarone 225 mg BID, combination therapy, or placebo. 44 This moderate dose of ranolazine combined with the reduced‐dose dronedarone (which is currently available as 400 mg) was hypothesized to have complementary electrophysiological properties with a potential increased safety and tolerability profile. After 12 weeks of treatment, a significant 59% reduction (P = 0.008) in AF burden was observed in the combination therapy group (ranolazine 750 mg BID/dronedarone 225 mg BID) compared with placebo. No significant reduction in AF burden was noted in the placebo, either drug alone, or combination therapy with dronedarone 150 mg BID groups.

### Vardenafil hydrochloride (levitra) [^08f63fe2]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic Insufficiency:

In volunteers with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), the Cmaxand AUC following a 10 mg vardenafil dose were increased 130% and 160%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. Consequently, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment and the maximum dose should not exceed 10 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Vardenafil has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation: In a study of the effect of LEVITRA on QT interval in 59 healthy males (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Electrophysiology), therapeutic (10 mg) and supratherapeutic (80 mg) doses of LEVITRA and the active control moxifloxacin (400 mg) produced similar increases in QTcinterval. A postmarketing study evaluating the effect of combining LEVITRA with another drug of comparable QT effect showed an additive QT effect when compared with either drug alone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Electrophysiology). These observations should be considered in clinical decisions when prescribing LEVITRA to patients with known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. Patients taking Class 1A (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or those with congenital QT prolongation, should avoid using LEVITRA.

### Anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous thromboembolism and portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^9efd45c4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

While advanced liver disease was previously considered to be an acquired bleeding disorder, there is increasing recognition of an associated prothrombotic state with patients being at higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE) including portal vein thrombosis (PVT). We review the available literature on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors and provide guidance on anticoagulant management of these conditions in adults with cirrhosis. In patients with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis and AF, we recommend anticoagulation with standard-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in accordance with cardiology guideline recommendations for patients without liver disease. In those with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis, there is inadequate evidence with respect to the benefit and risk of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF. In patients with cirrhosis and acute deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, we recommend anticoagulation and suggest use of either a DOAC or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)/vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis and LMWH alone (or as a bridge to VKA in patients with a normal baseline international normalized ratio) in Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. We recommend anticoagulation for patients with cirrhosis and symptomatic PVT. We suggest anticoagulation for those with asymptomatic, progressing PVT and recommend continuing extended anticoagulation for liver transplant candidates with PVT.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^b25abf68]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^1b4962e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Pacerone may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to Pacerone may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but Pacerone can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of Pacerone, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### A formula for the stratified selection of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the emergency setting: a retrospective pilot study [^a82dba54]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is a commonly used medication in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) of recent onset.

Study Objectives

The aim of the study was to identify a possible formula for selecting Emergency Department (ED) patients with paroxysmal AF who will spontaneously restore sinus rhythm (SR), successfully restore SR with the use of loading intravenous (i.v.) amiodarone, or require 24-h maintenance amiodarone infusion.

Methods

This retrospective pilot study included 141 patients with recent-onset AF. Patients who did not restore SR spontaneously received i.v. amiodarone (5 mg/kg) within a period of 30 min. In case of no response, an additional dosage of 1000 mg of i.v. amiodarone was administered over a period of 24 h. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of spontaneous conversion and the response to amiodarone administration.

Results

The formula ([heart rate/systolic blood pressure] + 0.1 × number of past AF incidences) was chosen as the one with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. This index identified the patients who spontaneously restored SR (cutoff point 1.31 with 78.6% sensitivity and 77.9% specificity), whereas for patients who responded to the loading i.v. amiodarone dose, the use of the index (cutoff point 1.24) exhibited 84.1% sensitivity and 75.3% specificity.

Conclusions

This formula may be a useful and reliable bedside diagnostic tool to identify AF patients most likely to spontaneously convert, or respond to loading amiodarone administration in the emergency setting. The use of this index also can assist in patient risk stratification.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^6da26dcb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Effect of Age: Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/hr/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/hr/kg) and an increase in t½ from about 20 to 47 days.

Renal Impairment: Renal impairment does not influence the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone or DEA.

Hepatic Impairment: After a single dose of intravenous amiodarone to cirrhotic patients, significantly lower Cmaxand average concentration values are seen for DEA, but mean amiodarone levels are unchanged.

Cardiac Disease: In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not significantly altered but the terminal elimination t½ of DEA is prolonged.

Although no dosage adjustment for patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiac abnormalities has been defined during chronic treatment with oral amiodarone, close clinical monitoring is prudent for elderly patients and those with severe left ventricular dysfunction.

Concomitant drug cautions include concomitant use with VKAs or digitalis (their dose should be reduced) and increased risk of myopathy when used with statins. The drug requires regular surveillance for liver, lung and thyroid toxicity, has AV nodal slowing properties, but should not be used as monotherapy for rate control, and QT prolongation is common, but very rarely associated with TdP (< 0.5%).

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^df515973]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Apart from studies in patients with VT or VF, described below, there are two other studies of amiodarone showing an antiarrhythmic effect before significant levels of DEA could have accumulated. A placebo-controlled study of intravenous amiodarone (300 mg over 2 hours followed by 1200 mg/day) in post-coronary artery bypass graft patients with supraventricular and 2- to 3-consecutive-beat ventricular arrhythmias showed a reduction in arrhythmias from 12 hours on. A baseline-controlled study using a similar IV regimen in patients with recurrent, refractory VT/VF also showed rapid onset of antiarrhythmic activity; amiodarone therapy reduced episodes of VT by 85% compared to baseline.

The acute effectiveness of intravenous amiodarone in suppressing recurrent VF or hemodynamically unstable VT is supported by two randomized, parallel, dose-response studies of approximately 300 patients each. In these studies, patients with at least two episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT in the preceding 24 hours were randomly assigned to receive doses of approximately 125 or 1000 mg over the first 24 hours, an 8-fold difference. In one study, a middle dose of approximately 500 mg was evaluated. The dose regimen consisted of an initial rapid loading infusion, followed by a slower 6-hour loading infusion, and then an 18-hour maintenance infusion. The maintenance infusion was continued up to hour 48. Additional 10-minute infusions of 150 mg intravenous amiodarone were given for "breakthrough" VT/VF more frequently to the 125 mg dose group, thereby considerably reducing the planned 8-fold differences in total dose to 1.8- and 2.6-fold, respectively, in the two studies.

### Risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation among Asian chronic hepatitis C virus carriers: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^b2208ea9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of AF includes rate/rhythm control, stroke prevention, and management of predisposing factors and underlying diseases. 16 Early identification and appropriate treatment of AF are strongly recommended to further prevent cardioembolic stroke, heart failure, and mortality. 41 Regrettably, many potential agents to treat or control AF, eg, amiodarone, β‐blockers, and anticoagulants, are relatively contraindicated in patients with HCV who develop cirrhosis or malignancy 42, 43 because many antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs used for AF are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway. 44 Once liver inflammation or dysfunction occurs, the drug's effectiveness is unpredictable with potentially increased adverse effects. The above clinical issue highlights the importance of understanding increased AF risk in the HCV population. Hence, our findings encourage physicians to not only recognize NOAF and treat AF or its associated comorbidities in the early phase but also administer antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of NOAF in the future.

### Pharmacologic prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery: a systematic review [^9c1b086e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The effect of intravenous amiodarone therapy has also been investigated. Guarnieri et al, in ARCH trial randomized 300 patients underwent open heart surgery to amiodarone infusion or placebo. The drug infusion was started within 3 hours of entering the surgical ICU amiodarone was infused at rate of 1 gr over 24 hrs for 2 days (2 g total). Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred 35% in amiodarone group versus 47% in placebo, revealing no statistically significant difference (p = 0.01).

Similarly, Yagdi et al, randomized 157 patients to amiodarone infusion or placebo. Amiodarone infusion without a loading dose was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day within 2 hours of entering the cardiovascular ICU for 48 hours. On 2nd postoperative oral amiodarone was initiated at 600 mg/day three times daily for 5 days, 400 mg per day twice daily for the following 5 days, and 200 mg per day in a single dose for the last 20 days. Amiodarone did not reduce significantly postoperative AF incidence compared to placebo (19, 4% vs 25%). Kerstein et al, randomized 143 patients that were scheduled for CABG to amiodarone infusion or placebo. IV amiodarone, 0.73 mg/min, without any loading dose was administered on call to the operating room for 48 h, and followed by oral amiodarone, 400 mg q12 h, for the next 3 days. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 3 of 51 patients (5.88%) in the amiodarone group, compared to 24 of 92 patients (26.08%) in the control group, presenting no statistical significant difference. Of note, most patients also received b-blockers and this study is limited by its non-randomised design. Also, Lee et al, began i.v. amiodarone 3 days before CABG and continued it for 5 days after surgery. The incidence of AF was lower and the duration shorter in the amiodarone group than in the placebo group (12% vs. 34%), respectively. Doerge et al, randomized 150 patients into amiodarone or placebo groups. Amiodarone given IV for 3 days following surgery did not decrease the incidence of AF. Treggiari-Venzi et al, conducted a randomized controlled double-blind trial in which patients received amiodarone postoperatively (900 g/days for 72 h) and demonstrated that the decrease in AF was not statistically significant.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in cirrhosis of the liver: are low-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants a reasonable alternative to warfarin? [^faf11514]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this large, observational study makes a significant contribution to the literature on the potential use of NOAC therapy in Asians patients with AF and cirrhosis. Low‐dose NOAC therapy may be safe and efficacious in this setting in the short term, despite the known differences in risk profiles and outcomes in Asian populations with AF combined with the balance of thrombosis and bleeding in cirrhosis. Some additional areas of uncertainty remain unanswered, however, and we thus look forward to future studies that may help us continue to reduce the burden of AF and stroke in Asia and elsewhere.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Elevations of blood hepatic enzyme values – alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) – are seen commonly in patients with immediately life-threatening VT/VF. Interpreting elevated AST activity can be difficult because the values may be elevated in patients who have had recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or multiple electrical defibrillations. Approximately 54% of patients receiving amiodarone HCl injection in clinical studies had baseline liver enzyme elevations, and 13% had clinically significant elevations. In 81% of patients with both baseline and on-therapy data available, the liver enzyme elevations either improved during therapy or remained at baseline levels. Baseline abnormalities in hepatic enzymes are not a contraindication to treatment.

Acute, centrolobular confluent hepatocellular necrosis leading to hepatic coma, acute renal failure, and death has been associated with the administration of amiodarone HCl injection at a much higher loading dose concentration and much faster rate of infusion than recommended in DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION. Therefore, the initial concentration and rate of infusion should be monitored closely and should not exceed that prescribed in DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

In patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, the potential risk of hepatic injury should be weighed against the potential benefit of amiodarone HCl injection therapy, but patients receiving amiodarone HCl injection should be monitored carefully for evidence of progressive hepatic injury. Consideration should be given to reducing the rate of administration or withdrawing amiodarone HCl injection in such cases.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^e37c924e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone hydrochloride may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but amiodarone hydrochloride can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of amiodarone hydrochloride, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^e3739161]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in transplant recipients — direct-acting antiviral (DAA) selection and drug–drug interactions: Elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended as an alternative regimen due to the necessity for baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) testing and the need for addition of ribavirin to the regimen if RASs are present. Protease inhibitors should be avoided in the presence of moderate to severe liver dysfunction (i.e. Child-Pugh B or C). Assessment of drug–drug interactions is crucial because some medications are contraindicated or not recommended during DAA therapy, including high-dose proton pump inhibitors (twice daily dosing), amiodarone (contraindicated with sofosbuvir-inclusive regimens), and certain statins (e.g., atorvastatin). Complex interactions occur with calcineurin inhibitors; coadministration of elbasvir/grazoprevir and cyclosporine leads to 15-fold increase in grazoprevir concentration–time curve and this combination should be avoided, while with tacrolimus a 40%-50% increase in tacrolimus level is predicted and no dosing adjustments are anticipated, but tacrolimus levels should be monitored.

Anticoagulation has been found to be safe and effective. The risk of bleeding is highest in patients with platelet count < 50, so anticoagulation in these patients should be considered on a case-by-case basis. In patients with GOV, beta blockers or variceal band ligation should be initiated prior to starting anticoagulation.

Treatment is initiated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), dosed by weight. Caution is required in renal impairment and dose adjustments may be required. LMWH or warfarin with a target INR of 2–3 can be used for maintenance, although INR is difficult to interpret in patients with cirrhosis. While data are limited for direct oral anticoagulants, evidence suggests they are safe in Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and they have the advantage of being much easier to use. Due to the risk of accumulation, they should be used with caution in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, and they are currently not recommended in patients with Child-Pugh C disease outside clinical trials.

Anticoagulation should be given for at least 6 months, and until the clot has resolved, or until transplant. Long-term anticoagulation can be considered in patients where risk of recurrence outweighs bleeding risk, including patients with underlying thrombophilic conditions, recurrent thromboses, and those with extension into the SMV.

In the case of progressive PVT despite anticoagulation, concordance and therapeutic drug monitoring should optimised in the first instance. A change in dose/therapeutic range (eg, aiming for higher INR) or alternative anticoagulants can be considered with specialist input from haematology. Interventional radiology/TIPSSand surgery can also be considered, particularly in transplant candidates or in patients with acute symptomatic PVT or ischaemia.

### US antiarrhythmic drug treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation: an insurance claims-based report [^74816cfc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis suggests that there is at least some level of suboptimal guideline concordance for patients with and without structural heart disease (CAD/HF or no CAD/HF, respectively). This outcome appears to be driven by very high use of amiodarone in first‐line settings as well as the use of class IC agents (flecainide, propafenone) in patients with CAD.

The EAST‐AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention) trial supports first‐line use of AADs for managing AF. 15 Still, it is acknowledged that guidelines for the maintenance of sinus rhythm are based on Level of Evidence C, which obliges the clinician to be flexible in practice regarding both safety and efficacy considerations from variable levels of evidence. For example, in the pivotal AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow‐up Investigation of Rhythm Management) First Antiarrythmic Drug Substudy, 16 amiodarone was found to be more effective at maintaining sinus rhythm than both sotalol and class I AADs, but the study did not assess effectiveness versus dofetilide or dronedarone. Serious adverse drug effects were uncommon within the 1‐year time frame of the primary end point of the AFFIRM substudy, although adverse effects that led to discontinuation of a drug were frequent. Amiodarone is associated with risk of complications (including cardiovascular and extracardiac adverse events such as pulmonary and liver toxicity), hyper‐ and hypothyroidism, photosensitivity, neuropathy, blindness, and a blue discoloration of the skin. 10, 17 Amiodarone initiation also requires loading, monitoring of respiratory functions, and repeated laboratory tests, adding to patient and healthcare system burden. In our analysis, amiodarone was the most used AAD in first‐line treatment despite guideline recommendations for other agents for most patients with AF. Alongside anticoagulation for stroke prevention and rate control considerations, this is consistent with findings indicating the persistence of this practice during the past 2 decades. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 An explanation for this observation and lower use of other AADs includes the legacy of the treatment 18 coupled with amiodarone's strong antiarrhythmic effects, specific risks associated with dofetilide and sotalol use, and potential cost considerations. 5, 19 Thus, patients treated with amiodarone in real‐world practice may reflect considerations of costs and time for drug loading even if resulting in an AAD recommendation outside the guidelines.

### A systematic review on pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular outcomes and safety profiles of statins in cirrhosis [^a6ae74e6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Guiding dose adjustment of statins in cirrhosis

We did not identify any studies comparing different methods for adjusting statin dose in cirrhosis. There are few possible reasons for this. First, there are no definitive global methods of medication dose adjustment used in cirrhosis. Unlike in renal impairment, where creatinine clearance or serum creatinine is used for dose adjustment, there is not a single reliable marker that allows the same in patients with liver function impairment. While FDA recommends manufacturers to study drugs in different Child–Pugh classes to enable dosing recommendations in hepatic impairment. The product monographs of some statins do not contain hepatic dose adjustment information and list active liver disease as a contraindication. Clearly, there is a need for evidence-based hepatic dose adjustment methods for all medications including statins. Such method(s), when available, should not only reveal equivalent pharmacokinetic parameters in a short term but also demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety endpoints in the long run.

### Celivarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm and conversion of atrial fibrillation / flutter [^06d705f9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Celivarone, a new noniodinated benzofuran derivative pharmacologically related to dronedarone and amiodarone, has been shown to have antiarrhythmic properties at a molecular level. The purpose of the 2 trials presented here (MAIA and CORYFEE) was to assess celivarone efficacy in the maintenance of sinus rhythm postcardioversion and for the conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL).

Methods and Results

In the MAIA trial, 673 patients with AF/AFL recently converted to sinus rhythm were randomly assigned to receive 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once-daily dosing of celivarone; 200 mg daily of amiodarone preceded by a loading dose of 600 mg for 10 days; or placebo. At 3 months' follow up, no significant difference was observed in time to AF/AFL relapse among the various celivarone groups and placebo. However, fewer symptomatic AF/AFL recurrences were observed in the lower-dose celivarone groups (26.6% for celivarone 50 mg [P = 0.022] and 25.2% for celivarone 100 mg [P = 0.018] vs 40.5% for placebo at 90 days). Fewer adverse events were observed with the use of celivarone and placebo than amiodarone. In the CORYFEE study, 150 patients with AF/AFL were randomly assigned to once-daily celivarone dosing of 300 or 600 mg, or placebo, for a 2-day treatment period. There was no significant difference in the rate of spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm between the treatment and control groups.

Conclusions

In these studies, celivarone does not appear to be efficacious in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF/AFL patients or for the conversion of AF/AFL patients.

The following table summarizes the mean ranges of pharmacokinetic parameters of amiodarone reported in single dose IV (5 mg/kg over 15 min) studies of healthy subjects.

PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE AFTER

AMIODARONE HCl INJECTION ADMINISTRATION

Notes: V c and V ss denote the central and steady-state volumes of distribution from IV studies.

" — " denotes not available.

Desethylamiodarone clearance and volume involve an unknown biotransformation factor.

The systemic availability of oral amiodarone in healthy subjects ranges between 33% and 65%. From in vitro studies, the protein binding of amiodarone is > 96%.

In clinical studies of 2 to 7 days, clearance of amiodarone after intravenous administration in patients with VT and VF ranged between 220 and 440 mL/h/kg. Age, sex, renal disease, and hepatic disease (cirrhosis) do not have marked effects on the disposition of amiodarone or DEA. Renal impairment does not influence the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone. After a single dose of amiodarone HCl injection in cirrhotic patients, significantly lower C max and average concentration values are seen for DEA, but mean amiodarone levels are unchanged. Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/h/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/h/kg) and an increase in t½ from about 20 to 47 days. In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not significantly altered but the terminal disposition t½ of DEA is prolonged. Although no dosage adjustment for patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiac abnormalities has been defined during chronic treatment with oral amiodarone, close clinical monitoring is prudent for elderly patients and those with severe left ventricular dysfunction.
