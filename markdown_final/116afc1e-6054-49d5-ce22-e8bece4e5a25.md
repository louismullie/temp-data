## Question

Treatment of lip licking dermatitis if steroid doesn't work.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for lip licking dermatitis when topical steroids fail. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the likely pathophysiology to guide therapy. Next, I will review steroid-sparing anti-inflammatory options and their evidence. After that, I need to consider barrier repair and behavioral strategies. Finally, I should outline escalation pathways, including when to consider systemic therapy or procedural options, and close with a practical, stepwise algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because persistent lip inflammation can reflect overlapping entities such as allergic contact cheilitis, perioral dermatitis, topical steroid withdrawal, or even infectious or granulomatous disease. I should double-check for a history of repetitive lip licking, characteristic distribution on the vermilion and perioral skin, and whether steroids helped initially but then lost effect or worsened the condition, which would push me toward irritant mechanisms and possibly steroid-induced changes rather than primary allergic disease [^6a69c809] [^e38b9715].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before choosing therapy. Lip licking dermatitis is primarily an irritant contact dermatitis from saliva, with repeated wetting and drying cycles disrupting the stratum corneum and triggering inflammation; chronic steroid use can further impair barrier function and lead to tachyphylaxis or topical steroid withdrawal, so I need to ensure I'm not perpetuating the cycle with continued steroids if the skin is thin, burning, or rebounding [^75e163cd] [^e38b9715].

> I will now examine steroid-sparing anti-inflammatory options, starting with topical calcineurin inhibitors, because guidelines endorse them when steroids are unsuitable or ineffective on sensitive facial skin. Tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream are reasonable choices, with evidence of benefit in facial dermatitis and a steroid-sparing profile, though transient burning can occur and I should counsel on that upfront [^4e59b18d] [^b53dabdf] [^338cd8c8].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for calcineurin inhibitors in this exact context. While head-to-head data in lip licking dermatitis are limited, randomized data support pimecrolimus for perioral dermatitis, including steroid-induced cases, and broader dermatology guidance supports TCIs as facial steroid alternatives; in practice, many clinicians combine a TCI with aggressive emollients to mitigate burning and enhance barrier recovery [^2ca0f49e] [^4e59b18d].

> Next, I should review barrier repair because eliminating the irritant and restoring the stratum corneum are foundational. Plain petrolatum or a thick, fragrance-free ointment applied frequently throughout the day and at bedtime helps protect the lips from saliva and supports healing; I need to ensure the patient stops flavored lip balms, toothpaste with SLS, and other potential irritants while we recover the barrier [^3764a09f].

> But wait, what if the inflammation remains refractory despite TCIs and barrier measures? I should consider a topical JAK inhibitor such as ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, which has case-level evidence for steroid-dependent facial dermatitis and topical steroid withdrawal; mechanistically, JAK inhibition dampens cytokine signaling that drives pruritus and erythema, and it can be particularly useful when TCIs are not tolerated or insufficient [^31281b06] [^aa30c8dd].

> I need to check for secondary infection or colonization, because chronic lip fissuring can harbor Staphylococcus aureus, which perpetuates inflammation. Short courses of topical mupirocin or oral antibiotics such as cephalexin can be considered when there is crusting, exudate, or impetiginization, and I should remember that some patients with perioral pustules harbor Demodex, in which case ivermectin may be effective; I should confirm with microscopy or clinical correlation before treating empirically [^75e163cd] [^25148450].

> Let me consider behavioral and adjunctive strategies, since habit reversal is critical. I should screen for anxiety, ADHD, or obsessive-compulsive features that sustain lip licking, and consider referral for cognitive behavioral strategies; in select cases, SSRIs or habit-reversal training can reduce compulsive behaviors, and for nighttime protection, a thin layer of petrolatum plus a gentle lip guard can prevent unconscious licking during sleep [^3764a09f].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation pathways if topical therapy fails. Phototherapy can be considered for chronic, refractory facial dermatitis, and in steroid-dependent or TSW-like presentations, a carefully supervised taper off steroids with supportive anti-inflammatory coverage is essential; systemic agents such as low-dose doxycycline for anti-inflammatory effect or methotrexate for severe, recalcitrant inflammatory dermatoses are options, but I need to weigh risks and monitor closely, reserving these for carefully selected cases [^ded4a69f] [^4455d72c].

> I should double-check for allergic contact dermatitis if the course is atypical or refractory. Patch testing to a broad series including fragrances, preservatives, and dental materials can uncover relevant allergens such as balsam of Peru, fragrances, or even shellac from mouthguards; identifying and avoiding the allergen can be curative in a subset of patients with persistent cheilitis [^6a69c809] [^97e308d6].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm. First, confirm the diagnosis and stop topical steroids if there is burning, rebound, or atrophy. Second, initiate intensive barrier repair with petrolatum and strict irritant avoidance. Third, start a topical calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% twice daily for 4 to 6 weeks, tapering to maintenance as needed. Fourth, if inadequate response or intolerance, trial ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice daily. Fifth, treat suspected superinfection or Demodex when indicated. Sixth, incorporate behavioral modification and consider phototherapy or systemic agents for refractory disease. And throughout, reassess the diagnosis if there is no improvement by 6 to 8 weeks to exclude mimics such as perioral dermatitis, contact allergy, or granulomatous disease [^4e59b18d] [^31281b06] [^ded4a69f].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety. I will reassess in 2 to 4 weeks to ensure adherence, tolerability, and early improvement, and I will counsel on expected transient burning with TCIs and the importance of continued barrier use even after clearance to prevent relapse. If I see telangiectasias, atrophy, or persistent erythema, I need to reconsider topical steroid withdrawal and adjust the plan accordingly [^e38b9715] [^24c299a3].

If steroids fail for lip licking dermatitis, **stop steroids** to avoid rebound or atrophy [^24c299a3], and switch to **tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% ointment** [^4e59b18d] or pimecrolimus 1% cream [^b53dabdf] twice daily for 4–6 weeks, then taper to maintenance [^1eb501d1]. Use **thick emollients** (petrolatum, white petrolatum-based balms) frequently to restore the barrier and reduce licking [^3764a09f]. Address behavioral triggers with habit reversal and consider SSRIs if compulsive [^3764a09f]. If refractory, consider ruxolitinib 1.5% cream [^31281b06] or low-dose doxycycline for anti-inflammatory effect [^dc36d8fd]. Persistent cases warrant patch testing for contact allergens [^6a69c809] and evaluation for perioral dermatitis or topical steroid withdrawal [^e38b9715].

## Non-steroidal topical therapies

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)

- **Mechanism**: Inhibit T-cell cytokines, reducing inflammation without steroid adverse effects [^aa30c8dd].
- **Evidence**: Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are effective for facial dermatitis and steroid-resistant cases [^4e59b18d] [^98ee159b].
- **Regimen**: Apply thin layers twice daily for 4–6 weeks, then taper to maintenance [^notfound].
- **Safety**: Local burning/itching is common but transient; minimal systemic absorption [^aa30c8dd].

---

### Topical JAK inhibitors

Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream is a **steroid-sparing option** for refractory facial dermatitis, including steroid-dependent cases [^31281b06]. Apply a thin layer twice daily until clearance, then taper to maintenance. Local irritation may occur but is generally mild.

---

### Emollients and barrier repair

Thick emollients such as petrolatum, white petrolatum-based balms, or beeswax-based products restore the barrier and reduce licking. Apply frequently throughout the day and at bedtime. Non-steroidal options are safe for long-term use and help prevent relapse.

---

## Behavioral interventions

Behavioral modification with **habit reversal training** and stress management reduces lip licking. SSRIs may be considered for compulsive licking or anxiety-related triggers. Counseling and education improve adherence and outcomes.

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Low-dose doxycycline (e.g. 20–50 mg/day) provides **anti-inflammatory benefit** for refractory cases [^dc36d8fd]. Patch testing is indicated for persistent or atypical cases to identify contact allergens [^6a69c809]. Phototherapy is a potential option for severe, refractory cases.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting non-steroidal therapies

| **Therapy** | **Evidence level** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Tacrolimus/pimecrolimus | High | Effective for facial dermatitis; steroid-sparing; safe long-term [^4e59b18d] [^98ee159b] |
| Ruxolitinib cream | Moderate | Effective for steroid-dependent facial dermatitis; steroid-sparing [^31281b06] |
| Emollients | High | Essential for barrier repair; reduce licking; safe long-term [^notfound] |
| Behavioral therapy | Moderate | Reduces licking; improves adherence and outcomes [^notfound] |

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Stop steroids**: Avoid rebound, atrophy, and perioral dermatitis [^e005d207].
- **Start TCI**: Tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% or pimecrolimus 1% twice daily for 4–6 weeks, then taper [^notfound].
- **Barrier repair**: Frequent petrolatum or thick emollients throughout the day [^notfound].
- **Behavioral support**: Habit reversal, stress management, SSRIs if compulsive [^notfound].
- **Escalate**: Consider ruxolitinib or low-dose doxycycline if refractory [^31281b06] [^dc36c8fd].
- **Evaluate**: Patch testing for persistent cases; consider perioral dermatitis or TSW [^6a69c809] [^e38b9715].

---

## Conclusion

When steroids fail for lip licking dermatitis, **switch to TCIs**, prioritize barrier repair, and address behavioral drivers. Ruxolitinib or low-dose doxycycline are next-line options for refractory disease. Persistent cases need evaluation for contact allergy and alternative diagnoses.

Case report

A healthy 33-year-old pregnant woman presented previously for peri-alar seborrheic dermatitis that responded quickly to topical hydrocortisone 2.5% cream. At 36 weeks' gestation, she noted a worsening of her skin condition, despite continued hydrocortisone use. At this time, the patient presented with papules and pustules located periorally, in the absence of comedones, consistent with a diagnosis of perioral dermatitis. Her skin condition worsened despite stopping topical steroids and instituting topical calcineurin inhibitors, ketoconazole, azelaic acid, and metronidazole sequentially. Given the pregnancy, no tetracycline class antibiotics were prescribed. At a follow-up visit 2 weeks later, several days after her delivery of a healthy, full-term infant, her eruption evolved into perioral and lip erythema, swelling, confluent pustules, and scaling, with pronounced pruritus and burning sensations (Fig 1). Notably, there was sparing of the remainder of the face and neck. A differential diagnosis at this time included allergic contact dermatitis and lip licker's dermatitis, although the clinical findings of pustules mitigated against these, and the patient lacked a history of new facial cosmetic products or propensity for lip licking. A scraping of multiple pustules was performed and examined under light microscopy, revealing 6 Demodex mites in lower-power field (Fig 2). A diagnosis of Demodex folliculitis was made, and the patient was prescribed 2 doses of oral ivermectin, 200 μg/kg, spaced 1 week apart. All pustules, swelling, and erythema resolved 2 weeks after the start of the first dose of ivermectin (Fig 3), and all scaling resolved after an additional week without further treatment. She did not require use of any topical medications and did not have any further facial rashes after treatment.

Discussion

TSW is an increasingly described adverse event characterized by prolonged inappropriate use of TCS leading to erythema and burning upon discontinuation. Most published cases in existing literature present on the face and genital regions (99.3%), mainly in female (81.0%). Our patient aligns with the classic presentation, with prolonged TCS use, stinging and pain, affected regions, and gender.

In existing literature, most documented TSW cases follow TCS treatment for atopic dermatitis. In a retrospective review of 19 TSW patients, 18 had atopic dermatitis, whereas 1 had ACD. Our patient's initial lip and chin irritation likely stemmed from ACD due to a lip balm identified as a known allergen on her patch testing. This case highlights the possible utility of patch testing for ACD in the setting of TSW.

TSW pathogenesis includes suggested mechanisms such as tachyphylaxis, dysregulation of glucocorticoid receptors, dysregulation of cortisol production by keratinocytes, rebound vasodilation or rebound cytokine cascade secondary to TCS induced barrier impairment.

Treatment protocols lack consensus, but current literature suggests options including discontinuation of TCS with a possible slow taper and various combinations of antihistamines, antibiotics, ice/cool compresses, and psychological support. This case documents the use of a topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, ruxolitinib as a treatment for TSW.

JAK inhibitors are increasingly used in atopic dermatitis treatment.JAK proteins are activated when extracellular ligands bind to type I/II cytokine receptors, recognizing inflammatory mediators such as interleukins and interferons. Once activated, JAK phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of trascription proteins, enabling them to move to the nucleus and initiate downstream gene transcription that leads to continued and increased itching and inflammation.

Considering their role in cytokine pathways, JAK inhibitors may minimize rebound cytokine cascade, a potential TSW mechanism. Although systemic immune suppressants such as cyclosporine have been used to treat TSW, topical therapy reduces the potential for adverse systemic side effects.

We report this case to expand the clinical toolset employed in treatment of TSW by describing the successful clearing of a chronic, refractory case of TSW with the use of a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib.

Currently, no guidelines exist for the treatment of LA and LS. Intralesional and topical steroids documented in the literature have been tried with no improvement. Our patient received a trial of intralesional triamcinolone injection. Follow-up for our patient showed no clinical signs of improvement, and the patient did not desire additional treatment. There have been cases of successful treatment of LA. Cabrera et alreported in 2015 treating a patient with 10 months of oral mycophenolate mofetil, 1 g/d. After this treatment period, the patient had complete recovery of hair sustained even after 6 months of follow-up. Yip et alnoted successful treatment with surgical debulking of the scalp after achieving remission of LA with no recurrence 1 year after surgery. Given the limited cases of successful treatment, further clinical evidence is needed to reach a consensus for treatment of LA.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^d1e62e12]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The aim of developing targeted therapy for AD is to provide control of inflammation and pruritus with improvement of barrier function while minimizing AEs seen with the use of TCSs and TCIs. By elucidating the complex pathogenesis of AD, additional targets for therapy can be developed. Many patients with AD require lifelong treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of AEs with long-term use. Non-steroidal topical therapies that work regionally with minimal systemic effects may deliver effective disease control, without concerns of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, or perioral dermatitis associated with TCSs. These novel treatments are part of the frontier for expanding our armamentarium to bring relief to a wider range of AD patients with varying needs.

### Allergic contact cheilitis in children and improvement with patch testing [^f5fa85ab]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 2-year-old boy was referred by the pediatrician for recurrent lip dermatitis present for 2 years. He previously saw 2 other dermatologists. One prescribed topical tacrolimus 0.03% ointment, hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, and desonide ointment for atopic cheilitis with minimal improvement in symptoms. The second dermatologist diagnosed lip licker's dermatitis, and the same treatment was maintained. In addition, leaky gut syndrome was ruled out, and the patient had no improvement with aloe vera supplements or a gluten-free diet for 6 months and returned to eating a normal diet. Occasionally, he experienced flares with certain foods, including brown rice, citrus foods, candies, and bread. He was using a hypoallergenic lip balm twice daily and fluoride-free toothpaste when he presented to our clinic. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable, with no history of atopy; the only medications were a daily multivitamin (Rainbow Light, Santa Cruz, CA) and occasional probiotic, and there were no known drug allergies. His family history was notable for an older brother with asthma and father with eczema and psoriasis.

Examination found pink fissured plaques with mild yellow crust involving the perioral skin including the upper and lower lips. The rest of the skin examination was clear. Images were provided around the time of presentation (Fig 1). A differential diagnosis included lip licker's dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. The patient was given a 10-day course of cephalexin and was started on combination topical tacrolimus 0.03% and alclometasone ointments twice daily. The only other topical moisturizers recommended were Vanicream and CeraVe. The patient was referred for patch testing.

Patch testing with the North American Baseline Standard Series of 50 allergens (Chemotechnique/Dormer), and 3 gallates (octyl gallate, propyl gallate, and dodecyl gallate) showed +1 reaction at 48 hours and +2 at 96 hours to balsam of peru; 2-Bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (bronopol); methylisothiazolinone (MI); and methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/MI (Kathon CG 100 ppm aq) (Table I). His parents were provided with a safe list of products to use and a list of foods and products to avoid.

### Topical steroid withdrawal treated with ruxolitinib cream [^dc36d8fd]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

In 2022, a 69-year-old woman sought a third dermatologic opinion for chronic dermatitis affecting her lips, mouth, lower cheeks, and chin since 2017. Previous allergy patch testing due to suspicion for contact dermatitis, revealed multiple allergens including cleure natural lip balm, one of her current products at time of testing. She had self-initiated over the counter 1% hydrocortisone cream for ongoing irritation that continued despite allergen avoidance. Once to twice daily TCS use continued for flares of symptoms over the 5-year period, with escalation of therapy to hydrocortisone 2.5% cream from her previous dermatologist. Flares involved significant erythema plus or minus burning, itching, and crusting. Other treatments such as 6-week supplement discontinuation, continued avoidance of known topical allergens, and elimination of almonds due to food allergen testing yielded no resolution. At the time of evaluation, she was on a regimen of nightly hydrocortisone 2.5% cream and doxycycline 20 mg daily.

No seasonal worsening or atopic history was reported. She endorsed feeling systemically well with no fever, chills, or generalized fatigue.

Examination revealed faint pink confluent patches with fine telangiectasias overlying the upper cutaneous lip, edges of the vermilion lip, bilateral nasolabial cheeks, and chin. No secondary scale was seen. Past photos showed sharply demarcated bright pink thin plaques overlying the same currently affected areas (Fig 1). She reported stinging and pain in the affected areas.

Fig 1
Sharply demarcated bright pink thin plaques overlying the bilateral nasolabial and mid cheeks, upper cutaneous lip, and chin before initial evaluation.

Due to TCS history, waxing and waning rash, telangiectasias and sharp demarcation seen in previous photos, a TSW diagnosis was made. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) was less suspected due to diligent allergen avoidance. Autoimmune or connective tissue disease was less likely due to lack of systemic symptoms. She was advised to taper nightly TCS use by decreasing frequency of application from 3 to 2 to 1 time per week for a month each and then stopping entirely. Additionally, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily, continued use of safe product list, and oral doxycycline 20 mg daily for antiinflammatory effect were recommended.

### Children atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^75e163cd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1.4 Contact dermatitis

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a type IV‐delayed hypersensitivity reaction and should be considered in differential diagnosis with AD as well as co‐existing with it and/or exacerbating it. It presents as a demarcated, erythematous plaques with vesiculations in the acute phase, or xerotic crusts in the chronic phase. In AD patients with persistently and refractory to therapies dermatitis, ACD should be taken into consideration and patch test performed. A recent study suggested a consistent prevalence of contact sensitizations among children, with higher sensitivity rate among children with AD than without AD. In this study, the most frequent contact allergens reported were nickel sulfate, cobalt chloride, methylisothiazolinone, fragrance mix‐2, potassium dichromate, fragrance mix‐1, and methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone.

Irritant CD is caused by skin injury, direct cytotoxic effects, or cutaneous inflammation from contact with an irritant. Symptoms may occur immediately and may persist if the irritant is unrecognized. Recognition of isolated CD relies on temporal pattern, as well as suggestive distribution. In pediatric patients, irritant CD is most common on the face, dorsal aspect of the hands, and "diaper area", often triggered by frequent cycles of skin wetting and drying as well as exposure to endogenous (e.g. drool, lip‐licking, urine, and feces) or exogenous (e.g. cleansing products, highly alkaline or acidic foods) irritants.

4.2 Infections and infestations

Several factors can contribute to the increased infections in AD such as skin barrier defects, suppression of cutaneous innate immunity by type 2 inflammation, Staphylococcus aureus colonization, and cutaneous dysbiosis. Furthermore, some infections or infestations can mimic AD.

### Clinical trials… [^98ee159b]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients are younger than 30 years, with 90 percent reporting symptoms beginning by five years of age. 2 In this chronic condition, therapy is directed at decreasing inflammation and minimizing symptoms. Available treatments include oral antihistamines, topical emollients, topical doxepin, and topical corticosteroids. It may also be alleviated with attention to bathing habits and avoidance of irritants. Disease severity and location determine which therapies are used. Topical steroids are commonly used to treat moderate to severe disease, but chronic use of these agents at higher concentrations can cause skin atrophy and pigmentation changes. Chronic use of higher potency steroids can also have systemic effects on the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and inhibit growth. These adverse events may limit corticosteroid use in young children and adults in all areas, especially the face and intertriginous zones.

6 Pimecrolimus 1 percent cream was recently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for short-term and intermittent long-term treatment of mild to moderateatopic dermatitis in patients two years and older who do not respond well to or have side effects with conventional treatments.
7. 9, 10 Because it affects a variety of interleukins, it can be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis. Biopsy studies at three and seven days have shown diminished T-cell and eosinophilic infiltrates.
5. CLINICAL TRIALS Several studies have examined the efficacy of topical tacrolimus in adult patients. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 215 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive 0. 03,
0. 1, or 0. 3 percent tacrolimus, or vehicle, applied twice daily. Patients were evaluated at three weeks using atopic dermatitis severity scores. The decrease in scores for the three groups was 67, 83, and 75 percent for the 0.

03,
0. 1, and 0. 3 percent ointments, respectively. The vehicle group showed a 22 percent decrease in severity scores. No statistical difference was found among the three tacrolimus groups, which showed equal efficacy in face, neck, and trunk regions. The only statistically significant side effect in treatment versus vehicle groups was a sensation of local burning, but this effect resulted in no increase in the dropout rate.

Lichen planus of the lip (LPL) is not common, and only a few cases have been reported. Medical treatment modalities for LPL are not always effective. Therefore, treatment of this presentation is difficult and challenging. A 41-year-old man was referred to the dermatology clinic with a chronic, painful erosion on the lower lip and buccal mucosa. Treatment with topical steroids, systemic cyclosporine, dapsone, and systemic steroids failed. We performed surgical excision and mucosal advancement flap treatment, with complete response noted after 6months. Surgical excision with mucosal advancement flap treatment may be effective for the treatment of refractory LPL.

### Topical steroid withdrawal treated with ruxolitinib cream [^31281b06]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

At subsequent clinic visits, the patient reported improvement but occasional flares requiring 48 hours of TCS usage per flare for control (Fig 2). She also had reactions to both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus topicals during this time reporting erythema, swelling, and burning in areas they were applied, discontinuing use of both. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream twice daily was prescribed as an alternative antiinflammatory option.

Fig 2

At her 3 month follow-up, she reported once daily ruxolitinib use with substantial improvement with no erythema or plaques noted on provided images or on focused examination (Fig 3). All burning or itching symptoms had resolved, and she had completely discontinued TCS since starting ruxolitinib with no subsequent flares. Continued daily ruxolitinib treatment was recommended due to chronic nature of her condition and likely rebound effect of rash with decreased medication use frequency. At the time of this paper, she has continued topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream once daily for 5 months with sustained clearance. The plan was to continue to taper off of ruxolitinib cream by changing frequency to 3 times weekly once per day and subsequent further taper over the next several months.

Case 3

A 23-year-old woman with a history of perioral dermatitis was seen in the clinic for evaluation of chronic "dry lips". Her symptoms began 2 years previously when she began picking her lips due to stress and persisted even after she stopped this behavior. Previously effective therapies of clobetasol and tacrolimus lost effectiveness. The physical examination was significant for distinctive lip puckering and thick white scale of the upper and lower lips (Supplementary Fig 2, A, available via Mendeley at).

She was prescribed oral prednisone, clobetasol ointment, and calcipotriene cream, which produced limited improvement. Bacterial cultures demonstrated polymicrobial growth, prompting initiation of oral doxycycline and topical gentamicin. There was no significant improvement 1 month later, and therefore saline soaks, tacrolimus ointment, and gentamicin ointment were prescribed, with overall improvement but persistent intermittent flares (Supplementary Fig 2, B). At last follow-up, she was instructed to use petroleum jelly multiple times per day and tacrolimus ointment twice per day, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors held in reserve due to patient preference.

### Treatment of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis [^9f363761]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The treatment of contact dermatitis lies principally in the avoidance of the offending agent. In certain circumstances, avoidance protocols are insurmountable, and therapy is rendered to assuage the inflammatory component and its consequent objective and subjective findings. However, the options thereafter vary, as some patients will require continuous symptomatic therapy despite avoidance of the purported offending agent. This manuscript will review established treatment options for contact dermatitis, such as corticosteroids and dietary manipulation, as well as discuss some promising new therapies from the last decade, such as the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agents.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — mechanisms of action of topical treatments: Topical therapies can have both local and systemic effects depending on the molecule and systemic absorption. Topical corticosteroids are absorbed into cell membranes, bind to glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and increase production of lipocortin while decreasing stability of mRNA coding for pro‑inflammatory molecules. Topical calcineurin inhibitors bind FK506‑binding protein and suppress calcineurin activity leading to decreased expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and interferon‑gamma and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha; however, TCIs are larger molecules, so they have less systemic absorption. Topical JAK inhibitors inhibit one or many JAK molecules and thereby reduce activation of STAT proteins, also controlling cellular division and growth. PDE4 inhibitors reduce enzymatic activity of PDE4, affecting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn can affect pro‑inflammatory and anti‑inflammatory cytokine synthesis, activation of T cells, and antigen presentation.

Introduction

Lipedematous alopecia (LA) and lipedematous scalp (LS) are 2 rare conditions of unknown etiology that are thought by some to be 2 stages on a spectrum of a single scalp disorder.LA was first described by Coskey et alin 1961, and in 2007, the term spongy scalp was used to describe LA and LS. Both LA and LS conditions are characterized by a localized or diffusely thickened, boggy scalp, but LS lacks alopecia. Associated pruritus and soreness can occur with LA, but most LS patients are asymptomatic. Both conditions are characterized pathologically by a measurable hyperplasia of the subcutaneous tissue.

### Eruption on the vulva and groin [^e249fd02]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: If the patient does not improve with topical medications, a reasonable option would be:
A. Acitretin
B. Methotrexate
C. Chronic high potency topical steroids
D. Combination oral magnesium, low-dose naltrexone, and isotretinoin
E. Systemic corticosteroids

Answers:
A. Acitretin – Incorrect. Acitretin is not recommended in a woman of childbearing age unless disease is severe and unresponsive to other therapies.
B. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate has been reported to be used successfully at doses of 7.5–15 mg weekly but would not be considered first-line treatment in a woman of childbearing age unless disease is severe and unresponsive to other therapies.
C. Chronic high-potency topical steroids – Incorrect. Short-term use of high-potency topical steroids in these anatomic sites is acceptable, but prolonged use should be avoided to avoid atrophy and striae.
D. Combination oral magnesium, low-dose naltrexone, and isotretinoin – Correct. There is no standard treatment for papular acantholytic dyskeratosis that has not responded to topical therapy; however, oral retinoids have successfully induced remission in extensive disease. Oral magnesium may be a useful adjunct, as disease resolution has been observed in Hailey-Hailey disease. Low-dose naltrexone can be added in patients with refractory disease; however, treatment response to naltrexone alone is variable, and relapses may occur.
E. Systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Oral corticosteroids have been used to treat severe flares or as maintenance therapy at low doses. However, adverse effects and worsening disease upon discontinuation limit their use.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^e005d207]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis adjunct medical treatment (Summary Statement 43) indicates that in addition to avoidance of exposure, the physician should prescribe appropriate adjunct medical treatment [Strength of recommendation: Strong B Evidence]. TCS are widely accepted as the treatment of acute and chronic dermatitis, and TCS may be sufficient for localized lesions, but acute extensive and severe dermatitis such as extensive Toxicodendron dermatitis may need systemic therapy. The clinician should avoid the prolonged use of systemic steroids for management of chronic dermatitis. Ointments and potent fluorinated CS should be avoided on areas of thinner skin such as the intertriginous areas, eyelids and face, and in young children. The use of TCS over prolonged periods of time should be avoided and should not be a substitute for defining the etiology of the dermatitis, and if symptoms worsen, the possibility of contact sensitization to the CS itself, the vehicle, or other ingredients in the TCS should be considered.

### Successful treatment of lipoatrophy with normal saline [^0db28f4c]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Our patient was followed over a 9-month period. The alternative treatments mentioned above are expensive and inconvenient, potentially prohibiting patients from following through with experimental treatment. On the other hand, monthly intralesional bacteriostatic saline can be a convenient and affordable treatment for lipoatrophy attributed to intralesional or intra-articular steroids. Our patient had improvement in the appearance of her skin lesions while undergoing monthly injections and had no significant side effects. There may have been faster improvement if she had undergone weekly injections as described previously. However, further studies may help determine if a synergistic effect between time and saline injection is possible, further delineating the need for injections on a monthly versus weekly basis. It is hypothesized that injecting saline where steroid crystals lie would put them back into suspension, where the crystals could then be recognized as foreign bodies and naturally removed from the body. Further studies may help elucidate the mechanism of action and are needed to better characterize optimal treatment dose and frequency.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^fe18cb96]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for atopic dermatitis [^338cd8c8]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Question

Which topical anti-inflammatory treatments are most effective and safe for managing atopic dermatitis?

Bottom Line

In a network meta-analyses, very potent/potent topical corticosteroids; tacrolimus, 0.1%; and topical Janus kinase inhibitors were among the most effective treatments for short-term control of atopic dermatitis symptoms, while phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were among the least effective. Topical calcineurin inhibitors and crisaborole were associated with application-site irritation, and short-term topical steroid use was not associated with skin thinning. However, these findings were of low to moderate certainty, and longer-term data remain limited for many agents.

### A randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of 1% pimecrolimus cream in adult patients with perioral dermatitis [^2ca0f49e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Perioral dermatitis (POD) is a common dermatosis without standard therapy.

Objective

We sought to evaluate pimecrolimus cream 1% in POD.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in adult patients with POD treated twice daily with pimecrolimus cream 1% or vehicle until clearance for up to 4 weeks. Follow-up took place 4 and 8 weeks after treatment.

Results

Patients treated with pimecrolimus had an average POD Severity Index score of 2.6 compared with 3.5 for patients treated with vehicle. Both groups had baseline scores of 5.2. The between-group difference was 0.9 (95% confidence level 0.4, 1.4, P = 0.0011). Patients with history of topical corticosteroids benefited most. Pimecrolimus-treated patients reported greater improvement in quality of life. There were no group differences regarding safety.

Limitations

Pimecrolimus vehicle is not a true placebo.

Conclusions

Pimecrolimus rapidly improves clinical symptoms and quality of life of patients with POD, being most effective in corticosteroid-induced POD.

Case 2

An 18-year-old male patient with a 9-year history of recurrent lip ulcerations presented to our institution initially with oral mucositis and no skin involvement. He did not have a known history of CAP, and HSV was historically negative. The patient presented again 7 months later with recurrent oral mucositis. Laboratory results at that time showed elevated levels of M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG, with no HSV detected by RT-PCR. His lesions resolved with completion of prednisone taper (40, 30, 20, and 10 mg for 1 week each). Over the following year, he reported 4 additional oral mucositis episodes by telephone, which resolved with the above prednisone taper. He returned to clinic 2 years after the initial presentation with recurrent mucositis and no skin involvement (Fig 1, B). Laboratory results again showed elevated M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG. He was treated with prednisone taper (40, 30, 20, and 10 mg for 4 days each) and azithromycin suppressive therapy (250 mg 3 times a week), but he had another episode of oral mucositis 1 month later, reported by telephone, that was treated successfully with an additional course of prednisone taper.

Case 3

A 9-year-old female patient presented with CAP and skin rash (20% of BSA) with oral, ocular, and rectal mucositis. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG, with no HSV detected by RT-PCR. About two years after the initial presentation with CAP and mucositis, she had a recurrent episode with only oral erosions. She was found to have elevated levels of M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG again. Four years after the initial episode, she reported 5 additional episodes, 1 with skin and oral involvement, 3 with only skin involvement, and 1 with only oral involvement. During these episodes (Fig 1, C and D), she was treated with prednisone taper (40, 30, 20, and 10 mg for 4 days each) and azithromycin prophylaxis, which was increased from 250 mg 3 times a week to 5 times a week. Her oral lesions showed improvement within 48 hours of steroid treatment and resolution with completion of the steroid taper, although she had recurrences while on azithromycin prophylaxis, which was increased to 250 mg daily. She had persistent ocular sequelae for several years after her initial episode.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^acc32db8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

Main Results

We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods. Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants). There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids. We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence). In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment. Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance. Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects. Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^51305032]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles altering the potency and giving the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, area of involvement, age of the patient, and most importantly, severity of the condition. Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers such risk for side effects, and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) evaluation — consider ACD in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic eczematous or noneczematous dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. In patients suspected of ACD, patch testing is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. In addition to personal products used by a patient suspected of ACD, review the home and workplace for other sources of contact allergens [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; D Evidence]. Evaluate patients for both irritant and allergic causes, especially in those presenting with hand dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Strong; C Evidence]. Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected and evaluated in the patient with both generalized and anatomically localized skin eruptions (such as the hands, face, eyelids) that come in contact with the substances in the environment [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. In a patient with a facial rash involving the periorbital area (eg, eyelids), evaluate for ACD caused by components of cosmetics, such as fragrances, preservatives, and excipients, because these are common sensitizers of the facial skin [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence]. Evaluate patients presenting with lip dermatitis (cheilitis) and perioral dermatitis for both irritant and allergic causes of contact dermatitis [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence].

### An eczematous eruption with features of prurigo nodularis: an unexpected presentation of α-gal syndrome [^b6318a4b]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 34-year-old male presented to our clinic with a 2 year history of a recurrent pruritic rash on his face, bilateral arms, and trunk (Fig 1, A - D). The rash, which initially appeared on one arm, gradually spread to both arms before eventually covering the entire body, sparing only the back. The rash, especially severe on his face and lips, sometimes caused bleeding. He found minimal relief with over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream. He denied any new triggers, including history of new medications, fragrances, recent hiking, travel, sick contacts, or changes in bedding. He was diagnosed with an eczematous reaction given the morphology of his rash, and was treated with a high-potency topical corticosteroid for prurigo nodularis.

Fig 1
Clinical presentation (A) erythematous edematous papules of upper lips and cheeks (B) Multiple scattered small, erythematous papules of trunk (C and D) erythematous to violaceous eczematous papules of bilateral arms.

Over the following several months, however, these symptoms continued despite the addition of intralesional kenalog injections into prurigo lesions and an intramuscular kenalog injection. Given the persistence of his symptoms, a punch biopsy was performed, which demonstrated a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils consistent with an eczematous eruption.

It was not until a follow-up appointment the following year that he noted lip swelling with the ingestion of a red apple, which resolved spontaneously following treatment with diphenhydramine. He later recalled experiencing lip edema in the past, following ingestion of red meat. Upon further questioning, the patient mentioned a history of a tick bite after hiking several years earlier. AGS was then considered given the history of the angioedema upon red meat ingestion. Lab work-up subsequently revealed an elevated specific serum alpha-gal immunoglobulin E level of 1.12 kU/L (Normal ≤ 0.1 kU/L). The patient was advised to avoid red meat and alpha-gal-containing products, provided with an epinephrine auto-injector, and was referred to allergy/immunology. Follow-up appointments and further testing were scheduled to monitor progress and response to treatment. After eliminating meat, diary, gelatin, and other foods containing alpha-gal, and initiating Dupixent, his skin has shown marked improvement, with significant resolution of his lesions.

Breastfeeding challenges — eczematous conditions with erythematous skin and acute blisters, erosions, weeping/oozing and crust formation or chronic dry, scaling and lichenified areas, where lesions can be pruritic, painful, or even burning, are managed by reducing identifiable triggers, applying an emollient, applying low/medium-strength steroid ointment twice daily for 2 weeks (immediately after a breastfeeding) to maximize contact time before the next breastfeed, using second-generation antihistamines for pruritus, and considering a short course (less than 3 weeks) of oral prednisolone or prednisone in resistant cases.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application… [^24c299a3]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruption, and purpura. 20 Other cutaneous adverse effects include folliculitis, periocular dermatitis, delayed wound healing, gluteal granulomas, telangiectasias and erythema, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, masking or aggravation of dermatophyte infection, secondary infection, and contact dermatitis. 17 Mucocutaneous infections are also common with topical corticosteroid use. 20 The inflammatory suppression from topical corticosteroids can contribute to the prolongation, progression, and atypical presentation of cutaneous infections. Contact sensitization to topical corticosteroids can also occur but is rare. Differentiation from hypersensitivity to other components of the topical treatment is important if contact sensitization is suspected.

22 Topical corticosteroid use has not been associated with adverse effects in patients who are lactating. 20 There is no evidence that topical corticosteroids lose effectiveness over time. 23 However, corticosteroid withdrawal can occur upon cessation after prolonged use on the face and genitals, causing erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, papules, pustules, and edema.
24. 25 Lotions and creams can have a drying effect, which may be useful for acute exudative inflammation. Gels are aqueous, dry rapidly, and leave little residue. Gels often sting when applied to inflamed, fissured, or eroded skin and have a drying effect. They are useful for hairy areas or when the patient wishes to avoid the greasy feeling of ointments, creams, and lotions.

26 Although ointments have classically been considered more potent than creams or lotions, evidence from multiple small, nonblinded, randomized trials suggests that creams, ointments, and lotions have similar levels of effectiveness. 27, 28 Patients typically prefer creams and lotions over ointments because they are less greasy and vanish more easily. Foams may be more preferred for all applications, particularly in areas with thick hair such as the scalp. 29 The choice of formulation should be based on characteristics of the lesion, cost, and patient preference over the potential differences in strength. 26–29.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^6607795f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### What's new in the treatment of atopic dermatitis? [^04198b32]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic, chronic and inflammatory skin disease, with an usual onset in the pediatric age. Several drugs are used in the treatment of this skin disease. Drugs as steroid, calcineurin inhibitors, and moisturizing creams are widely used in the treatment of this disease but often patients are not satisfied with the obtained results. New drugs like dupilumab or crisaborole seem to be a promising option for moderate and severe forms of AD. This article analyzes the newest therapy available today for the treatment of AD.

### Treatment of parthenium dermatitis with methotrexate [^4455d72c]. Contact Dermatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with parthenium dermatitis are often unresponsive to topical steroids, and immunosuppressive agents may be necessary to reduce their need for systemic corticosteroids. We evaluated the efficacy of methotrexate in parthenium dermatitis. Sixteen patients unresponsive to topical treatment were included after baseline investigations, and treated with oral methotrexate (15 mg/week). Clinical response was monitored using a dermatitis area and severity index (DASI). Seven patients completed ≥ 6 months' follow-up, and their mean DASI fell to 5, 2.7 and 2.1 at the end of 1, 3 and 6 months respectively, from a baseline score of 10. Only 3/7 patients required oral prednisolone in the initial 2–4 weeks. Side effects were minor, being mainly folliculitis and furuncles. Methotrexate may hence be a useful alternative for patients with severe parthenium dermatitis.

### Results of a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled efficacy trial of pimecrolimus cream 1% for the treatment of moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis [^b33cb9d2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrheic dermatitis is commonly treated with anti-inflammatory products, including topical corticosteroids. Pimecrolimus cream 1% also exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting T-cell cytokine production.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of twice-daily pimecrolimus for treatment of moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis.

Methods

This double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-week trial randomized patients with seborrheic dermatitis to pimecrolimus or vehicle (1:1). Clinical assessments (erythema [0–3] and scaling [0–3] combined for a total area score [0–6]) were performed at weeks 0, 2, and 4. Inclusion criteria included total area score 4 or greater and erythema 2 or greater. The prespecified primary variable, change from baseline in total area score at week 4, was analyzed using a two-sample t test for intent-to-treat and per protocol populations.

Results

In all, 96 adults of mean age 59.6 years, 88.5% male, were randomized (n = 47 pimecrolimus; 49 vehicle). At week 4, the mean change from baseline in total area score was 3.7 versus 3.3 for pimecrolimus and vehicle groups, respectively (intent-to-treat: P = 0.1913; 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference [-0.195, 0.961]). Per protocol analysis (n = 41 pimecrolimus; 46 vehicle) indicated a significant difference between groups (mean change 3.9 pimecrolimus vs 3.2 vehicle; P = 0.0156; CI [0.129, 1.197]). The superiority of pimecrolimus was observed as early as week 2 (intent-to-treat: P = 0.0062; CI [0.132, 0.777]; per protocol: P = 0.0012; CI [0.410, 1.593]). No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were local, mild, and transient (pimecrolimus = 26%; vehicle = 12%).

Limitations

Generalizability is limited by the elderly male study population.

Conclusion

This study suggests that pimecrolimus cream 1% is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for moderate to severe facial seborrheic dermatitis.

### Clinical dose and adverse effects of topical steroids in daily management of atopic dermatitis [^d9e8191f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Topical steroids are used as the first-line therapy for atopic dermatitis.

Objectives

To determine the clinical doses of topical steroids for the daily treatment of atopic dermatitis in clinics and to elucidate their adverse effects.

Patients and Methods

A multicentre retrospective analysis of a series of 1271 patients (210 infants, 546 children, and 515 adolescents and adults) with atopic dermatitis.

Results

Less than 89.5 g, 135 g and 304 g of topical steroid were applied in 90% of the patients in the infant, childhood, and adolescent and adult AD groups, respectively, on the entire body during the 6-month treatment period. The majority of patients were controlled well; however, 7% of infant, 10% of childhood and 19% of adolescent and adult patients remained in a very severe or severe state or experienced exacerbation even though they applied larger amounts of topical steroids. With regard to adverse effects, the incidence of telangiectasia on cheeks tended to increase in patients who had a longer duration of disease and who applied more than 20 g to the face during the 6-month treatment period. The steroid-induced atrophy of the antecubital and popliteal fossae was more frequently observed in males than in females.

Conclusions

Topical steroids are useful for treating atopic dermatitis, but a substantial percentage of patients cannot be satisfactorily treated with topical steroids. For such patients, adjustments of dose and rank of topical steroids and other therapeutic adjuncts are necessary.

### Atopic dermatitis: a new treatment paradigm using pimecrolimus [^1f34e51a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), often called eczema, is a disease characterized by intense pruritus, erythema, dry skin, and inflammation. Pimecrolimus is a novel steroid-free treatment for AD. Consistently positive results have been found with pimecrolimus treatment in infants, children/adolescents, and adults. Its safety record is excellent, and studies have found no clinically relevant drug-related systemic adverse events. In this article, we first review atopic dermatitis and conventional treatment strategies. We then discuss various aspects of pimecrolimus, including pharmacologic properties, toxicology, short- and long-term studies, and safety and adverse events. Finally, we propose a new steroid-sparing treatment strategy for AD.

### Dermatitis caused by metal allergy after coil embolization for unruptured cerebral aneurysm [^2ea0fa17]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of metal-induced dermatitis after coil embolization for cerebral aneurysm. A 51-year-old woman experienced a rash around the lips and neck 3weeks after coil embolization. Judging from the clinical course and results of several patch tests, platinum coils were considered to have induced the dermatitis. Symptoms were relieved with administration of oral steroids. This represents the first report of metal-induced dermatitis after neuroendovascular treatment. The possibility of metal allergy was difficult to suspect preoperatively. However, early evaluation and referral are important when skin symptoms are observed postoperatively.

### Photodynamic therapy for perioral dermatitis [^7ecb3f1a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of perioral dermatitis (POD) consists of topical steroids, oral antibiotics, and topical antibiotics.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the treatment of POD.

Methods

A split-face 21-patient study was conducted in which one side of the face was treated 4 times weekly with ALA PDT (30-minute ALA incubation) with blue light activation and the other side with topical clindamycin. Lesions were counted and photographs were taken before and after the final treatment. Patient satisfaction was also evaluated.

Results

Fourteen patients (66.7%) completed the study. Facial sides treated with ALA PDT achieved a mean clearance of 92.1% compared to 80.9% for the clindamycin-treated sides. The difference was significant (P = 0.0227). The mean patient satisfaction level for the ALA PDT-treated side was 4.4 (1–5 scale).

Conclusion

ALA PDT may be a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of POD.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^e296266b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Ketoconazole was more effective than placebo at four weeks of follow-up and possibly at three months of follow-up, but few longer-term studies have been conducted. Evidence for this was of low quality. Evidence was insufficient to suggest a dose effect. The most often applied dose was 2%, but the frequency of application of treatments varied between studies from once or twice daily to once or three times weekly for varying lengths of time, and it is unclear which regimen works best.

Ketoconazole did not cause more side effects than were observed with placebo. Topical ketoconazole showed similar efficacy when compared with steroids, but steroids showed a two-fold greater risk of side effects than was seen with ketoconazole. Compared with other antifungals, we cannot say that ketoconazole consistently resulted in a more or less effective outcome because most of these comparisons involved single studies.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo but with a comparable incidence of side effects. Evidence was insufficient to reveal an effect of increased dose. Evidence was of moderate quality. Ciclopirox showed effects similar to those of ketoconazole. No comparisons of ciclopirox versus steroids were reported.

Bifonazaole was also found to be more effective than placebo.

Outome variables in this review were stratified according to site (scalp, face or scalp and face). Treatment outcomes were fairly consistent for ketoconazole and other antifungals across different application sites. Studies provided insufficient evidence that the mode of delivery accounted for consistent differences in treatment effect.

### Diseases of the lips [^d339e5c9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Heath care providers should be comfortable with normal as well as pathologic findings in the lips, because the lips are highly visible and may display clinical manifestations of local, as well as systemic inflammatory, allergic, irritant, and neoplastic alterations. Fortunately, the lips are easily accessible. The evaluation should include a careful history and physical examination, including visual inspection, as well as palpation of the lips and an examination of associated cervical, submandibular, and submental nodes. Pathologic and microscopic studies, as well as a review of medications, allergies, and habits, may further highlight possible etiologies. Many lip conditions, including premalignant changes, are relatively easy to treat, when the abnormalities are detected early; however, advanced disease and malignancies are challenging for both the patient and clinician. Treatment should be focused on eliminating potential irritants or allergens and treatment of the primary dermatosis. In this paper we review physiologic variants as well as pathologic conditions of the lips.

### Topical steroids for atopic dermatitis in primary care [^b54cfe62]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is very common. In most instances, the condition is relatively mild and can be managed in primary care. Topical corticosteroids are the standard therapy for controlling acute 'flares' of dermatitis. However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### A study to assess the occlusivity and moisturization potential of three topical corticosteroid products using the skin trauma after razor shaving (STARS) bioassay [^fe6cbeb3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the epidermal barrier is generally considered a precursor of cutaneous inflammation that can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of skin diseases, notably atopic dermatitis (AD). We also know that topical corticosteroids may actually impair the epidermal barrier by interfering with epidermal lipid synthesis. Therefore, it is important to utilize topical corticosteroids in vehicles that will help at least to enhance the already disrupted epidermal barrier in atopic dermatitis patients. Two studies of identical design were conducted to determine and compare the occlusivity and moisturizing potential of three topical corticosteroid products when applied to skin whose barrier integrity has been disrupted by dry shaving. Findings in both studies showed the clocortolone pivalate cream decreased TEWL better than non-treatment or treatment with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. Skin surface hydration increased significantly (P < 0.001) in all three treated sites, compared to the non-treated damaged control and non-treated normal skin. Clocortolone pivalate cream increased skin surface hydration significantly (P < 0.001) better than hydrocortisone butyrate lipocream or hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. These studies showed that clocortolone pivalate cream enhances barrier function by providing occlusion. While understanding of the structure and function of the stratum corneum (SC) and epidermal barrier function has evolved tremendously over the last several decades, and especially over the last 15 years,1 confusion and misinformation still persist. Dysfunction of the epidermal barrier is generally considered a precursor of cutaneous inflammation that can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of skin diseases, notably atopic dermatitis (AD).2,3 Topical steroids are standard of care in treatment of atopic dermatitis. However, we also know that topical corticosteroids may actually impair epidermal barrier by interfering with epidermal lipid synthesis.4,5 In addition to that, various penetration enhancers in the topical steroid formulations also contribute to the impairment of the epidermal barrier.4 Therefore, it is important to utilize topical corticosteroids in vehicles that will help at least to enhance the already disrupted epidermal barrier in atopic dermatitis patients. In this regard, these studies were designed to determine the hydrating effects of clocortolone pivalate cream 0.1% (Cloderm Cream, Promius Pharma).

### Contact allergy to a shellac-containing mouthguard [^97e308d6]. Contact Dermatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Oral aphthae and lip fissures are common symptoms in dermatologists' daily practice. Arriving at a diagnosis can be challenging and the complaints are notoriously recalcitrant. The differential diagnoses for aphthae include viral infections, immunobullous diseases, and Morbus Behçet. Differential diagnoses for lip fissures include lip lick dermatitis, median lip fissure, or dermatitis artefacta. Patch tests can be useful to determine whether an underlying and relevant contact allergy is present or not. Eliminating the culprit allergen can completely resolve the often long‐lasting symptoms. Most underlying causative agents for lip dermatitis include lip cosmetics, toothpaste and other dental care products, metals (dental or orthodontic devices, musical instruments), food, medications, nail varnishes, and rubber gloves. However, in our case shellac was considered a likely culprit contributing to the clinical picture.

Shellac, also known as lacca (CAS no. 9000‐59‐3), is a natural resinous secretion of the insect Laccifer lacca (Tachardia lacca), currently named Coccus lacca. Shellac is considered a "natural plastic" and used in the food, drug, and cosmetic industries. It is applied in cosmetics for its emollient and coat‐forming characteristics. Shellac can be found in hair sprays, lotions, shampoos, eyeliners, mascaras, nail polishes, lipsticks, and fragrances. In addition, it is used for coating or glazing of food, candies, and medicines. Furthermore, shellac is widely present in dentures and other dental products. Skin sensitization to shellac is rare. Reports of allergic contact dermatitis describe mainly eyelid dermatitis from mascara or eyeliner and contact cheilitis from lipsticks. Patch testing is recommended with shellac 20% in ethanol. This case report adds sport‐related mouthguards as an unusual and possibly underreported cause of contact dermatitis to shellac.

### Steroid acne and rebound phenomenon [^411a6158]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There have been many reports of topical steroids treatment for the face causing perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, and steroid rebound phenomenon.

Objective

To assess patient reported outcomes in patients receiving compounded topical (hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5%) lotion for up to 15 years for common dermatological conditions of the face.

Methods

In a retrospective study, 300 patients were randomly sampled from the dermatology clinic who had used, or were continuing to use, a lotion based, pharmacy-compounded topical preparation for the face. The topical compound was used in therapies for seborrheic dermatitis and combination with prescription topical therapy for patients with acne and rosacea with tolerability problems.

Results

None of the 300 patients experienced steroid acne, rebound phenomenon, or perioral dermatitis associated with use of hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5% on the face.

Conclusion

There was no evidence found that perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, or rebound phenomenon occurs when sulfur is compounded with topical hydrocortisone 0.75%.

### Optimal management of atopic dermatitis [^a9b74014]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Optimal treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis requires the knowledge of its pathogenetic factors and the often time-consuming attention to the course of the disease in each individual patient. In the therapeutic attempt, altered skin barrier function, possible provocation factors and psychological matters have to be taken into account. Basic therapy should comprise optimal skin care and the strict avoidance of triggering factors if possible. During periods of acute exacerbation, topical glucocorticosteroids in combination with classic antihistamines with sedative effects are still the drugs of first choice and will result in the rapid relief of symptoms in most patients. UVA1 phototherapy has proven to be a glucocorticoid-equivalent alternative therapy for exacerbated atopic dermatitis. If superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus is evident, topical antiseptics are useful in treating localized lesions, while a general superinfected eczema should be treated with systemic staphylococcal-effective antibacterials. Cyclosporin or extracorporeal photochemotherapy are reserved for patients with very severe atopic dermatitis that is unresponsive to conventional treatment protocols. Promising future therapeutic approaches consist of an improvement in the antipruritic treatment options, the topical application of immunomodifying treatment modalities or phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and possibly Chinese herbal therapies and psychological intervention strategies.
