## Question

Terazosin for subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terazosin should be used to prevent or treat cerebral vasospasm or delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terazosin's pharmacology and whether its mechanism plausibly maps onto SAH vasospasm biology. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided guidelines or trials mention terazosin for SAH vasospasm. Next, I will review the established pathophysiology of SAH vasospasm and therapies with outcome benefit. Finally, I will balance potential risks of systemic alpha-1 blockade in SAH against any hypothetical benefit and provide a clinical recommendation [^114V23h2] [^113wJH3t].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and labeled use of terazosin. Terazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist approved for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia; it is not labeled for cerebrovascular indications and carries a known risk of first-dose hypotension and syncope, which is explicitly highlighted in the FDA labeling, so I should keep that hemodynamic liability in mind for SAH where cerebral perfusion pressure is critical [^116YBcrr] [^1152whAe]. Mechanistically, this is fundamentally different from nimodipine's L-type calcium channel blockade in cerebral vascular smooth muscle, which is the pharmacologic cornerstone in SAH vasospasm care with outcome benefit, so an alpha-1 blocker would not be expected to reproduce nimodipine's effects or evidence base [^116ikHQb] [^113wJH3t].

> Wait, let me verify whether terazosin appears anywhere in the provided SAH literature or guidelines. I need to check carefully for any mention of alpha-1 antagonists in vasospasm prevention or rescue therapy. Hold on, I should verify this across the guideline documents and trial summaries: there are no mentions of terazosin for SAH vasospasm in the provided corpus; the only terazosin entries are FDA labeling and contraindication, and the AHA/ASA guidelines do not include alpha-1 blockers among recommended therapies for vasospasm or DCI [^1152whAe] [^116YBcrr] [^114V23h2] [^115CQ9s8].

> Next, I should review vasospasm pathophysiology to see if alpha-1 antagonism would even target the main drivers. The literature consistently centers on calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, endothelin-1 upregulation, nitric oxide pathway dysfunction, and enhanced myogenic tone in cerebral arteries after SAH; alpha-1 adrenergic signaling is not identified as a primary determinant in the canonical models of delayed vasospasm [^11566Afd] [^116NAtFu] [^113hSQAf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether blocking sympathetic tone might help given the massive catecholamine surge after SAH, but that surge is more clearly linked to cardiac dysfunction and hemodynamic instability rather than the specific calcium/endothelin-driven constriction of large cerebral arteries implicated in DCI, so targeting alpha-1 receptors systemically is unlikely to correct the core cerebral vascular pathology [^113ErFWf].

> I will now examine what therapies the guidelines actually endorse and the level of evidence. Let me confirm: oral nimodipine is the only pharmacologic agent with consistent evidence of improving functional outcomes, and its early enteral administration for 21 days is standard of care in aSAH; no guideline tier includes alpha-1 blockers for DCI prevention or vasospasm treatment [^115CQ9s8] [^114V23h2]. I should double-check the trial synthesis: calcium antagonists overall reduce poor outcomes with the clearest effect from oral nimodipine, which underpins its strong recommendation in practice [^113wJH3t].

> Next, I should review hemodynamic management principles because terazosin's main adverse effect profile is hypotension. The guidelines emphasize maintaining euvolemia to prevent DCI and explicitly advise against prophylactic hemodynamic augmentation to avoid iatrogenic harm; in this context, adding a systemic vasodilator with first-dose hypotension risk would threaten cerebral perfusion pressure without any proven cerebral benefit, which is particularly concerning in SAH [^111EeDGt] [^116CCyva]. Let me consider nimodipine's own liability — hypotension — and verify: even nimodipine-induced hypotension is a recognized concern requiring careful titration and monitoring, yet nimodipine's net benefit is maintained because of outcome data; terazosin would add hypotension risk without any SAH-specific efficacy signal, which shifts the risk-benefit calculus unfavorably [^114DGEVW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that any vasodilator that reduces angiographic vasospasm improves outcomes. I should review comparators: endothelin receptor antagonism with clazosentan consistently reduces angiographic vasospasm and even vasospasm-related DCI, but fails to improve functional outcomes or mortality and increases adverse events, underscoring that mechanistic vasodilation alone is insufficient to demonstrate patient-centered benefit in SAH [^114cdxHt] [^1137KB6i] [^113e8roB]. Likewise, high-dose IV nicardipine reduces symptomatic vasospasm but does not improve 3-month outcomes, illustrating that the bar for adoption is outcome benefit, not just vessel caliber change or flow velocity reduction [^112TNRTE].

> Let me synthesize and ensure there are no overlooked scenarios. There is no indication for terazosin in SAH vasospasm within the provided evidence, its mechanism does not target the principal calcium/endothelin/NO axes of delayed vasospasm, and its hemodynamic profile risks lowering mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in a population where that can precipitate ischemia; by contrast, nimodipine remains the only agent with outcome benefit, and refractory cases should proceed to guideline-supported endovascular options such as intra-arterial vasodilators or angioplasty rather than systemic alpha-1 blockade [^113wJH3t] [^115xyhZ6] [^114V23h2].

> Final clinical recommendation: Terazosin should not be used for prevention or treatment of cerebral vasospasm or delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, given the absence of supporting evidence, mechanistic mismatch, and potential harm from hypotension; adhere to early enteral nimodipine and employ guideline-directed monitoring and endovascular rescue strategies when indicated [^115CQ9s8] [^114pLL6G] [^115xyhZ6].

Terazosin is not recommended for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage because there is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use and it is not included in current AHA/ASA guidelines [^115CQ9s8]. Terazosin's alpha-1 blockade can cause hypotension [^116YBcrr], which may worsen cerebral perfusion in SAH patients [^112TNRTE]. The standard of care remains **nimodipine** [^113wJH3t] [^115CQ9s8], with induced hypertension [^116g6aGK] and endovascular therapy for refractory cases [^115xyhZ6] [^114V23h2].

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

Terazosin is an **alpha-1 antagonist** that reduces vascular tone and blood pressure [^116YBcrr]; theoretically, it could dilate cerebral arteries and mitigate vasospasm. However, **alpha-1 blockade** can lower systemic blood pressure, potentially reducing cerebral perfusion and risking ischemia in SAH patients [^112TNRTE].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting terazosin for cerebral vasospasm after SAH [^116ikHQb]. Current **AHA/ASA guidelines** [^115CQ9s8] do not mention terazosin for vasospasm or DCI management [^114V23h2].

---

## Comparison with established treatments

Nimodipine is the **only pharmacologic agent** [^113wJH3t] with strong evidence and guideline support for vasospasm and DCI prevention after SAH [^115CQ9s8]. Induced hypertension [^116g6aGK] and **endovascular therapies** (angioplasty, intra-arterial vasodilators) are recommended for refractory vasospasm [^115xyhZ6] [^114V23h2]. By contrast, terazosin lacks evidence and is **not recommended** [^115CQ9s8].

---

## Safety considerations

Terazosin can cause **hypotension**, dizziness, and syncope [^116YBcrr], which may **worsen cerebral perfusion** and increase ischemic risk in SAH patients [^112TNRTE]. These risks outweigh any theoretical benefit.

---

## Current clinical practice and expert opinion

Terazosin is **not used in current practice** for cerebral vasospasm after SAH. Experts recommend **nimodipine** [^115CQ9s8], **induced hypertension** [^114bsTLe], and **endovascular therapy** for refractory cases [^115xyhZ6] [^114V23h2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Terazosin is **not recommended** for cerebral vasospasm after SAH due to the lack of evidence and guideline support [^115CQ9s8], and the potential for hypotension-related harm [^116YBcrr]. The standard of care remains **nimodipine** [^113wJH3t], with **induced hypertension** [^112TNRTE] and **endovascular therapy** for refractory vasospasm [^115xyhZ6] [^114V23h2].

### Role of levosimendan in the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113ErFWf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is one of the leading causes of neurologic disability, accounting for dismal long-term survival rates. aSAH leads to a sudden increase in intracranial pressure and a massive sympathetic discharge. Excessive sympathetic stimulation results in catecholamine-mediated myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic instability, which may critically hamper brain perfusion and oxygenation.

In the setting of acute aSAH, the administration of vasoactive drugs aims to stabilize impaired hemodynamics. However, studies have shown that conventional treatment with vasoactive drugs, which lead to Ca(+2) overload and increased myocardial oxygen consumption, fails to restore hemodynamics and decreases cerebral blood flow. Levosimendan is a non-adrenergic inotropic Ca(+2) sensitizer with not only beneficial hemodynamic properties but also pleiotropic effects, contributing to its cardioprotective and neuroprotective role.

Although there have been limited data regarding the use of levosimendan in patients with aSAH, evidence suggests that levosimendan may play a role in the setting of post-aSAH cardiomyopathy and decreased cerebral blood flow, both in emergency departments and intensive care units. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of studies on levosimendan therapy for aSAH and describe knowledge about the effects of levosimendan in the management of aSAH.

### Modifiable risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage: Narrative review with an emphasis on common controversies and epidemiologic pitfalls [^114979HE]. Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively low and decreasing incidence, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurologic causes of death and disability, especially among middle-aged people. Although the prognosis of patients with SAH has improved over recent decades, up to one-fourth of patients with SAH still die before reaching hospital care. Considering the high SAH death rate and the substantial role of modifiable risk factors in SAH mortality and morbidity, evidence-based primary prevention strategies relying on high-quality epidemiologic estimates are of considerable interest when aiming to decrease the burden of SAH.

The relatively low incidence, high prehospital death rate, substantial geographical differences, and complex disease origin of both environmental and genetic components make SAH epidemiology a challenging topic to study. In optimal scenarios, high-quality studies on SAH epidemiology, particularly focusing on its incidence and risk factors, should include decade-long follow-ups of hundreds of thousands of people from multiple geographical regions to achieve sufficient and representative sample sizes. Furthermore, prospectively collected data in such studies should consist of both genetic and environmental factors to evaluate the independent and causal effects of potential risk factors. Understandably, conducting such high-quality studies including all those features is often overly cumbersome. This has consequently led to the usage of more practical and convenient, yet often suboptimal, study designs with a higher risk.

### Vasospasm-induced spreading depolarization and/or spreading-depolarization-induced vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114nZpUb]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Low credibility.

The discovery that spreading depolarizations (SDs) can be acutely induced by injecting autologous blood into the subarachnoid space or by micropuncture of a cortical vessel dates back to Hubschmann and Kornhauser, who demonstrated this in cats in 1980. In the last sentence of the abstract, the two authors explicitly hypothesized that cortical cells, rather than blood vessels, are the primary targets in the initial stages of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Furthermore, in the introduction they wrote, "Objections to the concept linking the vasospasm directly with the neurological deficit have been raised on theoretical grounds, and the clinical relationship between the presence of vasospasm and the neurological deficit in patients has been poor". These statements alone show that the controversy about the pathogenesis of early and delayed focal brain damage after SAH has a long and checkered history.

### Beyond nimodipine: Advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia [^116ikHQb]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). High credibility.

In this narrative review, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and overall level of evidence for nimodipine alternatives in the prevention and treatment of aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm and DCI are outlined. The reported data also lead to a grading of the strength of the recommendations for the nimodipine alternative drugs, the rationale for which is to overcome some of the intrinsic shortcomings of nimodipine itself.

- **Nimodipine pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, strengths and weaknesses**: The incidence of vasospasm in large series has been reported to be higher in medial and anterior circulation aneurysms, while lower rates have been observed in ruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysms. These findings have also been confirmed in the authors' own series. Nimodipine is the backbone in the prevention and treatment of vasospasm and ischemic-related complications, being the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the AHA/ASA guidelines. Although it is known to inhibit the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels of vascular smooth muscles, this phenomenon is not held responsible for improving the clinical outcome of SAH and DCI patients. Possible proposed mechanisms of action targeting vasospasm are instead an increase in fibrinolytic activity, neuroprotection, and inhibition of cortical spreading ischemia. There are a few doubts about the advantages of nimodipine oral administration in decreasing the induced blood pressure oscillations. Conversely, there is a possible significant rise in favorable outcomes.

### Management of cerebral vasospasm [^112a49vr]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm is the delayed narrowing of the large arteries of the circle of Willis, occurring 4 to 14 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is one cause of delayed deterioration after SAH but is generally the most important potentially treatable cause of morbidity and mortality following SAH. The development of vasospasm is best predicted by the volume, location, persistence, and density of the subarachnoid clot early after SAH.

Diagnosis is made by catheter angiography or, with less accuracy, by computed tomographic angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasound, or other methods. Treatment remains problematic because it is expensive, time-consuming, associated with substantial risk, and largely ineffective. Treatment includes the optimization of factors that affect cerebral blood flow and metabolism, systemic administration of nimodipine, hemodynamic therapy, and pharmacologic and mechanical angioplasty.

### Efficacy of intra-arterial nimodipine in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm complicating subarachnoid haemorrhage [^111MaXXP]. Clinical Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of nimodipine as an alternative to papaverine for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, anaesthetic records, clinical charts, and CT and angiographic images of 9 patients who had received intra-arterial nimodipine; 1 of these patients received both nimodipine and papaverine. The difference in arterial luminal diameter before and after treatment was calculated as a percentage change.

- **Results**: The average dose of nimodipine administered per vessel was 3.3 mg. The mean increase in arterial diameter was 66.6% in the vasospastic segment. There was no significant change in blood pressure of any of the subjects during endovascular treatment of vasospasm.

- **Conclusion**: Intra-arterial nimodipine is effective in improving angiographic vasospasm complicating subarachnoid haemorrhage. Further studies aimed at examining the clinical benefits of nimodipine are warranted, particularly in view of the low risk of adverse side effects of nimodipine when compared with papaverine.

### Controversies in the endovascular management of cerebral vasospasm after intracranial aneurysm rupture and future directions for therapeutic approaches [^116hHfnu]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite maximal medical therapy, up to 15% of patients surviving the ictus of subarachnoid hemorrhage experience stroke or death from vasospasm. For cases of vasospasm that are refractory to medical treatment, endovascular techniques are frequently used, including balloon angioplasty with or without intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators, combined endovascular modalities, and aortic balloon devices.

In this article, various therapeutic approaches to endovascular management are reviewed, emphasizing their expanding role in managing this condition. Moving forward, rigorous prospective outcome assessments after endovascular treatment of cerebral vasospasm are necessary to clearly delineate the efficacy and indications for these techniques.

The clinical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-associated vasospasm remains a challenge in neurosurgical practice, with its prevention and treatment having a major impact on neurological outcomes. While considered a mainstay, nimodipine is burdened by some non-negligible limitations that make it a suboptimal candidate for pharmacotherapy in SAH. This narrative review aims to provide an update on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, overall evidence, and strength of recommendation of nimodipine alternative drugs for aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. A PRISMA literature search was performed in the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases.

### Long-term clinical trajectory of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: Linking acute care and neurorehabilitation [^114bsTLe]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Clinical management of patients with SAH conformed to international guidelines set forth by the American Heart Association and European Stroke Association, with the exception that nimodipine was routinely administered intravenously in patients with poor-grade SAH. The Hunt and Hess scale score (H&H) and the modified Fisher Score were used to assess the clinical and radiographic disease severity on admission. Ruptured aneurysms were treated, according to the consultation of an interdisciplinary team (consisting of neurology, neuroradiology, and neurosurgery), by either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling.

All patients were repeatedly screened for the development of large-vessel cerebral vasospasm using transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (LOGIQ S8; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Mean velocities > 120 cm/s in the middle or anterior cerebral artery or daily changes in mean velocities > 50 cm/s were defined as vasospasm. Patients who developed vasospasm were treated with induced hypertension, targeting a cerebral perfusion pressure > 80 mmHg, with individual adjustments being made on the basis of clinical, radiographic, and multimodal neuromonitoring data. Severe refractory vasospasm (> 200 cm/s) was further confirmed by catheter cerebral panangiogram and evaluated for intraarterial nimodipine application. Delayed cerebral ischemia was defined as a clinical deterioration of ≥ 2 points on the Glasgow Coma Score or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the occurrence of new focal neurological symptoms.

### Beyond nimodipine: Advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia [^114DGEVW]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The clinical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-associated vasospasm remains a challenge in neurosurgical practice, with its prevention and treatment having a major impact on the neurological outcome of the patient. Angiographic and clinically symptomatic vasospasm has been reported to account for up to 70% and 30% of patients, respectively, while delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) occurs in nearly 20%. Both have known detrimental effects on the brain.

Oral nimodipine is the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for cerebral vasospasm and DCI, as it is associated with improved outcomes and reduced mortality in patients with SAH, supported by indiscriminate type 1A evidence. Based on this data, it is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the latest AHA/ASA guidelines.

However, nimodipine-induced hypotension is a serious concern, as blood pressure fluctuations have been associated with the development of focal deficits and worse outcomes. The short half-life, pharmacokinetic variability, drug-drug interactions, and risk of vasoplegia are further shortcomings.

In recent years, drugs other than nimodipine have shown better pharmacokinetic profiles, but their efficacy and safety are still unclear. The narrative review reported here aims to provide a comprehensive update on the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, overall evidence, and strength of recommendation for nimodipine alternative drugs in the prevention and treatment of aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm and DCI.

### Factors associated with the development of vasospasm after planned surgical treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^117PK2QX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to determine factors associated with the development of symptomatic vasospasm among patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who participated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tirilazad between 1991 and 1997.

Data obtained from 3567 patients entered into trials of tirilazad were analyzed using uni- and multivariate logistic regression to determine factors that predict the development of symptomatic vasospasm. Symptomatic vasospasm was defined by clinical criteria accompanied by laboratory- and radiologically determined exclusion of other causes of neurological deterioration. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic and/or angiographic confirmation was not required. In these patients, the aneurysms were scheduled to be treated surgically, and no patient undergoing endovascular treatment was included.

A multivariate analysis showed that factors significantly associated with vasospasm were age 40 to 59 years, history of hypertension, worse neurological grade, thicker blood clot on the cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan obtained on hospital admission, larger aneurysm size, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), prophylactic use of induced hypertension, and not participating in the first European tirilazad study.

Symptomatic vasospasm was associated with the amount of SAH on the CT scan, the presence of IVH, and the patient's neurological grade. The association with patient age may reflect alterations in vessel reactivity associated with age.

### Methodological assessment of guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cerebral vasospasm using the AGREE-II tool [^1121UYf5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2022). Low credibility.

The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is the most common cause of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite recent advances in its early detection, diagnosis, and treatment, the outcome for patients experiencing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains poor. Cerebral vasospasm is a well-known, troublesome complication of aSAH, and delayed cerebral ischemia related to cerebral vasospasm is a major cause of unfavorable outcomes in patients with aSAH. Evidence-based guidelines are crucial for the prevention, early detection, and efficient management of aSAH-induced vasospasm. Additionally, guidelines provide young physicians with a valuable tool for practicing defensible medicine. However, the methodology, clinical applicability, reporting clarity, and biases of guidelines require periodic assessment. This study aimed to evaluate the reporting clarity and methodological quality of published guidelines and recommendations.

A search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The search terms used were "clinical practice guidelines", "recommendations", "stroke", "subarachnoid hemorrhage", and "vasospasm" in all possible combinations. The search period extended from 1964 to September 2021 and was limited to literature published in the English language. All published guidelines and recommendations reporting on the diagnosis and management of vasospasm were included, while studies other than those reporting guidelines and recommendations were excluded.

### Efficacy and safety of clazosentan after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: An updated meta-analysis [^114cdxHt]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Clazosentan has been studied to treat cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials updates the knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of clazosentan compared with placebo after aSAH.

- **Methods**: Databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials directly comparing the use of clazosentan and placebo for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after aSAH. Additional eligibility criteria were the report of any of the outcomes of interest (vasospasm, morbidity, functional outcome, or mortality). The primary outcome was vasospasm-related delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The analyses were stratified by clazosentan dosage (low or high dose) and aneurysm treatment modality (clipping or coiling). The Cochrane RoB-2 tool was used for studies quality assessment.

- **Results**: Six studies comprising seven clinical trials were included, involving 2778 patients. Clazosentan decreased the risk of vasospasm-related DCI (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.38–0.81) and delayed ischemic neurological deficit (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50–0.80). Angiographic vasospasm (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.47–0.61) was also decreased. Functional outcomes (favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.24) and death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71–1.49) did not change. Meanwhile, adverse events were increased by clazosentan (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.76).

- **Conclusion**: Clazosentan decreased vasospasm-related DCI and angiographic vasospasm but did not improve functional outcomes or mortality. Adverse events were increased.

### Mechanisms of disease: Roles of nitric oxide and endothelin-1 in delayed cerebral vasospasm produced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^11566Afd]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Molecular biologic investigations in the past decades have begun to unravel the intracellular mechanisms involved in the vasomotor regulation of cerebral blood vessels and their failure in delayed cerebral vasospasm produced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Progress in deciphering macrovascular regulatory mechanisms and their failure in delayed cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has revealed that there are at least two important vasoactive substances — nitric oxide and endothelin-1 — that play significant roles in the clinical manifestations of subarachnoid-hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm.

Nitric oxide is a cell-membrane-permeable free radical gas that accounts for the phenomenon of vasodilatation by various vasodilator agents. Endothelin-1, a 21-amino-acid peptide, is one of the most potent constricting factors. Cerebral vasospasm is thought to represent a disturbance in the cerebral vasomotor equilibrium for which these two physiologically antagonistic compounds are at least partly responsible. Advances in our understanding of the molecular responses of the cerebral vasculature to subarachnoid hemorrhage should lead to more comprehensive management as knowledge becomes translated into the development of effective pharmacologic agents to reverse or prevent cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Beyond nimodipine: Advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia [^112cnk6B]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic considerations of nimodipine alternative drugs

Within the type 1a evidence-grade A recommendation drugs, nicardipine and cilostazol have a longer half-life than nimodipine, which theoretically makes them advantageous in decreasing the negative effects of blood pressure fluctuations. Eicosapentaenoic acid, dapsone, and clazosentan also show an optimal pharmacokinetic profile within the type 1b evidence-grade B recommendation group.

Eicosapentaenoic acid is primarily metabolized by the adrenal glands and kidneys, making its use more appropriate in conjunction with phenytoin, due to the latter's induction effect on the cytochrome P-450 complex, or in poor nimodipine metabolizers. Nicardipine is mainly excreted via bile, which renders it safer for use in patients with acute and chronic renal failure.

Non-vasospasm related DCI and drugs targeting DCI

DCI is known to cause delayed clinical deterioration after SAH through mechanisms other than cerebral vasospasm, which, however, remains the most significant factor occurring at the level of larger extraparenchymal vessels. These additional mechanisms include (1) microcirculatory constriction, (2) microthrombosis, (3) cortical spreading depolarization and ischemia, and (4) neuroinflammation.

Microcirculatory constriction involves the disruption of cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and the blood-brain barrier. Each of these factors has detrimental effects on cerebral blood flow, primarily affecting the distal vasculature of the supratentorial region.

### Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^112TNRTE]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of DCI is usually approached with nimodipine, maintenance of normal circulating blood volume, and induced hypertension. Nimodipine, a calcium antagonist, is useful in the management of vasospasm and DCI when administered orally; however, its intravenous use is not recommended based on current evidence. High-dose IV nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg/h for 14 days) reduces symptomatic vasospasm, but does not improve neurological outcomes at 3 months according to the results of a multicenter prospective double-blind RCT. Consequently, the routine use of IV nicardipine is not indicated.

The value of HHH therapy, which includes induced hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution, is not validated and requires further study in RCTs. Hypertension is the most crucial component of HHH therapy as it increases cerebral blood flow, brain tissue oxygen levels, and helps reverse neurological symptoms. However, there are currently insufficient data to confirm the usefulness of hypervolemic therapy. Hypervolemic therapy results in decreased brain tissue oxygenation, fluid overload, and is associated with deleterious cardiac and pulmonary events. Isovolumic and hypervolemic hemodilution increase global cerebral blood flow, but are associated with decreased oxygen delivery.

Balloon angioplasty for distal vasospasm, refractory to medical management, has been shown to be beneficial in smaller retrospective analyses. Intra-arterial papaverine effectively relieves vasospasm, but its effects are transient, lasting about 3 hours, thus requiring multiple infusions. Elevated ICP is a frequent complication of intra-arterial papaverine therapy.

### The incidence of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DrpR7]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

This review was undertaken according to a pre-published protocol (PROSPERO registration CRD42020191895) and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies where the population was adults following aSAH. The intervention or exposure was any pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapy, the control group was not restricted, and the incidence of cerebral arterial vasospasm (as defined in the included studies) was reported. We excluded studies with a sample size of fewer than 40 participants due to the potential for bias and resource constraints.

- **Search strategy**: The search strategy was devised with the assistance of a research librarian. Our primary electronic search was conducted using Medline and EMBASE via the OVID interface and PubMed. We included search terms for subarachnoid haemorrhage, vasospasm, and delayed cerebral ischaemia, along with specific terms to identify randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies. We limited the searches to studies published in English with human subjects and focused on studies published after 2008 to obtain a contemporary cohort. We manually searched the reference lists of review articles and included published manuscripts and abstracts of conference proceedings. The full search strategy is included in the Supplementary Material.

- **Selection process**: The titles and abstracts of all identified study reports were independently screened by two authors, with reports identified by either reviewer that could potentially have met eligibility criteria subjected to full-text review.

### Extravascular blood augments myogenic constriction of cerebral arterioles: Implications for hemorrhage-induced vasospasm [^113hSQAf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a serious clinical condition that impairs local cerebral blood flow perfusion and consequently initiates neuronal dysfunction. Pressure-sensitive myogenic vasomotor regulation is an important mechanism involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow. We hypothesized that extravascular hemolyzed blood enhances arteriolar myogenic constriction, which in vivo may contribute to the reduction of local cerebral blood flow after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Methods and results**: Arterioles isolated from the middle cerebral artery of mice were cannulated in a perfusion chamber. Arteriolar diameters in response to step increases in intraluminal pressure (20–120 mm Hg) were measured in various experimental conditions. All arterioles exhibited myogenic vasoconstrictions in response to increases in intraluminal pressure. Compared with controls, the pressure-induced constriction was significantly enhanced in arterioles in vitro exposed to extravascular hemolyzed blood or different concentrations of extracellular erythrocyte lysate (1%, 10%, and 20%) for different exposure durations (1–6 hours). The magnitude of enhancement was proportional to the lysate concentration and exposure duration. During in vivo experiments, 10 µL of autologous blood lysate were injected into the mouse subarachnoid space on the surface of the left. Two hours later, arterioles were isolated, and left arterioles displayed enhanced myogenic responses compared with the right. The enhanced myogenic response was prevented by scavenge of superoxide in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

### "Triple-H" therapy for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114RP1yT]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The combination of induced hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution — known as triple-H therapy — is often utilized to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although this paradigm has gained widespread acceptance over the past 20 years, the efficacy of triple-H therapy and its precise role in the management of the acute phase of SAH remain uncertain. Additionally, triple-H therapy may carry significant medical morbidity, including pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, hyponatremia, renal medullary washout, indwelling catheter-related complications, cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral edema. This review examines the evidence underlying the implementation of triple-H therapy, providing practical recommendations for its use in patients with aneurysmal SAH.

### Cerebral infarction after subarachnoid hemorrhage contributes to poor outcome by vasospasm-dependent and -independent effects [^111NCYU7]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains incompletely understood. It is generally assumed that it is caused by angiographic vasospasm. Our aim was to clarify the relationship among angiographic vasospasm, neurological worsening, cerebral infarction, and poor outcome, and to investigate whether cerebral infarction also contributes to poor outcome by vasospasm-independent effects.

- **Methods**: This exploratory analysis used data from 413 patients included in the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial. We studied the incidence of neurological worsening, cerebral infarction, and poor outcome in patients with and without angiographic vasospasm. Path analysis implemented by structural equation modeling was performed to determine direct and indirect path coefficients.

- **Results**: Of the 194 patients with moderate to severe vasospasm, 43% had neurological worsening of any cause, 20% had cerebral infarction, and 46% experienced a poor outcome. Path coefficients for direct effects on poor outcome were 0.20 for World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Grade 4 to 5, 0.13 for the history of hypertension, 0.19 for angiographic vasospasm, 0.16 for neurological worsening, and 0.11 for new cerebral infarction. Cerebral infarction contributed to poor outcome by vasospasm-dependent and -independent effects.

- **Conclusions**: Our data show that the majority of patients with moderate to severe angiographic vasospasm did not have neurological worsening of any cause.

### Comparison between clipping and coiling on the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WP72J]. Neurosurgical Review (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm is one of the most important complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The effect of aneurysm occlusion technique on the incidence of vasospasm is not exactly known. The objective was to analyze surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling on the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and its consequences. Using the MEDLINE PubMed (1966-present) database, all English-language manuscripts comparing patients treated by surgical clipping with patients treated by endovascular coiling, regarding vasospasm incidence after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, were analyzed.

Data extracted from eligible studies included the following outcome measures: incidence of total vasospasm, symptomatic vasospasm, ischemic infarct vasospasm-induced, and delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND). A pooled estimate of the effect size was computed, and the test of heterogeneity between studies was carried out using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software, RevMan 4.2. Nine manuscripts that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included and analyzed. The studies differed substantially with respect to design and methodological quality. The overall results showed no significant difference between clipping and coiling regarding outcome measures. According to the available data, there is no significant difference between the types of technique used for aneurysm occlusion (clipping or coiling) on the risk of cerebral vasospasm development and its consequences.

### Advances in vasospasm treatment and prevention [^113mTo7w]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

The outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) depends on several factors, including the severity of the initial event, perioperative medical management, surgical variables, and the incidence of complications. Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is a condition that fails to consistently respond to treatment, emphasizing the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. This paper reviews the relevant literature on the main therapies employed for CV after aSAH and discusses possible avenues for future investigations.

Management of this condition consists of maximal medical therapy, including the triple H regimen and the oral administration of calcium antagonists. This may be followed by endovascular balloon angioplasty and/or injection of vasodilatory agents for refractory cases. As the precise pathophysiology of CV is further elucidated, the development of promising investigational therapies is anticipated.

### Controversies in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1148sZTc]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The care of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has evolved significantly with the advent of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Although these advances are believed to have contributed to improved outcomes, considerable uncertainty persists regarding key areas of management.

- **Objective**: To review selected controversies in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a special emphasis on endovascular versus surgical techniques for securing aneurysms, the diagnosis and therapy of cerebral vasospasm, neuroprotection, antithrombotic and anticonvulsant agents, cerebral salt wasting, and myocardial dysfunction, as well as to suggest venues for further clinical investigation.

- **Data source**: Search of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases and manual review of article bibliographies.

- **Data synthesis and conclusions**: Many aspects of care in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remain highly controversial and warrant further resolution through hypothesis-driven clinical or translational research. It is anticipated that the rigorous evaluation and implementation of such data will provide a basis for improvements in short- and long-term outcomes.

### Signaling mechanisms in cerebral vasospasm [^116NAtFu]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The elusive nature of events that sustain cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured aneurysm presents major challenges in designing effective therapies for this frequently devastating condition. Protracted cerebral artery constriction entails several dynamic components in intracellular signaling events initiated by endothelial factors, products of hemolysate, and numerous kinases, as well as increased intracellular Ca(2+). The rationale for potential treatment modalities and their efficacy are discussed in this brief review.

### Beyond nimodipine: Advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia [^115XMGQL]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Microthrombosis of the distal cerebral vasculature is the final result of documented impairments in both the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). While having a rationale, aspirin and enoxaparin failed to prove clear benefits. Although effective for strictly addressing vasospasm, statins were found to be unable to decrease the rate of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and mortality. The efficacy of the recombinant ADAMTS-13 is still limited to in-vitro observations. Intracisternal thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) recorded some beneficial results in a meta-analysis by Amin-Hanjani et al, which were largely mitigated by a phase II trial conducted by Etminan and colleagues.

Cortical spreading depolarization is a disorder arising from a slowly propagating depolarization wave causing amplified metabolic activity and a serious disturbance in ion homeostasis. It is correlated with arteriolar vasoconstriction, cortical spreading ischemia, and inverse neurovascular coupling, ultimately leading to a glutamate-induced neurotoxic release mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alfa-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptors. The rationale for using anticonvulsants for the prevention and management of DCI stems from the need to counteract epileptogenic complications. NMDA antagonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitors, anesthetics, topiramate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists have been tested with promising preclinical data.

A robust neuroinflammation has proved to underlie both aneurysm formation and aneurysmal SAH, contributing to increasing the risk of DCI.

### Intra-arterial nimodipine for the treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: Preliminary results [^111hF8Gr]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm remains a significant challenge in patients recovering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, despite advances in medical, surgical, and endovascular care. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of intra-arterial nimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker that primarily targets cerebral vessels, in preventing delayed neurologic deficits in patients with symptomatic vasospasm.

Clinical charts of 25 consecutively treated patients were retrospectively reviewed. A multifactorial decision tree was employed to determine the indications for angiography and subsequent endovascular treatment. Nimodipine was infused intra-arterially via a diagnostic catheter into the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery at a rate of 0.1 mg/min. The study assessed angiographic vasospasm before endovascular treatment, immediate vessel caliber modifications, and the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of the procedure.

Thirty procedures were performed on 25 patients. Clinical improvement was observed in 19 patients (76%), 16 of whom improved after the first endovascular procedure, two after the second intra-arterial treatment, and one after the third. Notably, only 12 (63%) of these 19 patients showed significant vascular dilatation at postprocedural angiography. Dilatation of infused vessels occurred in only 13 (43%) of the 30 procedures. After a follow-up of 3–6 months, 18 (72%) of the 25 patients had a favorable outcome, evidenced by a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 1–2 and a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2. No complications were observed.

Intra-arterial nimodipine is effective and safe for the treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Dissociation of vasospasm-related morbidity and outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with clazosentan: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1137KB6i]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Clazosentan therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been found to be effective in reducing the incidence of vasospasm in randomized controlled trials. However, while vasospasm-related morbidity, including delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) and delayed cerebral infarctions, was consistently decreased, statistical significance was not demonstrated, and outcomes were not affected by clazosentan treatment. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether clazosentan treatment after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduced the incidence of DINDs and delayed cerebral infarctions and improved outcomes.

- **Methods**: All randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of clazosentan were retrieved via searches with sensitive and specific terms. Six variables were abstracted after the assessment of the methodological quality of the trials. Analyses were performed following the method guidelines of the Cochrane Back Review Group.

- **Results**: Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials met eligibility criteria, enrolling a total of 2181 patients. The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of DINDs (relative risk [RR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.92]) and delayed cerebral infarction (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63–1.00]) in patients treated with clazosentan after aneurysmal SAH. However, this treatment regimen was not shown to affect outcomes, including functional outcomes measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (RR 1.12 [95% CI 0.96–1.30]) or mortality (RR 1.02 [95% CI 0.70–1.49]). Adverse events, including pulmonary complications and anemia, were noted.

### Medical treatment failure for symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage threatens long-term outcome [^116g6aGK]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Symptomatic vasospasm is a common cause of morbidity and mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study aimed to identify predictors and the long-term impact of treatment failure with hypertensive therapy for symptomatic vasospasm.

Methods involved a retrospective analysis of 1,520 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients enrolled in the Columbia University SAH Outcomes Project between August 1996 and August 2012. A total of 198 symptomatic vasospasm patients were treated with vasopressors to raise arterial blood pressure, with or without volume expansion. The treatment response, defined as complete or near-complete resolution of the initial neurological deficit, was adjudicated in weekly study team meetings based on serial clinical examinations after hypertensive treatment. Outcomes were evaluated at one year using the modified Rankin Scale.

Results indicated that 21% of the 198 patients who received hypertensive therapy did not respond to treatment. Treatment failure was associated with an increased risk of death or severe disability at one year (modified Rankin Scale score of 4–6; 62% versus 25%; P0.3 μg/L (64% versus 28%; P = 0.001), aneurysm coiling (43% versus 20%; P = 0.004), and involvement of more than one symptomatic vascular territory at onset (39% versus 22%; P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, treatment failure was independently associated only with troponin I elevation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.69–11.09; P = 0.002).

Conclusions highlighted treatment failure for symptomatic vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage is linked with poor long-term outcomes.

### Role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in isoflurane conditioning-induced neurovascular protection in subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1145jec5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Despite an improved understanding of vasospasm pathophysiology and advancements in medical and endovascular techniques for rescue therapy, cerebral vasospasm and the delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) that it produces remain common and profound risk factors for poor outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Though many strategies to prevent DCI have been explored over the years, none have proven efficacious. This is likely attributable to targeting individual elements of what has proven to be a multifactorial process.

Conditioning is a therapeutic strategy that leverages endogenous protective mechanisms to exert powerful and remarkably pleiotropic protective effects against injury to all major cell types of the central nervous system, including neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We previously showed that structurally distinct conditioning agents, such as hypoxia and the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane, provide strong protection against SAH-induced DCI in a mouse endovascular perforation model.

In the case of hypoxic conditioning, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was implicated in the afforded DCI protection. In the case of isoflurane conditioning, previous investigators have demonstrated that eNOS is likely a key downstream effector for anesthetic-based organ protection, though none have examined its impact on SAH-induced brain injury.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of eNOS in isoflurane-induced protection against vasospasm and neurological deficits following SAH. Our hypothesis is that isoflurane conditioning induces robust pro…

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^115SfBtP]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a neurovascular emergency with an incidence in the UK of approximately 8 per 100,000 population, peaking at ages 50–60 years. It is 1.6 times more common in women than men. The spontaneous rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (80–85%) is the most common cause of SAH. Aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) results in substantial morbidity, mortality, and burden on the healthcare system. Its downstream effects trigger a cascade of events resulting in organ dysfunction. After the initial ictus, these complex ensuing processes cause significant morbidity and mortality. This complex neurovascular syndrome requires an established multidisciplinary team and is best managed in dedicated neurosciences units.

### Preconditioning effect on cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115uus7U]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Recent experimental evidence indicates that endogenous mechanisms against cerebral vasospasm can be induced via preconditioning. The objective was to determine whether these vascular protective mechanisms are also present in vivo in humans with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Methods involved a multicenter retrospective cohort of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, examined for ischemic preconditioning stimulus: preexisting steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and/or previous cerebral infarct. Generalized estimating equation models were performed to determine the effect of the preconditioning stimulus on the primary endpoints of radiographic vasospasm, symptomatic vasospasm, and vasospasm-related delayed cerebral infarction, alongside the secondary endpoint of discharge modified Rankin Scale score.

Results showed that of 1043 patients, 321 (31%) had preexisting CVD and 437 (42%) had radiographic vasospasm. Patients with preexisting CVD were less likely to develop radiographic vasospasm (odds ratio = 0.67; 95% confidence interval = 0.489–0.930; p = 0.02) but showed no differences in other endpoints. In terms of the secondary endpoint, patients with preexisting CVD did not differ significantly from those without preexisting CVD in mortality or unfavorable outcome in multivariate analyses, although patients with preexisting CVD were marginally more likely to die (P = 0.06).

This retrospective case-control study suggests that endogenous protective mechanisms against cerebral vasospasm — a preconditioning effect — may exist in humans.

### Review of medical prevention of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A problem of neurointensive care [^114MaXYx]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm remains a devastating medical complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, even after the aneurysm has been secured surgically or radiologically. A great deal of experimental and clinical research has been conducted in an effort to find ways to prevent this complication. The literature includes extensive coverage of in vivo animal model studies of SAH and vasospasm. These experimental studies have contributed to tremendous advances in the understanding of the mechanisms leading to cerebral vasospasm.

Most of the experimental settings, however, have demonstrated varying levels of ability to predict accurately what occurs in human SAH. Therefore, although animal models have been developed to test new therapies, most of the treatment effects have been shown to be less compelling when trials have been conducted in clinical settings. The interpretation of literature is complicated further by the imprecise estimation of the incidence of cerebral vasospasm. This is due to various degrees of clinical expression, ranging from the absence of symptoms in the presence of increased blood flow velocities at transcranial Doppler or vessel diameter reduction at angiography, to neurological manifestations of severe ischemic deficits.

In addition, a change over time in the incidence pattern of human SAH and vasospasm, possibly related to improved surgical techniques and overall patient management, may have occurred. This topic review collects the relevant literature on clinical trials investigating these aspects.

### Cortical spreading ischaemia is a novel process involved in ischaemic damage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^113Ke2N2]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Moreover, blockade of chronic vasospasm remains an important therapeutic objective. Neuromonitoring in a randomized clinical trial of the endothelin antagonist clazosentan could help us to understand the possible links between chronic vasospasm and CSI, as well as their relative contributions to ischaemic damage and patient outcome after aSAH (MacDonald et al.). We should consider the possibility that only combination therapies targeting vasospasm, disturbed neuronal function, and disturbed neurovascular coupling might improve patient outcomes significantly.

### Terazosin [^116YBcrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

The dose of terazosin capsules and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted according to the patient's individual blood pressure response. The following is a guide to its administration:

- **Initial dose**: 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded. This initial dosing regimen should be strictly observed to minimize the potential for severe hypotensive effects.

- **Subsequent doses**: The dose may be slowly increased to achieve the desired blood pressure response. The usual recommended dose range is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a day; however, some patients may benefit from doses as high as 20 mg per day. Doses over 20 mg do not appear to provide further blood pressure effect, and doses over 40 mg have not been studied. Blood pressure should be monitored at the end of the dosing interval to ensure control is maintained throughout the interval. It may also be helpful to measure blood pressure 2 to 3 hours after dosing to see if the maximum and minimum responses are similar, and to evaluate symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations that can result from an excessive hypotensive response. If the response is substantially diminished at 24 hours, an increased dose or use of a twice-daily regimen can be considered. If terazosin administration is discontinued for several days or longer, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen. In clinical trials, except for the initial dose, the dose was given in the morning.

### Relationship between vasospasm, cerebral perfusion, and delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1138a79d]. Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It typically occurs 4–12 days after initial bleeding and increases the risk of poor outcomes in patients who survive the first few days. The onset of DCI is characterized by a decrease in consciousness, new focal deficit, or both. The presence or absence of angiographic vasospasm (luminal narrowing) is often used as a criterion for DCI. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements of flow velocities in the large cerebral vessels are conducted daily in many hospitals, and SAH patients with neurological symptoms frequently undergo angiography to detect vasospasm.

Furthermore, many strategies to treat DCI, such as induced hypertension, hypervolemia, or balloon angioplasty, have been developed with the conviction that vasospasm is the primary cause of deterioration and ischemia. However, vasospasm does not necessarily lead to cerebral infarcts, with a positive predictive value of around 70%, and cerebral infarcts after SAH have been reported to occur in the absence of vasospasm. In the development of DCI, infarction is preceded by decreased cerebral perfusion. It would therefore make sense to measure perfusion in an area fed by a spastic vessel to evaluate the contribution of vasospasm to DCI.

CT perfusion imaging (CTP) is an accurate tool for measuring cerebral perfusion. Within the same imaging study, CTP can be combined with CT angiography (CTA), which can accurately detect vasospasm. The combination of CTA and CTP makes it possible to study the relationship between vasospasm and perfusion.

### React: A randomized trial to assess the efficacy and safety of clazosentan for preventing clinical deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113zuk9W]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Ischemic complications account for significant patient morbidity following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The Prevention and Treatment of Vasospasm with Clazosentan (REACT) study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in preventing clinical deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with aSAH.

- **Methods**: REACT was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study. Eligible patients had aSAH secured by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling and presented with thick and diffuse clot on admission CT scan. Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) to 15 mg/hour intravenous clazosentan or placebo within 96 hours of the aSAH for up to 14 days, in addition to standard care treatment including oral or intravenous nimodipine. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of clinical deterioration due to DCI up to 14 days after initiation of the study drug. The main secondary endpoint was the occurrence of clinically relevant cerebral infarction at day 16 after study drug initiation. Other secondary endpoints included clinical outcomes assessed on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) at week 12 post-aSAH. Imaging and clinical endpoints were centrally adjudicated.

- **Results**: A total of 409 patients were randomized between February 2019 and May 2022 across 74 international sites. Three patients did not start study treatment and were not included in the analysis set. The occurrence of clinical deterioration due to DCI was evaluated.

### Endothelin receptor antagonists for subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116Qc17L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition where blood leaks out of blood vessels over the surface of the brain. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) and the related feature of vasospasm, where patients experience a delayed deterioration, have long been recognized as the leading potentially treatable cause of death and disability in patients with SAH. Endothelin is a potent, long-lasting endogenous vasoconstrictor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of DIND. Therefore, endothelin receptor antagonists (ETAs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of ETAs for SAH.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (December 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to December 2011), EMBASE (1946 to December 2011), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 to December 2011). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched additional Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers, Google Scholar, and Medical Matrix. We also handsearched journals, scanned reference lists, and contacted researchers and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an ETA with placebo for SAH in adult patients (18 years of age or older) who met the diagnostic criteria for SAH based on clinical symptoms, with confirmation on computerized tomography or other imaging.

### Patient age and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114aAHJf]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm is a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity. The incidence of SAH increases with advancing age. The objective of this study was to determine whether age is an independent predictor of angiographic vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs), or abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Data from CONSCIOUS-1 (Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarct Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage study), a dose-finding study of clazosentan, were used. Data on angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities were prospectively recorded, along with baseline characteristics and treatment data. Patient age was considered in three ways: as a continuous variable, dichotomized at age 65 years, and categorized by decade. Age was investigated as the main variable, while other possible confounding variables were adjusted for in the multiple logistic regression modeling with each of the three dichotomized vasospasm outcome measures (presence or absence of angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities) as the dependent variable.

- **Results**: The proportions of patients with angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, and TCD abnormalities were 45%, 19%, and 81%, respectively. Age, whether considered as a continuous, dichotomous, or categorical variable, was not significantly associated with angiographic vasospasm, DINDs, or abnormal TCD measurements.

- **Conclusion**: Age does not seem to be a significant predictor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Cardiovascular protection to improve clinical outcomes after subarachnoid hemorrhage: Is there a proven role [^116UuJqd]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiac abnormalities seen in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are considered to be a neurally mediated process rather than a manifestation of coronary artery disease. In patients with SAH, myocardial injury evidenced by troponin elevation appears to predict short- and long-term outcomes independently of other conventional risks. Although the incidence of electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction do not independently predict outcomes, monitoring these changes and optimizing hemodynamic status in high-grade SAH is crucial to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion and arterial oxygenation.

Novel interventions that go beyond blood pressure control, prevention of re-bleeding, and aneurysm obliteration should target early physiological derangements seen in the acute phase of SAH. The early resuscitation phase in SAH represents the greatest opportunity for impacting clinical outcome and is thus the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating novel therapeutic strategies related to protection and modulation of cardiovascular function. Specific measures, such as the early use of beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent these cardiac abnormalities and ameliorate their impact on morbidity and mortality, are yet to be established.

### Clazosentan to overcome neurological ischemia and infarction occurring after subarachnoid hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1): Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 dose-finding trial [^113e8roB]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study assessed the efficacy and safety of 1, 5, and 15 mg/h intravenous clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in preventing vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 413) were randomized to placebo or clazosentan beginning within 56 hours and continued up to 14 days after initiation of treatment. The primary endpoint was moderate or severe angiographic vasospasm based on centrally read, blinded evaluation of digital subtraction angiography at baseline and 7 to 11 days post-subarachnoid hemorrhage. A morbidity/mortality endpoint, including all-cause mortality, new cerebral infarct from any cause, delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, or use of rescue therapy, was evaluated by local assessment. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Moderate or severe vasospasm was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion from 66% in the placebo group to 23% in the 15 mg/h clazosentan group (risk reduction, 65%; 95% CI, 47% to 78%; P < 0.0001). No significant effects were seen on secondary endpoints. Post hoc analysis using a centrally assessed morbidity/mortality endpoint that included death and rescue therapy but only cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficits due to vasospasm on central review showed a trend toward improvement with clazosentan (37%, 28%, and 29% in the 1, 5, and 15 mg/h groups versus 39% in the placebo group, nonsignificant). Clazosentan was associated with increased…

### Calcium antagonists for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage [^113wJH3t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Secondary ischaemia is a frequent cause of poor outcome in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Its pathogenesis has been incompletely elucidated, but vasospasm probably is a contributing factor. Experimental studies have suggested that calcium antagonists can prevent or reverse vasospasm and have neuroprotective properties.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether calcium antagonists improve outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to March 2006). We handsearched two Russian journals (1990 to 2003) and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies in 1995 and 1996.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing calcium antagonists with control, or a second calcium antagonist (magnesium sulphate) versus control in addition to another calcium antagonist (nimodipine) in both the intervention and control groups.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Trialists were contacted to obtain missing information.

- **Main results**: Sixteen trials, involving 3361 patients, were included in the review; three of the studies were of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine. Overall, calcium antagonists reduced the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk (RR) was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92); the corresponding number of patients needed to treat was 19 (95% CI 1 to 51). For oral nimodipine alone, the RR was 0.67, 95% CI 0.55 to…

### The impact of sedative choice in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A scoping review [^1126MuUg]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Low credibility.

This review highlights the very limited evidence available to inform the use of analgosedative medications in aSAH. This is a striking finding given the central role these agents play in managing more severe forms of the disease. Despite the limitations of this evidence, ketamine and dexmedetomidine emerge as agents that require further exploration, given their potential to reduce spreading depolarizations, macrovascular vasospasm, and DCI. The design and implementation of large-scale prospective studies with clearly defined patient-centered outcomes have the potential to significantly inform practice and improve outcomes from this devastating disease.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^1131qvQb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols have significantly improved outcomes, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) remains a challenging condition with profound implications for patient care. The highly individualised nature of SAH, due to factors such as aneurysm location, patient comorbidities, and pathophysiology, underscores the importance of personalised treatment strategies. The incidence of multi-system complications further exemplifies the need for an interdisciplinary approach, which is critical for optimising patient outcomes.

As we continue to face these multifaceted challenges, there is a pressing need for ongoing research to refine existing treatment protocols and to develop new, innovative approaches to manage SAH. Future studies should aim to address the gaps in our understanding of SAH pathophysiology and to evaluate strategies that could mitigate the systemic inequities that currently limit the accessibility of optimal care.

The collaboration between neuroscientists, clinicians, and health policy experts will be crucial in this endeavour. The development of novel therapeutics and improved management techniques, backed by robust data collection and analysis, holds the promise of enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by SAH.

### Beyond nimodipine: Advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia [^112WcSfw]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Nimodipine has the strongest evidence for reducing the incidence of radiological and clinical cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), although its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic shortcomings make it a suboptimal candidate even today. There is robust evidence for the efficacy and safety of nicardipine and cilostazol as valid alternatives to nimodipine, although the number of trials conducted is significantly lower than for nimodipine. Eicosapentaenoic acid, dapsone, and clazosentan showed a good balance between evidence of efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetics. Combinations between different classes of drugs have been studied to a very limited extent. Aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm remains an area of ongoing preclinical and clinical research where the search for new drugs or associations is critical.

### Plasma endothelin-1 as screening marker for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1169wjgB]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm complicating subarachnoid hemorrhage causes ischemic stroke and worsens neurological outcomes. The potential role of endothelin-1 in vasospasm pathogenesis may provide therapeutic opportunities. However, a recent meta-analysis did not support the use of endothelin antagonists. Aside from clinical assessment, transcranial Doppler, and interval angiography, there are no sensitive screening markers for evolving vasospasm. We investigate the ability of serial measurement of endothelin-1 to predict the development of vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Endothelin-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood were measured daily in 20 patients admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage from days 1 to 10 following the initial bleed. In addition to clinical assessment, patients had daily transcranial Doppler. Digital subtraction angiography was performed on suspicion of vasospasm based upon clinical or transcranial Doppler assessment. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and SB100 were measured in blood as comparative biomarkers of neurological injury.

- **Results**: Mean plasma endothelin-1 on day 5 was 4.2 mcg/L (CI 3.1–5.8) in patients with vasospasm compared to 2.5 mcg/L (CI 1.5–4.0) in those without vasospasm (P = 0.047). There were no time-related differences in cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1, plasma NSE, or SB100 for patients with and without vasospasm.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and vasospasm, endothelin-1 is significantly higher in plasma than in cerebrospinal fluid on day 5. Neither NSE nor SB100 is associated with any differences between patients with and without vasospasm.

### The incidence of cerebral arterial vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11554VGs]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data items were collected regarding the details of the included studies, such as the first author, year of publication, number of study sites, and sample size. Information was also gathered about the included population, including mean age and the proportion of female participants. The study assessed the proportion of participants with a poor neurological state at enrolment, defined as a Hunt and Hess grade of 3, 4, or 5, or a World Federation of Neurological Surgeons clinical grade of 3, 4, or 5. Additionally, the study evaluated the proportion of participants with a large subarachnoid blood load, defined as a score of 3 or 4 on the Fisher scale or equivalent.

Data were collected on the mode of investigation to identify aVSP, noting whether aVSP was assessed routinely or only when deemed clinically necessary, or following a screening test indicated it was warranted. For RCTs of interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of aVSP, only the reported incidence of aVSP in the control group was recorded for interventions known to be effective, such as clazosentan and cilostazol. The criteria used to identify cases of aVSP in each study were also recorded.

Data regarding the timing of investigation for aVSP and details of the clinical management protocols were reported infrequently and inconsistently, making meaningful collection difficult. The proportion of participants diagnosed with DCI was recorded only when DCI was defined according to the standard definition.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the ROB V2.0 Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials.

### Dissociation of vasospasm and secondary effects of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage by clazosentan [^1171UT2L]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Endothelin receptor antagonists such as clazosentan decrease large-artery vasospasm after experimental and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage. We used clazosentan to gain insight into the pathophysiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage by determining if decreasing vasospasm is associated with alleviation of other secondary complications such as oxidative stress, endothelial nitric oxide synthase dysfunction, microthromboembolism, and neuronal injury.

- **Methods**: Mice were subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage by injection of blood into the chiasmatic cistern. They were treated with clazosentan or vehicle by continuous intraperitoneal infusion for 48 hours. Middle cerebral artery vasospasm, superoxide anion radical, peroxynitrite, microthromboemboli, endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling, cerebral blood flow, neuronal injury, and mortality were assessed.

- **Results**: Clazosentan preserved cerebral blood flow, alleviated vasospasm, and decreased mortality but did not affect superoxide anion radical, peroxynitrite, or microthromboemboli in the brain. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and neuronal injury also were not reduced by clazosentan.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows large-artery vasospasm is pathophysiologically independent of some other effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The findings have implications for development of treatments for this disease.

### Intra-arterial papaverine infusions for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^117VkBK6]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm secondary to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage that has become refractory to maximal medical management can be treated with selective intra-arterial papaverine infusions. Papaverine is a potent vasodilator of the proximal, intermediate, and distal cerebral arteries and can improve cerebral blood flow (CBF). When infused intra-arterially using endovascular microcatheter techniques, papaverine can effectively increase angiographic vessel diameter, decrease prolonged cerebral circulation time, and improve cerebral oxygenation. However, one of the major disadvantages of papaverine is its transient nature, which can result in recurrent or persistent angiographic and clinical vasospasm that may require multiple repeated infusions, despite a successful response to the initial treatment. Intra-arterial papaverine can be used alone or in combination with balloon angioplasty. This article reviews the mechanism of action, technique of administration, effects on CBF, clinical results, and complications of intra-arterial papaverine for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.

### Nitric oxide-based treatment of poor-grade patients after severe aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113dsPib]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Low credibility.

After the introduction of a bridging scheme for nightly administrations of SNP without TCD guidance, and during high-dose instances of Molsidomine administration, no more ischemic events occurred (n = 15 responding patients; 83%). No diffuse brain edema was observed. The NIRS values after single and repeated SNP administrations increased by 17% (p < 0.0001) and 15% (p = 0.02), respectively (SD 14%; range 5–85%); these values remained unchanged in three patients (4%) and showed similar changes bilaterally, probably indicating an augmentation of tissue oxygenation and suggesting a lack of a steal phenomenon.

The survival rate was 29.4% among responders. Twelve patients died, two because of the reoccurrence of vasospasm at night and the remaining ten because of their critical illness or within therapy limitations as per their living will. The non-responder died of a massive stroke.

A follow-up performed by an independent physician (6 months after discharge) revealed that three patients had completely recovered and returned to their former life and job (17.7%). One patient suffered left-sided, low-grade paresis but remained independent while working part-time (GOSE8/6; mRS0/1; NIHSS0/2; please see "Appendix"). No cognitive deficits occurred in any of these four patients (23.5%). One patient required high-grade care.

- **Adverse effects**: In the context of Molsidomine, a rebound phenomenon can occur. One patient developed septic shock during the escalation of the Molsidomine dose, which required interruption for 24 hours and high-dose vasopressors.
