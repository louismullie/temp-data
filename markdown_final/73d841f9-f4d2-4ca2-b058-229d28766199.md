## Question

Can you do a quick osteomyelitis overview?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a quick overview of osteomyelitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and classification to anchor the clinical framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why this disease is hard to cure. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors to contextualize pretest probability. After that, I need to examine clinical presentations by mechanism and age. Then, I will appraise diagnostics, including imaging and microbiology, and I should double-check where guidelines conflict. Next, I will synthesize management principles, including when surgery is needed and how to choose antibiotics and duration. Finally, I will consider special populations, outcomes, and evidence gaps, and I will close with a concise, practical takeaway that aligns with high-quality guidance.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions and classification so I don't gloss over nuances that drive therapy. Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone due to infection, classically divided into acute versus chronic by duration and by mechanism into hematogenous versus contiguous spread or direct inoculation; pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is typically defined as infection within 4 weeks of symptom onset in a previously uninfected bone, whereas chronic disease implies sequestrum and/or relapse weeks to years later, and this framework guides intensity of therapy and follow-up [^116voAvn] [^117W1Ydq]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism split: hematogenous disease predominates in children and in vertebral sites, while contiguous or post-traumatic disease predominates in adults, which aligns with clinical experience and guideline framing [^117W1Ydq] [^113SBgXe].

> I will now examine pathophysiology to explain why antibiotics alone often fail. Staphylococcus aureus is the dominant pathogen and has evolved multiple persistence strategies, including biofilm formation on implants and necrotic bone, invasion of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network, and induction of dysregulated bone remodeling with osteoclast activation and osteoblast apoptosis, all of which create avascular sequestra that shield bacteria from host immunity and antibiotics; this is why cure often requires surgical removal of dead bone plus prolonged antimicrobial therapy [^1143UtTa] [^111ph1d8] [^1131i9qo]. Wait, let me verify the biofilm–bone interface: yes, biofilm-mediated cytokine signaling drives osteoclastogenesis while simultaneously impairing osteoblast function, reinforcing a vicious cycle of bone destruction and therapeutic recalcitrance [^1143fRcq].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors to calibrate suspicion. The U.S. incidence is roughly 20 per 100,000 person-years and appears to be rising among older adults and people with diabetes; globally, trauma-related osteomyelitis is more common in younger populations in LMICs, and chronic presentations are frequent when access to care is delayed [^112qvibB] [^114qA1J6] [^1178tr8S]. I need to ensure I list key risks: diabetes with foot ulcers, peripheral arterial disease, sickle cell disease, open fractures, surgical implants, and immunocompromise all elevate risk and worsen outcomes, including amputation risk in diabetes [^111ZsvLq] [^112eUYMK] [^113X1vYg].

> Let me consider clinical presentations by mechanism, and I should double-check age-related patterns. In children, acute hematogenous osteomyelitis often presents with fever, irritability, and focal bone tenderness, most commonly in the metaphysis of long bones; in adults, vertebral osteomyelitis typically presents with new or worsening back or neck pain, sometimes with fever or neurologic deficits, and may follow S. aureus bacteremia; contiguous-focus disease often lacks systemic symptoms and may present with nonhealing ulcers or draining sinuses in chronic cases [^116voAvn] [^115HQwvq] [^117W1Ydq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "pathognomonic sinus tract", but I should correct that: while a draining sinus to bone is highly suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis, it is not strictly pathognomonic and must be interpreted in context [^112LEvzQ].

> Now, diagnostics — this is where I need to be careful and reconcile conflicting guidance. Definitive diagnosis requires a positive culture from bone biopsy, but imaging and labs guide pretest probability and procedural planning; plain radiographs are low sensitivity early but remain first-line in many pathways, whereas MRI with contrast is the most sensitive modality for marrow and soft-tissue extent; in vertebral disease, if MRI is nondiagnostic, 18F-FDG-PET/CT can help, and image-guided biopsy is recommended when safe to obtain tissue for culture and pathology [^112fcBAT] [^114L7tyS] [^116bJnw3] [^1155AHWo] [^1176a5gG]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: pediatric guidelines still recommend routine plain radiographs despite low early sensitivity because they narrow the differential and serve as a baseline, which reconciles the apparent contradiction with adult-focused imaging strategies [^116uo3kB].

> I should confirm microbiologic strategy and the timing of antibiotics relative to sampling. Bone biopsy is the gold standard for pathogen identification, and in clinically stable patients it is reasonable to defer empiric therapy until after sampling to maximize culture yield; however, ill-appearing patients or those with sepsis should receive immediate empiric therapy, and histology is less affected by short prior antibiotics than culture yield, which tempers the concern somewhat [^112fcBAT] [^112mJgXJ] [^117Qfemx]. Let me reconsider diabetic foot osteomyelitis: culture concordance between wound and bone is poor, so bone sampling is preferred when feasible, and molecular methods like 16S rRNA sequencing can increase detection over culture alone, though this remains investigational in many settings [^115Xa8mo] [^114E4Eah].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure I separate dogma from evidence. The core principle is that chronic osteomyelitis with necrotic bone generally requires surgical debridement of avascular tissue plus culture-directed antibiotics, whereas acute hematogenous osteomyelitis without dead bone may respond to antibiotics alone; duration is typically at least 4–6 weeks, with longer courses for chronic disease or retained implants, and emerging guidance supports shorter, evidence-based durations when debridement is thorough and source control is achieved [^112LEvzQ] [^113Rw7mj]. Wait, let me verify the route-of-therapy question: high-quality comparative data suggest oral therapy can be as effective as parenteral therapy when bioavailability and adherence are adequate, which is a key shift away from routine prolonged IV treatment [^116zDvww] [^116ijkZ5].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection and duration with guideline anchors. Empiric therapy should cover S. aureus, including MRSA risk, then be narrowed to culture results; for native vertebral osteomyelitis, IDSA recommends 6 weeks of active therapy, and for MRSA bone infections, a minimum of 8 weeks is advised given the risk of relapse; in prosthetic joint infection managed with debridement and implant retention, 12 weeks is favored over 6 weeks in recent consensus, reflecting biofilm biology and limited RCT data [^114LfJnr] [^113Rw7mj]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric transitions: once clinically improving, children with AHO should transition to oral therapy rather than prolonged OPAT, and total durations commonly range 3–4 weeks for uncomplicated cases, with longer courses for complicated disease or slow response [^1165qqJH] [^116voAvn].

> But wait, what if the infection is under a pressure ulcer — does routine antibiotic help? I need to check that nuance. The WikiGuidelines consensus advises against routine antibiotics for suspected osteomyelitis beneath pressure ulcers in the absence of planned surgical closure or systemic infection, because antibiotics without source control have not shown benefit and may cause harm; instead, prioritize biopsy confirmation, surgical management, nutrition, off-loading, and wound care [^112mJgXJ]. I should double-check that this applies when deep bone is exposed and the clinical pretest probability is high — yes, even then, the recommendation is conditional and tied to operative plans or sepsis risk [^112mJgXJ].

> Let me consider special populations and mimics so I don't miss important differentials. In children, Kingella kingae is a key pathogen in toddlers, and chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis can mimic infection and requires rheumatology input. In sickle cell disease, distinguishing vaso-occlusive crisis from osteomyelitis is challenging and often requires MRI and careful clinical correlation. In diabetics, foot osteomyelitis is common and amputation risk is higher, mandating aggressive but judicious surgical and antimicrobial strategies [^113Z97Zi] [^1162mNzi] [^112eUYMK] [^113X1vYg]. I should confirm that CNO/CRMO prevalence is low but diagnosis is frequently delayed — yes, whole-body MRI patterns and biopsy help, but classification criteria and biomarkers are still evolving [^116X9E1Q] [^113vCCRR].

> Next, I should review outcomes and evidence gaps to set expectations. Chronic osteomyelitis has substantial recurrence rates despite best practice, historically around 20%, and much of the antibiotic literature is low quality and dated. Contemporary guidance emphasizes minimizing low-value tests, favoring oral therapy when appropriate, and shortening durations to the shortest effective course while maintaining source control, but high-quality RCTs remain limited [^116ijkZ5] [^113x7PU4] [^113Rw7mj]. Hold on, I should verify that pediatric long-term follow-up is suggested for those at risk of complications — yes, at least 1 year of specialist follow-up is conditionally recommended for children with risk factors for adverse outcomes [^117D2RKr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is crisp and aligned with high-quality sources. Suspect osteomyelitis in compatible pain syndromes, especially with risk factors; use MRI to define extent when suspicion is high; obtain bone biopsy for culture whenever safe to guide therapy; start empiric antibiotics immediately if the patient is ill or sepsis is a concern, otherwise consider delaying until after sampling; plan surgical debridement for chronic disease or necrotic bone; treat for at least 4–6 weeks, tailoring duration to response and source control, and prefer oral regimens when reliable and active; and manage within a multidisciplinary framework for complex cases, including diabetes foot and vertebral disease [^112fcBAT] [^116zDvww] [^115HQwvq] [^112LEvzQ].

Osteomyelitis is a **bone infection** most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus [^1143UtTa], with hematogenous spread in children and contiguous or post-traumatic routes in adults [^113SBgXe]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus MRI** [^116bJnw3] and a **bone biopsy for culture** [^112fcBAT]; plain films are insensitive early [^116MXFu5] but useful for follow-up [^111DaHbo]. Acute cases may respond to antibiotics alone [^111HQFoF], whereas chronic disease usually requires surgical debridement plus prolonged antibiotics [^112LEvzQ]; **duration is typically 4–6 weeks** [^111HQFoF], and oral therapy is acceptable if bioavailability and adherence are reliable [^116ijkZ5]. Complications include chronic infection, sequestrum, and amputation [^112LEvzQ], especially with diabetes or poor perfusion [^113X1vYg]; management is best with a multidisciplinary team [^111HQFoF].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Pathogens**: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen [^1143UtTa]; others include Gram-negatives (e.g. Pseudomonas), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and anaerobes [^113SBgXe] [^117W1Ydq].

- **Routes of infection**: Hematogenous spread is common in children [^117W1Ydq]; direct inoculation from trauma or surgery and contiguous spread from soft tissue are more common in adults [^113SBgXe].

- **Pathophysiology**: Infection triggers inflammation, bone destruction, and impaired healing; biofilm formation and necrotic bone (sequestrum) protect bacteria from antibiotics and immune responses [^111ph1d8].

---

## Clinical presentation

| **Clinical feature** | **Acute osteomyelitis** | **Chronic osteomyelitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Rapid (days to weeks) [^117W1Ydq] | Insidious (months to years) [^117W1Ydq] |
| Symptoms | - Severe pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Systemic symptoms [^117W1Ydq] | - Persistent pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Sinus tracts <br/> - Nonhealing ulcers <br/> - Minimal systemic symptoms [^117W1Ydq] |
| Complications | - Abscess <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Bone necrosis [^111ZsvLq] | - Sequestrum <br/> - Involucrum <br/> - Chronic infection <br/> - Amputation [^113X1vYg] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated ESR/CRP and leukocytosis support diagnosis but are nonspecific [^notfound]; blood cultures are positive in ~50% of cases [^113Z97Zi].

- **Imaging**: MRI is the modality of choice for early detection and defining extent [^116bJnw3]; plain radiographs are insensitive early [^116uo3kB] but useful for follow-up [^111DaHbo]; CT or PET/CT may be used when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^113idPbY] [^1155AHWo].

- **Bone biopsy**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis and pathogen identification; obtain before antibiotics when feasible [^112fcBAT] [^112mJgXJ].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empiric therapy should cover S. aureus (including MRSA risk) [^notfound]; tailor to culture results; duration is typically 4–6 weeks [^111HQFoF], with oral therapy acceptable if bioavailability and adherence are reliable [^116zDvww].

- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for chronic osteomyelitis, abscess, necrotic bone, or failed antibiotic therapy; includes debridement, dead-space management, and soft-tissue coverage [^111XFe3D].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Hyperbaric oxygen, bioactive glass, and local antibiotic delivery systems are emerging but require further validation [^112MMLKz].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Complications include chronic infection, sequestrum, pathologic fractures, sinus tracts, and amputation [^111ZsvLq], particularly in diabetes or with poor perfusion [^113X1vYg]. Prognosis is best with **early diagnosis and appropriate treatment** [^112LEvzQ]; chronic infection and recurrence are common, especially with delayed care or comorbidities [^116ijkZ5].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include **strict aseptic technique** during surgery, prompt management of soft-tissue infections, and optimization of comorbidities such as diabetes and vascular disease. Patient education on early recognition of infection and adherence to therapy also helps reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

Osteomyelitis is a **serious bone infection** requiring early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and coordinated medical-surgical care [^112LEvzQ]. MRI and bone biopsy are central to diagnosis, and management hinges on appropriate antibiotics plus surgery when indicated; outcomes depend heavily on timeliness and host factors [^116bJnw3] [^112fcBAT] [^111HQFoF] [^111ZsvLq].

Osteomyelitis remains one of the greatest risks in orthopaedic surgery. Although many organisms are linked to skeletal infections, Staphylococcus aureus remains the most prevalent and devastating causative pathogen. Important discoveries have uncovered novel mechanisms of S. aureus pathogenesis and persistence within bone tissue, including implant-associated biofilms, abscesses and invasion of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network. However, little clinical progress has been made in the prevention and eradication of skeletal infection as treatment algorithms and outcomes have only incrementally changed over the past half century. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of persistence and immune evasion in S. aureus infection of the skeletal system as well as features of other osteomyelitis-causing pathogens in implant-associated and native bone infections. We also describe how the host fails to eradicate bacterial bone infections, and how this new information may lead to the development of novel interventions. Finally, we discuss the clinical management of skeletal infection, including osteomyelitis classification and strategies to treat skeletal infections with emerging technologies that could translate to the clinic in the future.

### Priorities in chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO)-results from an international survey and roundtable discussions [^116rCMxA]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis may be informed by the presence of CNO-associated extra-osseous inflammation which was present in almost half of all patients responding to the survey. Indeed, soon to be published EULAR/ACR classification criteria for CNO also include associated organ involvement. Notably, it is likely that overlapping features between CNO and associated diseases blurs lines when it comes to diagnosis and treatment and may have affected aforementioned discrepancies in the response to diagnostic delay and false diagnoses.

Research priorities showed alignment between patients and clinicians in both surveys and round table discussions. However, ranking of priorities by clinicians was slightly less "clear" when compared to patients/carers, and delivered "pathophysiology" as highest priority as it may allow individualized and target-directed treatments, followed by "medication trials", "outcome measures" and "diagnosis and classification" as shared next priorities. The high priority of studies investigating the molecular pathophysiology of CNO may be explained by its potential to inform several aspects affecting patients and carers, including the development of biomarkers that may allow for early diagnosis and treatment initiation, and the development of effective, target-directed and individualized treatments. Clinicians/academics may, furthermore, not have been able to distinctly rank "medication trials", "outcome measures" and "diagnosis and classification" because of their related character and the fact that the definition of representative study populations and outcome measures are necessary for the delivery of clinical trials and laboratory studies. In line with outcomes from this initiative, an expert consensus meeting following the "International Conference on CNO and Autoinflammatory Bone Disease" suggested use of expert diagnosis and meeting EULAR/ACR classification criteria for CNO as inclusion criteria for clinical trials.

The panel further notes that "knowledge of the pathogen and its susceptibility pattern often simplifies treatment decisions" and that "the decision to perform an aspiration or biopsy procedure for diagnostic purposes and its timing should be considered on a case-by-case basis".

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment [^116MXFu5]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to an infectious process. Osteomyelitis is usually clinically diagnosed with support from imaging and laboratory findings. Bone biopsy and microbial cultures offer definitive diagnosis. Plain film radiography should be performed as initial imaging, but sensitivity is low in the early stages of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media has a higher sensitivity for identifying areas of bone necrosis in later stages. Staging based on major and minor risk factors can help stratify patients for surgical treatment. Antibiotics are the primary treatment option and should be tailored based on culture results and individual patient factors. Surgical bony debridement is often needed, and further surgical intervention may be warranted in high-risk patients or those with extensive disease. Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease increase the overall risk of acute and chronic osteomyelitis.

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment… [^117W1Ydq]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to infection; it may be acute or chronic. Symptoms of acute osteomyelitis include pain, fever, and edema of the affected site, and patients typically present without bone necrosis in days to weeks following initial infection. Chronic osteomyelitis develops after months to years of persistent infection and may be characterized by the presence of necrotic bone and fistulous tracts from skin to bone. 1, 2 Osteomyelitis is further classified by mechanism of infection as hematogenous or nonhematogenous. With hematogenous osteomyelitis, bacteria are seeded into bone secondary to a bloodstream infection and the condition is most common in children, older adults, and immunocompromised populations. 1–3 Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis occurs from direct inoculation in the setting of surgery or trauma or with spread from contiguous soft tissue and joint infections. 1, 2.

4 Vertebral osteomyelitis is the most common type of hematogenous osteomyelitis and is polymicrobial in 5% to 10% of cases. 1 Blood cultures may be negative if osteomyelitis develops following bacterial clearance from the bloodstream. Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis can be polymicrobial; S. aureus is the most common pathogen in addition to coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. Clinical Features The clinical presentation of nonhematogenous osteomyelitis varies and symptoms are often non-specific. Signs and symptoms common to all sub-types may include pain, edema, and erythema. Acute osteomyelitis may present with a more rapid onset of symptoms and is more likely to be associated with fever. Systemic symptoms are not common in chronic osteomyelitis, and the presence of fistulous tracts from skin to bone is diagnostic. Long-standing, nonhealing ulcers and nonhealing fractures may also be associated with chronic osteomyelitis.

Hematogenous osteomyelitis often presents similarly to nonhematogenous disease. The most common form of hematogenous osteomyelitis is vertebral; patients often have back or neck pain and muscle tenderness, sometimes followed by fever. Hematogenous osteomyelitis may also occur in the sternoclavicular, pelvic, and long bones.

### Current concepts of osteomyelitis: from pathologic mechanisms to advanced research methods [^1131i9qo]. The American Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of the bone and bone marrow that is most commonly caused by a Staphylococcus aureus infection. Much of our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of osteomyelitis, from the perspective of both host and pathogen, has been revised in recent years, with notable discoveries including the role played by osteocytes in the recruitment of immune cells, the invasion and persistence of S. aureus in submicron channels of cortical bone, and the diagnostic role of polymorphonuclear cells in implant-associated osteomyelitis. Advanced in vitro cell culture models, such as ex vivo culture models or organoids, have also been developed over the past decade, and have become widespread in many fields, including infectious diseases. These models better mimic the in vivo environment, allow the use of human cells, and can reduce our reliance on animals in osteomyelitis research. In this review, we provide an overview of the main pathologic concepts in osteomyelitis, with a focus on the new discoveries in recent years. Furthermore, we outline the value of modern in vitro cell culture techniques, with a focus on their current application to infectious diseases and osteomyelitis in particular.

Plain radiographs in suspected pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — rationale and directive indicate that although the sensitivity of plain radiographs for the diagnosis of AHO is low, their value both in narrowing the differential diagnosis and as potential baseline studies outweighs the concern around the high false-negative rate for AHO, and because the overall benefits exceed risks, the panel thus makes a strong recommendation that plain radiographs remain a routine part of the evaluation of children with suspected AHO.

### Osteomyelitis [^114SAkY3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease with varied pathophysiology. The several clinical syndromes associated with bone infection have specific clinical presentations and microbiology. Successful recognition and management of the disease requires a knowledge of these mechanisms and the organisms most common in each. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical examination, supportive blood testing, and appropriate radiography. With these elements in place, patient presentation can be placed in the framework of a staging system, which often helps to suggest the appropriate mix of antimicrobial and surgical therapies.

### Osteomyelitis [^112LEvzQ]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Bone and joint infections are painful for patients and frustrating for both them and their doctors. The high success rates of antimicrobial therapy in most infectious diseases have not yet been achieved in bone and joint infections owing to the physiological and anatomical characteristics of bone. The key to successful management is early diagnosis, including bone sampling for microbiological and pathological examination to allow targeted and long-lasting antimicrobial therapy. The various types of osteomyelitis require differing medical and surgical therapeutic strategies. These types include, in order of decreasing frequency: osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection (after trauma, surgery, or insertion of a joint prosthesis); that secondary to vascular insufficiency (in diabetic foot infections); or that of haematogenous origin. Chronic osteomyelitis is associated with avascular necrosis of bone and formation of sequestrum (dead bone), and surgical debridement is necessary for cure in addition to antibiotic therapy. By contrast, acute osteomyelitis can respond to antibiotics alone. Generally, a multidisciplinary approach is required for success, involving expertise in orthopaedic surgery, infectious diseases, and plastic surgery, as well as vascular surgery, particularly for complex cases with soft-tissue loss.

### Routine pediatric surgical emergencies: incidence, morbidity, and mortality during the 1st 8000 days of life – A narrative review [^1178tr8S]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that often results from direct inoculation into bone or contiguous or hematogenous spread of an infection from elsewhere in the body. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is the most common form of osteomyelitis in school age children but can happen at any age. It is often associated with the need for invasive diagnostic, surgical procedures, and prolonged course of antimicrobial treatment. Furthermore, there is an association of osteomyelitis with sickle cell disease, which has a higher prevalence in LMICs. Studies from LMICs show that patients with osteomyelitis may be older than most surgical patients on admission and experienced a significantly longer average length of stay. Delayed and/or inadequate treatment of acute osteomyelitis in LMIC settings results in 60–80% of affected children presenting in the chronic phase, leading to more complex and multi-stage management. Delayed treatment of open bone fractures can also contribute to osteomyelitis in up to a quarter of patients. One review demonstrated that early administration of antibiotics is the most important factor in prevention, but timely intervention does not consistently occur in LMICs. Lack of imaging and microbiology also pose added challenges. A study estimates that 27% of patients with osteomyelitis require both multiple admissions and surgeries before treatment is successful. In low-income countries, eradication of chronic osteomyelitis after treatment is never assured, and many patients have recurring infections and ultimately may require amputation of the affected limb.

### Infectious and inflammatory disorders [^115Rd3Kc]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis and inflammatory arthritis affect many children. In this article, the authors describe clinical, pathophysiologic, and imaging characteristics of common (and a few not-so-common) conditions in these categories. Emphasis is placed on MR imaging characteristics, but the article discusses other imaging modalities and clinical evaluation when appropriate. Having a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and imaging characteristics of these disease processes helps us choose the best radiologic study to answer the clinical questions.

IDSA native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) guideline methodology — panel composition, literature review, evidence grading, consensus development, and conflicts of interest — are described as follows: A panel of 11 experts, including specialists in infectious diseases, spine orthopedic surgery, and neuroradiology, was convened, and among the 11 panel members, 9 are from the United States, 1 is from Europe, and 1 is from the Middle East. The panel identified 13 clinical questions and assigned 3 different groups, divided into the Diagnosis, Management, and Follow-up sections, to draft responses. The search looked at publications from 1970 to December 2014. The guideline followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system recommended by IDSA, in which the assigned strength of a recommendation is either "strong" or "weak", and high-quality evidence does not necessarily lead to strong recommendations; conversely, strong recommendations can arise from low-quality evidence if one can be confident that the desired benefits clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences. For consensus development, panel members met in person twice during the 2010 and 2012 IDSA annual meetings and participated in 9 teleconferences. All members complied with the IDSA policy regarding conflicts of interest, and no limiting conflicts were identified.

### Is mandibular osteomyelitis a sequela of SSRI-induced dental implant failure? A systematic review&case report [^111GBkin]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To determine if the utilization of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increases the risk of osteomyelitis as a sequela of dental implant failure. We also report the case of a patient on long-term SSRIs who presented with dental implant failure and subsequently developed mandibular osteomyelitis.

Methods

We performed a systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) in PubMed, Google Scholar and Embase, for all records pertaining to SSRIs, dental implants, and mandibular osteomyelitis.

Results

SSRIs are associated with increased risk of dental implant failure, and our results suggest that they may be independently associated with mandibular osteomyelitis in the setting of implant failure. Though there was no evidence of mandibular osteomyelitis specifically following SSRI-related dental implant failure, there were a few case reports on osteomyelitis resulting from failed dental implant osseointegration.

Conclusions

In the context of long-term SSRI utilization, our findings suggest that osteomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with recent dental implant placement or failure.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^113x7PU4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

WikiGuidelines represent a novel approach to guideline construction, clearly delineating evidenced-based recommendations from opinions based on lower-quality data. Resulting changes in management of pyogenic osteomyelitis include recognizing the low value and high burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients, reducing the routine ordering of low value, low accuracy blood biomarkers, increasing adoption of oral therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest necessary for optimizing cure.

These guidelines are based on published data available as of March 1, 2022. Clinicians who believe other evidence should be considered may contact any of the authors to initiate possible revisions, which the authors intend to complete in close to real-time. The authors understand that no clinical trial can extrapolate to all possible patient care scenarios. Thus, we expect that these guidelines should not establish medicolegal standards of care or replace clinician judgment for individual patients.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^116imprB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

The consortium that established the WikiGuidelines Charter consisted of 63 participants from 8 countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. These participants included physicians, pharmacists, and microbiologists with expertise in general internal and hospital medicine, pediatrics, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology.

The participants addressed 7 questions regarding the diagnosis and management of pyogenic osteomyelitis but found data sufficient to establish clear recommendations for only 2: oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy. In contrast, 5 questions were addressed with clinical reviews in the absence of high-quality data: diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis, management of osteomyelitis underlying pressure ulcers, appropriate timing of empirical therapy, rational selection of antimicrobial options, and use of serial biomarkers or imaging studies to evaluate therapeutic response.

### SAPHO and recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^116jYNhK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

SAPHO and recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis are complex inflammatory conditions that clinical radiologists play an essential part in diagnosing. They present with a wide range of musculoskeletal and skin manifestations, and exhibit several key diagnostic features that, when present, make the diagnoses unequivocal. The overall population group is young. Diagnostic delay is common with a relapsing and remitting clinical course and often subtle early radiologic findings. This article provides an up-to-date insight into both conditions, including their multifaceted pathogenesis, effective therapeutic options, and advanced imaging features, to arm radiologists with the knowledge required to make the diagnoses confidently in a timely manner.

### What's new in pediatric septic arthritis? A review of pertinent clinical questions [^111Y5hvG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The evaluation and treatment of children with septic arthritis (SA) is challenging and requires an organized approach to address the spectrum of pathogens which appear to aggregate in age-specific groups. Although evidence-based guidelines have recently been published for the evaluation and treatment of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, there is a relative dearth of literature devoted exclusively to SA.

Methods

Recently published guidance for the evaluation and treatment of children with SA was reviewed and evaluated with respect to pertinent clinical questions to summarize what is new in this area of practice for pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

Results

Evidence suggests that there is a profound difference between children with primary SA and those who have contiguous osteomyelitis. This disruption of the commonly accepted paradigm of a continuum of osteoarticular infections has important implications in the evaluation and treatment of children with primary SA. Clinical prediction algorithms have been established to help determine the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging during the evaluation of children suspected to have SA. Antibiotic duration for SA has been recently studied with some evidence in favor of short-course parenteral followed by short-course oral therapy may be successful if the pathogen is not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusion

Recent studies of children with SA have provided better guidance for evaluation and treatment to improve diagnostic accuracy, processes of evaluation, and clinical outcomes.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^116zDvww]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a novel methodology using collaborative research coordinated online be successfully applied to the development of a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis?

Findings

This consensus statement and systematic review using a novel WikiGuidelines methodology addresses 7 questions regarding the management of osteomyelitis, resulting in the establishment of 2 clear recommendations (concerning oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy) and 5 clinical reviews that outline a present lack of adequate, hypothesis-confirming data.

Meaning

These results suggest that this novel, egalitarian methodology enables a clear separation of established care standards based on hypothesis-confirming evidence from practice preferences that are based on lower quality or no evidence.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute and chronic osteomyelitis definitions and course classifications define acute osteomyelitis as diagnosis of bone infection within 4 weeks after the onset of clinical manifestations in a previously uninfected bone, and chronic osteomyelitis as a more protracted, often indolent process with presence of a sequestrum and/or relapse of infection in the same site weeks to years after apparently successful treatment. Acute osteomyelitis presentations may be relatively mild or "subacute", and chronic osteomyelitis, while rare in childhood and adolescence in North America, can occur as an initial presentation or as a complication of AHO. The panel recognizes presentations that do not fit cleanly into the acute vs chronic dichotomy, such as Brodie abscess or indolent presentations with onset of symptoms or signs > 4 weeks before diagnosis without clear evidence of chronic osteomyelitis, and states that management of such presentations should be determined on a case-by-case basis and influenced by clinical and imaging response. Uncomplicated vs complicated designations are based on features of the clinical presentation and treatment course, and complicated infections are more likely to require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and a longer duration of therapy.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^1159GYWN]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to illustrate the imaging findings of childhood osteomyelitis. The diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis can be challenging. Clinical presentation and laboratory results can differ and are relatively unreliable. To date, its role in the assessment of treatment efficacy is not yet clear.

Methods

This review article provides an overview of the different imaging modalities and imaging characteristics of childhood osteomyelitis. Levels of evidence for different modalities are presented.

Results

Paediatric radiology plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis and can also be used to guide therapy and intervention.

Conclusion

Although imaging is essential in the diagnostic process, cooperation between the physician and radiologist remains the cornerstone in accurately diagnosing childhood osteomyelitis.

Main Messages

- Imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis.
- Cooperation between the clinician and radiologist is a very important aspect of making the diagnosis.
- The initial imaging modality in childhood osteomyelitis is conventional imaging.
- Normal conventional imaging does not exclude osteomyelitis.

### Antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^116ijkZ5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic osteomyelitis is generally treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement but can persist intermittently for years with frequent therapeutic failure or relapse. Despite advances in both antibiotic and surgical treatment, the long-term recurrence rate remains around 20%. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different systemic antibiotic treatment regimens for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1948 to September Week 4 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2012 Week 40), LILACS (October 2012), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (June 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs addressing the effects of different antibiotic treatments given after surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and appraised risk of bias in the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight small trials involving a total of 282 participants with chronic osteomyelitis. Data were available from 248 participants. Most participants were male with post-traumatic osteomyelitis, usually affecting the tibia and femur, where recorded. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow-up varied between trials. All trials mentioned surgical debridement before starting on antibiotic therapy as part of treatment, but it was unclear in four trials whether all participants underwent surgical debridement. We found that study quality and reporting were often inadequate. In particular, we judged almost all trials to be at moderate to high risk of bias due to failure to conceal allocation and inadequate follow-up. Four trials compared oral versus parenteral route for administration of antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission at the end of treatment (70/80 versus 58/70; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.18; four trials, 150 participants). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (49/64 versus 44/54; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13; three trials, 118 participants). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the occurrence of mild adverse events (11/64 versus 8/54; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.42; three trials, 118 participants) or moderate and severe adverse events (3/49 versus 4/42; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.57; three trials, 91 participants). Superinfection occurred in participants of both groups (5/66 in the oral group versus 4/58 in the parenteral group; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60; three trials, 124 participants). Single trials with few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following four comparisons: oral only versus parenteral plus oral administration; parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two different parenteral antibiotic regimens; and two different oral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited and low quality evidence suggests that the route of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. The majority of the included trials were conducted over 20 years ago and currently we are faced with a far higher prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to many of the available antibiotics used for healthcare. This continuously evolving bacterial resistance represents another challenge in the choice of antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis.

(Conditional; Moderate)". To maximize pathogen recovery and avoid contamination, bone specimens should be collected "in an aseptic manner (i.e., percutaneously via intact and uninfected skin, or intraoperatively)", and obtaining a bone specimen "is the generally accepted criterion standard" and "the only definitive way to determine the causative pathogen(s)". Culture concordance is limited: paired per-wound versus transcutaneous bone biopsies were "identical in only 42%", and bone versus non-bone culture correlation is "most < 50%". Procedurally, percutaneous and intraoperative bone biopsies "are both safe", percutaneous biopsy is "generally not painful" and "complications are rare", and bedside sampling "can be performed safely at the bedside and by any trained medical caregiver". Around antibiotics, "Some experts suggest delaying BeBoP in a patient who is receiving antibiotics until they have been off therapy for at least a few days, and ideally for at least 2 weeks", but "the optimal duration of any antibiotic-free period before the biopsy is not known", and prior antibiotic therapy has been "associated with an increased likelihood of false negative culture".

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, or its most severe form, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, is an autoinflammatory bone disease that causes skeletal inflammation characterized by bone pain and swelling that primarily affects children. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and its clinical presentation may mimic underlying infectious processes and malignancy. Clinical suspicion for this diagnosis and timely referral to pediatric rheumatology is crucial to achieve earlier diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and improved quality of life of affected patients and families. This article focuses on recent insights into the pathogenesis of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis and outlines recent advances and ongoing research.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for children with AHO, including specialists in pediatric infectious diseases, orthopedics, emergency care physicians, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. Summarized below are the recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO in children. The panel followed a systematic process used in the development of other IDSA and PIDS clinical practice guidelines, which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or soft tissue infection (excluding spine and diabetic foot): 2022 update [^113uYRyP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections involve bones, joints, and soft tissues. These infections are a common clinical scenario in both outpatient and emergent settings. Although radiography provides baseline findings, a multimodality approach is often implemented to provide more detailed information on the extent of infection involvement and complications. MRI with intravenous contrast is excellent for the evaluation of musculoskeletal infections and is the most sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis. MRI, CT, and ultrasound can be useful for joint and soft tissue infections. When MRI or CT is contraindicated, bone scans and the appropriate utilization of other nuclear medicine scans can be implemented for aiding in the diagnostic imaging of infection, especially with metal hardware and arthroplasty artifacts on MRI and CT. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Osteomyelitis in long bones [^111XFe3D]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis in long bones remains challenging and expensive to treat, despite advances in antibiotics and new operative techniques. Plain radiographs still provide the best screening for acute and chronic osteomyelitis. Other imaging techniques may be used to determine diagnosis and aid in treatment decisions. The decision to use oral or parenteral antibiotics should be based on results regarding microorganism sensitivity, patient compliance, infectious disease consultation, and the surgeon's experience. A suppressive antibiotic regimen should be directed by the results of cultures. Standard operative treatment is not feasible for all patients because of the functional impairment caused by the disease, the reconstructive operations, and the metabolic consequences of an aggressive therapy regimen. Operative treatment includes debridement, obliteration of dead space, restoration of blood supply, adequate soft-tissue coverage, stabilization, and reconstruction.

### Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis: bone, bugs, and surgery [^111ph1d8]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis, or inflammation of bone, is most commonly caused by invasion of bacterial pathogens into the skeleton. Bacterial osteomyelitis is notoriously difficult to treat, in part because of the widespread antimicrobial resistance in the preeminent etiologic agent, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus Bacterial osteomyelitis triggers pathological bone remodeling, which in turn leads to sequestration of infectious foci from innate immune effectors and systemically delivered antimicrobials. Treatment of osteomyelitis therefore typically consists of long courses of antibiotics in conjunction with surgical debridement of necrotic infected tissues. Even with these extreme measures, many patients go on to develop chronic infection or sustain disease comorbidities. A better mechanistic understanding of how bacteria invade, survive within, and trigger pathological remodeling of bone could therefore lead to new therapies aimed at prevention or treatment of osteomyelitis as well as amelioration of disease morbidity. In this minireview, we highlight recent developments in our understanding of how pathogens invade and survive within bone, how bacterial infection or resulting innate immune responses trigger changes in bone remodeling, and how model systems can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets. We review the current state of osteomyelitis epidemiology, diagnostics, and therapeutic guidelines to help direct future research in bacterial pathogenesis.

### Staphylococcus aureus from an acute fracture-related infection displays important bacteriological and histopathologic differences from a chronic equivalent in a murine bone infection model [^113pMB8f]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Several factors influencing the course of fracture-related infections have been described. A time-related classification in acute and chronic fracture-related infections is still used to guide surgical and antimicrobial treatment strategies. However, there is growing controversy about this time-related classification because it oversimplifies the complexity of fracture-related infection. Further, the host's comorbidities and immune status may impact the clinical presentation, course, and systemic dissemination of infection. Recently, specific virulence characteristics of S. aureus have been detected in clinical isolates of acute and chronic bone infections, suggesting these characteristics may play a key role in infection development and persistence. These findings, most of which were obtained from osteomyelitis models in animals or in vitro assays comparing knockout strains with wild types, have provided valuable insights into bacterial virulence in bone infections. However, although the clinical and investigative findings may be similar, results derived from osteomyelitis models cannot be automatically extrapolated to fracture-related infections. In contrast to osteomyelitis, the presence of a fracture and influence of a frequently inserted implant may differentially affect the regulatory network, so the role of bacterial virulence in the pathophysiology of fracture-related infection remains unclear. Thus, detailed bacteriologic and histopathologic analyses of clinical isolates that may differ in bacterial virulence because of variations in genomic sequences and their association with the clinical and pathophysiologic course of fracture-related infections are still lacking.

We therefore asked: Are there differences in the course of infection when comparing these two different clinical isolates in a murine fracture-related infection model, as measured by (1) clinical observations of weight loss, (2) quantitative bacteriology, (3) immune response, and (4) radiographic and histopathologic morphology?

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^113Rw7mj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Osteomyelitis (Including DFO) Without a Retained Implant

Based on small RCTs, 3 or 4 weeks may be a reasonable duration of antibiotics for debrided osteomyelitis, whether hematogenous or contiguous (including DFO); however, confirmatory data are desired. Based on observational studies and 1 small RCT, it is reasonable to refrain from antibiotic use after total resection of infected bone if the treating physicians are confident that all infected bone has been resected. If administered, we do not recommend exceeding 2 to 5 days of therapy if there is no complicating soft tissue infection.

Osteomyelitis With a Retained Implant (Including PJI)

Based on the Duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Prosthetic Osteo-articular infection (DATIPO) RCT, participating experts unanimously agree that 12 is preferred to 6 weeks of antibiotics for PJI treated with debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR). Some experts also clearly preferred 12 weeks of antibiotics for PJI treated with prosthetic exchanges. However, others believed that equipoise remains between 6 vs 12 weeks for these patients, particularly if S aureus is not the etiologic pathogen, or for 1-stage exchanges or 2-stage revisions with negative cultures prior to implantation.

Duration of therapy for other infected implants is not clear. A reasonable strategy, without evidence for or against, may be to treat with antibiotics until the bone heals sufficiently enough that the implants can be removed, such as in cases of fracture. Finally, chronic oral suppressive therapy may be considered for patients for whom the risks and benefits of curative surgery is deemed unacceptable; however, available data have not defined the risks and benefits of this approach well to this point.

### Treating osteomyelitis: antibiotics and surgery [^111HQFoF]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory disorder of bone caused by infection leading to necrosis and destruction. It can affect all ages and involve any bone. Osteomyelitis may become chronic and cause persistent morbidity. Despite new imaging techniques, diagnosis can be difficult and often delayed. Because infection can recur years after apparent "cure", "remission" is a more appropriate term.

Methods

The study is a nonsystematic review of literature.

Results

Osteomyelitis usually requires some antibiotic treatment, usually administered systemically but sometimes supplemented by antibiotic-containing beads or cement. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. Chronic osteomyelitis, often accompanied by necrotic bone, usually requires surgical therapy. Unfortunately, evidence for optimal treatment regimens or therapy durations largely based upon expert opinion, case series, and animal models. Antimicrobial therapy is now complicated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Without surgical resection of infected bone, antibiotic treatment must be prolonged (≥ 4 to 6 weeks). Advances in surgical technique have increased the potential for bone (and often limb) salvage and infection remission.

Conclusions

Osteomyelitis is best managed by a multidisciplinary team. It requires accurate diagnosis and optimization of host defenses, appropriate anti-infective therapy, and often bone débridement and reconstructive surgery. The antibiotic regimen must target the likely (or optimally proven) causative pathogen, with few adverse effects and reasonable costs. The authors offer practical guidance to the medical and surgical aspects of treating osteomyelitis.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a benign skeletal disorder of childhood and adolescence characterised by sterile bone inflammation that results in chronic insidious bone pain. Although it is increasingly recognised, many challenges remain in its diagnosis with patients waiting 15–24 months for diagnosis from the time of symptom onset. Prompt identification and treatment are key to reducing morbidity from CNO, which affects school attendance and can result in chronic limb or spine deformities. Identifying its imaging features, particularly its characteristic lesion distribution on whole-body MRI, remains key to diagnosis. Image-guided biopsy is also required in many cases, particularly those with clinical uncertainty around the diagnosis. We present a review of the challenges encountered in the diagnosis of CNO from a critical appraisal of the literature and our experience as a national paediatric sarcoma, rheumatology and orthopaedic centre. This review hopes to inform radiology colleagues involved in the evaluation of potential CNO patients by discussing its imaging appearances, typical MRI phenotypes, potential mimics and the role of image-guided biopsy.

### Diagnostic imaging of pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis: lessons learned from a multi-modality approach [^112daQaK]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis may present highly variable radiological expression, which is influenced by the age and condition of the patient, the virulence of the causative agent, the stage of the disease, or the selected imaging tool. Given the multiplicity of available modalities and the multi-faceted nature of the process, purposeful imaging of pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis may be difficult. In order to avoid diagnostic delays and complications, familiarity with the variable expression of the disease and assumption of the potentialities, roles and limitations of the various imaging modalities is required. In this pictorial essay we review, illustrate and discuss, in a multi-modality approach, the various radiological patterns that may be found in pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis, with emphasis on strategies, staging, uncommon distribution patterns, and differential diagnosis.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited hematological disorder, affecting millions of patients worldwide. It is estimated that the overall prevalence of SCD in African-Americans is one in 365. This condition produces abnormal hemoglobin, which leads to the "sickling" of red blood cells. Patients frequently present with hemolytic anemia and microvascular occlusion leading to vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Patients with SCD are also at an increased risk of orthopaedic manifestations such as osteomyelitis, septic joint, or osteonecrosis. Osteomyelitis is one of the most serious and potentially disabling orthopaedic manifestations of SCD, but its differentiation from benign SCD conditions such as VOC can be difficult. This article aims to discuss the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of osteomyelitis in the SCD population.

Osteomyelitis can present to the emergency department as an acute, subacute, or chronic orthopedic concern. The presentation can range from subtle, as with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in the pediatric patient population, to obvious, as with the diabetic patient who presents with a foot ulcer overlying exposed bone. Accurate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, whether with antibiotics, debridement, or both, are important in helping determine the ultimate outcome in this potential orthopedic pitfall. We review here the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options for osteomyelitis that are applicable to the emergency practitioner.

### Current concepts in pathogenesis of acute and chronic osteomyelitis [^1143fRcq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The term osteomyelitis covers a wide range of inflammatory bone disorders caused by microbial invasion or due to autoinflammatory processes, but furthermore osteomyelitis also occurs at different ages and at preferred localizations in the human skeleton. This article aims to give an overview of the current literature focussing on pathognomonic aspects of osteomyelitis because of microbial invasion.

Recent Findings

Outlining the chronological sequence of osteomyelitis originating from the invasion of microbes finally leading to destruction of bone tissue, the formation and proliferation of biofilm structures play a key role in the development of inflammatory bone disorders. The components of the biofilm on the one hand mediate an immune response leading to an increase of local cytokines and induction of osteoclastogenesis but on the other hand also directly interact with the osteoblasts. As a result, the bone-remodelling process is immensely diminished by induction of proapoptotic pathways, decreased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and an additional promotion of osteoclastogenesis.

Summary

Although microbial invasion is responsible to be the cause for inflammatory bone disorders, except for an autoinflammatory origin, the underlying and detailed mechanisms in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis are not yet fully understood, but represent an absolute precondition for the development of effective causal treatment strategies in the future.

### An improved understanding of pediatric chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis pathophysiology informs current and future treatment [^111hdHuM]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the absence of diagnostic criteria and/or disease biomarkers, CNO/CRMO remains a diagnostic challenge. Treatment is empiric and targets inflammation and bone remodeling. Recent progress in understanding the involvement of pathological inflammasome activation and associated cytokine release promises exploitation of knowledge to allow for clinical trials of targeted treatments (cytokine blockade, P2X7 inhibition, etc.) and the development of biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Clinical trial design will be informed by imminently awaited classification criteria and outcome measures.

### Contemporary concepts in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis [^112MMLKz]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Although there are relatively standard treatment approaches for chronic osteomyelitis, many avenues of investigation are being pursued to reflect contemporary concerns. The mainstays of care continue to include timely and thorough surgical débridement and culture-directed antibiotics. Sensitive diagnostic screening is essential, and advances in radiology can lead to early confirmation of disease and accurate surveillance. There is potential to greatly reduce overall morbidity, chance of recurrent infection, and treatment courses by using the local delivery systems currently researched by orthopedic surgeons. The challenges posed by multidrug-resistant bacterium may be countered by sound culturing techniques and new antibiotics. The general purpose of this article is to survey the new directions in oral surgery, orthopedics, infectious disease, immunology, and radiology that may have application to the treatment of maxillofacial osteomyelitis.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis… [^113Z97Zi]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis is generally categorized as acute or chronic based on histopathologic findings, rather than duration of the infection. Acute osteomyelitis is associated with inflammatory bone changes caused by pathogenic bacteria, and symptoms typically present within two weeks after infection. Necrotic bone is present in chronic osteomyelitis, and symptoms may not occur until six weeks after the onset of infection. Etiology The most common pathogens in osteomyelitis depend on the patient's age. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of acute and chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults and children. Group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Kingella kingae are the next most common pathogens in children. Group B streptococcal infection occurs primarily in newborns. Clinical Features Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis results from bacteremic seeding of bone.

Children are most often affected because the metaphyseal regions of the long bones are highly vascular and susceptible to even minor trauma. More than one-half of cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children occur in patients younger than five years. 7 Children typically present within two weeks of disease onset with systemic symptoms, including fever and irritability, as well as local erythema, swelling, and tenderness over the involved bone. 8 Chronic osteomyelitis in children is uncommon. 9 Chronic osteomyelitis is generally secondary to open fractures, bacteremia, or contiguous soft issue infection. The incidence of significant infection within three months after an open fracture has been reported to be as high as 27 percent. 12 Back pain is the primary presenting symptom. Chronic osteomyelitis from contiguous soft tissue infection is becoming more common because of the increasing prevalence of diabetic foot infections and peripheral vascular disease.

Up to one-half of patients with diabetes develop peripheral neuropathy, which may reduce their awareness of wounds and increase the risk of unrecognized infections. Diagnosis Acute osteomyelitis in children is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the rapid onset and localization of symptoms. Systemic symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and irritability may be present. The physical examination should focus on identifying common findings, such as erythema, soft tissue swelling or joint effusion, decreased joint range of motion, and bony tenderness. The identification of a bacterial infection may be difficult because blood cultures are positive in only about one-half of cases.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^114qA1J6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An important limitation of traditional clinical guidelines is the frequent dissociation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. As a result, some past guideline recommendations have endorsed harmful care, which was only subsequently recognized when high-quality, prospective controlled trials were conducted. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach, called WikiGuidelines, to establish clear recommendations only when high-quality, hypothesis-confirming evidence is available (see group charter in Supplement 1).

Our initial social media poll revealed a desire for renewed guidance on a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pyogenic osteomyelitis occurs at a rate of approximately 20 cases per 100 000 person-years, with rates rising among patients with diabetes and older patients, as well as those with prosthetic joints. In low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), osteomyelitis may be more common in younger patients as a result of traumatic injury. Nevertheless, the global economic burden of osteomyelitis is considerable for high-income countries and LMIC.,

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease, with the earliest documented case in an unfortunate, 250-million-year-old dimetredon with a fractured spinal shaft. In the modern era, radiography, surgical methods, and antibiotics have revolutionized its management. However, these successful interventions have resulted in long-standing diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms that have guided treatment despite lacking strong evidence, including the need for diagnostic x-rays and intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for all patients. Recent studies have begun to challenge these dogmas. This guideline focuses on data regarding management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults (see Supplement 2 for the complete guidelines).

### Context-dependent roles for toll-like receptors 2 and 9 in the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis [^116aj9XF]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The Gram-positive bacteriumcauses devastating infections in a variety of tissue sites, including the musculoskeletal system.is the most common causative agent of infectious osteomyelitis, or the infection of bone. A major pathological feature of osteomyelitis is dysregulated bone homeostasis and consequent bone damage. In healthy skeletal tissue, bone-building osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts balance the deposition of new bone matrix with the resorption of old bone, thereby maintaining bone homeostasis. The perturbation of bone homeostasis during osteomyelitis leads to bone loss and aberrant bone healing and also contributes to morbid complications, including pathological fractures. Moreover, vascular damage occurring in response to infection can interfere with antibiotic delivery, thereby promoting chronic infection. Thus, in addition to prolonged antibiotic therapy, patients suffering from osteomyelitis often require invasive surgical debridement to remove infected and necrotic bone. To create new therapeutic strategies that reduce morbidity and improve the antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis, it is crucial to define the mechanisms by which bacterial infections incite bone damage. Thus, the objective of this study is to define how innate immune signaling, specifically through Toll-like receptor (TLR) sensing of, influences pathological bone remodeling during osteomyelitis.

### Management of bone infections in adults: the surgeon's and microbiologist's perspectives [^112oNdmp]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Bone infection in adults is a potentially devastating complication following trauma or surgery. The clinician should diagnose osteomyelitis based on certain clinical manifestations and on laboratory and imaging findings. For pathogen identification, the treating surgeon should take appropriate tissue samples. Close collaboration with microbiologists is of paramount importance to dictate the appropriate duration and type of antibiotics to be administered. Treatment of acute osteomyelitis requires surgical debridement and prolonged course of antibiotics. Debate exists regarding the maintenance or the removal of any internal fixation device. Treatment of chronic osteomyelitis is more complicated. For its eradication the treatment course is often prolonged and frustrating. Based on the current literature an algorithm of treatment for both acute and chronic bone infections is recommended.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis [^113SBgXe]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.

Introduction

Childhood osteomyelitis can be a challenging problem to both the clinician and the radiologist as the clinical presentation can be variable in severity, and laboratory results are relatively unsupportive in the diagnostic workup. Radiology plays a pivotal role in its diagnosis and can also be used to guide therapy and intervention. This review discusses the pathophysiology of childhood osteomyelitis and the clinical presentation. With respect to radiological imaging, it will focus on the application of radiological techniques in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis and the reported levels of evidence for the use of these techniques (Table 1).

### Are we misdiagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis? Is the gold standard gold? [^114E4Eah]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

To compare the incidence of osteomyelitis based on different operational definitions using the gold standard of bone biopsy, we prospectively enrolled 35 consecutive patients who met the criteria of ≥ 21 years of age and a moderate or severe infection based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America classification. Bone samples were obtained from all patients by percutaneous bone biopsy or intraoperative culture if the patient required surgery. Bone samples were analyzed for conventional culture, histology, and 16S ribosomal RNA genetic sequencing. We evaluated 5 definitions for osteomyelitis: 1) traditional culture, 2) histology, 3) genetic sequencing, 4) traditional culture and histology, and 5) genetic sequencing and histology. There was variability in the incidence of osteomyelitis based on the diagnostic criteria. Traditional cultures identified more cases of osteomyelitis than histology (68.6% versus 45.7%, p = .06, odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 6.87), but the difference was not significant. In every case that histology reported osteomyelitis, bone culture was positive using traditional culture or genetic sequencing. The 16S ribosomal RNA testing identified significantly more cases of osteomyelitis compared with histology (82.9% versus 45.7%, p = .002, OR 5.74, 95% CI 1.91 to 17.28) and compared with traditional cultures but not significantly (82.9% versus 68.6%, p = .17, OR 2.22, 95% CI 0.71 to 6.87). When both histology and traditional culture (68.6%) or histology and genetic sequencing cultures (82.9%) were used to define osteomyelitis, the incidence of osteomyelitis did not change. There is variability in the incidence of osteomyelitis based on how the gold standard of bone biopsy is defined in diabetic foot infections.

### Does this patient with diabetes have osteomyelitis of the lower extremity? [^111ZsvLq]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on nonvertebral osteomyelitis:

- **Definition**: Nonvertebral osteomyelitis is an infection that affects the bone tissue outside of the vertebral column.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of osteomyelitis involves the invasion of microorganisms into the bone, leading to inflammation and bone destruction. Bacteria can reach the bone through the bloodstream or from nearby tissue. In some cases, bacteria can invade the bone directly due to an open fracture or surgery.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of osteomyelitis in the US is estimated at 21.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for osteomyelitis include conditions that compromise the immune system or blood flow to the bone, such as diabetes, PAD, and recent trauma or surgery. Invasive medical procedures, such as joint replacements or bone surgeries, can also increase the risk of osteomyelitis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, osteomyelitis often presents with symptoms such as bone pain, swelling, redness, and fever. In some cases, patients may also experience reduced ROM. Chronic osteomyelitis can lead to the formation of sinus tracts, draining pus to the skin.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of osteomyelitis depends on the promptness of diagnosis and appropriateness of treatment. If left untreated, osteomyelitis can lead to serious complications, including abscess formation, sepsis, and chronic osteomyelitis.

Chronic osteomyelitis is refractory to nonsurgical treatment due to a resilient, infective nidus that harbors sessile, matrix-protected pathogens bound to substrate surfaces within the wound. Curative treatment mandates physical (surgical) removal of the biofilm colony, adjunctive use of antibiotics to eliminate residual phenotypes, and efforts to optimize the host response throughout therapy. Patient selection, therapeutic options, and the treatment format are determined by the Cierny/Mader staging system, while reconstruction is governed by the integrity/stability of the affected bone(s) and quality/quantity parameters of the soft-tissue envelope.

PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) without adjacent osteomyelitis — duration of therapy recommendations: In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For children with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred. These treatment recommendations apply to children with ABA who do not have adjacent osteomyelitis; when osteomyelitis is present, treatment recommendations for it, which frequently include longer treatment duration, supersede these recommendations.
