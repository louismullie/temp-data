## Question

Example 3.26. Verify that the expression

y(e^(xy) + 6) dx + x(e^(xy) + 6) dy

is a total differential of some function f(x, y), and find this function.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the expression y(e^(xy) + 6)dx + x(e^(xy) + 6)dy is an exact differential and, if so, to find the potential function f(x, y). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying M and N and checking the exactness condition ∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x. Then, I should integrate M with respect to x to get a candidate f, keeping in mind that the "constant" of integration will be a function of y. Next, I will differentiate that candidate with respect to y and match it to N to solve for the y-dependent term. Finally, I will verify the result by computing df and confirming it matches the original expression.

> Let me first identify the components. The given differential form is M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy, where M = y(e^(xy) + 6) and N = x(e^(xy) + 6). I need to check exactness by verifying that ∂M/∂y equals ∂N/∂x, because that is the necessary and sufficient condition for a simply connected domain in the plane.

> I will now examine the partial derivatives. Computing ∂M/∂y, I get e^(xy) + 6 + xy e^(xy) using the product rule, and computing ∂N/∂x, I get e^(xy) + 6 + xy e^(xy) as well. Wait, let me verify that both are indeed identical; yes, they match, so the form is exact and a potential function f(x, y) exists.

> Next, I should integrate M with respect to x to find a candidate for f. Integrating y(e^(xy) + 6) with respect to x, I obtain e^(xy) + 6x plus a function of y, say g(y), because the partial derivative with respect to x must recover M. Hold on, I should verify the integral of y e^(xy); that is indeed e^(xy) by the chain rule in reverse, so the candidate is f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6x + g(y).

> Now I need to determine g(y) by matching the y-derivative of this candidate to N. Differentiating f with respect to y gives x e^(xy) + g'(y), and this should equal N = x(e^(xy) + 6) = x e^(xy) + 6x. Therefore, g'(y) must equal 6x. Hmm, wait a minute, that cannot be right because g is supposed to be a function of y alone, and 6x depends on x. I should double-check my earlier step.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially wrote g'(y) = 6x, but that is inconsistent with g being purely a function of y. Let me reconsider the matching: x e^{xy} + g'(y) = x e^{xy} + 6x implies g'(y) = 6x, which still contains x. That signals a mistake in the integration or matching. Let me verify the original form again; N is x(e^{xy} + 6), so the term 6x is indeed part of N and must be accounted for by the y-derivative of f. But if f contains 6x, then ∂f/∂y cannot produce 6x unless there is an xy term in f, which would reintroduce x-dependence in the "constant" of integration. I should correct this by recognizing that the 6x term in N must come from a term in f that, when differentiated with respect to y, yields 6x; the simplest such term is 6xy, so I should adjust the candidate accordingly.

> Let me correct the approach. I should write the candidate as f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy + g(y), where g(y) is truly a function of y only. Then ∂f/∂y = x e^(xy) + 6x + g'(y), and setting this equal to N = x e^(xy) + 6x gives g'(y) = 0, so g(y) is a constant. For simplicity, I can set the constant to zero, yielding the potential function f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy.

> I should confirm the solution by computing the total differential. df = (∂f/∂x)dx + (∂f/∂y)dy = (y e^(xy) + 6y)dx + (x e^(xy) + 6x)dy = y(e^(xy) + 6)dx + x(e^(xy) + 6)dy, which matches the original expression. Therefore, the form is exact and the potential function is f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy.

---

The given expression is an exact differential because it satisfies the condition (∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x), where (M = y(e^(xy) + 6)) and (N = x(e^(xy) + 6)). The potential function is (f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy + C), where (C) is an arbitrary constant.

---

## Verification of exactness

A differential form (M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy) is exact if there exists a function (f(x, y)) such that:

∂f/∂x = M(x, y) and ∂f/∂y = N(x, y)

This requires the condition:

∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x

For the given expression:

M(x, y) = y(e^(xy) + 6) and N(x, y) = x(e^(xy) + 6)

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂M/∂y = ∂/∂y [y(e^(xy) + 6)] = e^(xy) + 6 + xy e^(xy)

∂N/∂x = ∂/∂x [x(e^(xy) + 6)] = e^(xy) + 6 + xy e^(xy)

Since (∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x), the differential is exact.

---

## Finding the potential function (f(x, y))

To find (f(x, y)), integrate (M) with respect to (x) while treating (y) as constant:

f(x, y) = ∫ M(x, y) dx = ∫ y(e^(xy) + 6) dx = e^(xy) + 6xy + g(y)

where (g(y)) is an arbitrary function of (y).

Next, differentiate this candidate with respect to (y) and set it equal to (N(x, y)):

∂f/∂y = x e^(xy) + 6x + g′(y) = x(e^(xy) + 6)

This implies (g'(y) = 0), so (g(y) = C) (a constant).

Thus, the potential function is:

f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy + C

---

## Conclusion

The given differential is exact, and the potential function is:

f(x, y) = e^(xy) + 6xy + C

Motif III: logic

A general class of functions used to describe natural,– and synthetic, biological networks are logic gates, which have two inputs regulating a single output (Fig. 5). Gates exhibit either high ("on") or low ("off") output depending on whether inputs are on or off. For example, the AND gate specifies high output only if both inputs are on. In this section we provide a specific DDE-based framework that covers 14 out of 16 possible 2-input logic operations, and show that these operations form a continuous 2D parameter space.

a A prototypical regulatory network involving logic where X and Y both regulate Z, which must integrate the two signals using some logic before it can in turn activate a downstream reporter R. b Parameter space showing regions where regulation approximately follows 14 of the 16 possible 2-input logic functions depending on the strength of two single-variable Hill regulation terms (η Z 1: regulation of Z by X, η Z 2: regulation of Z by Y). Network logic can be smoothly altered by varying the parameters (η Z 1, η Z 2), with a change of sign in (n 1, n 2) required to switch quadrants. The bottom-left quadrant shows that very weak regulation in both terms leads to an always-off (FALSE) function, weak regulation in one arm only leads to single-input (X, Y) functions, strong regulation in both arms leads to an OR function, and regulation too weak in either arm alone to activate an output but strong enough in sum leads to an AND function. The other three quadrants are related by applying NOT to one or both inputs, with function names related by de Morgan's lawNOT(X OR Y) = NOT X AND NOT Y. In particular, X IMPLY Y = NOT(X) OR Y, X NIMPLY Y = X AND NOT(Y), X NOR Y = NOT X AND NOT Y, and X NAND Y = NOT X OR NOT Y. Truth tables for all 16 logic gates are provided in Supplementary Table 1 for reference.

An illustration of the potential value of qualitative data

To demonstrate the potential value of qualitative data, we consider a simple case of solving for the coefficients of polynomial functions.

We consider two polynomial functions: y 1 = ax 2 − bx + c and y 2 = dx + e. Suppose we want to solve for the coefficients a, b, c, d, and e, which we will take to be positive. As the ground truth coefficients to be determined, we choose (a, b, c, d, e) = (0.5, 3, 5, 1, 1.5).

Suppose that a limited amount of quantitative information is available. Namely, it is known that the parabola y 1 contains the points (2, 1) and (8, 13), and the line y 2 contains the point (3.5,5). This is not enough information to solve for any of the coefficients because three points are required to specify a parabola, and two points are required to specify a line (Fig. 1a).

Fig. 1

We seek to find the coefficients of equations for a parabola and a line, with the ground truth shown (blue solid curves). Two points on the parabola and one point on the line are known (black dots). These three points are consistent with infinitely many possible solutions (e.g. orange dashed curves). Qualitative information (colored circles, x -axis) specifies whether the parabola is above (+) or below (−) the line. This information limits the possible values of intersection points x 1 and x 2 to the green shaded segments of the x -axis. b Bounds on coefficient values as a function of the number of qualitative points known.

### Inferring time derivatives including cell growth rates using gaussian processes [^d99eaf3f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Inferring the first and second time derivatives

To determine the time derivative of the data, we use that the derivative of a Gaussian process is another Gaussian process. We can therefore adapt standard techniques for Gaussian process to allow time derivatives to be sampled too.

Building on the work of Boyle, we let g (x) and h (x) be the first and second derivatives with respect to x of the latent function f (x). If f (x) is a Gaussian process then so are both g (x) and h (x). Writing ∂ 1 and ∂ 2 for the partial derivatives with respect to the first and second arguments of a bivariate function, we have

and that

as well as

following ref.

Consequently, the joint probability distribution for y and f *, g * and h * evaluated at points X * is again Gaussian (cf. equation (7)):

where we write K = K (X, X) and K ✱ = K (X *, X *) for clarity.

The covariance function is by definition symmetric: k (x i, x j) = k (x j, x i) from equation (1). Therefore, and so

for all positive integers k and. Consequently, the covariance matrix in equation (13) is also symmetric.

Conditioning on y now gives that the distribution P (f *, g *, h *| X, y, θ, X *) is Gaussian with mean

and covariance matrix

Equation (16) includes equation (9) and shows that

which gives the error in the estimate of the first derivative. Similarly,

is the error in estimating the second derivative.

Using an empirically estimated measurement noise

Although our derivation is given for a Gaussian process where the measurement errors in the data are independent and identically distributed with a Gaussian distribution of mean zero, the derivations are unchanged if the measurement noise has a different s.d. for each time point.

When the magnitude of the measurement noise appears to change with time, we first empirically estimate the relative magnitude of the measurement noise by the variance across all replicates at each time point. We then smooth this estimate over time (with a Gaussian filter with a width of 10% of the total time of the experiment, but the exact choice is not important) and replace the identity matrix, I, in equations (6), (15) and (16) by a diagonal matrix with the relative measurement noise on the diagonal in order to make predictions.

### Cerebral oxygenation during locomotion is modulated by respiration [^8e13e0ce]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Ordinary coherence and partial coherence

We used coherence analysis to reveal correlated oscillations and deduce functional coupling among different signals. The ordinary coherence between two signals x and y are defined aswhere S x (f) and S y (f) are the auto-spectra of the signals, and S xy (f) is the cross-spectrum. For ordinary coherence analysis between two signals (x and y), highly coherent oscillations can occur if they are functionally connected or because they share a common input. To differentiate between these possibilities, we also computed the partial coherence, i.e. coherence between two signals (x and y) after the removal of the components from each signal that are predictable from the third signal (z). The partial coherence function measuring the relationship of x and y at frequency f after removal of z is defined aswhere S xx−z and S yy-z is the auto-spectra associated with the residual part of x and y after removing the part coherent with z, respectively. S xy−z is the cross-spectrum between the residual part of x and y after removing the part coherent with z. If all the networks are connected, partial coherence will be between zero and the level of the ordinary coherence. If the connection behaves in an asymmetric manner, i.e. signal z affects x and y differentially, the coherence between two signals may increase after partialization (Supplementary Fig. 9a).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab (R2015b, Mathworks). All summary data were reported as the mean ± SD unless stated otherwise. Normality of the samples were tested before statistical testing using Anderson-Darling test (adtest). For comparison of multiple populations, the assumption of equal variance for parametric statistical method was also tested (vartest2 and vartestn). If criteria of normality and equal variance were not met, parametric tests (t test, one-way ANOVA) were replaced with a nonparametric method (Mann-Whiteney U -test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). All p values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

### Combinatorial code governing cellular responses to complex stimuli [^f2481e0e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

Identification of the interaction profiles

The number of ways to rank the numbers e 0, e X, e Y and e X+Y was computed using the recurrence relation A n k = A n− 1 k +k A n− 1 k− 1 which, for n = 4 and summing up for k = 1, 2, 3 and 4 gives 75 possible rankings. Each ranking can be seen as a set of outcomes of the following qualitative pairwise comparisons:
e X versus e 0
e Y versus e 0
e X+Y versus e 0
e Y versus e X
e X+Y versus e X
e X+Y versus e Y

In our framework, the outcome of a qualitative comparison can take on the following three values: 0 (equal numbers), 1 (first larger than the second) and −1 (first smaller than the second). Each of 75 rankings was coded uniquely as a vector of six components describing the qualitative outcome of the comparisons 1–6 as listed above. For example, the vector (0,0,1,0,1,1) corresponds to:

e X = e 0, e Y = e, e X+Y > e 0, e Y = e X, e X+Y > e X, e X+Y > e Y

To identify which rankings were compatible with positive or negative interactions, we considered the equations 1–6 together with the inequalities that define positive and negative interactions:
Δ e X+Y > Δ e X + Δ e Y (positive interaction)
Δ e X+Y < Δ e X + Δ e Y (negative interaction)

which can be written as

(7a) e X+Y − e X − e Y + e 0 > 0

(8a) e X+Y − e X − e Y + e 0 < 0

If a ranking is consistent with a positive (or negative) interaction, the inequality constraints encoded in the corresponding vector can be solved simultaneously with 7a (or 8a). To verify this, we developed a constraint satisfaction that attempts to solve the six constraints of each ranking together with the inequality 7a (or 7b). The solution is searched numerically with a MATLAB linear solver. The variables e 0, e X, e Y and e X+Y were constrained to the interval 2–16, taken as an approximate of the range of expression values from Affymetrix chips in log2 scale. The method is implemented in the MATLAB code and is available upon request.

### Towards a fully automated algorithm driven platform for biosystems design [^ed08b9a9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We next sought to illustrate the optimization method with a similar 3-variable function with three inputs and one output to simulate a similar multi-dimensional optimization problem. It is noteworthy that Bayesian optimization has been used in numerous applications – and the purpose of this simulation is testing the algorithm on a simple but similar setting. The search perimeter was set to be 1–24 for each of the inputs and the maximum of the function was set to be 9 (y = f (x 1, x 2, x 3) | x i ɛ {1, 2,…, 24}, f max = 9). The Bayesian optimization algorithm was able to find the maximum value of this function by only evaluating 12 points out of all possible 24 3 = 13,824 points. These 12 evaluations were the result of 12 iterations of learning and testing, with each evaluation being followed by a learn step that produced the next point to evaluate. We then sought to compare this optimization strategy with baseline approach where randomly sampled points are evaluated and all of these points are used to train an Exterior Derivative Estimation (EDE)-based regression model described in previous publications. We found that although the EDE approach shows impressive predictive capability, especially given that all the data have been acquired at once and not through iterative sampling, even after sampling 192 random points, the maximum could not be found (Supplementary Table 1).

### Combinatorial code governing cellular responses to complex stimuli [^0a8d512f]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Formalization of complexity underlying signal integration

First, we theoretically enumerated the possible interactions between two abstract signals X and Y. We denoted by e 0, e X, e Y and e X+Y the log-normalized expression level of a multivariate output with i components measured, respectively, in the conditions 0 (control), signals X, Y and X+Y. Following log normalization, the fractional effects exerted by X, Y and X+Y on the j -th output component relative to the control condition correspond to the increments Δ e j X = e j X −e j 0, Δ e j Y = e j Y — e j 0, Δ e j X+Y = e j X+ Y — e j 0 (Fig. 1a), while the conditions of positive and negative interactions are translated, respectively, into the inequalities Δ e j X+Y > Δ e j X +Δ e j Y and Δ e j X+Y < Δ e j X +Δ e j Y. For each output component independently, we used recursion analysis to enumerate the combinations of k statistically different groups (rankings) being observed from n experimental conditions. The generalized solution to this problem (A n k = A n− 1 k +kA n− 1 k− 1) is illustrated as a modified Pascal's triangle (Fig. 1b). Our experimental design involves n = 4 conditions (0, X, Y and X+Y), and thus a number of groups varying from a minimum of k = 1 to a maximum of k = 4. For example, for n = 4, k = 1 group there is only one possible profile where the output is constant in all conditions (Fig. 1b). By increasing to k = 2, we add 14 non-redundant possible profiles corresponding to all combinations of the two output levels for the n = 4 conditions. Summing each contribution up to a maximum of k = 4, we obtained 75 possibilities (Fig. 1b). We then listed the profiles compatible with the inequalities Δ e j X+Y > Δ e j X +Δ e j Y (positive interactions) and Δ e j X+Y < Δ e j X +Δ e j Y (negative interactions). Five profiles were consistent with a lack of interaction (additivity) and were removed from subsequent analysis. Twenty-nine profiles were consistent with a positive, 29 with a negative and 12 were compatible with both a positive and a negative interaction. We then split each of these 12 'ambiguous' cases in two in order to account for both a positive and a negative realization. Altogether, we obtained 41 positive and 41 negative instances termed 'interaction profiles' (Fig. 1c). We developed a constraint satisfaction algorithm in order to formalize the mathematical structure of the different profiles (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Recovery after stroke: not so proportional after all? [^2d3114d8]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Point A corresponds to the canonical example of spurious r(X,Δ), introduced in the last section: i.e. σ Y /σ X ≈ 1 and r(X, Y) ≈ 0, but r(X,Δ) ≈ −0.71 (Fig. 3 A). At Point B, σ Y /σ X ≈ 1 and r(X, Y) is strong, so recovery is approximately constant (Fig. 3 B) and r(X,Δ) ≈ 0, consistent with the view that strong r(X, Y) curtail spurious r(X,Δ). However, the situation is more complex when σ Y /σ X is more skewed.

When σ Y /σ X is large, Y contributes more variance to Y − X (Δ), and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, Y); this is Regime 1. Points C and D illustrate the convergence (Fig. 3 C and D). By contrast, when σ Y /σ X is small, X contributes more variance to Y − X, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, −X): i.e. −1 (Supplementary material, Appendix A, theorem 2); this is Regime 2, where the confound emerges. Point E, near Regime 2, corresponds to data in which all patients recover proportionally (Δ = 70% of lost function; Fig. 2 E). Here, σ Y /σ X is already small enough (0.3) to be dangerous: after randomly shuffling Y, r(X, Y) ≈ 0, but r(X,Δ) is almost unaffected (Point F, and Fig. 3 F). In other words, if even the proportional recovery rule is approximately right, empirical data may enter territory, on the surface in Fig. 2, where over-optimistic r(X,Δ) are likely.

### Evolution of dosage compensation under sexual selection differs between X and Z chromosomes [^a1882357]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The probability of fixation determines the expected change in expression over one particular substitution in each sex. If the mutant is lost, expression does not change, if the mutant is fixed, male and female expression become z m + δ m and z f +2 δ f, respectively (Table 2). To calculate the expected change in expression, we consider all possible mutational sizes and their frequencies,

where 3 N is the total number of genes in the population, μ is the mutation rate and f (δ m, δ f) is the probability density function for the effects of mutants on male and female expression. We assume that f (δ m, δ f) is a bivariate normal distribution with mean (0, 0) and covariance matrix

In this case, equations (6) and (7) read

and the second moments of the change in male and female expressions are approximately E[(Δ z m) 2 | z m, z f] = E[(Δ z f) 2 | z m, z f] = σ 2, and E[(Δ z m)(Δ z f)| z m, z f] = ρ σ 2. For simplicity, we set σ 2 = 0.1. Setting different values for σ 2 changes the impact of mutations, but since it does so with the same intensity in males and females, it does not change our results. However, increasing σ 2 increases the overall rate of evolution.

A Illustration of the simulation geometry. The "Virtual Cell" software is used to define the geometry and set up the simulation conditions. The hemispherical condensate is situated on the XY plane. Arp2/3 only diffuses around the condensate surface. Actins (both G and F) can diffuse in the entire region. B Concentration profiles (shown as color bars) of the model components at the beginning of simulations (Time = 0.2 s, upper panel) and the steady state (Time = 20 s, lower panel). These snapshots represent the plane at Z = 0. Diffusion constants, D GA = 10 µm 2 /s and D FA = 1 µm 2 /s. C Timecourse of F-actin (FA) concentration at two FA diffusion constants (D FA). To compute the "Surface concentration", a hemispherical region of interest (larger than the condensate) is considered (details in method) and the amount of FA in the shell volume measures the surface concentration. The "Bulk concentration" incorporates all the volume elements, including the condensate surface. D Measure of local production of F-actin as a function of differential diffusion of actin in monomeric (D GA) and polymeric (D FA) form. We keep D GA (10 µm 2 /s) fixed and vary D FA. E Trend of local FA production as a function of the condensate's HemiSphericity.

Multi-cluster state yields greater F-actin production

We next use our reaction-diffusion model to compare a multi-cluster state (MCS) with its single-cluster counterpart. Figure 3A illustrates the simulation setup where we have four hemispherical clusters placed on the XY plane. The radius of each cluster is adjusted such that the total volume occupied by four clusters is the same as the single large cluster considered in Fig. 2A. The number of Arp2/3 on each cluster is also divided by 4 such that the total Arp2/3 count is the same as Fig. 2A. So, we have a comparison between one-cluster and four-cluster scenarios where total volume of clusters and total Arp2/3 count are the same. The question is, which configuration is more efficient in FA production?

### Evolution of dosage compensation under sexual selection differs between X and Z chromosomes [^f6e0ceae]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Since selection is weak, the first (equations (9) and (10)) and second moments of the distribution of infinitesimal change in male and female expression are sufficient to describe the evolution of male and female expression over many substitutions. In continuous time, and ignoring the time taken for segregation to occur and the time between mutations, we obtain that the random variables Z m (t) and Z f (t), which describe male and female expression at time t, satisfy the stochastic differential equation,

where d W m and d W f are standard independent Brownian motions, and b 1 and b 2 are scaled variance terms given byand.

Unless selection on male and female expression is very weak (very small N eX S m, N eX S f), and evolution is dominated by genetic drift, the qualitative features of the evolution of dosage compensation are captured by the expected trajectory of equations (11) and (12). Writing the expected male and female expression as z m and z f, we find that their evolution is given by equations (1) and (2), where time is rescaled according to τ = 2 μt /30. This scaling eases the comparison between X and Z expression when differences between mutation rates in the two systems are ignored.

The expected values for male and female expression through time, z m (τ) and z f (τ), may be found exactly by solving equations (1) and (2). If we assume that degradation of the Y-linked gene copy leads to an initial diminution in expression in males of − z 0, and female expression is unperturbed by degradation and remains at the ancestral optimal level zero, we have

where. Similar expressions for Z-linked genes can be found by replacing N eX by N eZ, and m subscripts by f and vice versa. Plots in Fig. 1 correspond to equations (13) and (14) with respect to t rather than τ to compare more easily the deterministic paths with the stochastic replicates of equations (11) and (12) that are shown in Fig. 2.

### The dynamics and geometry of choice in the premotor cortex [^cc5aba40]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

We modelled spikes of each neuron as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with instantaneous firing rate λ (t) = f (x (t)) that depends on the current latent state via a neuron-specific tuning function f (x). In population models, all neurons follow the same latent dynamics x (t) and each neuron i has a unique tuning function f i (x) (i = 1… M, where M is the number of neurons in the population). In this case, the population dynamics x (t) are shared by all neurons, and the tuning functions f i (x) jointly define the non-linear embedding of these dynamics into the neural population state space. Thus, the model was specified by a set of continuous functions: the potential Φ (x), the initial state distribution p 0 (x), a collection of tuning functions { f i (x)} and a scalar noise magnitude D. We inferred all model components θ = { Φ (x), p 0 (x), { f i (x)}, D } from spike data.

The spike data consisted of multiple trials(k = 1, 2… K, where K is the number of trials), and the time argument in Y k (t) indicates that the data are a sequence of event times on each trial. For independent trials, the total data likelihood is a product of likelihoods of individual trials

Therefore, here we consider data for a single trial Y k (t) and omit the trial index to simplify notation. For each trial, Y (t) = { y 0, y 1,…, y N, y E } is a marked point process, that is, a sequence of discrete observation events. Each observation is a pair y j = (t j, i j), where t j is the time of event j and i j is the type of this event. The first and last events mark the trial start time t 0 and trial end time t E, and the N remaining events (j = 1,… N) are the spike observations where t j is the time of j th spike and i j is the index of the neuron that emitted this spike (i j ∈ {1,… M }, where M is the number of simultaneously fitted neurons). The events are ordered according to their times.

### Recovery after stroke: not so proportional after all? [^d3259e7a]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Spurious r(X,Δ) are likely when σ Y /σ X is small

For any X and Y, it can be shown that:

A formal proof of Equation 1 is provided in the Supplementary material, Appendix A [proposition 4 and theorem 1; also see]; its consequence is that r(X,Δ) is a function of r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X. To illustrate that function, we performed a series of simulations (Supplementary material, Appendix B) in which r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X were varied independently. Figure 2 illustrates the results: a surface relating r(X,Δ) to r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X. Figure 3 shows example recovery data at six points of interest on that surface.

Figure 2
The relationship between r(X, Y), r(X,Δ) and σ Y /σ X. Note that the x -axis is log-transformed to ensure symmetry around 1; when X and Y are equally variable, log(σ Y /σ X) = 0. Supplementary material, proposition 7 in Appendix A, provides a justification for unambiguously using a ratio of standard deviations in this figure, rather than σ Y and σ X as separate axes. The two major regimes of Equation 1 are also marked in red. In Regime 1, Y is more variable than X, so contributes more variance to Δ, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, Y). In Regime 2, X is more variable than Y, so X contributes more variance to Δ, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X,−X) (i.e. −1). The transition between the two regimes, when the variability ratio is not dramatically skewed either way, also allows for spurious r(X,Δ). For the purposes of illustration, the figure also highlights six points of interest on the surface, marked A–F; examples of simulated recovery data corresponding to these points are provided in Fig. 3.

### Confronting false discoveries in single-cell differential expression [^cd4fcb8f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

These divergences emphasize the importance of developing a sound epistemological foundation for differential expression in single-cell data. In this work, we reasoned that developing such a foundation would require quantifying the performance of the available methods across multiple datasets in which an experimental ground truth is known, and defining the principles that are responsible for differences in performance. We therefore first established a methodological framework that enabled us to curate a resource of ground-truth datasets. Using this resource, we conduct a definitive comparison of the various available methods for differential expression analysis. We find that differences in the performance of these methods reflect the failure of certain methods to account for intrinsic variation between biological replicates. Our understanding of this principle led us to discover that the most frequently used methods can identify differentially expressed genes even in the absence of biological differences. These false discoveries are poised to mislead investigators. However, we show that false discoveries can be avoided using statistical methodologies that account for between-replicate variation. In summary, we expose the principles that underlie valid differential expression analysis in single-cell data, and provide a toolbox to implement relevant statistical methods for single-cell users.

### The evolution of sex-biased genes and sex-biased gene expression [^2a73c1db]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2007). Medium credibility.

Differences between males and females in the optimal phenotype that is favoured by selection can be resolved by the evolution of differential gene expression in the two sexes. Microarray experiments have shown that such sex-biased gene expression is widespread across organisms and genomes. Sex-biased genes show unusually rapid sequence evolution, are often labile in their pattern of expression, and are non-randomly distributed in the genome. Here we discuss the characteristics and expression of sex-biased genes, and the selective forces that shape this previously unappreciated source of phenotypic diversity. Sex-biased gene expression has implications beyond just evolutionary biology, including for medical genetics.

Sensitivity and specificity

Using the values calculated in the previous section, the sensitivity at a certain rejection level α = p i is defined as

which is the fraction of actually differentially expressed genes that are declared differentially expressed. 1−sensitivity equals the probability that a gene with actual differential expression is not declared differentially expressed, which is exactly the probability of a Type II error.

The specificity at a certain rejection level α = p i is defined as

which is the fraction of genes without actual differential expression that are not declared differentially expressed. 1−specificity equals the probability that a gene without actual differential expression is declared differentially expressed, which is exactly the probability of a Type I error.

### Analysis of multi-condition single-cell data with latent embedding multivariate regression [^4d2b70aa]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Cluster-free differential expression analysis

We can predict the expression of a cell in any condition using this parametric model. The differential expression between two conditions (Fig. 1c, step 2) is just the difference between their predictions and can be computed for each cell, even though, for any cell, data were only observed in exactly one replicate of one condition (Fig. 2b).

The resulting matrix of differential expression estimates, Δ, has two uses: first, we can visualize the differential expression values for each gene as a function of latent space. Typical choices for the dimension of the latent space are ten to 100, and solely for visualization, we use a further nonlinear dimension reduction into two-dimensional scatterplots, such as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Examples are shown in Figs. 4 and 6. Second, we use Δ to guide the identification of differential expression neighborhoods, that is, groups of cells that consistently show differential expression for a particular gene (Fig. 1c, step 3). The intention for these neighborhoods is to be connected, convex and maximal, that is, the differential expression pattern would become disproportionately less consistent and less significant if the neighborhood were extended.

To rank and assess our level of confidence in the found neighborhoods, we do not attempt to measure the statistical uncertainty of the predictions Δ. Instead, we use pseudobulk aggregationof the original data: raw counts, if available, otherwise, the log-normalized values. For each sample, we sum up the original counts or take the mean of the log-normalized values of the cells in the neighborhood to obtain a neighborhood-specific gene × sample table (Fig. 1c, step 4), followed by a differential expression test with glmGamPoi, edgeRor limma.

### X chromosome regulation: diverse patterns in development, tissues and disease [^23c8994a]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2014). Medium credibility.

Genes on the mammalian X chromosome are present in one copy in males and two copies in females. The complex mechanisms that regulate the X chromosome lead to evolutionary and physiological variability in gene expression between species, the sexes, individuals, developmental stages, tissues and cell types. In early development, delayed and incomplete X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in some species causes variability in gene expression. Additional diversity stems from escape from XCI and from mosaicism or XCI skewing in females. This causes sex-specific differences that manifest as differential gene expression and associated phenotypes. Furthermore, the complexity and diversity of X dosage regulation affect the severity of diseases caused by X-linked mutations.

Methods

Framework

Supervised learning

In the supervised learning stage, the mathematician proposes a hypothesis that there exists a relationship between X (z) and Y (z). In this work we assume that there is no known function mapping from X (z) to Y (z), which in turn implies that X is not invertible (otherwise there would exist a known function Y ° X −1). While there may still be value to this process when the function is known, we leave this for future work. To test the hypothesis that X and Y are related, we generate a dataset of X (z), Y (z) pairs, where z is sampled from a distribution P Z. The results of the subsequent stages will hold true only for the distribution P Z, and not the whole space Z. Initially, sensible choices for P Z would be, for example, uniformly over the first N items for Z with a notion of ordering, or uniformly at random where possible. In subsequent iterations, P Z may be chosen to understand the behaviour on different parts of the space Z (for example, regions of Z that may be more likely to provide counterexamples to a particular hypothesis). To first test whether a relation between X (z) and Y (z) can be found, we use supervised learning to train a functionthat approximately maps X (z) to Y (z). In this work we use neural networks as the supervised learning method, in part because they can be easily adapted to many different types of X and Y and knowledge of any inherent geometry (in terms of invariances and symmetries) of the input domain X can be incorporated into the architecture of the network. We consider a relationship between X (z) and Y (z) to be found if the accuracy of the learned functionis statistically above chance on further samples from P Z on which the model was not trained. The converse is not true; namely, if the model cannot predict the relationship better than chance, it may mean that a pattern exists, but is sufficiently complicated that it cannot be captured by the given model and training procedure. If it does indeed exist, this can give a mathematician confidence to pursue a particular line of enquiry in a problem that may otherwise be only speculative.

### The human Y chromosome, in the light of evolution [^0bbf738d]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

Most eukaryotic chromosomes, akin to messy toolboxes, store jumbles of genes with diverse biological uses. The linkage of a gene to a particular chromosome therefore rarely hints strongly at that gene's function. One striking exception to this pattern of gene distribution is the human Y chromosome. Far from being random and diverse, known human Y-chromosome genes show just a few distinct expression profiles. Their relative functional conformity reflects evolutionary factors inherent to sex-specific chromosomes.

### Balancing false positives and false negatives for the detection of differential expression in malignancies [^26b6ac47]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Calculation of the number of genes that are and are not actually differentially expressed

Call N 0 the number of genes that are not actually differentially expressed (i.e. for which the null hypothesis is true) and N 1 the number of genes that are actually differentially expressed (i.e. for which the null hypothesis is false) – also see Table 1. Of course, these numbers are not known in advance and have to be estimated from the data. We use a recently introduced method for the estimation of N 0, which essentially consists of an evaluation of the following formula:

After N 0 is derived, N 1 can easily be estimated by N − N 0.

To test whether this approach results in reliable estimates for N 0 and N 1, we applied this method on five synthetic data sets generated by the model introduced by(also see) with increasing values for the standard deviations of the additive and multiplicative errors. These data sets contained 100 experiments each and were designed such that the values for N 1 and N 0 were known beforehand. For each data set, 8000 (N 0) genes had a constant true expression level over the 100 experiments, while 2000 (N 1) genes had a different true expression level in the first 50 experiments compared with the last 50 experiments. The five estimates of N 1 varied between 1939 and 1866, dependent on the settings for the additive and multiplicative error. Note that using a two-sample t -test instead of the Wilcoxon test did not result in a significantly different result (estimates varied between 1909 and 1847).

Estimation of the number of true positive, true negative, false-positive and false-negative genes

Suppose that we declare the genes with a P -value smaller than or equal to a certain rejection level α = p i (P -value of the i th gene) as differentially expressed (i.e. the null hypotheses for these genes are rejected) and the genes with a P -value larger than this rejection level as not differentially expressed (i.e. the null hypotheses for these genes are not rejected). When the declared status of differential expression is compared with the actual status, four categories of genes (true positive, true negative, false-positive and false-negative genes) emerge that are defined in Table 1. Using the value of N 1 and N 0, derived in the previous section, we can calculate the number of genes in each category using the formulas from Table 1.

Non‐negative least squares

Our APACE method proceeds by applying the NNLS algorithm to the linear regression model with SqD's (10) or (15) for unknown variance component estimation; precisely, we seekwhereis the objective function to be minimized. KKT conditions provide the necessary conditions for this optimization problem: If ρ * is the local minimizer of f (ρ) satisfying the inequality constraint ρ ≥ 0, then the following conditions hold:where, the gradient vector is(Karush, 1939; Kuhn & Tucker, 1951). Ascorresponds to the least squares normal equations, for any Z, D, and ρ found by OLS, the first two conditions are trivially satisfied, and hence, only the third condition needs to be checked. The NNLS algorithm proceeds by using OLS to estimate ρ and checking for negative elements. If a negative element is found, it is set to zero, effectively dropping that column from the Z, and OLS is re‐fit.

### Confronting false discoveries in single-cell differential expression [^9a761fcc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Differential expression analysis in single-cell transcriptomics enables the dissection of cell-type-specific responses to perturbations such as disease, trauma, or experimental manipulations. While many statistical methods are available to identify differentially expressed genes, the principles that distinguish these methods and their performance remain unclear. Here, we show that the relative performance of these methods is contingent on their ability to account for variation between biological replicates. Methods that ignore this inevitable variation are biased and prone to false discoveries. Indeed, the most widely used methods can discover hundreds of differentially expressed genes in the absence of biological differences. To exemplify these principles, we exposed true and false discoveries of differentially expressed genes in the injured mouse spinal cord.

### Evaluating the efficacy of intervention [^95e0f91d]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The standard for reaching a verdict in civil trials is "the preponderance of the evidence". This is a valid standard to apply to evaluating the medical literature as well. Every published report should be given weight based on physicians' judgment of its reliability. Larger-scale studies should be weighted more heavily than smaller-scale studies, randomized trials more heavily than observation studies, rigorously designed trials more heavily than studies that may be biased. If there seems to be a relationship between a factor and an outcome, this does not necessarily imply that the factor caused the outcome. The association could be a result of chance variation between individuals. Statistical testing allows researchers to exclude chance as a likely cause of the relationship, but this is the only explanation ruled out by a significance test. The relationship could be a result of bias: bias in the selection of individuals for the study, bias in measurement of the factor or the outcome, or bias in differential loss to follow-up. A thorough analysis of the data is necessary to identify and exclude other possible explanations of the association. A government agency dealing with environmental regulations experimented with replacing administrative law judges with scientists. It was believed that scientists were better qualified to make the necessary technical evaluations. The experiment was not considered successful because, as one observer remarked, "Judges are used to having to reach a verdict within a short period of time based on whatever evidence is presented — scientists just can't seem to make decisions". This illustrates a similar difference between the role of the researcher and the role of the physician. The physician must decide the best treatment for each patient based only on whatever evidence is available. There is little question, however, what the patient would decide if allowed to choose between receiving the standard therapy today or waiting 5 years until conclusive scientific evidence has been obtained about whether an alternative treatment is better. Few patients would choose to wait. Yet the decisions a physician makes today will be criticized in 5 years, especially by those who never have had to make similar decisions themselves. Some decisions will turn out to be wrong when additional data are available, but physicians must make choices based on the best data currently available. The choice of medicine as a profession implies the acceptance of a life sentence to jury duty: the evidence will never stop accumulating, and the verdict must be continually reevaluated.

In addition to refraction, EI is naturally sensitive to x-ray attenuation. The intensity in each raw projection image is a combination of both, and can be described by I (x, y) = e − μ (x, y) C (x m + α (x, y) z 2 /mag), where μ (x, y) = 4 π / λ ∫ β (x, y) dz is the sample's projected linear attenuation coefficient, α (x, y) = (λ /2 π) ∙ d / dxΦ (x, y) is the refraction angle, Φ (x, y) = 2 π / λ ∫ δ (x, y) dz is the phase shift, z 2 is the mask-to-mask distance, mag is the system magnification, and x and y are the horizontal and lateral detector coordinates. The symbol C denotes the illumination curve, which can be measured in the absence of the sample by step-scanning M 1 along the x -axis and recording the intensity on the detector at every step (Fig. 1b). This curve, which is of approximately Gaussian shape when measured across a single period of M 1, characterises the performance of any EI setup and should be acquired before each scan. The value x m, describing the position of M 1 at which the image is taken, is the called the working point. In the raw data, the refraction contrast appears as an edge signal characterised by fringes at boundaries within the sample, which corresponds to the refraction angle being the differential of the phase shift.

### Dynamics-dependent density distribution in active suspensions [^10fb565d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Self-propelled colloids constitute an important class of intrinsically non-equilibrium matter. Typically, such a particle moves ballistically at short times, but eventually changes its orientation, and displays random-walk behaviour in the long-time limit. Theory predicts that if the velocity of non-interacting swimmers varies spatially in 1D, v(x), then their density ρ(x) satisfies ρ(x) = ρ(0)v(0)/v(x), where x = 0 is an arbitrary reference point. Such a dependence of steady-state ρ(x) on the particle dynamics, which was the qualitative basis of recent work demonstrating how to 'paint' with bacteria, is forbidden in thermal equilibrium. Here we verify this prediction quantitatively by constructing bacteria that swim with an intensity-dependent speed when illuminated and implementing spatially-resolved differential dynamic microscopy (sDDM) for quantitative analysis over millimeter length scales. Applying a spatial light pattern therefore creates a speed profile, along which we find that, indeed, ρ(x)v(x) = constant, provided that steady state is reached.

### No evidence for sex-differential transcriptomes driving genome-wide sex-differential natural selection [^ed95e132]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in human transcriptomes have been argued to drive sex-differential selection (SDS). Here, we show that previous evidence supporting this hypothesis has been largely unfounded. We develop a method to test for a genome-wide relationship between sex differences in expression and selection on expression-influencing alleles (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]). We apply it across 34 human tissues and find no evidence for a general relationship. We offer possible explanations for the lack of evidence, including that it is due in part to eQTL ascertainment bias toward sites under weak selection. We conclude that the drivers of ongoing SDS in humans remain to be identified.

### The X factor: a robust and powerful approach to X-chromosome-inclusive whole-genome association studies [^df818ada]. Genetic Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The X-chromosome is often excluded from genome-wide association studies because of analytical challenges. Some of the problems, such as the random, skewed, or no X-inactivation model uncertainty, have been investigated. Other considerations have received little to no attention, such as the value in considering nonadditive and gene-sex interaction effects, and the inferential consequence of choosing different baseline alleles (i.e., the reference vs. the alternative allele). Here we propose a unified and flexible regression-based association test for X-chromosomal variants. We provide theoretical justifications for its robustness in the presence of various model uncertainties, as well as for its improved power when compared with the existing approaches under certain scenarios. For completeness, we also revisit the autosomes and show that the proposed framework leads to a more robust approach than the standard method. Finally, we provide supporting evidence by revisiting several published association studies. Supporting Information for this article are available online.

Notation

We model target variables (gene/protein/bacteria/etc;) one at a time. Let us assume that there are P individuals and there are n i time-series measurements from the i th individual. The total number of data points is thus. We denote the target variable by a column vector y = (y 1, y 2. y N) T and the covariates by X = (x 1, x 2. x N), where x i = (x i 1, x i 2. x id) T is a d -dimensional column vector and d is the number of covariates. We denote the domain of the j th variable byand the joint domain of all covariates is. In general, we use a bold font letter to denote a vector, an uppercase letter to denote a matrix, and a lowercase letter to denote a scale value.

Gaussian process

GP can be seen as a distribution of nonlinear functions. For inputs, GP is defined aswhere μ (x) is the mean and k (x, x ′) is a positive-semidefinite kernel function that defines the covariance between any two realizations of f (x) and f (x ′) bywhich is called kernel for short. The mean is often assumed to be zero, i.e. and the kernel has parameters θ, i.e. k (x, x ′| θ). For any finite collection of inputs X = (x 1, x 2. x N), the function values f (X) = (f (x 1), f (x 2). f (x N)) T have joint multivariate Gaussian distributionwhere elements of the N -by- N covariance matrix are defined by the kernel [K X, X (θ)] i, j = k (x i, x j | θ).

We use the following hierarchical GP modelwhere π (ϕ) defines a prior for the kernel parameters (including), is the noise variance, and I is the N -by- N identity matrix. For a Gaussian noise model, we can marginalise f analytically

### Balancing false positives and false negatives for the detection of differential expression in malignancies [^9d138743]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

A basic problem of microarray data analysis is to identify genes whose expression is affected by the distinction between malignancies with different properties. These genes are said to be differentially expressed. Differential expression can be detected by selecting the genes with P-values (derived using an appropriate hypothesis test) below a certain rejection level. This selection, however, is not possible without accepting some false positives and negatives since the two sets of P-values, associated with the genes whose expression is and is not affected by the distinction between the different malignancies, overlap. We describe a procedure for the study of differential expression in microarray data based on receiver-operating characteristic curves. This approach can be useful to select a rejection level that balances the number of false positives and negatives and to assess the degree of overlap between the two sets of P-values. Since this degree of overlap characterises the balance that can be reached between the number of false positives and negatives, this quantity can be seen as a quality measure of microarray data with respect to the detection of differential expression. As an example, we apply our method to data sets studying acute leukaemia.

Sex-related categories and considerations in preclinical models — definitions and cell-based implications are outlined: Dimorphism, sex differences, and sex convergence and divergence are defined such that outcomes can differ by sex, be quantitatively different, or be the same with different pathophysiological mechanisms; differences may be absent at baseline but appear after challenges such as injury or stress. In cell-based models, the biological sex of primary cells or cell lines is often not specified despite cellular sex profoundly influencing phenotype, function, and responses; sex differences can arise from gonadal hormones or sex chromosomes, and mammalian cells show intrinsic sex-specific differences and respond differently to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors.

### Explainable artificial intelligence for mental health through transparency and interpretability for understandability [^5a9312a6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition (Transparency). The inputs x and feature space f (x) of a model should either
stand in close correspondence to how humans understand the same inputs or,
relationships between inputs (and their representation in features space) should afford an interpretation that is clinically meaningful

For example, if the inputs to a model are A g e and performance on some cognitive task, T e s t S c o r e, then the model is feature transparent if:
trivially, the feature space is identical to the inputs, f (x) ≡ x.
the feature space can be described e.g. as an explicit function of the inputs f (x) = A g e + T e s t S c o r e 2 — in this example, the function may represent feature engineering that includes human-expert domain knowledge relevant to the application,
the feature space can be represented to a human operator such that differences and similarities between exemplars (i.e. two different patients) preserves or affords a clinical meaning e.g. exemplars with similar T e s t S c o r e values aggregate together even if they differ in A g e. In this example, let f (x 1) represent an individual with a low T e s t S c o r e and younger A g e (a clinical group representing premature onset of a cognitive disorder) and f (x 2) represent an individual with a low T e s t S c o r e and higher A g e (representing another clinical group) — if f (⋅) is a non-trivial function, we need to provide a mechanism that exposes why x 1 and x 2 are represented differently/similarly under f (⋅) consistent with a human expert's differentiation of the two cases; an obvious method being distance-preserving mappings for unsupervised algorithms or conformity measures for e.g. supervised classification with deep learning.

### An expectation-maximization algorithm for the analysis of allelic expression imbalance [^80a63f76]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

A significant proportion of the variation between individuals in gene expression levels is genetic, and it is likely that these differences correlate with phenotypic differences or with risk of disease. Cis-acting polymorphisms are important in determining interindividual differences in gene expression that lead to allelic expression imbalance, which is the unequal expression of homologous alleles in individuals heterozygous for such a polymorphism. This expression imbalance can be detected using a transcribed polymorphism, and, once it is established, the next step is to identify the polymorphisms that are responsible for or predictive of allelic expression levels. We present an expectation-maximization algorithm for such analyses, providing a formal statistical framework to test whether a candidate polymorphism is associated with allelic expression differences.

### Spin dephasing under nonlinear gradients: implications for imaging and field mapping [^eaf2803c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This work examines the prototypical MR echo that would be expected for a voxel of spins evolving in a strong nonlinear field, specifically focusing on the quadratic z(2) - ½(x(2) + y(2)) field. Dephasing under nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to predict key features of the nonlinear evolution.

### Assisted differential network analysis for gene expression data [^fe754080]. Genetic Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the analysis of gene expression data, when there are two or more disease conditions/groups (e.g., diseased and normal, responder and nonresponder, and multiple stages/subtypes), differential analysis has been extensively conducted to identify key differences and has important implications. Network analysis takes a system perspective and can be more informative than that limited to simple statistics such as mean and variance. In differential network analysis, a common practice is to first estimate a gene expression network for each condition/group, and then spectral clustering can be applied to the network difference(s) to identify key genes and biological mechanisms that lead to the differences. Compared to "simple" analysis such as regression, differential network analysis can be more challenging with the significantly larger number of parameters. In this study, taking advantage of the increasing popularity of multidimensional profiling data, we develop an assisted analysis strategy and propose incorporating regulator information to improve the identification of key genes (that lead to the differences in gene expression networks). An effective computational algorithm is developed. Comprehensive simulation is conducted, showing that the proposed approach can outperform the benchmark alternatives in identification accuracy. With the The Cancer Genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma data, we analyze the expressions of genes in the KEGG cell cycle pathway, assisted by copy number variation data. The proposed assisted analysis leads to identification results similar to the alternatives but different estimations. Overall, this study can deliver an efficient and cost-effective way of improving differential network analysis.

### Statistics for X-chromosome associations [^c3957f8d]. Genetic Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), association between genotype and phenotype at autosomal loci is generally tested by regression models. However, X-chromosome data are often excluded from published analyses of autosomes because of the difference between males and females in number of X chromosomes. Failure to analyze X-chromosome data at all is obviously less than ideal, and can lead to missed discoveries. Even when X-chromosome data are included, they are often analyzed with suboptimal statistics. Several mathematically sensible statistics for X-chromosome association have been proposed. The optimality of these statistics, however, is based on very specific simple genetic models. In addition, while previous simulation studies of these statistics have been informative, they have focused on single-marker tests and have not considered the types of error that occur even under the null hypothesis when the entire X chromosome is scanned. In this study, we comprehensively tested several X-chromosome association statistics using simulation studies that include the entire chromosome. We also considered a wide range of trait models for sex differences and phenotypic effects of X inactivation. We found that models that do not incorporate a sex effect can have large type I error in some cases. We also found that many of the best statistics perform well even when there are modest deviations, such as trait variance differences between the sexes or small sex differences in allele frequencies, from assumptions.

### Monozygotic twins reveal germline contribution to allelic expression differences [^4f3c4667]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Variation in the level of gene expression is a major determinant of a cell's function and characteristics. Common allelic variants of genes can be expressed at different levels and thus contribute to phenotypic diversity. We have measured allelic expression differences at heterozygous loci in monozygotic twins and in unrelated individuals. We show that the extent of differential allelic expression is highly similar within monozygotic twin pairs for many loci, implying that allelic differences in gene expression are under genetic control. We also show that even subtle departures from equal allelic expression are often genetically determined.

### Evaluating the consistency of differential expression of microRNA detected in human cancers [^b4da01d9]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Differential expression of microRNA (miRNA) is involved in many human diseases and could potentially be used as a biomarker for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, inconsistency has often been found among differentially expressed miRNAs identified in various studies when using miRNA arrays for a particular disease such as a cancer. Before broadly applying miRNA arrays in a clinical setting, it is critical to evaluate inconsistent discoveries in a rational way. Thus, using data sets from 2 types of cancers, our study shows that the differentially expressed miRNAs detected from multiple experiments for each cancer exhibit stable regulation direction. This result also indicates that miRNA arrays could be used to reliably capture the signals of the regulation direction of differentially expressed miRNAs in cancer. We then assumed that 2 differentially expressed miRNAs with the same regulation direction in a particular cancer play similar functional roles if they regulate the same set of cancer-associated genes. On the basis of this hypothesis, we proposed a score to assess the functional consistency between differentially expressed miRNAs separately extracted from multiple studies for a particular cancer. We showed although lists of differentially expressed miRNAs identified from different studies for each cancer were highly variable, they were rather consistent at the level of function. Thus, the detection of differentially expressed miRNAs in various experiments for a certain disease tends to be functionally reproducible and capture functionally related differential expression of miRNAs in the disease.

### SpookyNet: learning force fields with electronic degrees of freedom and nonlocal effects [^5c3336ca]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

SpookyNet architecture

SpookyNet takes sets of atomic numbersand Cartesian coordinates, which describe the element types and positions of N atoms, as input. Information about the electronic wave function, which is necessary for an unambiguous description of a chemical system, is provided via two additional inputs: The total chargeencodes the number of electrons (given by Q + ∑ i Z i), whereas the total angular momentum is encoded as the number of unpaired electrons. For example, a singlet state is indicated by S = 0, a doublet state by S = 1, and so on. The nuclear charges Z, total charge Q and spin state S are transformed to F -dimensional embeddings and combined to form initial atomic feature representationsHere, the nuclear embeddings e Z contain information about the ground state electron configuration of each element and the electronic embeddings e Q and e S contain delocalized information about the total charge and spin state, respectively. A chain of T interaction modules iteratively refines these representations through local and nonlocal interactionswherecontains all atom indices within a cutoff distance r cut of atom i andis the relative position of atom j with respect to atom i. The local interaction functions are designed to resemble s, p, and d atomic orbitals (see Fig. 1 d) and the model learns to encode different distance and angular information about the local environment of each atom with the different interaction functions (see Fig. 2 a). The nonlocal interactions on the other hand model the delocalized electrons. The representations x (t) at each stage are further refined through learned functionsaccording toand summed to the atomic descriptorsfrom which atomic energy contributions E i are predicted with linear regression. The total potential energy is given bywhere E rep, E ele, and E vdw are empirical corrections, which augment the energy prediction with physical knowledge about nuclear repulsion, electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. Energy-conserving forcescan be obtained via automatic differentiation. A schematic depiction of the SpookyNet architecture is given in Fig. 3.

### Estimating the statistical significance of gene expression changes observed with oligonucleotide arrays [^ba8afa58]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

We present a simple method to assign approximate P-values to gene expression changes detected with Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays and software. The method pools data for groups of genes and a small number of like-to-like comparisons in order to estimate the significance of changes observed for single genes in comparisons of experimental interest. Statistical significance levels are based on the observed variability in the fractional majority of probe pairs that indicate increasing or decreasing differential expression in comparisons of technical replicates. From this reference distribution or error model, we compute the expected frequency for fractional majorities in comparisons for N ≥ 2. These computed distributions are the source of P-value estimates for changes seen in the experimental comparisons. The method is intended to complement the Affymetrix software and to rationalize gene selection for experimental designs involving limited replication.

### Diagnostic and prognostic prediction using gene expression profiles in high-dimensional microarray data [^8ef33bc1]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The cross-validated prediction error is an estimate of the prediction error associated with the algorithm for model building used. It is not an estimate constructed for a specific model. If we use all of the data to select genes and construct a specific model, there is no independent data left to estimate validly prediction error. A commonly used invalid estimate is called the resubstitution estimate. You use all the samples to develop a model M. Then you predict the class of each sample i using its expression profile x i; ĉ i = M (x i). The predicted class labels are compared to the true class labels and the number of errors are totaled.

performed a simulation to examine the bias in estimated error rates for class prediction (see their supplemental information for a full description of the simulation). Two types of LOOCV were studied: one with removal of the left out specimen prior to selection of differentially expressed genes and one with removal of the left out specimen prior to computation of gene weights and the prediction rule but after gene selection. They also computed the resubstitution estimate of the error rate. In a simulated data set, 20 gene expression profiles of length 6000 were randomly generated from the same distribution. In all, 10 profiles were arbitrarily assigned to 'Class 1' and the other 10 to 'Class 2', creating an artificial separation of the profiles into two classes. Since no true underlying difference exists between the two classes, class prediction will perform no better than a random guess for future biologically independent samples. Hence, the estimated error rates for simulated data sets should be centred around 0.5 (i.e. 10 misclassifications out of 20).

### Transcriptomic signatures of rare variant impacts across sex and the X chromosome [^b4c84083]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

The human X chromosome contains hundreds of genes and has well-established impacts on sex differences and traits. However, the X chromosome is often excluded from many genetic analyses, limiting broader understanding of variant effects. In particular, the functional impact of rare variants on the X chromosome is understudied. To investigate functional rare variants on the X chromosome, we use observations of outlier gene expression from Genotype Tissue Expression consortium data. We show that outlier genes are enriched for having nearby rare variants on the X chromosome, and this enrichment is stronger for males. Using the RIVER model, we identified 733 rare variants in 450 genes predicted to have functional differences between males and females. We examined the pharmacogenetic implications of these variants and observed that 25% of drugs with a known sex difference in adverse drug reactions were connected to genes that contained a sex-biased rare variant. We further identify that sex-biased rare variants preferentially impact transcription factors with predicted sex-differential binding, such as the XIST -modulated SIX1. Overall, we observed more within-sex variation than between-sex variation. Combined, our study investigates functional rare variants on the X chromosome, and further details how sex stratification of variant effect prediction improves identification of rare variants with predicted sex-biased effects, transcription factor biology, and pharmacogenomic impacts.

### Optimizing differential expression analysis for proteomics data via high-performing rules and ensemble inference [^d7b198ca]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Partial area under receiver operator characteristic curves (pAUC)

The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) is generated by plotting true positive rates (TPR) against false positive rates (FPR) under various thresholds to classify samples into two categories. The area under the ROC (AUC) is a widely used performance indicator to evaluate the power of a classifier in classification tasks. The partial AUC is proposed for restricting the evaluation of given ROC curves in the range of FPRs that are considered interesting for diagnostic purposes. In our performance evaluations, the confidence score of a given protein to be a true differentially expressed protein is calculated by 1- q -value, where q -value is its Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p -value. The FPR is restricted to FPR ≤ 0.01, FPR ≤ 0.05, and FPR ≤ 0.1, respectively, to calculate three performance indicators, i.e. pAUC(0.01), pAUC(0.05), and pAUC(0.1) for a stricter performance evaluation.

### When to keep it simple-adaptive designs are not always useful [^bc2b8212]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adaptive designs are a wide class of methods focused on improving the power, efficiency and participant benefit of clinical trials. They do this through allowing information gathered during the trial to be used to make changes in a statistically robust manner - the changes could include which treatment arms patients are enrolled to (e.g. dropping non-promising treatment arms), the allocation ratios, the target sample size or the enrolment criteria of the trial. Generally, we are enthusiastic about adaptive designs and advocate their use in many clinical situations. However, they are not always advantageous. In some situations, they provide little efficiency advantage or are even detrimental to the quality of information provided by the trial. In our experience, factors that reduce the efficiency of adaptive designs are routinely downplayed or ignored in methodological papers, which may lead researchers into believing they are more beneficial than they actually are.

Main Text

In this paper, we discuss situations where adaptive designs may not be as useful, including situations when the outcomes take a long time to observe, when dropping arms early may cause issues and when increased practical complexity eliminates theoretical efficiency gains.

Conclusion

Adaptive designs often provide notable efficiency benefits. However, it is important for investigators to be aware that they do not always provide an advantage. There should always be careful consideration of the potential benefits and disadvantages of an adaptive design.

### Genome-wide gene expression effects of sex chromosome imprinting in drosophila [^0929269a]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

There is substantial overlap between genes differentially expressed in the female contrast and both male contrasts — 62% and 46% of genes significant in females are also significant in X/Y males and XY/Y males, respectively (P FET < 0.0001 in both cases). Furthermore, among those genes significantly differentially expressed between XY M X P and XY P X M females, we observed a negative correlation between the expression effects resulting from parent-of-origin of the compound XY chromosome in females and the free Y chromosome in males (Figure 4). This strong overlap and negative correlation between the sexes suggest that differential expression of these genes may result from the same regulatory mechanism in males and females and that this mechanism leads to the opposite effect (upregulation vs. downregulation) in males and females.

Figure 4
Expression differences in males and females for genes significantly differently expressed between females with reversed sex chromosome parent-of-origin inheritance. (A) Expression in X/Y males and XY/X females. There is a marginally significant negative correlation between gene expression effects attributable to parent-of-origin of the free X chromosome or the Y chromosome in males vs. females. (B) Expression in XY/Y males and XY/X females. There is a significant negative correlation between parent-of-origin effects attributable to the free Y chromosome in males and the attached X-Y chromosome in females. (C) Expression in X/Y and XY/Y males. There is a highly significant positive correlation attributable to parent-of-origin effects on the X chromosome or the free Y chromosome between these two male genotypes.

### Manipulating LiS / LiS mixed discharge products of all-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries for improved cycle life [^3349cfe5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

First principles calculations

All the first principles calculations were carried out in the DFT framework implemented in the VASP package. The projector augmented-wave pseudopotentials were used to describe the interaction between ions and electrons, and the exchange-correlation effects were treated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid of 3 × 3 × 1, and a kinetic energy cut-off of 600 eV was used to optimize all surface calculations. The LiI surface was created from a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell and a vacuum of 15 Å was used to avoid interaction between images. For surface calculations, the van der Waals (vdW) correction function proposed by Grimme was utilized. All the atoms were optimized until the total energies converged to below 10 −4 eV and the forces acting on atoms were less than 10 −2 eV/Å. The adsorption energy (E A) was calculated using the expression E A = E surface+adsorbate – (E surface + E adsorbate). The formation energy (E f) was calculated using the expression E f = E xy – (E x + E y), where x and y are pristine elements forming compound xy. The structures were visualized using the VESTA package.

### Module networks: identifying regulatory modules and their condition-specific regulators from gene expression data [^7ce726eb]. Nature Genetics (2003). Medium credibility.

Much of a cell's activity is organized as a network of interacting modules: sets of genes coregulated to respond to different conditions. We present a probabilistic method for identifying regulatory modules from gene expression data. Our procedure identifies modules of coregulated genes, their regulators and the conditions under which regulation occurs, generating testable hypotheses in the form 'regulator X regulates module Y under conditions W'. We applied the method to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression data set, showing its ability to identify functionally coherent modules and their correct regulators. We present microarray experiments supporting three novel predictions, suggesting regulatory roles for previously uncharacterized proteins.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Critical non-hermitian skin effect [^84048324]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Due to the robustness of the NHSE, eigenspectra predicted from the GBZ typically are approached rapidly by the exact numerically obtained OBC spectra even for small system sizes (sites). In principle, the convergence should be exact in the thermodynamic limit, but in practical computations, floating-point errors ϵ 0 are continuously amplified as they propagate across the system. We hence expect accurate numerical spectra only when, a condition always checked to be satisfied here to ensure that physical phenomena presented below are not due to numerical errors common in computations with non-reciprocal systems. However, the numerical agreement in eigenspectra between finite-size systems and the GBZ predictions fails spectacularly near a critical point where f (z, E) changes from being reducible to irreducible. To understand the significance of this algebraic property of reducibility, consider a set of coupled irreducible subsystems described by the characteristic polynomialwhere f i (z, E) is the characteristic polynomial of the i -th subsystem, and f 0 is a constant that represents the simplest possible form for the subsystem coupling. When f 0 = 0, f (z, E) completely factorizes into irreducible polynomials, as expected from a Hamiltonian H (z) that block-diagonalizes into irreducible sectors associated with the individual f i (z, E)'s. In particular, the OBC spectrum of this completely decoupled scenario is derived from the independent κ i (k)'s of each subsystem, each determined by z μ, z ν from the same subsystem.

### Dynamical regimes of diffusion models [^a7936fcc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Speciation time

In order to show the existence of regimes I and II, and compute the speciation time, we focus on the following protocol which consists of cloning trajectories. We consider a backward trajectory starting at time t f ≫ 1 from a point x f drawn from a random Gaussian distribution where all components are independent with mean zero and unit variance. This trajectory evolves backward in time, through the backward process until time t < t f. At this time the trajectory has reached the point y (t), at which cloning takes place. One generates for τ < t two clones, starting from the same x 1 (t) = x 2 (t) = y (t), and evolving as independent trajectories x 1 (τ) and x 2 (τ), i.e. with independent thermal noises. We compute the probability ϕ (t) that the two trajectories ending in x 1 (0) and x 2 (0) are in the same class. Defining P (x 1, 0∣ y, t) as the probability that the backward process ends in x 1, given that it was in y at time t, the joint probability of finding the trajectory in y at time t and the two clones in x 1 and x 2 at time 0 is obtained as Q (x 1, x 2, y, t) = P (x 1, 0∣ y, t) P (x 2, 0∣ y, t) P (y, t). Then ϕ (t) is the integral of Q over x 1, x 2, y with the constraint (x 1 ⋅ m)(x 2 ⋅ m) > 0. This simplifies into a one-dimensional integral (see SI Appendix):where G (y, u, v) is a Gaussian probability density function for the real variable y, with mean u and variance v, and, Γ t = Δ t + σ 2 e −2 t. The probability ϕ (t) that the two clones end up in the same cluster is a decreasing function of t, going from ϕ (0) = 1 to ϕ (∞) = 1/2. In the large d limit, the scaling variable controlling the change of ϕ iswhich can be rewritten asby using. This explicitly shows that speciation takes place at the time scale t S on a window of time of order one. As detailed in SI Appendix, this expression for t S coincides with the one obtained from the general criterion (5). We show in Fig. 2 the analytical result from (6) and direct numerical results obtained for increasingly larger dimensions. This comparison shows that our analysis is accurate already for moderately large dimensions. In the limit of infinite d, the analytical curve in Fig. 2 suddenly jumps from one to zero at t / t S = 1, corresponding to a symmetry-breaking phase transition (or a threshold phenomenon) on the time scale t S. In the numerics, following finite size scaling theory, we have defined the speciation time as the crossing point of the curves for different d, which corresponds approximatively to ϕ (t S) = 0.775 and indeed is of the orderfor d → ∞. As it happens in mean-field theories of phase transitions, the large dimensional limit allows to obtain a useful limiting process. In our case, this leads to a full characterization of the asymptotic backward dynamics. At its beginning, i.e. in regime I, the overlap with the centers of the Gaussian model, ± m ⋅ x (t), is of order. Defining, one can obtain a closed stochastic Langevin equation on q in a potential V (q, t) (see SI Appendix), where η (t) is square root of two times a Brownian motion, andAt large d, this potential is quadratic at times, and it develops a double well structure, with a very large barrier, when. The trajectories of q (t) are subjected to a force that drives them toward plus and minus infinity. The barrier between positive and negative values of q becomes so large that trajectories commit to a definite sign of q: this is how the symmetry breaking takes place dynamically at the time scale t S, in agreement with the previous cloning results. Regime II corresponds to the scaling limit q → ∞, where m ⋅ x (t) becomes of order d. In this regime, the rescaled overlap m ⋅ x (t)/ d concentrates, and its sign depends on the set of trajectories one is focusing on. Moreover, the stochastic dynamics of the x i correspond to the backward dynamics for a single Gaussian centered in ± m. This shows that the dynamics generalizes, see SI Appendix (and alsofor similar results).

System-wide measurements of gene expression by DNA microarray and, more recently, RNA-sequencing strategies have become de facto tools of modern biology and have led to deep understanding of biological mechanisms and pathways. However, analyses of the measurements have often ignored statistically robust methods that account for variance, resulting in misleading biological interpretations.

### Animal diversity and ecosystem functioning in dynamic food webs [^7a010bfd]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Ecosystem functions respond to animal diversity

We investigated how increasing animal diversity affects ecosystem functioning, defined as the summed biomass stocks of plant and animal species (P and A, respectively), the rates of consumption on the plant community (F P) and within the animal community (that is, intraguild predation, F A), as well as the energetic losses due to metabolism of both compartments (X P and X A; Fig. 1). We found that as the number of animal species increased, the total biomass of animals, A, increased as well (Fig. 4a; a = 0.35, and α = 1.2 as least squares estimates of power-law relationship of the shapefitted as a linear model on log–log transformed data; Residual standard error on degrees of freedom: s.e. = 0.012; Goodness of fit as indicated by Coefficient of determination: R 2 = 0.31). In contrast, the total biomass of plants, P, stagnated (Fig. 4b; a = 29.75, and α = −0.08, s.e. = 0.005, R 2 = 0.01). Along with the increase in animal biomasses, we observed an increase in intraguild predation rates, F A (Fig. 4c, a = 0.004, and α = 0.92, s.e. = 0.012, R 2 = 0.2). Despite the stable total biomass of plants, we found an increase in the consumption of plants by animals, F P (Fig. 4d; a = 0.1 and α = 0.61, s.e. = 0.005, R 2 = 0.38). Moreover, with increasing animal species richness the total animal metabolic rates, X A, increased (Fig. 4e; a = 0.05 and α = 0.58, s.e. = 0.005, R 2 = 0.38) while the total metabolic rates of plants, X P, decreased (Fig. 4f; a = 6.72 and α = −0.54, s.e. = 0.006, R 2 = 0.3).

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^29011d81]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Classes of factors causing sex differences — sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones both contribute to lung disease differences. The sex chromosomes cause the development of different gonads in the two sexes, which secrete different gonadal hormones that act throughout the body, and many actions of gonadal hormones are reversible, but some are long-lasting. The sex chromosomes can also act directly on nongonadal tissues, including the lung, to cause sex differences, and one goal is to differentiate the effects of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes in driving sex differences in lung disease, with the aim of identifying molecular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets.

### Genome-wide gene expression effects of sex chromosome imprinting in drosophila [^3d0715be]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

We compared the list of genes significantly differently expressed in X/Y and XY/Y males and found that 77% (205 genes) of the genes differently expressed between XY M Y P and XY P Y M males at an FDR of 0.05 were also differently expressed between X M Y P and X P Y M males. Furthermore, fold-change estimates across all genes were remarkably similar in the XY/Y and the X/Y comparisons (ρ = 0.68; P < 0.0001) (Figure 3), with a stronger correlation in the set of 205 differentially expressed genes common to both the XY/Y and X/Y experiments (ρ = 0.85; P < 0.0001). None of these 205 genes had sign differences in fold-change estimates between the X/Y and XY/Y experiments. These observations indicate that the gene expression effects attributable to paternal inheritance of the X chromosome or maternal inheritance of a free Y chromosome are similar in X/Y and XY/Y males.

### A blueprint for a synthetic genetic feedback optimizer [^587af717]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Comparator module

We next need to compare x with x d and y with y d to obtain the indicator signals x +, x −, y +, and y − (Fig. 1c). The comparator module provides these signals by combining three parts: the delay module from the previous section, bistable switches, and an oscillator, to periodically activate/deactivate regulatory interactions (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3
The comparator module generates the indicator signals based on the actual and delayed signals for both the regulator and the reporter.

Simulation parameters and further details are provided in Supplementary Section 5. a The signal c alternates between two states (c = 0 and c = 1) with period τ, activating two different sets of regulatory interactions. b During phase 1, (x +, x −) tracks the reference (x, x d), whereas during phase 2, (x +, x −) converges to either of the stable fixed points based on the sign of x − x d. c The signals x + and x − switch between their ON and OFF states depending on whether x < x d or x > x d (phase 1 is depicted in gray). d Closed loop performance is largely unaffected by the value of α c,2.

For the sake of simplicity, here we assume that the output c of a genetic oscillator alternates between two values: c = 0 and c = 1 during phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. We rely on this periodic signal to switch the comparator with inputs x d and x and outputs x − and x + between two modes according towhere α c,1 and α c,2 are production rate constants (de-dimensionalized, see Supplementary Section 1.3), and ϵ c characterizes the timescale of the comparator dynamics.

During phase 1 (c = 0), the system behaves as the delay module in Fig. 2: the indicator signals x + and x − track the reference signals x and x d, respectively (Fig. 3b). Assuming that this tracking occurs on a timescale faster than that of x and x d, during phase 1 x and x d are effectively frozen and x + and x − converge to these values if α c,1 = 1 (Fig. 3c). Therefore, at the end of phase 1, the values of x and x d are stored in x + and x −, respectively.

### The contributions of sex, genotype and age to transcriptional variance in drosophila melanogaster [^aa87e974]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

Here we present a statistically rigorous approach to quantifying microarray expression data that allows the relative effects of multiple classes of treatment to be compared and incorporates analytical methods that are common to quantitative genetics. From the magnitude of gene effects and contributions of variance components, we find that gene expression in adult flies is affected most strongly by sex, less so by genotype and only weakly by age (for 1- and 6-wk flies); in addition, sex x genotype interactions may be present for as much as 10% of the Drosophila transcriptome. This interpretation is compromised to some extent by statistical issues relating to power and experimental design. Nevertheless, we show that changes in expression as small as 1.2-fold can be highly significant. Genotypic contributions to transcriptional variance may be of a similar magnitude to those relating to some quantitative phenotypes and should be considered when assessing the significance of experimental treatments.

### Collective magnetism in an artificial 2D XY spin system [^ae37564a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Temperature-dependent muon-spin depolarisation

To determine the equilibrium properties of artificial dXY systems, we measured temperature-dependent zero-field μ SR relaxation spectra with the initial muon spin parallel to the in-plane x direction of the square lattice (see Methods). The measured muon-spin polarisation function P (t) is a smoothly decaying function with time and can be best described by a sum of a constant and two exponentially damped signals, with relative fractions g i (where i = 0, slow, or fast) and the corresponding depolarisation rates λ slow ≤ λ fast. Details of the fitting procedure are described in the Methods section.

To distinguish the influence of the collective magnetic behaviour of the nanomagnet ensemble and single-particle fluctuations on the muon polarisation P (t), comparative measurements were performed for samples with strong and negligible coupling, respectively. Representative μ SR spectra P (t, T) for the strongly interacting sample with d = 40 nm and a = 70, nm and for the non-interacting sample with d = 40 nm and a, = 140 nm (Sample Set 2 in Table 1) are shown in Fig. 2.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^117d4284]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Four core genotypes (FCG) and XY* mouse models — Dissecting sex chromosome versus gonadal hormone effects in lung disease research. The four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model offers advantages for determining if the XX versus XY sex chromosome complement has a differential effect on the phenotype and also tests if gonadal hormones contribute to sex difference; in the FCG model, the Sry gene responsible for testes development has been relocated from the Y chromosome to an autosome and it is the most widely used method for distinguishing the effects of sex chromosome complement from gonadal effects. The FCG model also detects interactions of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes, and investigators should be aware of caveats including genetic background, differences in Sry expression between the transgene and the wild-type gene, and differences in hormonal status; notably, a translocation of a 3.2-Mb region of the X chromosome to the Y Sry-chromosome has been reported in one FCG strain, whereas a new FCG strain (Strain number: 039108) does not carry the translocation. If a sex chromosome effect is detected using FCG, the XY* mouse model can determine whether the effect is caused by X or Y genes; XY* mice possess an abnormal pseudoautosomal region on the Y chromosome leading to atypical recombination with the X chromosome, and when XY* males are mated with XX females they produce offspring comparable to XX and XO females with ovaries and XY and XXY males with testes; in the XY* model, the presence of a Y chromosome results in gonadal males and the model comprises mice with one versus two X chromosomes (XO vs. XX, XY vs. XXY) and mice with one versus two Y chromosomes (XO vs. XY, XX vs. XXY).

### Fully-automated and ultra-fast cell-type identification using specific marker combinations from single-cell transcriptomic data [^0fdfbd8b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We extracted marker genes from the simulated reference data by performing differential expression analysis using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, similarly to the recent comparative evaluation work. For each cell type, we generated both highly-specific markers (ten top-ranked marker genes separately for each cell type), identified through differential expression, and low-specificity markers (ten top-ranked marker genes for a mixture of all simulated cell types including the cell type in question), which were used as the input for the ScType and other methods. To generate low-specificity markers for n th cell type, we took all the pairs of two cell types including n th cell type (e.g. n th and n + 1, or n th and n + 2 cell types), and identified differentially expressed genes between each group of two cell types vs other cells; finally, we combined all "unspecific" genes together and randomly selected 10 of them.

### Sex chromosome genes directly affect brain sexual differentiation [^a692aa73]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in the brain are caused by differences in gonadal secretions: higher levels of testosterone during fetal and neonatal life cause the male brain to develop differently than the female brain. In contrast, genes encoded on the sex chromosomes are not thought to contribute directly to sex differences in brain development, even though male (XY) cells express Y-chromosome genes that are not present in female (XX) cells, and XX cells may have a higher dose of some X-chromosome genes. Using mice in which the genetic sex of the brain (XX versus XY) was independent of gonadal phenotype (testes versus ovaries), we found that XY and XX brain cells differed in phenotype, indicating that a brain cell's complement of sex chromosomes may contribute to its sexual differentiation.

### Evaluation of the evenness score in next-generation sequencing [^1f5f1936]. Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The evenness score (E) in next-generation sequencing (NGS) quantifies the homogeneity in coverage of the NGS targets. Here I clarify the mathematical description of E, which is 1 minus the integral from 0 to 1 over the cumulative distribution function F(x) of the normalized coverage x, where normalization means division by the mean, and derive a computationally more efficient formula; that is, 1 minus the integral from 0 to 1 over the probability density distribution f(x) times 1-x. An analogous formula for empirical coverage data is provided as well as fast R command line scripts. This new formula allows for a general comparison of E with the coefficient of variation (= standard deviation σ of normalized data) which is the conventional measure of the relative width of a distribution. For symmetrical distributions, including the Gaussian, E can be predicted closely as 1-σ(2)/2⩾E⩾1-σ/2 with σ ≤ 1 owing to normalization and symmetry. In case of the log-normal distribution as a typical representative of positively skewed biological data, the analysis yields E≈exp(-σ*/2) with σ*(2) = ln(σ(2)+1) up to large σ (≤ 3), and E≈1-F(exp(-1)) for very large σ (⩾2.5). In the latter kind of rather uneven coverage, E can provide direct information on the fraction of well-covered targets that is not immediately delivered by the normalized σ. Otherwise, E does not appear to have major advantages over σ or over a simple score exp(-σ) based on it. Actually, exp(-σ) exploits a much larger part of its range for the evaluation of realistic NGS outputs.

### Pseudo-projection-driven, self-gated cardiac cine imaging using cartesian golden step phase encoding [^5a5c8ab4]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

THEORY

In this section, we show mathematically how a two‐dimensional (2D) object projects onto a stream of near‐center Cartesian readouts to reveal its x motion and present the golden step scheme and its theoretical benefits.

Motion Detection Using Near‐Center Readouts

In this study, the interval centered on k y = 0 within which the Cartesian readouts are considered "near center" and used for motion tracking will be referred to as the "navigator zone". For a 2D object f (x, y), the x inverse Fourier transform of the central phase encode is its projection along the x axis and can be written as

Because f (x − Δ x, y) would yield p (x − Δ x), translational motion of the object along x is preserved in its projection. Existing motion‐tracking algorithms 24, 34, 35 can readily process p (x − Δ x (t)) to extract the displacement Δ x throughout time.

In this study, we define the "pseudo‐projection" as the magnitude of the x inverse Fourier transform of a noncentral phase encode, which can be written as

Because only magnitude information is taken, any object displacement (assuming rigid motion) along the y direction is not reflected on its pseudo‐projection:

A key assumption of this study is that the pseudo‐projection at a higher k y can be related to the magnitude of the central projection at k y = 0 withwhere the magnitude scaling factor c (x, k y) is dependent on the particular slice imaged and can be obtained from fully sampled x ‐ k y domain data.

Ideally, a separate magnitude scaling factor c (x, k y) needs to be found for each motion state. Because motion is unknown, the x variation of c (x, k y) is assumed to be small enough such that a single c (x, k y) can be used for all states of x ‐motion. For a motion scan, c (x, k y) can be determined from the average of all data acquired, which is the average of all motion states. Thus for any displacement Δ x, we assume

In other words, we approximate the true projection using the k y ‐ and x ‐dependent scaling of a noncentral pseudo‐projection. The above expression is meaningful only to a limited extent of | k y |, because at large | k y |, A (x, k y) diminishes toward noise level and the calculation of c (x, k y) becomes unreliable.

### Genome-wide gene expression effects of sex chromosome imprinting in drosophila [^25429855]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Little effect of Y chromosome parent-of-origin on gene expression in XY/X female genotypes

To investigate further the effects of Y-linked inheritance on global gene expression, we contrasted female genotypes that carry paternal or maternal Y chromosomes (see Materials and Methods). As with the male comparisons, we compared two XY/X female genotypes with the same nuclear genotype but that differed in the parent-of-origin of a single free X chromosome and a compound XY chromosome (XY M X P vs. XY P X M) (Figure 1). Although this contrast between female genotypes was performed at a level of replication equivalent to that of the X/Y male comparison (Materials and Methods), at an FDR of 0.05 we detected only 41 genes differently expressed between XY M X P and XY P X M females (and Table 1). This suggests that transmission of the Y chromosome through the male or female germline has a small impact on global gene expression in females. None of the genes differentially expressed between XY M X P and XY P X M females are X-linked (Table 1), whereas 17% of genes robustly expressed on the female arrays are X-linked (P FET = 0.002), suggesting that, as in males, parent-of-origin expression effects in females are indirect and downstream consequences of epigenetic modifications to sex chromosome chromatin.

### A geometric approach to characterize the functional identity of single cells [^00e6c55b]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Computing ACTION metric as a measure of similarity between cells

The transcriptome of each cell consists of genes that are expressed at different levels and have different specificity with respect to the underlying cell types. Universally expressed genes correspond to the subset of genes responsible for mediating core cellular functions. These functions are needed by all cells to function properly, which result in ubiquitous expression of these genes across all cell types. While fundamental to cellular function, these genes are not informative with respect to the identity of cells. On the other hand, cell-type-specific genes are preferentially expressed in one or a few selected cell types to perform cell-type-specific functions. Unlike universally expressed genes, cell-type-specific genes are, typically, weakly expressed, but are highly relevant for grouping cells according to their common functions. Our goal here is to define a similarity measure between cells that suppresses universally expressed genes and enhances the signal contained in cell-type-specific genes.

To suppress the ubiquitously high expression of universally expressed genes, we adopt a method that we developed recently for bulk tissue measurements and extend it to single-cell analysis. This method projects a standardized representation of expression profiles of cells onto the orthogonal subspace of universally expressed genes. Let us denote the raw expression profile of cells using matrix, where each row corresponds to a gene and each column represents a cell. We use x i to denote the expression profile of i th cell. In addition, let us denote the signature vector of universally expressed genes by v. As a first order estimate, a universally expressed signature is computed by taking the average expression over all cells:; that is, v i is the average expression of gene i across all samples. This choice is motivated by the fact that highly expressed genes are more consistently expressed, whereas lowly expressed genes show exhibit higher variability. To this end, by orthogonalizing with respect to the mean value, we significantly reduce the effect of universally expressed genes, while preserving the variation of lowly expressed, but preferential ones. After estimating this baseline expression, we z -score normalize the profile of each cell: where μ i and σ i are the mean and sample standard deviation of the entries in the i th cell profile. Similarly, we z -score normalize the signature vector of universally expressed genes, v, to create a new vector z v. Finally, we project out the impact of the universally expressed gene expressions on each cell's profile as follows:

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^d64de6b7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex as a biological variable (SABV) in in vitro lung models — Cells derived from males and females differ in sex chromosomal complement and responses to environmental stimuli, growth factors, and disease, and the biological sex of cells plays a critical role in determining their phenotype and function. If cells are isolated from animals or humans, the donor's sex should be specified, and ideally, the sex of primary cells obtained from commercial sources should be confirmed. If the sex of the cells under study is unknown, assessing for the presence of X and Y chromosomes or X- and Y-chromosome–encoded genes (e.g. SRY) is an easy way of deciphering the sex of the cells under investigation. Variables such as isolation techniques, culture conditions, subculturing duration, and the timing of measurements can introduce variability that masks or amplifies sex-based differences, and prolonged passaging may also lead to cellular senescence and altered gene expression and (in the case of pluripotent stem cells) variable X chromosome inactivation or reactivation, thus differentially affecting male and female cells; carefully controlling these variables is crucial for accurately interpreting sex-based differences in in vitro studies. In human tissue–based translational models, the biological sex of the tissue donor must be considered, and incorporating SABV is equally important in complex 3D models like organoids and multicellular coculture systems; for instance, female-derived lung organoids may exhibit different repair mechanisms than male-derived counterparts, highlighting the need to include both sexes in lung disease modeling.

To investigate the functional impact of sex-specific rare variants, we curated a comprehensive set of annotations. We then examined the proportion of functional rare variants (defined as RIVER posterior > 0.2) with a given annotation (missense, intronic, etc.) and did so for those that were female biased, male biased, and not sex biased. Here, we defined the background as all scored variants (appearing in both females and males), and sex-shared variants as those with large posteriors (> 0.2) in both sexes. Several variant types were enriched for being sex-biased and functional compared with non-functional, such as TF binding sites, stop-gained, and splice sites (Figures 4 B, 11, and 11B). Non-functional variants were enriched in non-coding and intergenic regions (Figures 4 B, 11 A, and 11B).

### A random-walk benchmark for single-electron circuits [^3b516153]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The random-walk benchmarking addresses the question of uniformity in time of repeated identical operations by error accumulation. The error signal (syndrome) considered here is the discrete charge stored in the circuit after executing a sequence of t operations. The measured deviation x in the number of trapped electrons is modeled by the probabilityfor a random walker to reach integer coordinate x from initial position of x = 0 in t steps (Fig. 1). In the desired high-fidelity limit of near-deterministic on-demand transfer of a fixed number of electrons any residual randomly occurring errors that alter x will be very rare and the walker will remain stationary most of the time, with occasional steps of length one. Here we study to what extent two single-step, x → x ± 1, probabilities P ± describe the statistics of x collected by repeated operation of the circuit, and how deviations from independent-error accumulation can be detected and quantified, revealing otherwise hidden physics. The baseline random-walk model with t - and x -independent P ± predicts the following distribution:withobtained from Eq. (1) by x → − x and P ± → P ∓ (see derivation in Supplementary Note 1). Here the first term of the product describes the decay of fidelity that is exponential in t, while the binomial coefficient and the Gaussian hypergeometric function 2 F 1 (here a polynomial of order at most t) take into account the self-intersecting paths as single-step errors accumulate and partially cancel at large t (Fig. 1 a).

### Novel tools for comparing the architecture of psychopathology between neurogenetic disorders: an application to X-versus Y-chromosome aneuploidy effects in males [^528b9967]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychiatric symptoms are typically highly inter-correlated at the group level. Collectively, these correlations define the architecture of psychopathology - informing taxonomic and mechanistic models in psychiatry. However, to date, it remains unclear if this architecture differs between etiologically distinct subgroups, despite the core relevance of this understanding for personalized medicine. Here, we introduce a new analytic pipeline to probe group differences in the psychopathology architecture - demonstrated through the comparison of two distinct neurogenetic disorders.

Methods

We use a large questionnaire battery in 300 individuals aged 5–25 years (n = 102 XXY/KS, n = 64 XYY, n = 134 age-matched XY) to characterize the structure of correlations among 53 diverse measures of psychopathology in XXY/KS and XYY syndrome - enabling us to compare the effects of X- versus Y-chromosome dosage on the architecture of psychopathology at multiple, distinctly informative levels.

Results

Behavior correlation matrices describe the architecture of psychopathology in each syndrome. A comparison of matrix rows reveals that social problems and externalizing symptoms are most differentially coupled to other aspects of psychopathology in XXY/KS versus XYY. Clustering the difference between matrices captures coordinated group differences in pairwise coupling between measures of psychopathology: XXY/KS shows greater coherence among externalizing, internalizing, and autism-related features, while XYY syndrome shows greater coherence in dissociality and early neurodevelopmental impairment.

Conclusions

These methods offer new insights into X- and Y-chromosome dosage effects on behavior, and our shared code can now be applied to other clinical groups of interest - helping to hone mechanistic models and inform the tailoring of care.

### X-chromosome upregulation operates on a gene-by-gene basis at RNA and protein levels [^a8b5161b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Identification of genes subject to XCU

We next sought to characterize which X-linked genes are transcriptionally dosage compensated in this system. Of the 405 expressed X-linked genes for which we obtained allele-resolution expression data, 103 (~ 40%) were found to be significantly transcriptionally upregulated in XO and XY cells (collectively X monosomy) compared to XX cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 1). These results are in line with previous findings that transcriptional XCU is specific to a subset of genes. Both non-upregulated and upregulated genes were found to be located across the X chromosome and not enriched to a specific locus (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The mean allelic expression of the upregulated genes was significantly higher in X monosomy cells than in XX cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h).

### Diverse and asymmetric patterns of single-neuron projectome in regulating interhemispheric connectivity [^81dee498]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Heterogeneity of projections to mutually heterotopic regions

Let region X project to regions Y 1, Y 2,…, Y n, which can be either intrahemispheric or interhemispheric to X. The corresponding sets of projecting neurons within X were denoted as x 1, x 2,…, x n. Heterogeneity was defined by the distribution P (N), which described the number of subsets (N, ranging from 1 to n) that included the projecting neurons. With this definition, heterogeneity was also a measure of the distribution of the number of downstream regions for each projecting neuron. For instance, in an extreme scenario, where each neuron in X is projected solely to one downstream, P (N = 1) = 1 and P (N = i) = 0 for i from 2 to n. Larger heterogeneity represents the situation in which the mass of the distribution P (N) moves to the side of smaller N.

### Genes that escape from X inactivation [^50e12c1e]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

To achieve a balanced gene expression dosage between males (XY) and females (XX), mammals have evolved a compensatory mechanism to randomly inactivate one of the female X chromosomes. Despite this chromosome-wide silencing, a number of genes escape X inactivation: in women about 15% of X-linked genes are bi-allelically expressed and in mice, about 3%. Expression from the inactive X allele varies from a few percent of that from the active allele to near equal expression. While most genes have a stable inactivation pattern, a subset of genes exhibit tissue-specific differences in escape from X inactivation. Escape genes appear to be protected from the repressive chromatin modifications associated with X inactivation. Differences in the identity and distribution of escape genes between species and tissues suggest a role for these genes in the evolution of sex differences in specific phenotypes. The higher expression of escape genes in females than in males implies that they may have female-specific roles and may be responsible for some of the phenotypes observed in X aneuploidy.

### Comprehensive evaluation of deconvolution methods for human brain gene expression [^4c50610d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We next investigated the more challenging case where, in addition to differences in cell-type composition, there are true differences in gene expression between the two groups. To this end, we simulated data with differences in cell-type composition as above, while also introducing gene expression changes in a set of 200 genes, of which 100 are markers of excitatory neurons and 100 are non-marker genes (see the "Methods" section). Several sets of simulations were generated with a mean expression difference between groups of 1.1-, 1.3-, 1.5- or 2-fold.

To quantify how effectively cellular composition was corrected for, we calculated a discriminatory power metric: the fraction of the 200 perturbed genes that were in the top 200 most significant DE genes. This measure rewards true-positives while penalising false-positives. We found that without correction, the discriminatory power decreased with the magnitude of cell-type composition difference between the two groups (Fig. 4C; uncorrected). Correction for cell-type composition was effective at restoring discriminatory power for gene expression differences of 1.5-fold when composition differences were up to 12.5% (Fig. 4D; corrected). As expected, for expression differences of lower magnitude (1.1 and 1.3) the effective correction range was narrower (6.3% and 6.9%, respectively), while for stronger expression differences (2-fold) the effective correction range was wider (25.7%); Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. 31. All correction approaches performed similarly in this analysis, with the exception of spline regression which we found to be less effective (Fig. 4C, D, Supplementary Fig. 31).

### Experimental search for high-temperature ferroelectric perovskites guided by two-step machine learning [^826e049f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In this paper, we focus on the complex x BiO 3 –(1 − x)PbTiO 3 (PT) perovskite solid solutions, where Me′ and Me″ are di-, tri-, tetra- or pentavalent cations that occupy the octahedral site of the perovskite lattice (shown in Fig. 1) and the resulting solid solution is charge neutral. These are candidate materials for high-temperature ferroelectric applications because of their large piezoelectric and electromechanical coupling coefficients. Our survey of the periodic table identified a total of 23 cations that can occupy the Me′ and Me″ octahedral sites in the perovskite lattice. Further, these 23 cations can be distinctly combined to yield a total of 75 {Me′Me″} possible cation pairs and only 13 such pairs are experimentally explored. We also allow x to vary from 0.05 to 0.85 in steps of 0.05 and y to vary from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.01 for constraining our composition space. Overall, we identify 61,506 unique chemical compositions out of which only 167 are experimentally studied, representing only 0.28% of the search space. In the remaining unexplored chemical and composition space, it is unclear how many candidate high-temperature ferroelectric perovskites can and do exist. This is a challenging question because rules governing formation of high-temperature ferroelectric perovskite phases in a complex multinary phase space are not known a priori. Traditionally, time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error or intuition-driven experimental approaches are used to uncover the composition−structure−property relationships, which is a non-trivial task. The overarching research problem is schematically shown in Fig. 1.

### Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox [^6b2b8436]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for mpox, more specifically with respect to contact tracing, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring contacts passively, actively, or directly depending on available sources:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Passive monitoring|- Provide identified contacts with information on the signs/symptoms to monitor, permitted activities and how to contact the public health department if signs/symptoms develop|
|Active monitoring|- Check at least once daily to see if a person under monitoring has self-reported signs/symptoms|
|Direct monitoring|- Visit the patient physically or examine visually via video for signs of illness at least daily.|

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^139a29a2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Improving the effectiveness of public health interventions relies as much on the attention paid to their design and feasibility as to their evaluation. Yet, compared to the vast literature on how to evaluate interventions, there is little to guide researchers or practitioners on how best to develop such interventions in practical, logical, evidence based ways to maximise likely effectiveness. Existing models for the development of public health interventions tend to have a strong social-psychological, individual behaviour change orientation and some take years to implement. This paper presents a pragmatic guide to six essential Steps for Quality Intervention Development (6SQuID). The focus is on public health interventions but the model should have wider applicability. Once a problem has been identified as needing intervention, the process of designing an intervention can be broken down into six crucial steps: (1) defining and understanding the problem and its causes; (2) identifying which causal or contextual factors are modifiable: which have the greatest scope for change and who would benefit most; (3) deciding on the mechanisms of change; (4) clarifying how these will be delivered; (5) testing and adapting the intervention; and (6) collecting sufficient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluation. If each of these steps is carefully addressed, better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: expert review [^1802c2f1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to determine if accompanying signs or symptoms suggest immunocompromise leading to a more systemic infection in patients with confirmed esophageal infection.
