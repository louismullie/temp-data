## Question

What is eosinophil

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an eosinophil is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and identity of eosinophils. Then, I should verify their developmental origin and life cycle. Next, I will examine their core functions, including both classic effector roles and emerging immunomodulatory and homeostatic roles. After that, I need to check their tissue distribution and activation states. Then, I will review disease associations and the clinical significance of eosinophilia. Finally, I should consider diagnostic thresholds, biomarkers, and therapeutic implications, and close with a concise synthesis that reconciles the evolving paradigm with practical clinical relevance.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition and identity. Eosinophils are bone marrow–derived granulocytes, a type of polymorphonuclear leukocyte characterized by large secondary granules that stain with acidophilic dyes, and they circulate at low levels in healthy individuals while being capable of rapid tissue recruitment under inflammatory or homeostatic cues [^4deb2849] [^f52591e8] [^6317c07a].

> Wait, let me verify the developmental origin and life cycle. Eosinophils arise from hematopoietic progenitors under the control of IL-5–driven eosinopoiesis, mature in the bone marrow, and are released into the circulation as terminally differentiated cells with a relatively short half-life in blood, though they can persist as tissue-resident populations in mucosal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract, where they contribute to homeostasis and host defense [^4deb2849] [^f52591e8] [^fd180487].

> I will now examine their core functions, starting with the classic view. Historically, eosinophils were viewed primarily as cytotoxic effector cells against helminths and as key drivers of tissue damage in allergic disease via degranulation of cationic proteins like major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil peroxidase, along with reactive oxygen species, which can injure host tissues as well as pathogens [^4deb2849] [^d85921a7] [^c96cdc9d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the emerging paradigm. Contemporary evidence shows eosinophils are pleiotropic cells with immunomodulatory roles, including antigen presentation, T cell modulation, B cell help, and cytokine secretion, and they participate in tissue repair, remodeling, and homeostasis, particularly at mucosal barriers such as the gut and airways, which reframes them as integral regulators rather than purely destructive effectors [^4deb2849] [^f2a31fc4] [^fd180487] [^831bf30e].

> Let me consider tissue distribution and activation states carefully. Eosinophils are tissue-tropic and exhibit functional plasticity; they can be quiescent in healthy mucosa yet become activated in disease, with distinct activation signatures in different tissues, and their presence in certain organs like the skin is not normal and should be interpreted in clinical context, whereas in the gastrointestinal tract they are normally present and increase in disease, reflecting both homeostatic and pathologic roles [^4deb2849] [^d48026f5] [^89844b08].

> Next, I should review disease associations and the clinical significance of eosinophilia. Eosinophils are central to type 2 inflammatory diseases such as asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and elevated blood eosinophil counts correlate with exacerbation risk and steroid responsiveness in asthma, while in COPD, blood eosinophils predict inhaled corticosteroid benefit for exacerbation prevention, albeit with variability and overlap with normal ranges that complicate threshold-based decisions [^4deb2849] [^60cc6cc6] [^22bfd4b0] [^e59d8fa3].

> I should double-check diagnostic thresholds and classification. Peripheral eosinophilia is generally defined as an absolute eosinophil count greater than about 450–550 cells/μL, with hypereosinophilia at or above 1.5 × 10⁹/L prompting evaluation for clonal or secondary causes; contemporary classifications distinguish primary clonal eosinophilia, secondary reactive eosinophilia, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes, and persistent eosinophilia warrants a structured workup to exclude hematologic neoplasms and organ damage [^5708ef7e] [^c791694a] [^705e892d] [^5da129d9].

> But wait, what if a single blood eosinophil count is misleading? I need to ensure I address variability. Blood eosinophil counts fluctuate within a 24-hour period and can be suppressed by corticosteroids, so repeated measurements, consideration of peak values, and integration with tissue eosinophils or activation markers can improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and in diseases like eosinophilic esophagitis, quantitative histology with standardized reporting is recommended to guide management [^90340e66] [^60cc6cc6] [^4934d2b5].

> Let me think about therapeutic implications and biomarkers. Targeted eosinophil-depleting therapies such as anti–IL-5 antibodies reduce exacerbations and corticosteroid dependence in severe eosinophilic asthma and are approved for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome, while emerging biomarkers like eosinophil-derived neurotoxin may reflect activation status and complement blood counts for precision management, underscoring the shift from quantity to quality in eosinophil assessment [^459d3b13] [^c77f0ab6] [^1c978932].

> In summary, I should confirm the synthesis. Eosinophils are granulocytes with a dual nature: they are potent cytotoxic effectors in allergy and parasitic defense and, simultaneously, immunomodulatory cells that maintain mucosal homeostasis, promote tissue repair, and shape adaptive immunity; their roles are context-dependent and tissue-specific, and modern clinical practice increasingly uses eosinophil counts and activation markers to phenotype disease, predict treatment response, and guide targeted therapies, while recognizing variability and the need for integrated diagnostic approaches [^4deb2849] [^f52591e8] [^ea5617b9].

Eosinophils are **bone marrow–derived granulocytes** [^4deb2849] that circulate at low levels in healthy individuals and are distinguished by large secondary granules containing cationic proteins and enzymes [^d85921a7]. They are best known for their role in **type 2 immunity** against helminths and in allergic inflammation, but emerging evidence shows they also contribute to tissue homeostasis, repair, and immunoregulation [^b7df2876] [^fd180487]. Eosinophils are activated by IL-5, GM-CSF, and eotaxins, and their tissue accumulation can cause damage in diseases such as asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and hypereosinophilic syndromes [^46565629] [^e6a5cb21]. Clinically, eosinophil counts and activation markers guide diagnosis and therapy, including corticosteroids and biologics targeting IL-5 or IL-4/IL-13 pathways [^22bfd4b0] [^459d3b13].

---

## Morphology and granule content

Eosinophils are **12–15 µm** granulocytes with a bilobed nucleus and large secondary granules that stain with eosin dye. These granules contain:

- **Major basic protein (MBP)**: cytotoxic to parasites and host tissues [^d85921a7].
- **Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)**: ribonuclease with antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects [^d85921a7].
- **Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO)**: generates reactive oxygen species [^notfound].
- **Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN)**: ribonuclease with antiviral activity [^notfound].

---

## Development and activation

Eosinophils arise from hematopoietic stem cells under the control of **IL-5, GM-CSF, and IL-3**, with GATA-1 and C/EBPα directing differentiation [^notfound]. Maturation occurs in the bone marrow, followed by release into the circulation and migration into tissues under eotaxin (CCL11, CCL24, CCL26) chemotaxis [^notfound]. Activation occurs via cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement, leading to degranulation and mediator release [^80893e30].

---

## Physiological functions

Eosinophils have **diverse roles beyond host defense**:

- **Host defense**: Effector cells against helminths and some bacteria/fungi [^c96cdc9d] [^99784641].
- **Immunoregulation**: Modulate T cells, dendritic cells, and B cells; present antigens [^f2a31fc4].
- **Tissue homeostasis and repair**: Promote wound healing and remodeling via growth factors and cytokines [^831bf30e] [^b9ba4749].
- **Metabolic regulation**: Influence glucose metabolism and adipose tissue remodeling [^b0d0b16e].

---

## Pathological roles

Eosinophils contribute to disease through **tissue infiltration and mediator release**:

- **Allergic diseases**: Central to asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis pathogenesis [^b7df2876] [^4a38b404].
- **Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases**: Eosinophilic esophagitis and gastritis [^4934d2b5] [^89844b08].
- **Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES)**: Clonal or idiopathic eosinophilia with organ damage [^1f9e01f8] [^d24dbe7c].
- **Parasitic infections**: Helminth infections drive eosinophilia and tissue eosinophil accumulation [^c96cdc9d] [^4cb83f9a].

---

## Clinical significance and biomarkers

Eosinophil counts and activation markers are used to diagnose and monitor disease, guide therapy, and predict response to corticosteroids and biologics. Key thresholds include **≥ 300 cells/µL** in asthma to predict ICS response and **≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L** to define hypereosinophilia and prompt evaluation for clonal or idiopathic causes [^e0e66b36] [^c791694a] [^5da129d9]. Biomarkers such as ECP, EDN, and EPO reflect activation and tissue involvement [^4a38b404] [^1c978932].

---

## Therapeutic targeting

Therapies that target eosinophils include **corticosteroids** (first-line for eosinophilic inflammation), **anti-IL-5 biologics** (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) for severe eosinophilic asthma, HES, and EGPA [^459d3b13], and **anti-IL-4/IL-13 agents** (dupilumab) for allergic and eosinophilic diseases [^notfound]. Emerging strategies target eosinophil trafficking, survival, and activation pathways [^ac220260].

---

Eosinophils are **multifunctional granulocytes** with roles in defense, regulation, and repair; their dysregulation underlies multiple diseases, and modern management leverages eosinophil-targeted therapies and biomarkers to improve outcomes [^4deb2849].

### The expanding role (s) of eosinophils in health and disease [^e9facaac]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Surprisingly, the role(s) of eosinophils in health and disease is often summarized by clinicians and basic research scientists as a pervasive consensus opinion first learned in medical/graduate school. Eosinophils are rare white blood cells whose activities are primarily destructive and are only relevant in parasitic infections and asthma. However, is this consensus correct? This review argues that the wealth of available studies investigating the role(s) of eosinophils in both health and disease demonstrates that the activities of these granulocytes are far more expansive and complex than previously appreciated. In turn, this greater understanding has led to the realization that eosinophils have significant contributory roles in a wide range of diseases. Furthermore, published studies even implicate eosinophil-mediated activities in otherwise healthy persons. We suggest that the collective reports in the literature showing a role for eosinophils in an ever-increasing number of novel settings highlight the true complexity and importance of this granulocyte. Indeed, discussions of eosinophils are no longer simple and more often than not now begin with the question/statement "Did you know… ?"

The goal of this series is to offer a survey of the latest literature for clinicians and scientists alike, providing a list of important recent advances relevant to the broad field of allergy and immunology. This particular assignment was to cover the topic of eosinophils. In an attempt to highlight major ideas, themes, trends, and advances relevant to basic and clinical aspects of eosinophil biology, a search of articles published since 2015 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and other high-impact journals was performed. Articles were then reviewed and organized, and then key findings were summarized. Given space limitations, many outstanding articles could not be included, but the hope is that what follows provides a succinct overview of recently published work that has significantly added to our knowledge of eosinophils and eosinophil-associated diseases.

### Eosinophils: friends or foes? [^b0d0b16e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The roles eosinophils are recognized to play in health and disease continue to evolve. Formerly, eosinophils were believed to fill a primary role in host defense against helminths, an intermediary one in the propagation of allergic conditions, and a pathologic one in clinical conditions characterized by systemic eosinophilia and eosinophilic infiltration of target organs. Eosinophils are increasingly understood to be positioned centrally within mammalian immune and inflammatory networks, possessing receptors for an array of inflammatory mediators and capable of producing numerous proinflammatory and homeostatic mediators. The concept has emerged that eosinophils play a major role in the modulation of allergic inflammation and in the repair of damaged tissues in diseases characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. Possible new emerging roles for eosinophils include neoplasm surveillance, tissue remodeling during puberty and pregnancy, and the restructuring of adipose tissue. The eosinophil granulocyte line appeared hundreds of millions of years ago during the evolutionary process and continues to be retained by all vertebrate species. This is strong evidence that although all the beneficial roles of eosinophils have yet to emerge, eosinophils, on balance, must be considered friends and not foes.

### Changing roles of eosinophils in health and disease [^e1a90384]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and highlight the unappreciated roles of eosinophils suggested by recent studies.

Data Sources

The literature, unpublished observations, and insights by the authors.

Study Selections

Basic studies of mouse models and patient-based clinical studies of disease.

Results

Eosinophils are often thought of as destructive end-stage effector cells primarily linked to parasite host defense and dysregulated immune responses associated with allergic diseases, such as asthma. However, recent studies (ie, research focused on mechanisms of action and translational studies examining disease/inflammatory pathways) are suggesting far more complex roles for eosinophils. The goal of this review is 3-fold. (1) The authors examine the dynamic history of eosinophils and how physicians over time used this information to formulate defining hypotheses. Particular emphasis is placed on recent studies challenging the parochial view of host defense in favor of roles maintaining homeostasis through immune modulation and tissue remodeling/repair. (2) They discuss diagnostic approaches to assess eosinophils in clinical settings as a means of disease identification and subsequently as a measurement of disease severity. (3) They examine how contemporary views of eosinophils and their perceived roles in diseases have led to specific therapeutic strategies. The emphasis is to review the successes and failures of these strategies as the basis of formulating future clinical studies targeting eosinophils as potential therapies of disease.

Conclusion

Despite the complexities of eosinophil-mediated activities and the less than overwhelming success of initial attempts targeting these cells, eosinophils remain a potentially important focal target of disease diagnosis and subsequent treatment strategies.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^dc9e0224]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

All the phases leading to inflammation of the airways, and therefore clinical expression of allergic asthma, must be considered as dynamic processes. Treatment decisions should consider the biological background that is "driving" the inflammation as this is likely to predict patients' responses to treatment. While IgE is involved early in the inflammatory cascade and can be considered as a cause of allergic asthma, eosinophilia can be considered a consequence of the whole process. This helps to make sense of the clinical effectiveness observed with anti-IgE mAbs in bronchial asthma and the effects of anti-IL-5 mAbs in specific (eosinophilic) asthma patient populations.

However, the question of whether an anti-IgE or anti-eosinophil therapy will be more effective in the clinical practice with patients suffering from eosinophilic asthma is still an open question and further studies are needed.

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^9e4355dc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging can distinguish many of the causes. Often input from specialists (eg, hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management. What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

### Eosinophils: singularly destructive effector cells or purveyors of immunoregulation? [^394b61d7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are granulocytes typically associated with immune responses to a limited number of specific insults, including helminth infection and exposure to various allergens. Moreover, the overwhelming consensus from the literature is that eosinophils evolved as uniquely destructive leukocytes with cytotoxic activities as an adaptation for host defense. However, recent studies now suggest that the parochial caricature of eosinophils as effector cells with nonspecific killing abilities that evolved as a host defense mechanism against large nonphagotizable parasites is incomplete. A new paradigm has emerged describing eosinophils as initial responders to cell death/tissue damage that are a part of remodeling/repair processes and, more importantly, significant contributors to localized innate and acquired immune responses as well as systemic adaptive immunity. Significantly, this new paradigm does not preclude roles for eosinophils in host defense leading to tissue damage but instead suggests the equal importance of eosinophil-associated regulatory mechanisms modulating local tissue immune responses. The goal of this review is to summarize the data in support of this new paradigm. In turn, we believe that this expanded role provides a probable explanation for the presence of eosinophils in diverse disease settings such as asthma, allergy, cancer, transplant rejection, gastrointestinal inflammation, and viral or helminth infection.

### Eosinophils: biological properties and role in health and disease [^aad4fa69]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are pleiotropic multifunctional leukocytes involved in initiation and propagation of diverse inflammatory responses, as well as modulators of innate and adaptive immunity. In this review, the biology of eosinophils is summarized, focusing on transcriptional regulation of eosinophil differentiation, characterization of the growing properties of eosinophil granule proteins, surface proteins and pleiotropic mediators, and molecular mechanisms of eosinophil degranulation. New views on the role of eosinophils in homeostatic function are examined, including developmental biology and innate and adaptive immunity (as well as their interaction with mast cells and T cells) and their proposed role in disease processes including infections, asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, strategies for targeted therapeutic intervention in eosinophil-mediated mucosal diseases are conceptualized.

### Contemporary consensus proposal on criteria and classification of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes [^c791694a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia is an important indicator of various neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. Depending on the underlying disease and mechanisms, eosinophil infiltration can lead to organ dysfunction, clinical symptoms, or both. During the past 2 decades, several different classifications of eosinophilic disorders and related syndromes have been proposed in various fields of medicine. Although criteria and definitions are, in part, overlapping, no global consensus has been presented to date. The Year 2011 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders and Syndromes was organized to update and refine the criteria and definitions for eosinophilic disorders and to merge prior classifications in a contemporary multidisciplinary schema. A panel of experts from the fields of immunology, allergy, hematology, and pathology contributed to this project. The expert group agreed on unifying terminologies and criteria and a classification that delineates various forms of hypereosinophilia, including primary and secondary variants based on specific hematologic and immunologic conditions, and various forms of the hypereosinophilic syndrome. For patients in whom no underlying disease or hypereosinophilic syndrome is found, the term hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance is introduced. The proposed novel criteria, definitions, and terminologies should assist in daily practice, as well as in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.

### Spatial adaptation of eosinophils and their emerging roles in homeostasis, infection and disease [^4deb2849]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes that are traditionally associated with type 2 immune responses, such as those that occur during parasite infections and allergy. Emerging evidence demonstrates the remarkable functional plasticity of this elusive cell type and its pleiotropic functions in diverse settings. Eosinophils broadly contribute to tissue homeostasis, host defence and immune regulation, predominantly at mucosal sites. The scope of their activities primarily reflects the breadth of their portfolio of secreted mediators, which range from cytotoxic cationic proteins and reactive oxygen species to multiple cytokines, chemokines and lipid mediators. Here, we comprehensively review basic eosinophil biology that is directly related to their activities in homeostasis, protective immunity, regeneration and cancer. We examine how dysregulation of these functions contributes to the physiopathology of a broad range of inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we discuss recent findings regarding the tissue compartmentalization and adaptation of eosinophils, shedding light on the factors that likely drive their functional diversification within tissues.

### What targeting eosinophils has taught us about their role in diseases [^669cc527]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Eosinophil-associated disease is a term used to encompass a range of disorders from hypereosinophilic syndrome to asthma. Despite the longstanding belief that eosinophils can be primary contributors to disease pathophysiology, it is only in recent years that direct and selective reduction or elimination of eosinophils can be achieved in animals or human subjects. These developments have been made possible in mice through clever targeting of eosinophil production. Antibodies and other agents that target soluble eosinophil-related molecules, such as IL-5, or cell-surface structures, such as CCR3, have also proved useful in reducing blood and tissue eosinophil counts. In human subjects the only eosinophil-selective agents tested in clinical trials thus far are neutralizing antibodies to IL-5, with promising but mixed results. At the very least, such forms of pharmacologic hypothesis testing of the role of eosinophils in certain airway, gastrointestinal, and hematologic diseases has finally provided us with new insights into disease pathogenesis. At its optimistic best, these and other targeted agents might someday become available for those afflicted with eosinophil-associated disorders. This review summarizes what has been learned in vivo in both preclinical and clinical studies of eosinophil-directed therapies, with an emphasis on recent advances.

### Immunoregulatory roles of eosinophils: a new look at a familiar cell [^f2a31fc4]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are usually considered as end-stage degranulating effector cells of innate immunity. However, accumulating evidence has revealed additional roles for eosinophils that are immunoregulatory in nature in both the adaptive and innate arms of immunity. Specifically, eosinophils have key immunoregulatory roles as professional antigen-presenting cells and as modulators of CD4(+) T cell, dendritic cell, B cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions. This review addresses the emerging immunoregulatory roles of eosinophils with a focus on recent data that support this new paradigm. Recognizing both the effector and immunoregulatory functions of eosinophils will enable a fuller understanding of the roles of eosinophils in allergic airways inflammation and may be pertinent to therapies that target eosinophils both for their acute and ongoing immunomodulatory functions.

### Eosinophils: changing perspectives in health and disease [^b7df2876]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils have been traditionally perceived as terminally differentiated cytotoxic effector cells. Recent studies have profoundly altered this simplistic view of eosinophils and their function. New insights into the molecular pathways that control the development, trafficking and degranulation of eosinophils have improved our understanding of the immunomodulatory functions of these cells and their roles in promoting homeostasis. Likewise, recent developments have generated a more sophisticated view of how eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of different diseases, including asthma and primary hypereosinophilic syndromes, and have also provided us with a more complete appreciation of the activities of these cells during parasitic infection.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^0f1c0d74]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a marked heterogeneity in pathophysiology and etiology. The heterogeneity of BA may be related to the inducing mechanism(s) (allergic vs non-allergic), the histopathological background (eosinophilic vs non-eosinophilic), and the clinical manifestations, particularly in terms of severity and frequency of exacerbations. Asthma can be divided into at least two different endotypes based on the degree of Th2 inflammation (T2 'high' and T2 'low'). For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immunoglobulin E (IgE) or interleukin (IL)-5 are now available as add-on treatments. Treatment decisions for individual patients should consider the biological background in terms of the "driving mechanisms" of inflammation as this should predict the patients' likely responses to treatment. The question is not whether an anti-IgE or an anti-eosinophilic strategy is more effective, but rather what the mechanism is at the origin of the airway. While IgE is involved early in the inflammatory cascade and can be considered as a cause of allergic asthma, eosinophilia can be considered a consequence of the whole process. This article discusses the different roles of the IgE and IL-5/eosinophil pathways in the pathogenic mechanisms of airway inflammation occurring in allergic asthma, and the possible reasons to choose an anti-IgE mAb or anti-IL-5 treatment.

Interest in eosinophil biology and eosinophilic diseases is increasing, as reflected in a doubling of the number of annual articles focused on this topic published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology over the past decade. Although the majority of these publications relate to eosinophilic asthma, a growing proportion of them focus on breakthroughs in the diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of other eosinophilic disorders, most notably eosinophilic esophagitis. This review highlights advances in our understanding of eosinophilia and eosinophilic disorders (excluding asthma) published in the Journal in 2018.

### Quality over quantity; eosinophil activation status will deepen the insight into eosinophilic diseases [^abf6ff29]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Eosinophil associated diseases have gained much attention recently because of the introduction of specific eosinophil targeted therapies. These diseases range from acute parasitic infections to chronic inflammatory diseases such as eosinophilic asthma. In eosinophilic asthma an increased eosinophil cell count in peripheral blood is the gold standard for determination of the pheno-/endotype and severity of disease. Despite a broad consensus there is concern on validity of this simple measurement, because the eosinophil compartment is far from homogenous. Multiple tissues harbour non-activated cells under homeostatic conditions and other tissues, normally devoid of eosinophils, become infested with these cells under inflammatory conditions. It will, therefore, be clear that eosinophils become differentially (pre)-activated at different tissue sites in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. This complexity should be investigated in detail as it is 1) far from clear what the long-term side effects are that are caused by application of eosinophil targeted therapies in a "one size fits all" concept and 2) real-world data of eosinophil targeted therapies in asthma shows a broad variety in the treatment response. This review will focus on complex mechanisms of eosinophil activation in vivo to create a better view on the dynamics of the eosinophil compartment in health and disease both to prevent collateral damage caused by aberrant activation of eosinophils ánd to improve effectiveness of eosinophil targeted treatments.

### Eosinophils from A to Z [^f52591e8]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes and are found in low numbers in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. In type 2 inflammatory diseases, eosinopoiesis in the bone marrow is increased, resulting in a rise in the number of mature eosinophils released in the circulation. From the blood, eosinophils can migrate in multiple tissues and organs under both physiological and pathological conditions. Eosinophils exert their various functions through the synthesis and release of a variety of granule proteins and pro-inflammatory mediators. Despite being present in all species of vertebrates, the functional role of eosinophils is still a matter of debate. Eosinophils may play a role in host defense against various pathogens. In addition, eosinophils have been reported to be involved in tissue homeostasis and exhibit immunomodulatory activities. In this review, we aim to provide a broad overview of eosinophil biology and eosinophilic diseases in a lexicon-style format using keywords starting from A until Z with cross-references to other chapters indicated in italics in the text or specified in parentheses.

### Mechanisms of eosinophilia in the pathogenesis of hypereosinophilic disorders [^0bcdb46a]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The increased numbers of activated eosinophils in the blood and tissues that typically accompany hypereosinophilic disorders result from a variety of mechanisms. Exciting advances in translating discoveries achieved from mouse models and molecular strategies to the clinic have led to a flurry of new therapeutics specifically designed to target eosinophil-associated diseases. So far, this form of hypothesis testing in humans in vivo through pharmacology generally has supported the paradigms generated in vitro and in animal models, raising hopes that a spectrum of novel therapies soon may become available to help those who have eosinophil-associated diseases.

Mechanisms by which eosinophilia leads to end-organ damage are also considered.

### Verdict in the case of therapies versus eosinophils: the jury is still out [^960cb29c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are regarded by many as fundamental to the pathophysiology of allergic diseases, including asthma. An improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in these responses is therefore of great relevance to asthma pathogenesis and the development of new therapeutics. Most therapies that are effective in reducing allergic inflammation in animals and human subjects diminish tissue eosinophilia and levels of eosinophil-derived mediators. However, recent efforts with more selective eosinophil-suppressive therapies have failed to affect disease, bringing into question the role of eosinophils in asthma. This article will provide a brief overview of the role of eosinophils in allergic diseases, followed by a discussion of both eosinophil-specific and eosinophil-selective therapeutic targets, with a focus on cell-surface molecules. The known and theoretic benefits and risks of these strategies will also be covered.

### Functions of tissue-resident eosinophils [^fd180487]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils are a prominent cell type in particular host responses such as the response to helminth infection and allergic disease. Their effector functions have been attributed to their capacity to release cationic proteins stored in cytoplasmic granules by degranulation. However, eosinophils are now being recognized for more varied functions in previously underappreciated diverse tissue sites, based on the ability of eosinophils to release cytokines (often preformed) that mediate a broad range of activities into the local environment. In this Review, we consider evolving insights into the tissue distribution of eosinophils and their functional immunobiology, which enable eosinophils to secrete in a selective manner cytokines and other mediators that have diverse, 'non-effector' functions in health and disease.

### Targeting eosinophils in allergy, inflammation and beyond [^ac220260]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2013). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils can regulate local immune and inflammatory responses, and their accumulation in the blood and tissue is associated with several inflammatory and infectious diseases. Thus, therapies that target eosinophils may help control diverse diseases, including atopic disorders such as asthma and allergy, as well as diseases that are not primarily associated with eosinophils, such as autoimmunity and malignancy. Eosinophil-targeted therapeutic agents that are aimed at blocking specific steps involved in eosinophil development, migration and activation have recently entered clinical testing and have produced encouraging results and insights into the role of eosinophils. In this Review, we describe recent advances in the development of first-generation eosinophil-targeted therapies and highlight strategies for using personalized medicine to treat eosinophilic disorders.

### The eosinophil in infection [^80893e30]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

First described by Paul Ehrlich in 1879, who noted its characteristic staining by acidophilic dyes, for many years, the eosinophil was considered to be an end-effector cell associated with helminth infections and a cause of tissue damage. Over the past 30 years, research has helped to elucidate the complexity of the eosinophil's function and establish its role in host defense and immunity. Eosinophils express an array of ligand receptors which play a role in cell growth, adhesion, chemotaxis, degranulation, and cell-to-cell interactions. They play a role in activation of complement via both classical and alternative pathways. Eosinophils synthesize, store and secrete cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. They can process antigen, stimulate T cells, and promote humoral responses by interacting with B cells. Eosinophils can function as antigen presenting cells and can regulate processes associated with both T1 and T2 immunity. Although long known to play a role in defense against helminth organisms, the interactions of eosinophils with these parasites are now recognized to be much more complex. In addition, their interaction with other pathogens continues to be investigated. In this paper, we review the eosinophil's unique biology and structure, including its characteristic granules and the effects of its proteins, our developing understanding of its role in innate and adaptive immunity and importance in immunomodulation, and the part it plays in defense against parasitic, viral, fungal and bacterial infections. Rather than our worst enemy, the eosinophil may, in fact, be one of the most essential components in host defense and immunity.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^705e892d]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

11 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

Diagnosis and management of eosinophil‐associated disorders and related syndromes are an emerging challenge in the fields of clinical immunology, hematology, and pathology. With the recent availability of eosinophil‐depleting targeted drugs, it is now even more important to unify definitions and classifications for these conditions in an interdisciplinary effort. HE may develop in the context of various hematologic neoplasms and in certain reactive states. In all these patients, it is important to (i) document or exclude a related neoplastic or non‐neoplastic disease, and to (ii) document or exclude the presence of HE‐related organ damage (HES). Several immunological, serological, molecular, and cytogenetic markers are available to establish the nature of the underlying condition and, thus, help define the variant of HE and HES. In 2012, our consensus group proposed a comprehensive classification of eosinophil disorders together with diagnostic criteria. This proposal was based on a multidisciplinary approach involving the fields of allergy, immunology, hematology, pathology, and molecular medicine. Because of its multidisciplinary character and simple format, this concept has been widely accepted and is considered standard. However, recent developments in the field emerged and created a need to update and refine these concepts and diagnostic criteria. In the Year 2021 Working Conference on Eosinophil Disorders (Vienna, September 24–26, 2021), these developments were discussed and used to adjust diagnostic criteria, as well as definitions and classification of eosinophil disorders. As in 2011, these proposed criteria and definitions are based on a multidisciplinary approach and are in line with the previous ICOG‐EO consensus proposal and the 2016‐ and 2022‐updated classification of the WHO and ICC. We also define where the ICOG‐EO proposal complements or adds to the 2022‐updated WHO classification and ICC. Our updated definitions and criteria, along with our increasing knowledge about the etiology of HE should improve diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients with eosinophil disorders in daily practice as well as in clinical trials.

### Inhibitory receptors on eosinophils: a direct hit to a possible achilles heel? [^18426b86]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Since their discovery, much data have been accumulated on eosinophil differentiation, morphology, trafficking, and anatomical location(s) in health and disease. Although "classic" activation pathways (such as cytokines, chemokines, proinflammatory components, and adhesion molecules) regulating eosinophil activation have been widely explored, the presence of other activation molecules that might be disease specific is limited. Furthermore, the expression and function of inhibitory receptors on eosinophils have received scant attention. The need to identify new pathways that regulate eosinophil activation is a crucial goal as it can expand our knowledge on this peculiar cell and provide insights into important queries regarding the physiologic function of eosinophils. Over the past several years, it has become increasingly apparent that eosinophils express several receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the expression and function of new pathways that govern eosinophil activation. In addition, we will propose some hypotheses regarding the ability to use these pathways as a future therapeutic approach. In conclusion, we assume that targeting inhibitory receptors on eosinophils may provide opportunities for immunoregulatory therapy in the near future.

### Evaluation and differential diagnosis of persistent marked eosinophilia [^e6a5cb21]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The causes of peripheral blood eosinophilia are varied, ranging from benign eosinophilia to malignancy. A careful history and physical examination along with directed clinical evaluation may help determine the cause. When uncontrolled, peripheral blood eosinophilia may result in end-organ damage and life-threatening complications. This article summarizes the differential diagnosis and evaluation of persistent marked eosinophilia.

### Novel therapies for eosinophilic disorders [^37a7cc97]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Current therapies for eosinophilic disorders are limited. Most treatment approaches remain empirical, are not supported by data from controlled clinical trials, involve the off-label use of agents developed for treatment of other diseases, and tend to rely heavily on the use of glucocorticoids and other agents with significant toxicity. Great progress has been made in the discovery, preclinical development, and clinical testing of a variety of biologics and small molecules that have the potential to directly or indirectly influence eosinophils, eosinophilic inflammation, and the consequences of eosinophil activation.

### Approach to eosinophilia presenting with pulmonary symptoms [^e71ffde6]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement is characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, typically ≥ 500 cells/mm³, by pulmonary symptoms and physical examination findings that are nonspecific, and by radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease and is further supported by histopathologic evidence of tissue eosinophilia in a lung or pleura biopsy specimen and/or increased eosinophils in BAL fluid, usually > 10%. Considering that there are a variety of underlying causes of eosinophilia with pulmonary manifestations and overlapping clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is essential to approach the evaluation of eosinophilia with pulmonary findings systematically. In this review, we will describe a case presentation and discuss the differential diagnosis, a directed approach to the diagnostic evaluation and supporting literature, the current treatment strategies for pulmonary eosinophilia syndromes, and the levels of evidence underlying the recommendations, where available. Overall, optimal management of eosinophilic lung disease presentations are directed at the underlying cause when identifiable, and the urgency of treatment may be guided by the presence of severe end-organ involvement or life-threatening complications. When an underlying cause is not easily attributable, management of eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement largely relies on eosinophil-directed interventions, for which biologic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome [^1f9e01f8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome consists of a group of disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of eosinophils in the blood or peripheral tissues, independent of known secondary causes of eosinophilia such as parasitic infection. Clinical manifestations of the condition are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic eosinophilia to severe tissue damage and end-organ failure. This entity has been recognized for decades, with early studies identifying distinct groups of patients with differing symptoms, exam findings, laboratory abnormalities, and prognosis. In the past, these patients were treated with non-targeted immunosuppressive agents, often with limited efficacy. More recently, advances in the knowledge of eosinophil biology and molecular diagnostics have allowed for more specific delineation of the many disease subgroups that characterize hypereosinophilic syndrome. Identification of these groups has led to a personalized management approach to the condition, with improved diagnostic techniques as well as stratification of patients into more effective treatment groups. This review will discuss the evolution of the definition of hypereosinophilic syndrome, outline current disease classifications, provide a guide for evaluation and monitoring, and discuss current and future therapeutic modalities.

### Eosinophils, allergy and parasites [^31c8fd94]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Recently, known eosinophil functions have been extended considerably: previously the cells were thought to have an exclusive role in the release of cytotoxic mediators; now they are known to have roles in antigen presentation and immunoregulation through the release of cytokines. Although questionable, animal models indicate a rather beneficial role of eosinophils in parasitic infections but a detrimental one, together with other cells, in allergy.

### The eosinophil in health and disease: from bench to bedside and back [^7338df11]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Historically, eosinophils have been considered as end-stage cells involved in host protection against parasitic infection and in the mechanisms of hypersensitivity. However, later studies have shown that this multifunctional cell is also capable of producing immunoregulatory cytokines and soluble mediators and is involved in tissue homeostasis and modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In this review, we summarize the biology of eosinophils, including the function and molecular mechanisms of their granule proteins, cell surface markers, mediators, and pathways, and present comprehensive reviews of research updates on the genetics and epigenetics of eosinophils. We describe recent advances in the development of epigenetics of eosinophil-related diseases, especially in asthma. Likewise, recent studies have provided us with a more complete appreciation of how eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Over the past decades, the definition and criteria of HES have been evolving with the progress of our understanding of the disease and some aspects of this disease still remain controversial. We also review recent updates on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of HES, which have spurred dramatic developments in the clinical strategies of diagnosis and treatment for this heterogeneous group of diseases. The conclusion from this review is that the biology of eosinophils provides significant insights as to their roles in health and disease and, furthermore, demonstrates that a better understanding of eosinophil will accelerate the development of new therapeutic strategies for patients.

### The role of eosinophils in host defense against helminth parasites [^c96cdc9d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

The precise function of eosinophils in parasitic infection in vivo remains poorly understood despite eosinophils having been shown to be potent effectors in killing parasites in vitro. Although it has long been held that the primary function of the eosinophil is protection against helminth parasites, there are little data to prove this unequivocally. Moreover, eosinophils are responsible for a considerable amount of inflammatory pathology accompanying helminth infections. This article will provide an overview of our current knowledge about eosinophils and their role, both protective and pathogenetic, in parasitic helminth infections.

Table 3 — Research needs for mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms — Knowledge gaps include clinical outcomes of different mild asthma phenotypes including specific populations; the stability of mild asthma phenotypes; which phenotypes are at greater risk; the role of eosinophils in mild asthma regarding pathology, associated risks, and outcomes; other inflammatory pathways of mild asthma and whether/how they differ from those in more severe disease; and optimal study designs. Suggested research includes investigating inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, conducting cluster analyses to elucidate heterogeneity, describing phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including AHR, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, assessing whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly CS responsive phenotype, conducting large epidemiological studies on blood eosinophils and breath analysis, and characterizing stability of inflammatory markers/phenotypes across environmental triggers; CS = corticosteroid.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^1ef1777e]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

The discovery of IgE and its role in allergic inflammation

While the discovery of IgE in 1966 brought to an end the search for the elusive reagin, it unlocked an era of discovery that investigated the genetics, structure, functions and clinical applications of this immunoglobulin. As has been recognised since the early part of the twentieth century, IgE has unique properties among the immunoglobulin isotypes in its abilities both to induce extremely rapid pathological responses and to act as a highly sensitive immunological amplifier. Furthermore, it is well established that IgE levels are increased in patients affected by atopic conditions and that IgE provides the critical link between the antigen recognition role of the adaptive immune system and the effector functions of mast cells and basophils at mucosal and cutaneous sites of environmental exposure. These functions have made IgE an attractive target for pharmacological intervention with IgE blockade having clinical potential across many different therapy areas.

### The regulatory role of eosinophils in viral, bacterial, and fungal infections [^99784641]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils are innate immune cells typically associated with allergic and parasitic diseases. However, in recent years, eosinophils have also been ascribed a role in keeping homeostasis and in fighting several infectious diseases. Indeed, these cells circulate as mature cells in the blood and can be quickly recruited to the infected tissue. Moreover, eosinophils have all the necessary cellular equipment such as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-bacterial proteins, and DNA traps to fight pathogens and promote an efficient immune response. This review summarizes some of the updated information on the role of eosinophils' direct and indirect mediated interactions with pathogens.

### A report from the international eosinophil society: eosinophils in a tug of war [^67335955]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

The International Eosinophil Symposium in Banff was a timely gathering of leading experts to discuss the precise role of eosinophils in allergic asthma. The meeting followed hard on the heels of a report suggesting that eosinophils might be redundant in late-phase responses in asthma, inasmuch as treatment of asthmatic patients with humanized anti-IL-5 in clinical trials failed to modify bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Mouse models of allergic asthma were also cited for failing to show a consistent proinflammatory role for the eosinophil in asthma. Presentations at this meeting included a reevaluation of murine models of asthma, which exhibit substantial differences from human disease. The inability of murine eosinophils to degranulate either in vivo or in vitro was shown to present a major obstacle in asthma research; this is in sharp contrast to human eosinophils, which readily degranulate in response to stimuli. Degranulation from eosinophils was proposed to be a crucial event in human airway hyperresponsiveness. Major advances were presented in the understanding of molecular and intracellular pathways regulating eosinophil priming, activation, and mediator secretion. Recruitment and activation of eosinophils might be regulated by other immunoregulatory agents as well as IL-5, including eotaxin. Future clinical trials might benefit from focusing on dual inhibition of IL-5 and eotaxin to ensure the removal of the effects of activated eosinophils from the body.

(B) Eosinophils are key cells in allergic inflammation, and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) is a basic protein that can be detected in the granules of the eosinophil in different forms, with molecular weights ranging from 18.5 to 22 kDa. Elevated levels of ECP have been detected in the serum, sputum, and nasal secretions of individuals undergoing a late-phase allergic reaction, when an eosinophil influx is predominant at the reactive site. There is also increased appreciation in the clinical utility of sputum eosinophils for diagnosis of asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis.

### Eosinophilia: a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and treatment [^15ea2d96]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia is associated with a wide variety of allergic, rheumatologic, infectious, neoplastic, and rare idiopathic disorders. Clinical manifestations range from benign asymptomatic presentations to life-threatening complications, including endomyocardial fibrosis and thromboembolism. The prognosis and choice of treatment depend not only on the degree of eosinophilia and severity of organ involvement, but also on the etiology of the eosinophilia. Unfortunately, despite recent advances in molecular and immunologic techniques, the etiology remains unproven in the overwhelming majority of cases. This review presents a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with unexplained marked eosinophilia. A brief overview of the mechanisms of eosinophilia and eosinophil pathogenesis is also provided.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^08430279]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms — Eosinophilic inflammation is commonly identified but varies across cohorts, with an eosinophil phenotype predicted in 72.5% in a primary care cohort while a noneosinophilic phenotype was 5.6%, whereas 47% in another cohort showed no evidence of persistent eosinophilic disease; airway inflammation in mild asthma is more likely to be T2, and interpretation must account for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) effects that can suppress T2 and overestimate non-T2 phenotypes; inflammatory phenotype may vary over time with increases after allergen exposure or during exacerbations and decreases with ICS therapy; even low-dose ICS attenuates early and late asthmatic responses and reduces eosinophilic response, and high-dose ICS improves airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) after 8 weeks of therapy.

### Eosinophilic endotype of asthma [^1b840092]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into different clinical endotypes, depending on the type of airway inflammation, clinical severity, and response to treatment. This article focuses on the eosinophilic endotype of asthma, which is defined by the central role that eosinophils play in the pathophysiology of the condition. It is characterized by elevated sputum and/or blood eosinophils on at least 2 occasions and by a significant response to treatments that suppress eosinophilia. Histopathologic demonstration of eosinophils in the airways provides the most direct diagnosis of eosinophilic asthma; but it is invasive, thus, impractical in clinical practice.

The index aims to "focus on the critical elements of clinical severity across all domains (ie, symptoms, complications, endoscopy, and histology)" and enable categorization "as having inactive, mild, moderate, or severe disease", while also providing "a common language for communicating with patients and other providers" and "helping standardize practice for treatments and monitoring based on disease severity similar to the asthma model", acknowledging that "additional data will be required for full realization and to assess the index's reliability and reproducibility".

### Treatment of severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma: where we are heading [^ea2e605f]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to highlight how our understanding of the pathophysiology of severe asthma has evolved over time and discuss the role of biomarkers in treatment advances and emerging new therapies.

Data Sources

Nonsystematic PubMed literature search.

Study Selection

Articles were selected based on areas of relevance to the classification of asthma by endotype, with an emphasis on the evolution of current treatment guidelines for severe asthma.

Results

Unlike older guidelines for the treatment of severe asthma, recent updates now distinguish between asthma severity and control. Moreover, asthma classification is shifting from phenotype to endotype with the development of biomarkers used to determine the mechanism driving a patient's disease. Many cases of severe asthma are associated with type-2 inflammation with elevated eosinophil counts in the airways. In recent studies, patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and high eosinophil counts respond to biologic therapies targeting the type-2 signaling pathway and eosinophils themselves (eg, anti-IL-5 therapy). New treatments that address the pathophysiology of asthma offer a promising alternative to control severe asthma for patients who do not respond to traditional therapies.

Conclusion

Understanding and using new treatment guidelines that separate the concepts of asthma severity and control may help clinicians to identify patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma who may benefit from new treatment options, such as anti-IL-5 therapies.

Beyond the diagnostic threshold, "more detail than " > 15 eos/hpf" is needed for subsequent patient management", because counts inform response monitoring, for example "if a patient has gone from 200 to 150 eos/hpf, or from 200 to 20 eos/hpf after treatment", even though severity is not strictly tied to absolute counts (e.g., "200 eos/hpf… as a patient with 100 eos/hpf"). For cross-study consistency, reporting density may be preferable, "in which case, the diagnostic threshold is ~60 eos/mm²".

### Gastrointestinal eosinophils in health, disease and functional disorders [^89844b08]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils are potent innate immune cells that home to the gastrointestinal tract where they participate in host immunity to luminal pathogens, and help to maintain intestinal epithelial homeostasis. However, these cells are now recognized to have key functions in the pathogenesis of numerous other disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, including primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, common functional conditions, such as dyspepsia, and also in gastrointestinal disorders in patients with allergic disease. We are just beginning to understand the potential pathological role of eosinophils in gastrointestinal disease, and it is increasingly likely that gastroenterologists and histopathologists will need to account for the presence of gastrointestinal eosinophils and relate their presence to gastrointestinal symptoms. This Review discusses the role of gastrointestinal eosinophils in health and disease, including their associations with functional and allergic disorders.

### Eosinophils and tissue remodeling: relevance to airway disease [^831bf30e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The ability of human tissue to reorganize and restore its existing structure underlies tissue homeostasis in the healthy airways, but in disease can persist without normal resolution, leading to an altered airway structure. Eosinophils play a cardinal role in airway remodeling both in health and disease, driving epithelial homeostasis and extracellular matrix turnover. Physiological consequences associated with eosinophil-driven remodeling include impaired lung function and reduced bronchodilator reversibility in asthma, and obstructed airflow in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Given the contribution of airway remodeling to the development and persistence of symptoms in airways disease, targeting remodeling is an important therapeutic consideration. Indeed, there is early evidence that eosinophil attenuation may reduce remodeling and disease progression in asthma. This review provides an overview of tissue remodeling in both health and airway disease with a particular focus on eosinophilic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, as well as the role of eosinophils in these processes and the implications for therapeutic interventions. Areas for future research are also noted, to help improve our understanding of the homeostatic and pathological roles of eosinophils in tissue remodeling, which should aid the development of targeted and effective treatments for eosinophilic diseases of the airways.

### 2021 year in review: spotlight on eosinophils [^0a4b3535]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of eosinophils and eosinophilic diseases, particularly eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases during the last year. The increasing incidence of diseases marked by eosinophilia has been documented and highlighted the need to understand eosinophil biology and eosinophilic contributions to disease. Significant insight into the nature of eosinophilic diseases has been achieved using next-generation sequencing technologies, proteomic analysis, and machine learning to analyze tissue biopsies. These technologies have elucidated mechanistic underpinnings of eosinophilic inflammation, delineated patient endotypes, and identified patient responses to therapeutic intervention. Importantly, recent clinical studies using mAbs that interfere with type 2 cytokine signaling or deplete eosinophils point to multiple and complex roles of eosinophils in tissues. Several studies identified distinct activation features of eosinophils in different tissues and disease states. The confluence of these studies supports a new paradigm of tissue-resident eosinophils that have pro- and anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory roles in allergic disease. Improved understanding of unique eosinophil activation states is now poised to identify novel therapeutic targets for eosinophilic diseases.

### The physiological and pathophysiological roles of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract [^8f1babae]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Eosinophils and the gastrointestinal tract interact in an intimate and enigmatic relationship. Under healthy conditions, the presence of eosinophils is limited almost exclusively to the digestive tract mucosa where they exert several effector and immunoregulatory functions. While their precise function in the gastrointestinal tract is not completely understood, it is likely that, together with different T cell subsets, eosinophils are involved in maintaining the immunologic homeostastis across the mucosal barrier under resting conditions. Eosinophils also play a role in several inflammatory conditions, such as intestinal infections, hypersensitivity reactions, primary eosinophilic inflammations and several other chronic intestinal disorders. Depending on the responsible trigger, their effects may be beneficial or detrimental. Here, we discuss the available information regarding the physiological and pathological functions of eosinophils within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma: an expert consensus framework to characterize phenotypes in a global real-life severe asthma cohort [^46b78231]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Phenotypic characteristics of patients with eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma are not well characterized in global, real-life severe asthma cohorts.

Research Question

What is the prevalence of eosinophilic and noneosinophilic phenotypes in the population with severe asthma, and can these phenotypes be differentiated by clinical and biomarker variables?

Study Design and Methods

This was an historical registry study. Adult patients with severe asthma and available blood eosinophil count (BEC) from 11 countries enrolled in the International Severe Asthma Registry (January 1, 2015-September 30, 2019) were categorized according to likelihood of eosinophilic phenotype using a predefined gradient eosinophilic algorithm based on highest BEC, long-term oral corticosteroid use, elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide, nasal polyps, and adult-onset asthma. Demographic and clinical characteristics were defined at baseline (ie, 1 year before or closest to date of BEC).

Results

One thousand seven hundred sixteen patients with prospective data were included; 83.8% were identified as most likely (grade 3), 8.3% were identified as likely (grade 2), and 6.3% identified as least likely (grade 1) to have an eosinophilic phenotype, and 1.6% of patients showed a noneosinophilic phenotype (grade 0). Eosinophilic phenotype patients (ie, grades 2 or 3) showed later asthma onset (29.1 years vs 6.7 years; P < .001) and worse lung function (postbronchodilator % predicted FEV 1, 76.1% vs 89.3%; P = 0.027) than those with a noneosinophilic phenotype. Patients with noneosinophilic phenotypes were more likely to be women (81.5% vs 62.9%; P = 0.047), to have eczema (20.8% vs 8.5%; P = 0.003), and to use anti-IgE (32.1% vs 13.4%; P = 0.004) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (50.0% vs 28.0%; P = 0.011) add-on therapy.

Interpretation

According to this multicomponent, consensus-driven, and evidence-based eosinophil gradient algorithm (using variables readily accessible in real life), the severe asthma eosinophilic phenotype was more prevalent than previously identified and was phenotypically distinct. This pragmatic gradient algorithm uses variables readily accessible in primary and specialist care, addressing inherent issues of phenotype heterogeneity and phenotype instability. Identification of treatable traits across phenotypes should improve therapeutic precision.

### Allergic and eosinophilic asthma in the era of biomarkers and biologics: similarities, differences and misconceptions [^5848a84c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Severe asthma is associated with substantial personal and economic burden; maintaining disease control is the key management goal. Increased understanding of asthma heterogeneity and development of type 2 (T2)-targeting biologics has substantially advanced disease management and outcomes; however, despite both being driven by T2 inflammation, allergic and eosinophilic asthma have different treatment recommendations. We sought to better understand the similarities and differences between allergic and eosinophilic asthma and highlight where misconceptions may arise.

Data Sources

Published articles, pivotal trials, post hoc analyses, and asthma clinical guidelines sourced from PubMed.

Study Selections

Sources reporting allergic and eosinophilic asthma classifications, disease mechanisms, and biomarkers associated with treatment response.

Results

This review highlights that severe allergic and eosinophilic asthma are both driven by T2 inflammation with eosinophils playing a cardinal role. Despite this overlap, treatment recommendations differ based on asthma classification. T2 cytokine gene expression is a reasonably well-established research tool, but not a well-established biomarker in clinical practice, unlike blood eosinophil counts, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and immunoglobulin E; the clinical relevance of immunoglobulin E as a predictive biomarker remains unclear.

Conclusion

Asthma classifications that can be easily characterized at patient level to ensure accurate diagnosis, predict disease trajectory, and treatment response are required. The current dichotomy of allergic and eosinophilic asthma classifications is likely too simplistic, given the similar eosinophil-mediated disease pathophysiology in both classifications. Our results provide future directions to guide clinically meaningful interpretation of asthma endophenotypes, which may improve understanding of severe asthma characterization and aid future advances in defining responders more precisely with personalized medicine approaches.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma? [^0b74de6d]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is frequently encountered in the general medical and respiratory clinics. Asthma is often associated with peripheral eosinophilia, however, marked levels of eosinophilia are uncommon and should warrant further investigation. The patient described in this article presented with an initial diagnosis of allergic asthma but failed to respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Marked blood eosinophilia prompted the investigation for other eosinophilic lung diseases, which eventually yielded a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). This article illustrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for eosinophilic lung diseases should patients previously diagnosed as allergic asthma fail to respond to therapy, especially if this was associated with marked blood eosinophilia.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnosis (general principles), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to suspect a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia in the following clinical situations:

- sustained eosinophilia (≥ 1.5×10⁹/L) or tissue eosinophilia (any eosinophil count) in a target organ, with the occurrence of characteristic genetic breakpoints, some of which may not be visible by standard cytogenetics (e.g. FIP1L1::PDGFRA, ETV6::ABL1)

- clinical features such as splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukoerythroblastosis, circulating dysplastic cells, elevated serum tryptase levels, and abnormal mast cell proliferation in the bone marrow

- features of systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia but with interstitial, not dense aggregates of atypical mast cells (FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement)

- features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (PDGFRB rearrangement)

- persistent eosinophilia after intensive treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, or T-cell lymphoma.

### Analysing the eosinophil cationic protein – a clue to the function of the eosinophil granulocyte [^d85921a7]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The eosinophil granulocyte was discovered 130 years ago but its roles are still being revealed. The most characteristic feature of the eosinophil is the large secondary granules filled with basic proteins. The purpose of these proteins is still not fully understood. One of the proteins, ECP is a highly basic, cytotoxic, heparin binding ribonuclease that seems to need its ribonuclease site but not activity for its activities. Sensitive assays have been developed for its measurement in biological fluids which have contributed to the understanding of the role of the eosinophils in disease. In vitro studies have shown that high levels of ECP are necessary for development its destructive actions. Diseases engaging high levels of eosinophils might reach these levels locally in the tissue. At those high levels polymorphisms altering expression level and protein sequence might play a role within certain populations. Whether ECP also has roles at lower concentrations, such as the growth inhibitory influences on lymphocytes found in vitro, remain to be shown with in vivo models or clinically. These additional roles for ECP when discovered, might provide critical answers to the functions of eosinophil granulocytes and is therefore well worth waiting for.

### Management of hypereosinophilic syndromes [^07809bda]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The symptomatic hypereosinophilic patient must be approached in a stepwise manner, with thorough assessment to determine whether the hypereosinophilia itself is contributing to damage and disease manifestations (thereby defining a hypereosinophilic syndrome), and to identify an eventual cause of hypereosinophilia, followed by initiation of treatment directed against the underlying condition or deleterious hypereosinophilic state. Situations encountered in the clinic are extremely heterogeneous because of the numerous potential causes of hypereosinophilia and the variable spectrum of eosinophil-mediated organ damage. A practical approach to many of these situations is presented in this review.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis-AAP… [^aa4380f1]. AAP (2023). Medium credibility.

Here you will find the latest clinical guidance for eosinophilic esophagitis, including signs and symptoms, diagnostic considerations, medications and treatment, referral considerations and additional resources to use for educating patients and families. We have also provided an EoE visual library, as well as a detailed treatment algorithm. Eosinophilic Esophagitis Overview Eosinophilic Esophagitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by a Th2-type response that leads to chronic, eosinophil-predominant, inflammation of the esophagus. This chronic inflammation, when untreated, can cause esophageal remodeling, odynophagia and food impaction. EoE is the most common cause of persistent dysphagia in developed countries. Although the first case was reported in 1978, EoE was not identified as a unique disease entity until the early 1990s. Since then, the increase in incidence of EoE has exceeded that which can be attributed to increasing recognition alone.

There is no known single cause but it is believed to be caused by environmental factors possibly combined with genetic predisposition as a major driver of disease prevalence. In the United States, estimates of annual costs attributable to the treatment of patients with EoE approach 1. 4 billion dollars. Symptoms in children are variable and can include dysphagia, epigastric pain, vomiting and food impaction. Children with EoE may have subtle symptoms or adjust their mealtime habits to mitigate the more overt symptoms of choking and gagging, both of which can delay diagnosis.
- Adjustments may include excessive chewing of food, eating softer foods, eating smaller quantities and drinking frequently during meals. The primary goal of intervention is to treat the underlying inflammation through identification of potential food triggers, the use of medication or both. Phenotypic subtypes may require different treatment approaches.

Clinical Information Below you will find clinical information and resources to help care for children with EoE including risk factors, signs and symptoms and treatment options. Professional Tools & Resources The following tools and resources are designed to aid diagnosis, treatment, patient education and long-term considerations. Clinical Tools Here are some clinical tools to consider for use in the clinical setting. The development of this information was made possible through support from Sanofi and Regeneron.

### Clinical potential of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in asthma management [^1c978932]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The assessment and management of patients with asthma is challenging because of the complexity of the underlying inflammatory mechanisms and heterogeneity of their clinical presentation. Optimizing disease management requires therapy individualization that should rely on reliable biomarkers to unravel the phenotypes and endotypes of asthma. The secretory activity and turnover of eosinophils, as assessed by measuring eosinophil-derived proteins, may provide an accurate and complementary tool that mirrors the eosinophil activation status. Emerging evidence suggests that eosinophil-derived neurotoxin has considerable potential as a precision medicine biomarker. In this review, we explore the suitability of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin as a biomarker in asthma management, with particular emphasis on its clinical significance in the management of both pediatric and adult populations.

### Eosinophils as drivers of bacterial immunomodulation and persistence [^da8c832e]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pathogens have co-evolved with their hosts over centuries, specifically selected for their adeptness in dampening host inflammatory responses, thus facilitating infection establishment and persistence. While extensive research has delved into unraveling the intricate mechanisms by which pathogens evade host immune responses, particularly focusing on classical phagocytes, neutrophils, epithelial cells, and adaptive immune cells, the exploration of eosinophils remains in its nascent stages. Traditionally associated with parasitic responses or inflammatory pathologies, eosinophils have been increasingly implicated in bacterial interactions. Contemporary research now underscores the pivotal role of these cells during mucosal infections, offering a fresh perspective on their functional significance.

In our work, we focus on understanding at the molecular and cellular levels what mechanisms Bordetella spp. utilize to suppress host immune responses to promote initial colonization, persistence, and transmission. In our previous work, utilizing the Bordetella bronchiseptica murine model, we discovered a bacterial sigma factor, btrS that is critical to suppress host immune responses and delay adaptive immunity. Importantly, in the absence of a functional btrS, eosinophils became essential to promote adaptive immune response, pointing toward a possible mechanism by which Bordetella spp. target eosinophils to delay adaptive immune responses.

In this review, we aim to synthesize existing literature linking eosinophils with infections at various mucosal sites, elucidating the diverse functions these cells undertake during different infectious scenarios. Additionally, we will spotlight bacterial effectors known to target eosinophils, either to instigate anti-inflammatory responses or to hyper-activate eosinophils, thereby exacerbating pathology. Finally, leveraging our model system, Bordetella spp. we will provide insights into the potential role of eosinophils in exacerbating pathology and fostering the chronicity of infection.

### Asthma management: a new phenotype-based approach using presence of eosinophilia and allergy [^23d39955]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. The Czech Pneumology and Allergology Societies commissioned 10 experts to review the literature and create joint national guidelines for managing asthma, reflecting this heterogeneity. The aim was to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic strategy as a rational approach to the widening opportunities for the use of phenotype-targeted therapy. The guidelines were presented on websites for public comments by members of both the societies. The reviewers' comments contributed to creating the final version of the guidelines. The key hallmark of the diagnostic approach is the pragmatic concept, which assesses the presence of allergy and eosinophilia in each asthmatic patient. The guidelines define three clinically relevant asthma phenotypes: eosinophilic allergic asthma, eosinophilic nonallergic asthma and noneosinophilic nonallergic asthma. The resulting multifunctional classification describing the severity, level of control and phenotype is the starting point for a comprehensive treatment strategy. The level of control is constantly confronted with the intensity of the common stepwise pharmacotherapy, and the concurrently included phenotyping is essential for phenotype-specific therapy. The concept of the asthma approach with assessing the presence of eosinophilia and allergy provides a way for more precise diagnosis, which is a prerequisite for using widening options of personalized therapy.

### Eosinophilia associated with immune deficiency [^00fd65cf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of eosinophilia is broad and includes infections, malignancies, and atopy as well as inborn errors of immunity (IEI). Certain types of IEIs are known to be associated with elevated numbers of eosinophils and frequently elevated serum IgE, whereas for others the degree and frequency of eosinophilia are less established. The molecular defects underlying IEI are heterogeneous and affect different pathways, which highlights the complex regulations of this cell population within the immune system. In this review, we list and discuss clinical manifestations and therapies of immune deficiency or immune dysregulation disorders associated with peripheral blood or tissue eosinophilia with or without raised IgE levels. We present illustrative case vignettes for the most common entities and propose a diagnostic algorithm aiming to help physicians systematically to evaluate patients with eosinophilia and suspicion of an underlying IEI.

### Inflammatory cells in asthma: mechanisms and implications for therapy [^f7b18f25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent clinical studies have brought asthma's complex inflammatory processes into clearer focus, and understanding them can help to delineate therapeutic implications. Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration of airway T cells, CD(+) (T helper) cells, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. The cysteinyl leukotrienes also are important mediators in asthma and modulators of cytokine function, and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma through multiple mechanisms. Although the role of eosinophils in asthma and their contribution to bronchial hyperresponsiveness are still debated, it is widely accepted that their numbers and activation status are increased. Eosinophils may be targets for various pharmacologic activities of leukotriene receptor antagonists through their ability to downregulate a number of events that may be key to the effector function of these cells.

### A role for eosinophils in airway remodelling in asthma [^b9ba4749]. Trends in Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Over the years, the role of the eosinophil in asthma and allergic processes has been disputed. Recent human experiments using a humanised monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 (IL-5), and animal studies involving specific IL-5 gene deletion, indicates that eosinophils might control downstream repair and remodelling processes. Eosinophils are a rich source of fibrogenic factors, particularly transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the latent form of which is activated by epithelial-cell expression of the intergin alpha(v)beta(6). The emerging role for the eosinophil in airway remodelling might be important in future anti-asthma strategies. However, more effective eosinophil-depleting agents than anti-IL-5 are required before the definitive role of this cell type in asthma airway pathophysiology can be established.

### Blood eosinophil reference values and determinants in a representative adult population [^ea5617b9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Blood eosinophil count (BEC) plays a pivotal role in determining the severity, phenotypes, and therapy of a spectrum of chronic inflammatory lung disorders, most notably asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Indeed, BEC is a valuable prognostic indicator for assessing responsiveness to anti–IL-5 and anti–IL-4/IL-13 therapies in severe asthmaas well as for predicting the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in COPD. In addition, the Global INitiative for Asthma recommends the use of BEC to identify asthmatic patients with type 2 inflammation. Meanwhile, the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommends using a threshold of 300 cells/μL of blood eosinophils for patients with COPD, or 100 cells/μL for those who continue to experience exacerbations despite appropriate bronchodilator therapy, to guide the use of ICSs in COPD treatment.

However, the application of BEC as a biomarker in clinical practice is not straightforward. First, the predictive cutoff points for BEC interpretation derived from randomized controlled trials are confined to studies conducted within asthma and COPD populations. Second, the recommended BEC thresholds in clinical guidelines are subject to debate because of their perceived overlap with normal eosinophil ranges. This controversy arises from the limited evidence of normal and abnormal blood eosinophil levels across diverse populations with varying backgrounds and health conditions. This evidence gap is highlighted by the fact that investigations into healthy populations suggest that BEC is influenced by several demographic and clinical factors, including age, sex, obesity, atopy, and smoking.

Furthermore, studies having representative random samples from the general population are scarce. A recent systematic review by Benson et althat aimed to synthesize the absolute BEC, rather than reference values, identified 14 studies conducted in the general population. Of these studies, only 1 study used a random sample directly from the population itself. Conversely, 2 additional studies, although encompassing a considerable sample size, did not recruit participants from the general populationnor did report reference values for the healthy cohort. Thus, the typical range of BEC in the general population is not well established. Therefore, our objective was to determine the BEC reference values and their determinants in a population-representative sample. Parts of this work have been published as an abstract.

### Eosinophilic disorders [^46565629]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic inflammatory responses occur in association with multiple disorders. Although the initial cause and the affected organs vary among the different eosinophilic disorders, there are only 2 major pathways that mediate eosinophilia: (1) cytokine-mediated increased differentiation and survival of eosinophils (extrinsic eosinophilic disorders), and (2) mutation-mediated clonal expansion of eosinophils (intrinsic eosinophilic disorders). Independent from the original trigger, the most common cause of eosinophilia is the increased generation of IL-5-producing T cells. In some cases, tumor cells are the source of eosinophil hematopoietins. The intrinsic eosinophilic disorders are characterized by mutations in pluripotent or multipotent hematopoietic stem cells leading to chronic myeloid leukemias with eosinophils as part of the clone. Here, we propose a new classification of eosinophilic disorders on the basis of these obvious pathogenic differences between the 2 groups of patients. We then discuss many known eosinophilic disorders, which can be further subdivided by differences in T-cell activation mechanisms, origin of the cytokine-producing tumor cell, or potency of the mutated stem cell. Interestingly, many subgroups of patients originally thought to have the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome can be integrated in this classification.

### Role of eosinophils in inflammatory bowel and gastrointestinal diseases [^cc47ade5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by the invasion of leukocytes into the intestinal mucosa. However, a mixed inflammatory picture is observed that includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. To this day, the role of eosinophils in health and in disease remains unclear. Investigations into their function stem primarily from allergic diseases, asthma, and parasitic infections. This makes it even more difficult to discern a role for the fascinating eosinophil in IBDs because, unlike the lung or the skin, eosinophils reside in normal intestinal mucosa and increase in disease states; consequently, an intricate system must regulate their migration and numbers. These granulocytes are equipped with the machinery to participate in gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and in the susceptible microenvironment, they may initiate or perpetuate an inflammatory response. A significant body of literature characterizes eosinophils present in the GI microenvironment where they have the potential to interact with other resident cells, thus promoting intestinal remodeling, mucus production, epithelial barrier, cytokine production, angiogenesis, and neuropeptide release. A number of lines of evidence support both potential beneficial and deleterious roles of eosinophils in the gut. Although studies from the gut and other mucosal organs suggest eosinophils affect mucosal GI inflammation, definitive roles for eosinophils in IBDs await discovery.

### Eosinophilia: secondary, clonal and idiopathic [^fa6196dd]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Blood eosinophilia signifies either a cytokine-mediated reactive phenomenon (secondary) or an integral phenotype of an underlying haematological neoplasm (primary). Secondary eosinophilia is usually associated with parasitosis in Third World countries and allergic conditions in the West. Primary eosinophilia is operationally classified as being clonal or idiopathic, depending on the respective presence or absence of a molecular, cytogenetic or histological evidence for a myeloid malignancy. The current communication features a comprehensive clinical summary of both secondary and primary eosinophilic disorders with emphasis on recent developments in molecular pathogenesis and treatment.

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^7157ab2d]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Eosinophilia and eosinophil activation are recurrent features in various reactive states and certain hematologic malignancies. In patients with hypereosinophilia (HE), HE‐induced organ damage is often encountered and may lead to the diagnosis of a hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). A number of known mechanisms and etiologies contribute to the development of HE and HES. Based on these etiologies and the origin of eosinophils, HE and HES are divided into primary forms where eosinophils are clonal cells, reactive forms where an underlying reactive or neoplastic condition is detected and eosinophils are considered to be "non‐clonal" cells, and idiopathic HE and HES in which neither a clonal nor a reactive underlying pathology is detected. Since 2012, this classification and the related criteria have been widely accepted and regarded as standard. However, during the past few years, new developments in the field and an increasing number of markers and targets have created a need to update these criteria and the classification of HE and HES. To address this challenge, a Working Conference on eosinophil disorders was organized in 2021. In this conference, a panel of experts representing the relevant fields, including allergy, dermatology, hematology, immunology, laboratory medicine, and pathology, met and discussed new markers and concepts as well as refinements in definitions, criteria and classifications of HE and HES. The outcomes of this conference are presented in this article and should assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with HE and HES in daily practice and in the preparation and conduct of clinical trials.

### The impact of the eosinophil on the risk of acute exacerbation in asthma patients [^60cc6cc6]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Patients with higher eosinophil counts had consistently higher risks of moderate, severe and overall exacerbations across sex and age subgroups. Several studies have examined the role of eosinophils in asthma exacerbations, though most involved fewer than 10 000 patients. A meta-analysis of 23 studies found that high blood eosinophil counts were associated with increased exacerbation risk (OR 1.31), particularly when the cut-off was ≥ 200 cells/µL. In a large UK cohort of 130 248 asthma patients, eosinophils ≥ 400 cells/µL were linked to more severe exacerbations, while levels > 300 cells/µL significantly increased risk compared with ≤ 200 cells/µL. These results align with our finding that eosinophils ≥ 300 cells/µL predict exacerbation risk, though no universal cut-off has been established.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the evidence base is broader and more consistent, with numerous studies and meta-analyses confirming that higher eosinophil levels are associated with more frequent exacerbations. In COPD, the evidence base is broader and more consistent, with numerous studies and meta-analyses confirming that higher eosinophil levels are associated with more frequent exacerbations.

Eosinophils may contribute to asthma exacerbations through multiple mechanisms, including T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine-mediated inflammation, eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs)and functional differences between resident and inflammatory eosinophil subtypes. These processes promote airway inflammation, remodelling and heightened susceptibility to exacerbations. Detailed mechanistic pathways are described in the online supplemental file 1.

Eosinophil levels relative to exacerbation timing

In clinical practice, relying on the 'most recent' or 'average' eosinophil value may misclassify high-risk patients who have recently received corticosteroids, as these agents can transiently suppress eosinophil counts. To minimise this treatment-induced pseudo-reduction, we adopted the peak eosinophil value within a defined monitoring window as the baseline. This approach more accurately reflects the underlying type 2 inflammatory burden, enhances risk stratification and has been supported by large real-world studies showing strong concordance with repeated measurements and consistent associations with future exacerbations and rehospitalisations.

### Eosinophilia [^5708ef7e]. Primary Care (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on eosinophilia:

- **Definition**: Eosinophilia is a transient or sustained increase in the number of eosinophils in the tissues and/or blood with absolute blood eosinophil counts > 450 to 550 cells/mcL.
- **Pathophysiology**: Eosinophilia is caused due to allergies (asthma, atopic dermatitis, sinusitis), drugs (penicillins, ibuprofen, allopurinol, carbamazepine), parasites (ascariasis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis) and infections (fungi, virus), autoimmune diseases (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, IBD), malignancy (lymphoma, lung cancer), immunodeficiency (Job syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and idiopathic reasons (hypereosinophilic syndromes).
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of eosinophilia are heterogeneous that depend on the underlying cause and the affected organs (lungs, heart, skin, blood vessels, kidneys, brain, sinuses) that can range from being asymptomatic to showing symptoms of rash, pruritus, erythema, angioedema, urticaria, hives, fever, fatigue, malaise, tissue swelling, myalgias, weight gain, splenomegaly, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, thrombosis, and progressive HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Eosinophilia is associated with all-cause mortality with odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 1.09–1.24, p < 0.0001) and 1.60 (95% CI 1.35–1.91, p < 0.0001) for mild and severe eosinophilia, respectively.

### Is a single blood eosinophil count a reliable marker for "eosinophilic asthma? " [^90340e66]. The Journal of Asthma (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Eosinophilic asthma" refers to an asthma phenotype characterized by predominance of eosinophils in the bronchial airways and corticosteroid responsiveness. Recent clinical trials of eosinophil-blocking agents have utilized a blood eosinophil count of 300 or 400 eosinophils/mm(3) or higher to identify subjects with moderate to severe asthma. We observed multiple instances of counts which varied widely in the same patient within the same day.

Objectives

To determine whether there is significant variability in blood eosinophil counts taken throughout the day in the same patients with moderate asthma.

Methods

Twelve subjects had serial blood eosinophil counts obtained within a 24-hour period.

Results

Twelve subjects were enrolled: seven subjects had moderate asthma, three subjects had mild asthma, and two control subjects had no asthma. The variability of blood eosinophil counts ranged from 17% to 396%. No specific diurnal pattern was found among the subjects. The highest variability were seen in three moderate asthmatics (396%, 170%, and 154%) and one mild asthmatic (164%) while the other subjects had variability of 84% or less.

Conclusions

This study showed significant variability in blood eosinophil counts within a 24-hour period in the same subjects. The highest variability was seen in moderate asthmatics. These findings would appear to place the utility of a single eosinophil count in question.

Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a marked heterogeneity in etiology, pathophysiology and clinical aspects, leading to the identification of different phenotypes (early onset atopic/allergic, eosinophilic, exercise induced, obesity and paucigranulocitic) Subsequently, taking into account the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of bronchial inflammation, the concept of endotypes has been introduced. BA is often sustained by allergic sensitisation, which leads to bronchial hyper-responsiveness and acute bronchoconstriction in response to specific and non-specific triggers. For many years, from a pathogenic perspective, the focus of research has been on the role of T cells in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation. In particular, T helper 2 (Th2) cells have been identified as the cells involved in controlling immunoglobulin E (IgE) production because of their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and influence the functioning of eosinophils through the actions of IL-5. The presence of Th2 cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage from atopic asthmatics was clearly demonstrated, However, subsequent analyses demonstrated that at least two different endotypes could be proposed based on the degree of Th2 inflammation and called T2 'high' and T2 'low'. Regarding the type of bronchial infiltrate, eosinophils have been considered important pro-inflammatory and epithelial-damaging cells, both in allergic and non-allergic asthma, although alternative inflammatory cells such as neutrophils may be involved. Allergic (or atopic) asthma represents the most frequent endotype of asthma representing over the 60% whereas non atopic eosinophilic phenotype represents about 25–30% of the cases. Approximately 5–10% of patients suffering from asthma have severe refractory asthma, among them non-eosinophilc forms are frequents. Particularly, based on some clinical data, 55% are eosinophilc forms, 20% are neutrophilic forms, 18% paucigranulocytic and 6% a mixed forms. It is important to underline that among all severe forms of asthma, particularly in young subjects, a specific IgE sensitization is demonstrable in a significant proportion of patients.

### Value of peripheral blood eosinophil markers to predict severity of asthma [^bc1034b8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Much progress has been made over the years in identifying external or environmental risk factors/triggers of asthma attacks such as allergens, pollutants, irritants, etc. Recently the focus has shifted to better understanding different patient phenotypes to manage risk and optimize outcomes. In order to prevent exacerbations and progression to more severe disease, it is essential to identify modifiable risk factors for asthma control specific to patient phenotypes. An emerging priority to standardize biological markers in clinical research in order to better evaluate patient outcomes with new and available therapeutic modalities is evidenced by the formation of an expert group by the National Institute of Health (NIH) to classify key biological outcome measures for federally sponsored asthma research. In the NIH Asthma Outcomes report, different biomarkers are grouped as "core", "supplemental", or "emerging". Core outcome biomarkers are required to be included in NIH funded asthma clinical trials and observational studies, whereas supplemental biomarkers are optional. According to the NIH Asthma Outcomes report, multi-allergen screening of IgE against different allergens is considered the only core biomarker. Blood eosinophils are a type of white blood cells that are a part of immune responses and also responsible for inflammatory effects when triggered by allergens. Blood eosinophil measurement is recommended as a supplemental biomarker by the NIH asthma report, suggesting its optional use in NIH funded studies. Published studies evaluating its association with asthma exacerbation have reported significant association between blood eosinophil elevation and asthma exacerbations]. Blood eosinophil measurement is inexpensive and widely collected as part of the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test.

This study aimed to correlate asthma severity (based on EPR guideline step-therapy recommendations) and eosinophil elevation. In the absence of patient reported symptom classification, we explore the use of eosinophil biomarkers to identify patients who remain at risk for chronic exacerbation despite treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^22bfd4b0]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — treatment guided by sputum eosinophil count in adults, when compared with guidelines-based treatment, leads to a reduced risk of exacerbations and similar levels of symptom control and lung function in patients with frequent exacerbations and moderate-severe asthma; however, few clinics have routine access to induced sputum analysis, there is insufficient evidence to assess this approach in children, and sputum-guided treatment is recommended for adult patients with moderate or severe asthma who are managed in (or can be referred to) centers experienced in this technique (Evidence A).

### Eosinophilia in the returning traveler [^4cb83f9a]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

An elevated eosinophil count is a common, frequently underrecognized finding in travelers returning from the tropics and elsewhere. Although there are multiple causes of eosinophilia in a traveler, it is often related to an acquired helminth infection. In some cases these infections can be benign and self-limiting, but in others it may lead to severe sequelae for the individual or others. This article outlines the etiology and diagnosis of eosinophilia concentrating on helminth infections.

### Approaches to the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndromes: a workshop summary report [^e8ba3001]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of uncommon disorders characterized by the presence of marked peripheral blood eosinophilia, tissue eosinophilia, or both, resulting in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Although corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for many of these disorders, approaches to the treatment of patients who do not tolerate or are unresponsive to corticosteroids are poorly standardized. A multidisciplinary group of 37 clinicians and scientists participated in a workshop held in May 2005 in Bern, Switzerland to discuss current and future approaches to therapy for 3 eosinophil-mediated disorders: hypereosinophilic syndrome, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disease. The goal of the workshop was to summarize available data regarding treatment of these disorders to identify the most promising therapies and approaches for further study. There was consensus among all of the participants that the identification of markers of disease progression to assess treatment responses is a research priority for all 3 disorders. Furthermore, the need for newer therapeutic strategies and novel drugs, as well as multicenter trials to assess all treatment modalities, was emphasized.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders and the potential role of eosinophils [^15bad1e1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The eosinophil-mast cell-neural pathway may be important in the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by unexplained abdominal pain, disordered defecation, or meal-related discomfort. There is evidence that duodenal eosinophils are increased in functional dyspepsia, whereas mast cells are increased in the lower gut in irritable bowel syndrome, directly supporting a role for a hypersensitivity-type reaction in these disorders. The trigger may be a pathogen, food, or other allergen in the gut mucosa. This trigger may evoke eosinophils, mast cells, and other components to cascade to up-regulate serotonin release, with modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems, creating a vicious cycle. If correct, this theory suggests treatment should specifically target the eosinophil-mast cell pathway.

### Emerging questions regarding eosinophil's role in the esophago-gastrointestinal tract [^94905985]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is either increasing in frequency or being better recognized. Whichever is the case, clinical needs to meet this new challenge include establishing diagnostic criteria, identifying the natural history and determining effective, tolerable treatments.

Recent Findings

During the last 5 years, the emergence of eosinophilic esophagitis stimulated many case series; the new frontiers relate to understanding disease pathogenesis and maintenance treatments. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases involving the rest of the gastrointestinal tract pose new challenges in understanding the role of eosinophils in intestinal dysmotility and protein loss.

Summary

This review will focus on new clinical developments in the field of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases and the contribution of basic studies in understanding eosinophils impact on gastrointestinal inflammation.

### From DREAM to REALITI – A and beyond: mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^459d3b13]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Effective treatment of inflammatory diseases is often challenging owing to their heterogeneous pathophysiology. Understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms is improving and it is now clear that eosinophils play a complex pathophysiological role in a broad range of type 2 inflammatory diseases. Standard of care for these conditions often still includes oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or cytotoxic immune therapies, which are associated with debilitating side effects. Selective, biological eosinophil-reducing agents provide treatment options that improve clinical symptoms associated with eosinophilic inflammation and reduce OCS use. Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes interleukin-5, the major cytokine involved in eosinophil proliferation, activation, and survival. Mepolizumab is approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Additionally, the efficacy of add-on mepolizumab has been observed in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an eosinophilic phenotype. Here, we review the development, approval, and real-world effectiveness of mepolizumab for the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, from the DREAM to REALITI-A studies, and describe how knowledge from this journey extended to the use of mepolizumab and other biologics across a broad spectrum of eosinophilic diseases.

### Finding the right biological: eosinophil subset differences in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^32f6dba1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma practice guidelines recommend considering eosinophil counts from blood, induced sputum, or both for treatment decisions. However, controversy persists on the relevance of eosinophils to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes. Association of eosinophils with greater risk of COPD exacerbations has been either claimed for blood or refuted for both blood and sputum. Although 15–37% of patients with COPD persistently have > 2% blood eosinophils, low rather than high blood eosinophils were associated with both greater emphysema and lung function decline in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease group D disease. A recent systematic review concluded that blood eosinophil counts cannot predict COPD clinical outcomes.

Studies of lung samples also do not support a clearly deleterious role of eosinophils in COPD. Numbers of eosinophils in lungs resected from smokers did not differ in those patients without versus with COPD. Eosinophils in BAL were significantly increased in current (but not former) smokers with COPD relative to ever-smokers without COPD or never-smokers.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^e59d8fa3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Blood eosinophil count — In COPD, blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (added on top of regular maintenance bronchodilator treatment) in preventing future exacerbations, and are recommended by GOLD to guide the use of ICS as part of pharmacological management. On average, counts are higher in COPD with marked overlap with controls, and higher counts are associated with increased lung eosinophil numbers and higher levels of type‑2 airway inflammation markers, although concordance between blood and airway T2 biomarkers is not strict. Repeatability in a large primary care population appears reasonable, with greater variability at higher thresholds and better reproducibility at lower thresholds (e.g., 100 cells/μL). Blood eosinophil counts can help clinicians estimate the likelihood of a beneficial preventive response to the addition of ICS to regular bronchodilator treatment and can be used as a biomarker with clinical assessment when making decisions regarding ICS use. Cohort studies report either no relationship or a positive relationship between blood eosinophils and future exacerbation outcomes, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend using blood eosinophils to predict future exacerbation risk on an individual basis in COPD. Greater FEV1 decline was observed in mild to moderate COPD patients with higher blood eosinophil counts when ICS use was low, and in younger individuals without COPD higher counts are associated with increased risk of subsequent development of COPD.

### Allergy and eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGID) [^8bd8b3ac]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are characterized by an inappropriate accumulation of eosinophils within the gastrointestinal tract. The underlying etiology and pathophysiology that lead to the development of EGID are far from elucidated. However, there is growing evidence to support the role of aeroallergens and food allergens in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Recent advances have highlighted the role of Th2-driven cytokines in the development of EGID, and clinical studies have verified that children and adults with EGID often have positive skin testing to food allergens. The most common form of EGID, eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), has garnered intense investigation following an increased recognition over the past decade. Recently, there have been several important studies providing insight into both the cellular mechanisms governing EE and clinical therapies directed toward the treatment of EE. In the article herein, we will review the most recent scientific advances influencing our understanding of EGID with special emphasis on the role of allergens in the pathogenesis of EGID.

### Eosinophil extracellular traps in asthma: implications for pathogenesis and therapy [^dcf733e8]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that affects millions of people worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. Eosinophils, a type of immune cell, play a critical role in the development and progression of asthma. Eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs) are reticular structures composed of DNA, histones, and granulins that eosinophils form and release into the extracellular space as part of the innate immune response. EETs have a protective effect by limiting the migration of pathogens and antimicrobial activity to a controlled range. However, chronic inflammation can lead to the overproduction of EETs, which can trigger and exacerbate allergic asthma. In this review, we examine the role of EETs in asthma.
