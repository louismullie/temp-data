## Question

Is it normal to have diarrhea seven months after colon rectal resection surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether persistent diarrhea seven months after colon or rectal resection is normal and what evaluation and management approach should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "normal" in this post-surgical context and what the expected trajectory of bowel function looks like. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that make diarrhea plausible at seven months. Next, I will review prevalence data to quantify how common this is. After that, I need to check for red flags that would trigger urgent evaluation. Then, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup. Finally, I will synthesize management options and provide a bottom-line answer with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: seven months after resection, diarrhea is still within the window of expected postoperative bowel dysfunction, but it is no longer "early postoperative" and warrants structured assessment rather than passive observation, especially if it is persistent or impactful on quality of life [^116EeRFL] [^115PoQzp] [^113gXFW5].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure plausibility. Loss of the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum after right hemicolectomy predisposes to bile acid malabsorption and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, both of which can cause chronic diarrhea; resection of the proximal colon reduces water absorption; pelvic radiation and low anastomoses can impair reservoir and sphincter function; and dysbiosis or medications may further perpetuate symptoms, so mechanistically, diarrhea at seven months is entirely credible [^114jEHmF] [^1147N6kr] [^112fZGma].

> Wait, let me verify prevalence so I don't overstate this. Prospective data show that one year after colon cancer surgery, loose stools and urgency are more common after right-sided resections, with loose stools persisting in about 31% versus 20% after left-sided resections, and similar patterns are seen at three years; in rectal cancer cohorts, over half report persistent mild to moderate diarrhea at roughly 13 months post-op, and systematic reviews estimate chronic diarrhea after right hemicolectomy in about one in five patients, which aligns with clinical experience [^113gXFW5] [^114CV1wJ] [^1147N6kr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is "common", but not necessarily "normal" in the sense of benign neglect. I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent evaluation: rectal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, nocturnal diarrhea, severe urgency or incontinence, or any features suggesting recurrence or anastomotic complications; these should prompt expedited endoscopic and imaging assessment rather than empiric therapy alone [^116EeRFL] [^1163qfPo].

> Next, I should review a staged diagnostic workup. Let me think about the basics first: confirm the stool pattern with a diary, review medications and diet, check CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and thyroid; if not already done, obtain a colonoscopy to exclude recurrence, stricture, ischemia, radiation colitis, or microscopic colitis, with terminal ileum intubation and segmental biopsies as indicated; if right-sided resection was performed, consider testing for bile acid diarrhea; if bloating or malabsorption features are present, test for SIBO with glucose or lactulose breath testing; reserve anorectal physiology and imaging for refractory cases with incontinence or suspected outlet dysfunction [^1142LsjP] [^115XTcka] [^115ragqg] [^112fZGma].

> But wait, what if symptoms are mild and the patient prefers empiric therapy first? I should double-check that guidelines allow this. In the absence of alarm features, a trial of loperamide with or without fiber and diet modification is reasonable; for suspected bile acid diarrhea after right-sided resection, cholestyramine can be tried; pelvic floor rehabilitation is appropriate for urgency or clustering; and dietary strategies such as reducing caffeine, lactose, fructose, and artificial sweeteners can help, with escalation if symptoms persist or worsen [^116LrtuG] [^116qsF8Q] [^113b4Hnu] [^117F9bBt].

> Let me synthesize: persistent diarrhea seven months after colon or rectal resection is common and biologically plausible, especially after right-sided resections or rectal procedures, but it is not "normal" in the sense that it should be ignored; a structured evaluation to exclude recurrence and other organic pathology, followed by mechanism-targeted therapy, is appropriate, and many patients will benefit from empiric antidiarrheals, fiber, diet, and pelvic floor strategies while diagnostics proceed in parallel [^113gXFW5] [^114CV1wJ] [^1147N6kr] [^116EeRFL].

> Bottom line: Yes, persistent diarrhea at seven months can occur in a substantial minority after colorectal resection and is often due to surgically induced changes such as bile acid malabsorption, SIBO, altered transit, or pelvic floor/neural injury; it is common enough to be expected, yet important enough to evaluate methodically, with colonoscopy to exclude recurrence and targeted testing for bile acid diarrhea or SIBO as indicated, followed by individualized medical and dietary management to restore quality of life [^1147N6kr] [^112fZGma] [^116LrtuG] [^1142LsjP].

It is **not uncommon** to have diarrhea 7 months after colon or rectal resection [^112fZGma], especially after right hemicolectomy or low anterior resection [^112fZGma], due to bile acid malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or altered colonic transit and reservoir function [^112fZGma]. Persistent diarrhea should be evaluated with colonoscopy [^1142LsjP], stool studies, and targeted tests for bile acid diarrhea and SIBO [^111FZHZu]; management includes dietary changes, antidiarrheals, bile acid sequestrants, and pelvic floor therapy [^113b4Hnu] [^116LrtuG]. Most patients improve with conservative care, but symptoms can persist beyond a year in some cases [^113gXFW5].

## Incidence and prevalence of diarrhea after colon and rectal resection

Diarrhea is a **common complication** after colon and rectal resection, with reported incidences ranging from 10% to 31% [^11421UTu] in the early postoperative period. By 7 months, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience chronic diarrhea, particularly after right hemicolectomy or low anterior resection [^1147N6kr] [^113gXFW5].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** contribute to chronic diarrhea after colon and rectal resection:

- **Bile acid malabsorption**: Resection of the terminal ileum or ileocecal valve disrupts bile acid absorption, leading to bile acid diarrhea [^112fZGma].

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Loss of the ileocecal valve and altered intestinal motility predispose to bacterial overgrowth, causing diarrhea and malabsorption [^111HMqob].

- **Altered colonic transit and reservoir function**: Resection of the ascending colon or rectum impairs water absorption and stool storage, resulting in frequent, loose stools [^113gXFW5].

- **Neurogenic diarrhea**: Injury to the superior mesenteric nerve plexus during surgery may contribute to neurogenic diarrhea, although this association remains controversial [^114jEHmF].

---

## Risk factors associated with persistent diarrhea

Several factors increase the risk of **persistent diarrhea** after colon and rectal resection:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Extent of resection | - Greater bowel length removed <br/> - Particularly terminal ileum or rectum [^112fZGma] |
| Type of surgery | - Right hemicolectomy <br/> - Low anterior resection [^112fZGma] |
| Preoperative dysbacteriosis | Pre-existing intestinal dysbiosis increases risk of postoperative diarrhea [^11421UTu] |
| Adjuvant therapy | Radiation and chemotherapy exacerbate bowel dysfunction [^112fZGma] |
| Dietary factors | High fat intake and lactose intolerance worsen symptoms [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Persistent diarrhea 7 months after surgery warrants a **comprehensive diagnostic evaluation** to identify underlying causes:

- **Colonoscopy**: Rule out recurrence, anastomotic strictures, or inflammatory bowel disease [^1136UkmR].

- **Stool studies**: Test for infection, malabsorption, and inflammation [^notfound].

- **Bile acid diarrhea testing**: SeHCAT test or serum C4 levels [^notfound].

- **Breath tests**: Evaluate for SIBO [^112fZGma].

- **Dietary assessment**: Identify dietary triggers and malabsorption syndromes [^113uFvCT].

---

## Management strategies

Management of chronic diarrhea after colon and rectal resection is **multimodal**, including:

- **Dietary modifications**: Low-fat diet, lactose restriction, and fiber supplementation [^113b4Hnu].

- **Pharmacological therapy**: Antidiarrheal agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate-atropine), bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine), and antibiotics for SIBO [^113b4Hnu] [^116LrtuG].

- **Pelvic floor rehabilitation**: Biofeedback and pelvic floor exercises for fecal incontinence and urgency [^116LrtuG].

- **Probiotics**: Modulate gut microbiota and improve symptoms [^113JnnZR].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis of chronic diarrhea after colon and rectal resection varies; while many patients experience **improvement over time**, some have persistent symptoms beyond a year [^113gXFW5]. Long-term bowel dysfunction, including diarrhea, urgency, and incontinence, significantly impacts quality of life, necessitating ongoing management and support [^1147N6kr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized patient assessment and management**. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) recommends evaluating and treating chronic diarrhea with dietary modifications, antidiarrheal agents, and pelvic floor rehabilitation [^notfound]. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends colonoscopy and targeted testing for bile acid diarrhea and SIBO in persistent cases [^notfound].

---

Diarrhea 7 months after colon or rectal resection is **not uncommon** and often reflects bile acid malabsorption, SIBO, or altered colonic function [^1147N6kr]. Persistent symptoms warrant structured evaluation and multimodal management, with most patients improving over time, though some have chronic dysfunction requiring ongoing care [^116LrtuG].

### The effects of preoperative intestinal dysbacteriosis on postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study [^11421UTu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Preoperatively existing dysbacteriosis may lead to adverse postoperative outcomes. Our study found that, compared to patients with normal microbiota, those with dysbacteriosis before surgery were more likely to be afflicted with severe dysbacteriosis after surgery, and preoperative dysbacteriosis was identified to be predictive of early postoperative diarrhoea. A significantly higher rate of infectious complications was observed in patients with preoperative dysbacteriosis. Moreover, logistic regression revealed that early postoperative diarrhoea and preoperative dysbacteriosis grade 3 were negatively correlated with postoperative complications in rectal cancer patients. According to our interaction analysis, a possible explanation was that diarrhoea may act as an intermediate factor between dysbacteriosis and postoperative complications. Diarrhoea, one of the most common symptoms after colectomy with reported incidences from 10 to 31%, may render the host susceptible to infections. It has been reported that no specific pathogens, but instead gut dysbiosis, were associated with diarrhoea after organ transplantation. The gut origin of sepsis hypothesis proposes that some of the postoperative infectious complications are due to translocation of pathogens across the intestinal barrier. Diarrhoea was correlated with increased mucosal permeability, which further facilitated the translocation of intestinal endogenous bacteria and the absorption of endotoxin. Furthermore, starting supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics 6–7 days before colorectal surgery could protect the mucosal barrier, and lower the rate of diarrhoea and infectious complications, which was in agreement with our findings. However, in the subgroup analysis, early postoperative diarrhoea was not identified as a risk factor for complications after colon resection, which may be related to the degree of preoperative dysbacteriosis in colon cancer patients being less than that in rectal cancer patients. Future studies are needed to clarify the causal effects of dysbacteriosis on early postoperative diarrhoea and infectious complications. Recently, Kok et al. reported that higher dietary fiber intake was associated with a lower risk of surgical complications after CRC resection, the intestinal microbiota involved in fermenting dietary fiber and maintaining mucosal barrier might mediate the observed associations. This finding further promotes that protecting preoperative gut health may be considered in future prehabilitation programmes for CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer surveillance — symptom triggers: During the course of surveillance, the development of suspicious symptoms should prompt investigation because these may be the first sign of CRC recurrence. In randomized studies, 16% to 66% of patients with CRC were symptomatic at the time of their diagnosis of recurrence, yet < 7% of patients with symptomatic CRC recurrence have resectable disease. Suspicious symptoms commonly include new-onset abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal mass, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of fecal incontinence [^113b4Hnu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Nonoperative management — Dietary and medical management are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with fecal incontinence (FI), and 22% to 54% of patients with FI report improved symptoms after behavior modification regarding dietary habits and fluid management and changes to medications. In randomized evidence, a randomized controlled trial comparing 39 patients treated with either fiber supplementation or placebo showed that the fiber supplementation group decreased their percentage of incontinent stools to less than half that in the placebo group and had an improvement in stool consistency. A Cochrane review analyzed 16 randomized trials (558 pooled patients) using medications other than fiber and noted that antidiarrheal drugs such as loperamide or diphenoxylate-atropine may decrease episodes of FI in patients with preexisting diarrhea; common medications used in these circumstances include adsorbents (Kaopectate and Pepto Bismol), and a trial of cholestyramine may be reasonable in patients with suspected urgency from bile salt diarrhea after cholecystectomy or ileocolonic resection.

Results

The trial enrolled and registered 117 participants to step 1 registration between February 2020 and April 2022 (23 months) (Fig. 2 Supplemental). With minor modifications, the trial continued with accrual nationally through the initial COVID-19 pandemic surge in 2020 and through subsequent surges. Participants from 17 states were included and the US territory of Guam, with the largest recruitment numbers from the states of California and Texas (Fig. 2). A total of 39 institutions contributed to overall enrollment, including 30 community institutions and nine academic institutions.

Distribution of SWOG S1820 participants by state

The median age at enrollment for the 117 consented participants was 55.2 years, with 54% female, 65% married or partnered, and 77% with at least some college education (Table 1). Most participants were overweight or obese (72%) and never smokers (68%). Most participants (75%) reported adjusting their diets following anastomosis/ostomy surgery, and 51% reported persistent discomfort with their diet after surgery without a clear plan for how to manage this.

7.2 Post-surgical diarrhoea

There is a third group of 'surgical' patients with diarrhoea. These are the patients who have developed diarrhoea as a result of surgical intervention. The underlying aetiology of the diarrhoea may be attributed to pyloric dysfunction, bile salt malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth or gut bypass reducing absorptive capacity.

Upper GI surgery may result in damage or division of the vagus nerve accompanied in part by reduction in capacity of the stomach in the case of gastric resection. Rapid gastric emptying may result in osmotic diarrhoea and associated symptoms of 'dumping' syndrome. Surgery can also provide an ideal environment for bacterial colonisation and overgrowth leading to chronic diarrhoea. GI tract surgeries that create a blind loop (eg, a Billroth II procedure or a Roux-en-Y anastomosis) may predispose to stasis and overgrowth due to abnormal motility and ineffective clearance of retained food and secretions. In addition, those who have undergone jejunoileal bypass, an end-to-side enteroenteric anastomosis or the creation of a Koch distal ileal pouch are at risk. In the same way, small bowel strictures may lead to bacterial stasis and overgrowth. These may occur after surgery but can also be seen after radiotherapy, in Crohn's disease and secondary to some medications.

Small and large bowel resection clearly reduces absorptive capacity. At the extreme, this results in short bowel syndrome characterised clinically by chronic diarrhoea, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and malnutrition. The severity and management depend on the site and extent of the intestinal resection, whether there is disease in the residual bowel and the degree of adaptation of the remaining bowel. However, even a simple limited right hemicolectomy may result in diarrhoea as a result of loss of the ileocaecal valve and resorptive capacity of the right colon. This increases the risk of developing bacterial overgrowth because of retrograde movement of bacteria from the colon into the small intestine. This has been clearly demonstrated in one trial of patients with Crohn's disease which showed that resection of the ileocaecal valve almost doubled the prevalence of bacterial overgrowth.

### Long-term functional outcome after right-sided complete mesocolic excision compared with conventional colon cancer surgery: a population-based questionnaire study [^116jVdoc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Complete mesocolic excision improves the long-term outcome of colon cancer but might carry a risk of bowel dysfunction.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate whether right-sided complete mesocolic excision is associated with an increased risk of long-term bowel dysfunction and reduced quality of life compared with conventional colon cancer resections.

Design

Data were extracted from a population-based study comparing complete mesocolic excision and conventional colon cancer resections and from a national questionnaire survey regarding functional outcome.

Settings

Elective right-sided colon resections for stage I to III colon adenocarcinoma were performed at 4 university colorectal centers between June 2008 and December 2014.

Patients

Seven hundred sixty-two patients were eligible to receive the questionnaire in November 2015.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes measured were the risk of diarrhea (Bristol stool scale score of 6–7), 4 or more bowel movements daily, and the impact of bowel function on quality of life. Secondary outcomes were other bowel symptoms, chronic pain, and quality of life measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30.

Results

One hundred forty-one (63.8%) and 324 (59.9%) patients undergoing complete mesocolic excision and conventional resections responded after a median of 3.99 (interquartile range, 2.11–5.32) and 4.11 (interquartile range, 3.01–5.53) years (p = 0.04). Complete mesocolic excision was not associated with increased risk of diarrhea (adjusted OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.57–1.95; p = 0.84), 4 or more bowel movements daily (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.57–2.24; p = 0.68), or lower quality of life (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.49–1.40; p = 0.50). Complete mesocolic excision was associated nonsignificantly with nocturnal bowel movements, but not associated with chronic pain or other secondary outcomes.

Limitations

This study was limited by the retrospective design with unknown baseline symptoms. Responding patients were younger but without obvious selection bias. The outcome "diarrhea" seemed somehow sensitive to information bias.

Conclusion

Right-sided complete mesocolic excision seems associated with neither bowel dysfunction nor impaired quality of life when compared with conventional surgery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A665.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^112fZGma]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidance

Post-pelvic cancer symptoms need to be actively identified and managed.
The extent of surgery and position of the anastomosis (or stoma) has direct influence on symptoms and quality of life.
Multimodal treatment has a higher risk for long-term complaints and complications.
Interventions include bowel habit training, toilet positioning, advice on raising abdominal pressure for evacuation without straining, modifying stool consistency via diet and fluid adjustments, loperamide or fibre supplements, following a stepwise algorithm.
A large bowel transit study may help distinguish between slow transit constipation and evacuation difficulty.
Biofeedback for incontinence or evacuation difficulties, transanal irrigation or use of suppositories or mini-enemas are sometimes needed, but evidence for efficacy is lacking.
A stoma should be discussed in patients with poorly controlled symptoms and severely impaired quality of life, when other treatment options have failed.
Prophylactic use of laxatives is recommended when opioids are prescribed.
Evidence that a defaecating proctogram, endoanal ultrasound or ano-rectal physiological assessment change clinical practice is lacking so should be reserved for specialist practice or research.

Key factors which impact on long-term symptoms and complications are the type of operation (eg, diarrhoea being more common after right than left hemicolectomy) and the length of bowel segment removed (segmental vs complete), especially in the case of rectal surgery or resections of the terminal ileum. The position of the anastomosis is important, with fewer symptoms if placed more proximally. Resection of even very short segments of ileum (> 5 cm) increases the risk of bile acid malabsorption. Transit time is dysregulated in the absence of the so-called 'ileal brake', and bile acids can directly affect intestinal motility. The role of the sigmoid in regulating bowel function and the loss of function that occurs after resection (and irradiation) is also underappreciated. Multimodal treatment (eg, neoadjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy) further aggravates symptoms. SIBO affects approximately a third of patients after bowel surgery. Some evidence suggests that hydrogen-positive SIBO predisposes to diarrhoea, whereas methane-positive SIBO predisposes to constipation.

### Synbiotics and gastrointestinal function-related quality of life after elective colorectal cancer resection [^113JnnZR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The unavoidable anatomical distortion of bowel anatomy due to surgical resections for colorectal cancer (CRC) may lead to intestinal functional disturbances. Preoperative preparation strategies, such as mechanical bowel preparation may disturb the well-established functional balances between enteric flora and normal large bowel function. Bowel disorders may directly or indirectly affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and this may be reflected to proportional alterations in the scoring of standardized measurement tools, such as HRQoL questionnaires. A validated instrument that assesses gastrointestinal function is the Gastro-Intestinal Quality Life Index (GIQLI). GIQLI may offer valuable insight in rating postoperative gastrointestinal function status at CRC patients. The 30-item questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) has already widely assessed CRC patients' HRQoL and it includes items on gastrointestinal function, such as the symptom domains "diarrhea" and "constipation". HRQoL instruments may offer "functional surveillance" by monitoring, ranking and quantifying the "subjective" patient's symptoms.

Initial HRQoL postoperative deterioration and postcolectomy gastrointestinal disturbances are expected to be temporary enduring 3–6 months. Interventional strategies and enhancing therapeutic regimens at the immediate postoperative period may have a soothing effect on patients' symptoms. Probiotics are cultures of live microorganisms that might beneficially affect the host by improving the composition and the equilibrium of indigenous microflora. Prebiotics are nondigestible ingredients (fibers) that reach the colon and serve as substrate for fermentation by probiotics and indigenous colonic bacteria to nutrients beneficially improving host health. Synbiotics are the combination of probiotics and prebiotics and are believed to be more efficient in terms of gut health and function. Administration of pro- and/or synbiotics may serve as one of the supportive modulating dietary supplement-based strategies in CRC patients.

Studies reporting on the effects of pro-/synbiotics on functional outcome, gastrointestinal symptoms and HRQoL after CRC surgery are rather scarce. In an effort to clarify the effects of early postoperative administration of synbiotics on bowel functional outcome, as this is measured by gastrointestinal-oriented HRQoL instruments and domains, we prospectively carried out a randomized trial in a selected cohort of patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. This study aimed to justify the early postoperative use of oral synbiotics for the minimization of the adverse effect of surgery on the short- and mid-term gastrointestinal symptoms-associated HRQoL.

### Bowel dysfunction after colon cancer surgery: a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study [^1145NVUP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer ranks among the most prevalent types of cancer. Treatment with curative intent often includes surgical resection of the engaged bowel segment followed by anastomosis. For many patients with rectal cancer, the removal of the rectum leads to impaired bowel function, referred to as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). The functional impairments after rectal cancer surgery are well documented; however, bowel function after surgery for colon cancer has not been studied to a similar extent.

Most available studies have consisted of relatively small patient cohorts with a retrospective or a cross-sectional design. A recent meta-analysis was limited to a descriptive analysis of symptoms over time, and differences between right-sided and left-sided resections were unable to be addressed because of data heterogeneity and a shortage of longitudinal studies. Some studies, however, have suggested that after left or sigmoid resection, patients mainly experience symptoms associated with constipation, whereas patients treated with right-sided resection frequently report increased bowel movements, loose or liquid stools, fecal urgency, and incontinence. – It has also been proposed that colon resection minimally affects bowel function, as functional outcomes have been found comparable with those of the general population.

The Quality of Life in Colon Cancer (QoLiCOL) study is an observational, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of functional outcome and QoL among patients treated for colon cancer.

Our objectives were to compare bowel function and associated distress between right-sided and left-sided resections 1 and 3 years after treatment. We anticipated symptom variance based on resection type and expected improvement over time. We also theorized that symptoms such as "urgency" and "clustering" would be most distressing given their significant impact on QoL in the LARS score, which is frequently used in rectal cancer evaluations.

### Long-term bowel dysfunction and decline in quality of life following surgery for colon cancer: call for personalized screening and treatment [^114jEHmF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Right hemicolectomy was associated with twice as much liquid incontinence and fecal urgency compared to sigmoid colon resection. Liquid incontinence was probably linked to the more liquid stool consistency that was found in patients after right hemicolectomy, which had also been reported in previous long-term studies. Comparing stool consistency in patients after right hemicolectomy versus the general population of comparable age illustrates the true increase of liquid to mushy stool after right hemicolectomy (17.2% versus 4.8%, respectively). Liquid incontinence and fecal urgency were also the 2 symptoms of the LARS score that showed a significantly higher prevalence after right hemicolectomy.

From a pathophysiological point of view, 2 main issues can be distinguished that predispose patients who underwent right hemicolectomy to more liquid stool. First, the absence of the proximal colon, which is known as the part of the colon that absorbs most of the water from the stool. Second, the absence of or damage to the terminal ileum and/or ileocolic valve may lead to bile acid malabsorption, which causes chronic diarrhea. In addition, small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, on account of the absence of the ileocecal valve that acts as a barrier between the flora of the small and large intestine, was proposed as liquifying the stool. Next to that, some hypothesize that injury to the superior mesenteric nerve plexus could result in neurogenic diarrhea, although more recent studies could not prove this association.

### Quality of life after sphincter-preserving rectal cancer resection [^1112FSdk]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

With an increasing number of cancer survivors quality of life (QoL) becomes more and more important in the treatment of rectal cancer (RC). QoL after sphincter-preserving anterior resection (AR), however, was found nonsuperior to abdominoperineal resection. The aim of our study was to evaluate QoL after AR compared with colon cancer patients after right hemicolectomy (CC) and healthy lay persons without history of cancer (HL) in long-term follow-up.

Patients and Methods

Consecutive alive RC patients (n = 293) who received an AR between 1998 and 2008 were included. CC patients (n = 201) and HL of the same age were used as a surgical and a nonsurgical control group, respectively. QoL was assessed using European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C 30 and -CR 38.

Results

Questionnaires from 116 RC patients, 105 CC patients, and 103 HL were evaluable with a median time after surgery of 5 years. The global health status did not differ. Social functioning, future perspectives, and financial difficulties tended to poorer scores in the cancer groups. Physical functioning was better in RC and CC patients compared with HL. Defecation problems and diarrhea were more frequent in RC patients (P < .05). An additional open question revealed a median stool frequency of 3, 2, and 1 per day for RC, CC, and HL, respectively. Defecation problems were more frequent in RC patients who received radiation therapy (P < .05).

Conclusion

Diarrhea and defecation problems impaired QoL after AR for RC, which was worsened after radiation therapy. To improve QoL of RC patients in the future, physicians have to focus on minimization of gastrointestinal side effects while optimizing surgical reconstruction.

### The effects of preoperative intestinal dysbacteriosis on postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study [^112XyxsC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of intestinal dysbacteriosis in surgical site infections and anastomotic leakage after abdominal surgery. However, a direct correlation between pre-existing dysbacteriosis and postoperative infectious complications has not yet been established clinically.

Methods

A total of 353 consecutive patients who underwent colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery were enrolled. Gram-stained faecal smears were tested at admission and the first defecation after surgery. Intestinal dysbacteriosis was graded into three groups: normal or slightly decreased intestinal microflora (grade 1), moderate dysbacteriosis (grade 2), and severe dysbacteriosis (grade 3). Clinical outcomes were postoperative infections and anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery.

Results

At the preoperative assessment, 268 (75.9%) patients had normal or slightly decreased intestinal microflora, 58 (16.4%) patients had moderate dysbacteriosis, and 27 (7.6%) patients had severe dysbacteriosis. The patients with preoperative dysbacteriosis had a higher rate of early postoperative diarrhoea (grade 2: OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.28–9.00, grade 3: OR = 4.52, 95% CI 1.81–11.31), total complications (grade 3 40.7% vs. grade 2 25.9% vs. grade 1 12.7%, P < 0.001), and anastomotic leakage (grade 3 11.1% vs. grade 2 5.2% vs. grade 1 1.5%, P = 0.002). An interaction effect among preoperative dysbacteriosis and early postoperative diarrhoea on total complications was observed in rectal cancer patients (P for interaction = 0.007).

Conclusions

An imbalance of the intestinal microbiome exists in a considerable proportion of CRC patients before surgery. Preoperative dysbacteriosis is associated with higher rates of early postoperative diarrhoea, which further correlates with infectious complications and anastomotic leakage. However, the contribution of preoperative dysbacteriosis to the occurrence of anastomotic leakage needs to be clarified in further studies.

### The burden of low anterior resection syndrome on quality of life in patients with mid or low rectal cancer [^1168coJX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low anterior resection (LAR) with total mesorectal excision (TME) for mid and low rectal cancer is standard of care, reducing local recurrence and enhancing long-term survival. However, this surgery is associated with a constellation of major defecatory problems that are collectively referred to as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). The aims of this study were to evaluate the frequency of LARS in patients who have undergone LAR and to assess the impact of LARS on long-term quality of life (QoL).

Methods

This was a single-center prospective survey study on patients who underwent LAR and TME for low or mid rectal cancer between 2007 and 2015. LARS score and QLQ-C30 questionnaires were used to evaluate patient's bowel functions and quality of life, respectively. Associations between LARS and QoL were evaluated.

Results

Fifty-seven patients out of 65 eligible agreed to participate in the study. Forty-three (66%) patients returned complete questionnaires. Five patients (11.6%) had no LARS, 7 had minor LARS (16.3%), and 31 had major LARS (72.1%). In univariate analysis, BMI > 30 kg/m² was predictive of major LARS (p = 0.047). Major LARS did not impair global QoL (p = 0.75), function scores, or social scales, and was not associated with any of the symptom scores except for diarrhea (p = 0.02).

Conclusion

LARS is a frequent occurrence after LAR and TME for rectal cancer (72.1%) and is more prevalent in morbidly obese patients. However, the occurrence of LARS does not appear to have a direct impact on QoL except for the occurrence of diarrhea.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDED WORK‐UP

Safety concerns

Physicians should ensure that there is no underlying 'organic' lesion that may explain a patient's symptoms after surgery (e.g. radiation‐related mucosal lesions, anastomotic stricture, tumoural local recurrence). This needs a minimal work‐up, at least digital rectal examination and proctoscopy to rule out anastomotic strictures. Since most of these patients have been operated on for rectal cancer, the oncological follow‐up will detect any local recurrence or postoperative complication (e.g. anastomotic leakage) [44, 45].

The role of the gastroenterologist

The first step for all physicians taking care of a patient is to evaluate the patient's symptoms and their impact on HRQoL (see above). The gastroenterologist may also help to rule out any potential 'organic' lesions and specific cause of diarrhoea by appropriate investigations [30]. These also include perianal lesions related to soiling and/or radiation.

There are no data in the literature showing how preoperative bowel function may affect postoperative functional outcome. However, clinical experience shows that preoperative irritable bowel syndrome, functional diarrhoea or constipation may affect postoperative functional outcome in different ways: in some patients, surgery will result in the worsening of symptoms whereas in others it may have a more positive impact (e.g. a patient with distal constipation may improve after rectal excision). Physicians should also check for medications that may have a negative impact on intestinal transit. These medications may have been prescribed for misdiagnosed 'diarrhoea' (which is very often clustering rather than actual diarrhoea) or constipation (doses may be adapted), or for extraintestinal reasons (e.g. opioids, antidepressants). This is very important for the medical management of LARS.

Endoscopy

Apart from routine postoperative screening, endoscopy is not mandatory in all patients presenting with LARS. It may be useful when radiation‐induced colitis or local tumour recurrence is suspected. If the preoperative colonoscopy was not complete because of an obstructive tumour, a colonoscopy should be performed in the 6 months following rectal surgery in order to rule out a synchronous tumour or polyp that should be adequately treated. This is a rare situation. Anastomotic strictures can be easily diagnosed in coloanal anastomosis or if the anastomosis can be digitally assessed. In other cases, endoscopy may help to rule out anastomotic strictures and to perform endoscopic dilation [46].

### Successful treatment of cap polyposis with infliximab [^114PmaK2]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Cap polyposis is a disorder characterized by bloody diarrhea with rectosigmoid polyps covered by a cap of fibropurulent exudate. The pathogenesis is unknown, but histological features suggest that mucosal prolapse may play a role. Drug therapies are usually unsuccessful, and treatment requires sigmoid resection or, if the disease recurs after initial surgical resection, panproctocolectomy. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with characteristic clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of cap polyposis. Investigations included normal anorectal manometry and defecography, without evidence of prolapse. The patient's disease was unresponsive to treatment with mesalamine, antibiotics, lidocaine enemas, and corticosteroids. One infusion of infliximab 5 mg/kg provided dramatic symptomatic improvement but minimal endoscopic or histological change. After 4 infliximab infusions at 8-week intervals, endoscopy of the rectum and sigmoid colon was normal, and biopsies showed complete histological resolution of the inflammatory process. Well-being with normal endoscopy and histology has been maintained at 38 months, without further treatment. It was concluded that infliximab is effective therapy for cap polyposis and avoids the requirement for surgery. No clinical evidence was obtained to support mucosal prolapse as a causative factor, but the response to infliximab suggests a role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

EORTC QLQ-C30

Domains referring to "diarrhea" and "constipation" were isolated. The greater the score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptoms domains was, the worse the outcome. The "diarrhea" score was analyzed by subtracting the score at each time point from the baseline. Each difference was then compared between the two groups. The equation was ScC30ti- ScC30t0. The lower the difference was the better the outcome. As shown at Fig. 3, the mean difference in the Synbiotics group remained negative at all time-points. Therefore, at all time-points the score was always lower than that at baseline, highlighting a postoperative improvement. The values reached statistical significance between the two groups when compared at 3 months and 6 months assessment time-points (-13.33 ± 5.45 vs. 4.04 ± 5.6, P = 0.04 and -19.1 ± 6.3 vs. 2.01 ± 5.45, P = 0.003, respectively). The same analysis was used for the "constipation" domain. However, no statistically significant change was observed (data not shown).

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

Rectal cancer survivorship — bowel dysfunction and ostomy care require structured assessment and supportive management. Patients with an ostomy can experience unique issues and should typically see an ostomy nurse periodically for stoma assessment and care and education regarding adapting to life with a stoma. Patients without an ostomy, especially with a low anastomosis, may have bowel dysfunction attributed to low anterior resection syndrome. Up to 50% of patients with rectal cancer report bowel dysfunction, which should, ideally, be assessed using a validated scale such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument or the low anterior resection syndrome score. Treatment is often empiric and may include fiber supplementation, antidiarrheals, and dietary adjustment, and a pilot dietary modification coaching intervention demonstrated a clinical benefit with a randomized, prospective trial ongoing.

Postoperative considerations — Crohn's disease (CD) after surgery: After surgery for Crohn's disease, patients should be considered for medical therapy to treat residual active disease or to maintain disease remission, with a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence (1B). After an ileocecectomy, endoscopic recurrence in the neoterminal ileum occurs in 70% to 90% at 1 year and by 3 years is ubiquitous; at 5 years, an estimated 50% have clinical recurrence and 25% experience surgical recurrence, and by 10 years surgical recurrence may reach 35%. Perioperative risk factors include age at diagnosis < 30 years, < 10 years between diagnosis and surgery, perianal disease, penetrating phenotype, 2 or more prior intestinal resections, and active tobacco use. In low-risk patients without ongoing active CD, pharmacologic prophylaxis is not typically recommended, although metronidazole or ornidazole can be considered; in general, metronidazole use should be limited to about 3 months. At 6 months postoperatively, low-risk patients should undergo ileocolonoscopic assessment using Rutgeerts scoring, which ranges from i0 to i4; asymptomatic patients with a Rutgeerts score < i2 should typically repeat ileocolonoscopy in 1 to 3 years, whereas scores ≥ i2 should prompt starting an anti-TNF with or without a thiopurine per gastroenterology management.

Clostridioides difficile infection — surgical burden, predictors, and outcomes: Approximately 1% of all patients with CDI and about 30% of patients with severe-complicated or fulminant disease require surgery, and retrospective studies have identified clinical factors that can potentially predict patients who are more likely to need surgery, including patients with electrolyte derangements, age greater than 60 years, peripheral vascular disease, or congestive heart failure; in addition, IBD is a significant risk factor for developing CDI and for requiring surgery, and steroids and immunomodulators have been shown to be independent risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with IBD and CDI, with patients with ulcerative colitis having almost double the odds of needing a colectomy in the setting of CDI (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.23–2.93). In terms of adjunctive therapy after surgery, the literature does not support a specific recommendation for continuing antibiotics after colectomy for CDI, and mortality rates following surgery for CDI are high and can range from 34% to 57%; however, several large, retrospective studies have reported improved survival for patients with C difficile colitis who underwent timely subtotal colectomy compared with medical management alone, including a recent systematic review of 510 patients demonstrating a survival advantage (pooled adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49–0.99) with subtotal abdominal colectomy compared with medical therapy, while long-term outcomes after subtotal colectomy for CDI remain poor with a mean survival of 18.1 months, a median survival of 3.2 months, and a low rate of restoring GI continuity (20%).

### Long-term bowel dysfunction and decline in quality of life following surgery for colon cancer: call for personalized screening and treatment [^11518nz1]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the differences in outcomes, personalized treatment after the different types of colon resections seems to be lacking. This may be caused by a lack of awareness among physicians regarding bowel function problems after colon resections. For the rectum resections, postoperative low anterior resection syndrome is receiving more and more attention, but postoperative bowel function problems after colectomies have not been widely investigated. In the current study, only 16.9% of the patients who underwent sigmoid colon resection use laxatives, whereas 31.1% had constipation. Similarly, treatment for fecal incontinence was uncommon. Only 3.7% of the patients who underwent right hemicolectomy were using an antidiarrheal, whereas no less than 6.6% experienced liquid incontinence more than once per month. As bile acid malabsorption is likely to play a role in liquid incontinence after right hemicolectomy, a bile acid sequestrant might relieve these complaints. However, less than 10% of the patients in this study who had liquid incontinence after right hemicolectomy reported using a bile acid sequestrant, a situation that leaves room for improvement.

All multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, and follow-up time, as these factors are well known to influence bowel functioning, also in the context of surgery for colon cancer.– The current study shows no effect of follow-up time on constipation and fecal incontinence. This is in contrast with the general consensus that the colon structurally adapts over time after surgery. These findings imply that prompt treatment of constipation and fecal incontinence is required because the complaints are not likely to resolve spontaneously and might even worsen as more time passes between surgery and follow-up. Concerning smoking, this study shows that smoking seems to be associated with more fecal incontinence after a resection for colon cancer. This might be related to the direct stimulating effect of nicotine on colonic motor activity. Finally, the current study provides evidence of a 3-fold increase in fecal incontinence in patients who previously received radiotherapy in the pelvic region for other conditions. This emphasizes the detrimental effect of radiotherapy on fecal incontinence, which has been attributed to structural changes in the irradiated tissue.

### The effects of preoperative intestinal dysbacteriosis on postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study [^114o7vWU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Intestinal dysbacteriosis has already existed in nearly a quarter of CRC patients before surgery. The severity of bacterial dysbiosis after surgery increases along with the degree of bacterial dysbiosis before surgery. This study indicates preoperative dysbacteriosis as an independent risk factor for postoperative diarrhoea, which further correlates with postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leakage. However, the contribution of preoperative dysbacteriosis to the occurrence of anastomotic leakage needs to be clarified in further studies.

### Outcome of segmental colonic resection for slow-transit constipation [^112CWtRg]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The standard surgical treatment for slow-transit constipation (STC) is subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. A segmental resection may serve the same purpose, but with a reduced risk of side-effects such as diarrhoea or incontinence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional results following segmental resection in a consecutive series of patients with STC.

Methods

Selection criteria included prolonged segmental transit on oral 111In-labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid scintigraphic transit study, and disabling symptoms resistant to medical therapy and treatment of outlet obstruction. Twenty-eight patients (26 women, median age 52 years) were treated with segmental resection and followed prospectively with a validated questionnaire.

Results

After a median of 50 (range 16–78) months, 23 patients were pleased with the outcome. The median (range) stool frequency increased from 1 (0–7) to 7 (0–63) per week (P < 0.001). The number of patients passing hard stools and straining excessively decreased (P = 0.016 and P = 0.041, respectively). The median incontinence score was unchanged. Rectal sensory thresholds were higher in patients in whom the treatment failed (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

With a symptomatic relief comparable to that after ileorectal anastomosis and less severe side-effects, segmental colectomy may be a better alternative for selected patients with STC. Thorough preoperative evaluation is important and impaired rectal sensation may predict a poor outcome.

Though diarrhea is the hallmark symptom of CDI it may not be present initially, possibly due to colonic dysmotility either from previous underlying conditions or possibly from the disease process itself.

This is especially important in surgical patients who may have a concomitant ileus. Therefore, in surgical patients it is important to have a high index of suspicion for the development of CDI.

### The effects of preoperative intestinal dysbacteriosis on postoperative recovery in colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective cohort study [^11638URh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postoperative observations and definition of complications

Clinical outcomes were total or surgical postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery. Total complications included pulmonary infections, urinary tract infections, fever of unknown origin (≥ 38.5 °C), and surgical complications. Surgical complications included surgical site infections (SSIs) and anastomotic leakage. SSIs included surgical incision infections, abdominal infections, and pelvic infections.

Infectious complications were described in accordance with the Centres for Disease Control Definitions. Patients with mild fever (≥ 37 °C) before discharge or prolonged ileus or other unusual abdominal complaints received chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans for evaluation of leakage, intraperitoneal infection, or pulmonary infection. Anastomotic leakage was defined according to the proposal by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer. CT with contrast enema was used in patients with a suspicious diagnosis of anastomotic leakage. A local collection of fluid with gas around the anastomosis was confirmed as leakage. If a patient had simultaneous infections of the same body cavity, for instance, anastomotic leakage and pelvic abscess in the proximity of the anastomosis, only one case was counted into surgical or total postoperative complications.

Postoperative symptoms or clinical features, such as early postoperative diarrhoea, and hypoalbuminemia, that might be associated with outcomes were also recorded. Early postoperative diarrhoea was defined as three or more unusually loose or liquid stools per day, occurring within 7 days after surgery. Postoperative hypoalbuminemia was defined as albumin < 30 g/L within 3 days after surgery. The postoperative length of hospital stay was calculated from the day of surgery to discharge. Patients were followed up through the outpatient clinic at 2 weeks after discharge and received a telephone follow-up again at 30 days after surgery to track their outcomes. All enrolled patients completed the follow-up procedure.

### Synbiotics and gastrointestinal function-related quality of life after elective colorectal cancer resection [^1172dBAs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current randomized study early postoperative synbiotics administration appeared to have a beneficial effect on postcolectomy gastrointestinal function, as that was indicated by the better GIQLI scores at all postoperative assessment time-points, as well as the significant amelioration of the symptom "diarrhea", as assessed by the respective EORTC QLQ-C30 domain. The beneficial action of probiotics supplementation in gastrointestinal disorders has been recognized. Restoration of gut balance, inhibition of the epithelial and mucosal adherence of pathogens, introduction of lower colonic pH favoring the growth of nonpathogenic species, and stimulation of immunity during or after antibiotic treatment through receptor competition may be related to the positive gastrointestinal traits and properties of pro-/synbiotics. In keeping with our results, the use of pro-/synbiotics to postoperative CRC patients has been reported to be beneficial in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, the first defecation time, abdominal pain and flatulence. Probiotics have been associated with a reduction and prevention of non-colectomy-related diarrheas.

In general, early postoperative oral nutrition is regarded as an essential part of fast track recovery after colorectal surgery. Food intake can stimulate gastrointestinal peristalsis in the early postoperative period, attenuates catabolism and potentially decreases infectious complications. Synbiotics may play an additional beneficial role on the context of fast track and enhanced recovery programs after colorectal surgery but definite suggestions are not currently plausible since no fast track protocols integrating the administration of synbiotics have been tried yet in the clinical practice.

The strength of our study lies at the repetitive assessment of patients at fixed assessment time-points and the use of validated questionnaires to objectify the patients' subjective symptomatology. Only one other group of investigators has utilized a general, non-specific HRQoL questionnaire in assessing probiotics effects at colectomized patients. Improvements in the functional outcome and/or HRQoL were observed in all groups after administration of probiotics, with the right colectomy and proctectomy groups mostly benefited.

Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A systematic review up to May 2020 identified 31 studies of alvimopan in colorectal surgery, of which 23 demonstrated a positive effect and 8 reported no effect; of the 6 randomized trials, 4 were positive and 2 showed no effect. Several RCTs and pooled post hoc analyses reported accelerated recovery of GI function with alvimopan 6- and 12-mg doses and a significantly shorter hospital LOS in the alvimopan 12-mg group for patients undergoing open surgery. A Cochrane review of 9 studies found alvimopan better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased GI transit time and constipation and that it was safe and efficacious in decreasing postoperative ileus, but studies were limited to open surgery patients without an ERP in place, and there have been no randomized trials after laparoscopic surgery.

Clinical manifestations

DPAU mainly occurs in children and teenagers, with a male to female ratio of 1.5. Most patients had undergone bowel resection surgery (mean age at surgery was 3.7 months). Because diagnosis of DPAU is often delayed, the exact onset of the disease may occur months or even years before diagnosis. According to the findings by Madre et al, DPAU was detected 39 months after surgery on average. Nearly all patients with DPAU present with bloody stools, most of which were concealed bloody stools and only a few were melena and visible rectal bleeding. Other manifestations include chronic anemia (61.2%), which is refractory to iron supplementation, diarrhea (40.4%), abdominal pain (36.4%), abdominal distention (20%), and other symptoms such as growth retardation and hypoproteinemia.

Preoperative interventions — preadmission counseling emphasize patient education and ileostomy-specific guidance. A preoperative discussion regarding clinical milestones and discharge criteria should typically be performed before surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Patients undergoing ileostomy creation should receive stoma teaching and counseling regarding how to avoid dehydration. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. As dehydration is the most common cause of readmission after ileostomy creation, counseling regarding dehydration avoidance is an important element of ERP. In a prospective study of 42 patients versus 168 historical controls, implementation of an ileostomy pathway in which patients were directly engaged in ostomy management, discharged with supplies for measuring input/output, and set up with visiting nurse services reduced the readmission rate for dehydration from 15.5% to 0% (p = 0.02).

### Synbiotics and gastrointestinal function-related quality of life after elective colorectal cancer resection [^112r1CqQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Synbiotics (combination of prebiotics and probiotics) may serve as a supportive dietary supplement-based strategy after colectomy for cancer. The potential benefits of early postoperative administration of synbiotics on the gastrointestinal function-related quality of life inpatients were explored.

Methods

Patients who underwent elective colectomy were prospectively enrolled and randomized to receive either synbiotics (n = 38) or placebo (n = 37) on the day they tolerated liquid diet and for 15 days thereafter. Primary endpoints were Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire assessments at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Secondary endpoints were functional bowel disorders ("diarrhea", "constipation") assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30.

Results

Patients under synbiotics had a better GIQLI "Global score" compared with those who received placebo [77 ± 1.67 vs. 71.36 ± 1.69, P = 0.01 (1 month); 77 ± 1.7 vs. 72.5 ± 1.73, P = 0.03 (3 months); 79.23 ± 1.82 vs. 72.75 ± 1.85, P = 0.01 (6 months)]. Multivariate linear mixed model analysis showed that synbiotics administration was the only independent significant factor for the "Global score" amelioration (b: 5.42, SE (b)1.8, 95%CI 1.78–9.1, P = 0.004). The EORTC QLQ-C30 "diarrhea" domain score differences from baseline were better after synbiotics administration after 3 (P = 0.04) and 6 months (P = 0.003). No significant effect on "constipation" scores was observed.

Conclusion

Synbiotics administration may have a beneficial effect on the postcolectomy gastrointestinal function.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^112RW9yN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biondo et al. interestingly, observed similar results when comparing patients undergoing emergency surgery for occluded CRC to patients with perforated CRC.

Long-term oncologic outcomes were analysed in the same studies: Zielinski and colleagues showed that, when adjusted by excluding the perioperative mortality, overall survival (OS) was similar for free faecal peritonitis, as compared to contained collection and in all perforated compared with non-perforated cases. At the opposite, the inclusion of the perioperative mortality dramatically increases the difference in terms of OS in case of free faecal peritonitis; however, at the multivariate analysis, perforation is not an independent factor for OS. Similar results were obtained by Biondo et al.

As a consequence, in case of perforation at the tumour site:
For right-sided perforation, a right colectomy should be performed. In case of poor general or adverse local conditions, a resection without anastomosis and terminal ileostomy should be performed.
For transverse/left-sided perforation: resection with anastomosis, with or without ileostomy, should be attempted. Hartmann's procedure might be considered, keeping in mind the low rate of stoma reversal. In case of perforation at a distant site from the tumour (generally the neoplasm is in the left colon and the perforation is found in the caecum), a subtotal colectomy should be attempted. The literature reports a better control of postoperative diarrhoea with resection of less than 10 cm of terminal ileum and a distant colon remnant above the peritoneal reflection of at least 10 cm of length.

The surgeon managing CRC perforation should decide whether to perform the intestinal anastomosis or to carry out a derivative stoma. There is no evidence of sound quality to guide evidence-based decisions, as specific studies mostly consider heterogeneous groups of perforated and obstructed cancer-related LBO. The rate of anastomotic leak (AL) in right colon resections varies from 0.5 to 4.6% in perforated emergency cases and should be compared with 0.5–1.4% reported for elective surgery; the AL rate after left colonic resection ranges from 3.5 to 30% in emergency versus 5–10% in elective cases.

As a general rule, principles of oncologic resection should be followed, always considering the importance of the medical comorbidities and of the septic status on the one side and the aim of a shortened uncomplicated postoperative course in order to allow oncologic staging completion and the start of chemotherapy programs, on the other side.

Symptoms of Bowel Dysfunction

The specific symptoms of bowel dysfunction occurring more often than weekly are shown in Figure 2 (statistics provided in Supplemental Table 2 at). One year after surgery, urgency and loose stools were significantly more common after right-sided resection (17% versus 11%, p = 0.01, and 32% versus 20%, p < 0.001), whereas leakage of flatulence was significantly more common after left-sided resection (30% versus 24%, p = 0.02).

FIGURE 2.
Bar charts of the specific symptoms of bowel dysfunction occurring more frequently than 1 time per week 1 and 3 y after right-sided or left-sided resection.

Three years after surgery, no differences between the types of resections were statistically significant except for loose stools, which were more common after right-sided resection (31% versus 20%, p < 0.001).

Differences Between Men and Women

Women generally reported worse bowel function. After 3 years, symptoms such as incontinence for flatus, as well as clustering and urgency, were significantly more common among women than men, regardless of resection type.

After right-sided resection, 24% of women and 16% of men reported incontinence for flatus (p = 0.02). After left-sided resection, the figures were 31% for women and 18% for men (p = 0.003). Clustering was reported by 21% of women after right-sided resection and by 23% after left-sided resection, whereas the corresponding figures for men were 12% and 14%, respectively (p = 0.006 and p = 0.04). Twice as many women reported urgency, irrespective of the resection type, 21% versus 10% (p < 0.001) after right-sided resection and 15% versus 8% (p = 0.04) after left-sided resection.

Few patients (< 10%) reported incontinence for stools with little difference between sexes and resection types. The only significant difference was noted 3 years after left-sided resection (9% women versus 3% men, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences between the sexes in terms of frequency of bowel movements or the occurrence of loose stools.

### Anterior resection syndrome [^113ZaqBH]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Up to 80% of patients with rectal cancer undergo sphincter-preserving surgery. It is widely accepted that up to 90% of such patients will subsequently have a change in bowel habit, ranging from increased bowel frequency to faecal incontinence or evacuatory dysfunction. This wide spectrum of symptoms after resection and reconstruction of the rectum has been termed anterior resection syndrome. Currently, no precise definition or causal mechanisms have been established. This disordered bowel function has a substantial negative effect on quality of life. Previous reviews have mainly focused on different colonic reconstructive configurations and their comparative effects on daily function and quality of life. The present Review explores the potential mechanisms underlying disturbed functions, as well as current, novel, and future treatment options.

Locally advanced rectal cancer — PROSPECT trial adverse events (AEs) and patient-reported outcomes show that severe AEs during neoadjuvant treatment were significantly more frequent with FOLFOX versus CRT with radiosensitizing fluoropyrimidine (5FUCRT), while severe diarrhea was significantly more common with 5FUCRT versus FOLFOX. Among the 47% who answered questionnaires at 12 months postsurgery, severe neuropathy was 8% versus 3% in 5FUCRT versus FOLFOX, compared to 5% versus 19% pre-surgery and 3% versus 5% at 18 months postsurgery; postsurgical neuropathy may have been influenced by adjuvant oxaliplatin–containing chemotherapy given to 78% (median eight cycles) and 75% (median six cycles) in 5FUCRT and FOLFOX groups. Previously reported data suggest long–term grade 3 to 4 neuropathy following oxaliplatin–containing chemotherapy is approximately 9% after a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, and there were no other significant differences between groups in AEs at 12 months. One year after surgery, AE rates had converged; health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data were collected for 61.8% and 83.3% provided PRO-CTCAE responses, with no significant difference in overall HRQOL, but FOLFOX had significantly improved change from baseline for sensation of incomplete bladder emptying and bowel function at 1–2 weeks before surgery and male sexual function at 12 and 24 months postsurgery.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old previously healthy, asymptomatic man initially presented for his first screening colonoscopy. At this time, a friable, partially obstructing tumor was encountered in his proximal rectum. Final workup demonstrated a mrT2N1M0 upper rectal cancer. The patient went on to successfully complete total neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and was taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated robotic-assisted low anterior resection with primary anastomosis. His final pathology revealed an ypT2N1M0 rectal cancer, and he was subsequently followed in surveillance per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. At long-term follow-up visits he continued to report significant depressive symptoms and functional impairment. Despite aggressive medical management with fiber supplementation and antidiarrheal medications, the patient continued to struggle with bowel movement frequency and urgency. He reported having 4 to 6 clustered bowel movements during the day and 1 to 2 stools at night that significantly limited his ability to perform normal day-to-day activities.

### Systematic review: the effect of right hemicolectomy for cancer on postoperative bowel function [^115KJE74]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Right-sided colon cancer accounts for approximately 30% of bowel cancer in women and 22% in men. Earlier detection by screening programmes and advances in adjuvant treatments, combined with improved patient selection, means that the proportion of people surviving bowel cancer in the UK has more than doubled in the last 40 years. Curative treatment for right-sided colonic cancer includes right hemicolectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.

Colonic resection can cause changes in bowel function which affect quality of life. However, the focus of follow-up remains on detecting recurrent cancer, and it is clear that many patients struggle with very difficult bowel function after treatment, yet few patients are referred for specialist help.

The impact of rectal surgery on gastrointestinal function is well established, but there is much less emphasis on the functional impact of right-sided resections. Right hemicolectomy involves the removal of the ileocaecal valve and a variable length of terminal ileum, both of which play an important role in maintaining normal gastrointestinal function.

The aims of this systematic review are to assess the impact of right hemicolectomy for cancer on bowel function and to identify any treatment modalities that exist for treating bowel dysfunction after right hemicolectomy.

### Synbiotics and gastrointestinal function-related quality of life after elective colorectal cancer resection [^115Y3wXE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Different types of colorectal resections were included in our study and this constitutes a potential limitation on deriving definitive conclusions on the accurate beneficial role of synbiotics on specific subsets of patients. Another limitation of our study is its complete clinical orientation in regards to outcome measures and the lack of any theoretical explanation that could be provided by associated laboratory or microbial assays. Albeit, it would be more compelling if supporting data regarding actual changes in the bowel microbiota had been included. It has been, though, sufficiently demonstrated that the use of probiotics after surgery has markedly improved intestinal microbial populations. Although local immune function restoration by synbiotics is easily conceivable, improvement infunctional state may not be fully explainable. An explanation could involve immune-mediated neural local and systemic mechanisms. Dendritic cells in the gastrointestinal tract are able to interact with commensal bacteria and the nerves embedded in the gut wall. The vagus nerve has an important role in signaling from the gut to the brain and can be stimulated by bacterial products or inflammatory cytokines. Synbiotics-induced modulation of vagal responses indirectly affecting the brain function itself may be speculated. Indeed, in our study, non-gastrointestinal GIQLI domains, such as emotional and social function were improved after synbiotics supplementation. Administration of a probiotic formulation has significantly attenuated psychological distress in human volunteers and reduced anxiety-induced behavior in a rat model.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Synbiotics are used as a supportive dietary supplement-based strategy in patients after colectomies for cancer
Synbiotics administration has been shown to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and flatulence in patients after colectomies for colorectal cancer
Improvement in the functional outcome of colectomized patients has been shown only by one group using a non-specific HRQoL questionnaire

What the new findings are:

Early postoperative synbiotics administration improved post-colectomy gastrointestinal function based on better GIQLI scores at all postoperative assessment time-points
The early administration of synbiotics in patients after colectomy for colorectal cancer led to significant amelioration of "diarrhea" based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire

Colon cancer survivorship — care plan and preventive care: The Panel recommends that a prescription for survivorship and transfer of care to the primary care physician be written, and the oncologist and primary care provider should have defined roles in the surveillance period, with roles communicated to the patient. The care plan should include an overall summary of treatments received, including surgeries, radiation treatments, and systemic therapies; the possible expected time to resolution of acute toxicities, long-term effects of treatment, and possible late sequelae of treatment should be described; and surveillance and health behavior recommendations should be part of the care plan. Disease preventive measures, such as immunizations; early disease detection through periodic screening for second primary cancers; and routine good medical care and monitoring are recommended, with additional health monitoring performed as indicated under the care of a primary care physician, and survivors are encouraged to maintain a therapeutic relationship with a primary care physician throughout their lifetime. Other recommendations include monitoring for late sequelae such as chronic diarrhea or incontinence, and common long-term problems include oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, body image issues (especially as related to an ostomy), and emotional or social distress; specific management interventions are described in a review, and a survivorship care plan for patients with CRC have been published.

Ileus Prevention

21. Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (ie, within 24 hours of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower GI surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean LOS in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

Endoscopy for fecal incontinence (FI) should be performed according to established screening guidelines and triggered by concerning symptoms, rather than as a routine diagnostic test for FI. Endoscopy should be performed according to established screening guidelines and in patients presenting with symptoms that warrant further evaluation (ie, changes in bowel habits, bleeding). Although colonoscopy rarely contributes to the diagnosis and management of FI, diarrhea is commonly observed in women with late-onset incontinence, and endoscopic evaluation may be warranted under these circumstances to rule out other pathology. Other symptoms of concern include bleeding, urgency, tenesmus, and mucus drainage that may be because of incontinence, colorectal cancer, or other serious pathology, and general screening recommendations should be followed for all other patients to exclude concomitant colorectal pathology that might require attention.

### Systematic review: the effect of right hemicolectomy for cancer on postoperative bowel function [^1147N6kr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Right-sided cancer accounts for approximately 30% of bowel cancer in women and 22% in men. Colonic resection can cause changes in bowel function which affect daily activity. The aims are to assess the impact of right hemicolectomy for cancer on bowel function and to identify useful treatment modalities for managing bowel dysfunction after right hemicolectomy.

Method

The review was conducted in line with PRISMA. Eligible studies evaluated the impact of right hemicolectomy on bowel function in those treated for colorectal neoplasia or assessed the effect of surgical technique or other intervention on bowel function after right hemicolectomy. Right hemicolectomy for inflammatory bowel disease or benign cases only were excluded. Articles were limited to studies on human subjects written in English published between January 2008 and December 2018.

Results

The searches identified 7531 articles. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, of which eight were cohort studies and one was a randomised trial. Loose stool, increased bowel frequency and/or nocturnal defaecation following right-sided colectomy occurs in approximately one in five patients. Some of these symptoms may improve spontaneously with time. Bile acid malabsorption and/or small bowel bacterial overgrowth may be the cause for chronic dysfunction. Some studies report that no or little difference in outcome between right-sided and rectal resections likely suggests poor function after right-sided resection.

Conclusion

Right hemicolectomy can result in changes to bowel function. Patients should be counselled preoperatively, and follow-up should be designed to identify and effectively treat significantly altered bowel function.

Risk factors for total postoperative complications

Logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for total postoperative complications. The following variables were found to be associated with total complications in univariate analysis: preoperative dysbacteriosis, early postoperative diarrhoea, postoperative hypoalbuminemia, intraoperative blood loss, and sex (P < 0.1, Additional file 1: Table 1). They were included for multivariate logistic regression. As to early postoperative diahhroea, only those that occurred before postoperative complications were included in the logistic regression. Finally, preoperative dysbacteriosis grade 3 (OR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.21–8.62, P = 0.019), early postoperative diarrhoea (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.43–5.81, P = 0.003), and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 2.95, 95% CI 1.24–7.02, P = 0.014) were indicated as independent risk factors for total complications, as shown in Table 4.

Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 h after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (i.e. within 24 h of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower gastrointestinal surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a two-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference 1.95, 95% CI 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean length of stay in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of gastrointestinal function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. While there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of probiotics in post-surgical colorectal cancer [^114VTL4i]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient recruitment

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients who were 18 years and above, diagnosed with colorectal cancer and planned for colorectal resection in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) from October 2016 to May 2018. We excluded patients, who received antibiotics or consumed pro/pre/synbiotics product two weeks prior to recruitment, patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, advanced metastasis, evidence of recent infections and nursing or pregnant women. The study protocol was approved by the institutional research ethics committee (UKM FPR.4/244/TRGS/2/2014/UKM/02/3) and was registered with the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (NCT03782428; retrospectively registered on 20th December 2018).

Clinical assessment of patient

Patients' clinical characteristics, including age, gender, smoking habits, comorbidities, cancer stage, tumour pathological subtype and site were identified. Patient infection status within six months intervention period was recorded including any reported case of acute gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, surgical site infection or required any antibiotic administration. Recruited patients were randomized through simple randomization into either treated with probiotic or placebo. Trial unblinding was done upon completion of data analysis. Patients who underwent chemotherapy during the six months intervention period were reviewed and chemotherapy induced diarrhoea were evaluated based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0).

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^117E3WVW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.

The creation of an ostomy is "an independent risk factor for a prolonged length of stay after colorectal surgery". Structured patient stoma education is reported to "significantly improve quality of life and psychosocial adjustment, reduce hospital length of stay, and reduce hospital costs", with a randomized trial indicating education "was most effective if undertaken in the preoperative period". Preoperative evaluation by an enterostomal therapist "was associated with significantly improved postoperative quality of life, reduced rates of postoperative complications, and improved patient independence regardless of stoma type", and studies "have confirmed the benefit of preoperative stoma education, specifically within an ERP". The guideline also states that "Counseling on dehydration avoidance is an important element of ERPs".

Patient 2

She was a white female, 54-year-old, with a history of Crohn's disease since the age of 22, when an acute appendicitis surgery happened. She had undergone other abdominal surgeries, in 1986 (removal of 45 + 5 cm of bowel and ileocecal resection, latero-lateral anastomosis), in 1990 (resection of 36 cm of residual bowel, right colon and transverse colon, end-to-end anastomosis), and in 2004 (ileo-colonic resection of 20 cm and surgical removal of an abscess). The first symptoms of diarrhea occurred after the last surgical operation, the patient started to use loperamide tablets (2 mg), up to four daily. In 2010, an entero-cutaneous fistula appeared; it was successfully treated with adalimumab (discontinued due to mild hypertransaminasemia) and hyperbaric therapy. In July 2015, a new surgical scraping was performed because of the re-emergence of the fistula, along with an ileo-colonic anastomosis resection and ileostomy. The patient received a histologic diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma, treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In January 2016, she returned to the hospital, due to a sepsis from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, an acute kidney injury and worsening of diarrhea (up to 10 bowel movements per day). On admittance, there was no abdominal pain. Weight = 42 Kg, Hb = 9.4 g/dl, CRP = 4.6 mg/dl, CDAI = 183. She was treated with parenteral feeding, antibiotic therapy (rifampicin and levofloxacin) and nabilone (1 mg per day), considering her severe malnutrition. She had watery stool and about 10 bowel movements per day. Concurrent medications included kaolin, loperamide (12 mg, daily) and nutritional supplement. After 3 months, nabilone was discontinued; she had only one bowel movement per day, without blood or mucus in the stools (weight = 45.5 kg). The symptoms did not reappear in the following three months. She had 4 bowel movements per day, with semi-solid stools, no evidence of blood or mucus. Weight = 45 kg. No adverse events were reported during and after nabilone treatment.

### Cap polyposis: further experience and review [^117Wfhbh]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cap polyposis is characterized by the presence of inflammatory polyps with a "cap" of granulation tissue. It may represent one end of a spectrum of conditions caused by chronic straining. This experience represents the second largest reported series of cap polyposis.

Methods

The case notes of all patients with histologically proven cap polyposis were reviewed retrospectively and clinicopathologic features identified. A MEDLINE search was performed from 1985 to 2002 using cap polyps, polyposis, and inflammatory polyp as key words and further hand search was undertaken of key references.

Results

Eleven cases (9 males; median age, 20 (range, 15–54 years) of cap polyposis were diagnosed between 1993 and 2002. The commonest presenting symptoms were rectal bleeding (82 percent) and mucous diarrhea (46 percent). Chronic straining at stool and constipation were noted in seven of these patients (64 percent). Digital rectal examinations revealed polypoidal masses in the rectum in four patients (36 percent). All patients underwent colonoscopy. The commonest site of involvement was in the lower rectum (82 percent). One patient had polyps in the sigmoid colon and one patient in the transverse colon. Of 11 patients, 2 defaulted follow-up after colonoscopy. Three patients with solitary polyps had complete resolution of symptoms after polypectomy and remained symptom-free at three-month follow-up. The remaining six patients had persistent symptoms and required surgical intervention. Four underwent anterior resection and were all symptom-free at median of 48 (range, 18–72) months after surgery. One patient had transanal excision of rectal polyps and had recurrence at three months after surgery. This patient refused further treatment and remains symptomatic to date. One patient presented with recurrence of polyps at the coloanal anastomosis soon after a pull-through procedure. Total colectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was performed and the patient was free of symptoms at four months after surgery.

Conclusions

Cap polyposis is eminently treatable with good long-term prognosis and function. Patients with solitary cap polyp respond well to endoscopic polypectomy. However, patients with multiple polyps and concurrent anorectal pathology require surgical resection.

### Bowel dysfunction after laparoscopic antireflux surgery: incidence, severity, and clinical course [^114R7Q4K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the incidence, severity, and clinical course of postoperative bowel dysfunction, primarily diarrhea, after laparoscopic antireflux surgery.

Methods

Patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery during January to December 1998 responded to a questionnaire about pre-existing and postoperative bowel symptoms, which included questions about the type of bowel dysfunction (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation), onset in relation to surgery, frequency, severity, duration, use of medical resources or diagnostic evaluations, and treatment outcome.

Results

Of the 109 patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery at our center during the study, 84 (77%) completed the survey. Thirty-six (43%) had no bowel dysfunction before or after surgery, whereas 29 (35%) had pre-existing bowel dysfunction. New bowel symptoms developed postoperatively in 30 patients (36%), including bloating in 16 (19%) and diarrhea in 15 (18%). Two thirds of the patients with new diarrhea developed it within 6 weeks after surgery. The severity of the diarrhea ranged from mild to debilitating; 4 had fecal incontinence. Most patients (13/15) with diarrhea had symptoms for ≥ 2 years following surgery. No patient was hospitalized, and only 2 patients reported temporary work loss.

Conclusion

Postoperative bowel dysfunction, namely diarrhea, is an important adverse effect of antireflux surgery. Awareness of this complication should lead to prompt recognition, effective management, and reduction in anxiety.

### Systematic review: the effect of right hemicolectomy for cancer on postoperative bowel function [^1177Gn7c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Only two studies investigated the effect of an intervention on postoperative bowel function. One focused on different types of anastomosis formation, whilst another investigated the effect of probiotic administration.

The ISOVANTI trial was a double-blind randomised trial comparing isoperistaltic with antiperistaltic ileocolic anastomoses in patients having laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. A total of 108 patients were included, with 54 randomised to each arm. The primary aim of the study was to compare the safety and feasibility of the two techniques, and the secondary endpoint was to assess long-term functional outcomes and quality of life at 12 months. Patients were interviewed and GIQLI Questionnaires were administered at 1, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Ten out of 51 (18.5%) patients in the isoperistaltic group reported diarrhoea (> 3 stools/day) compared with 16 out of 52 (29.6%) in the antiperistaltic group; this however did not reach statistical significance. After 1 year, the rate of chronic diarrhoea (defined as more than three liquid stools per day for a period of longer than 4 weeks) was 24% in the isoperistaltic group and 31.4% in the antiperistaltic group. The authors concluded that regardless of anastomosis type, patients demonstrated significant improvement in the quality of life postoperatively compared with their preoperative score (p < 0.001). Whilst chronic diarrhoea was noted, it was not correlated with a worse quality of life, which agrees with previous work.

Baseline characteristics

Among 184 patients undergoing sphincter preserving surgery for rectal cancer from 2010 to 2018, 115 patients were included in the study. Reasons for exclusion are described in Fig. 1. Baseline characteristics of patients included are described in Table 1. Tumor location was in the lower rectum (< 8 cm from the anal verge) in 68 (59%) of cases, with an average distance of 6.9 ± 3.1 cm from the anal verge. 109 (92%) patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation before surgery and a single patient underwent only chemotherapy. All patients underwent a low anterior resection with total meso-rectal excision (TME), with coloanal anastomosis performed in 38 (33%) of patients. A temporary protective ileostomy was performed in 110 (96%) patients. Surgical staging included 40 cases at stage 0/I, 38 cases at stage II, 36 cases at stage III and one case at stage IV. 23 (20%) patients had postoperative complications, most commonly anorectal strictures (14 patients). Other complications included small bowel obstruction (7 patients), pelvic abscess or anorectal fistula (2 patients) and impotence (2 patients). Thirty three (30%) patients received post-surgical adjuvant chemotherapy. Stoma reversal was performed following a normal rectal examination, rectoscopy and gastrografin enema, an average of 6 ± 4 months from initial surgery.

### Is evaluation by questionnaires sufficient to cover all aspects of bowel symptoms in rectal cancer patients after low anterior resection? [^114ANSzg]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

The aim of the study was to investigate whether bowel symptoms related to low anterior resection for rectal cancer can be sufficiently well evaluated by the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) questionnaire score or the ColoRectal Functional Outcome (COREFO) questionnaire compared with a stool diary.

Method

All patients underwent low anterior resection for rectal cancer. They were asked to fill out a stool diary, the LARS questionnaire and the COREFO questionnaire, at 1, 4, 6 and 12 months after low anterior resection or stoma closure. The main outcome measure was the amount of association (calculated by means of canonical correlation analysis) between items on anal incontinence for faeces, frequency of bowel movements, clustering of bowel movements, urgency and soiling.

Results

Ninety‐five patients were included. Items on anal incontinence for faeces and frequency of bowel movements were significantly correlated between the LARS questionnaire or the COREFO questionnaire, versus the stool diary, respectively. Items on soiling were significantly correlated between the COREFO questionnaire and the stool diary.

Conclusion

Although the LARS questionnaire and the COREFO questionnaire are reliable and valid for measuring low anterior resection syndrome after rectal cancer, our results show that there are no strong associations with the stool diary. Therefore, we can conclude that there is additional clinical information to be obtained from the stool diary. In order to evaluate all aspects of low anterior resection syndrome, we suggest the addition of a stool diary or a combination of different measurement methods during patient follow‐up.

### Consensus review of optimal perioperative care in colorectal surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) group recommendations… [^112uPuPh]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Mechanical bowel preparation can cause dehydration and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly in elderly patients. 14 Two recent large, multicenter RCTs15, 16 confirm the conclusions of earlier meta-analyses17–19 that bowel preparation is not beneficial in elective colonic surgery, and 2 smaller recent RCTs suggest that it increases the risk for anastomotic leak. 20, 21 Bucher et al20 included only left-sided colonic resections and demonstrated increased morbidity after routine bowel cleansing. A meta-analysis88 in 1995 showed that routine nasogastric decompression should be avoided after colorectal surgery since fever, atelectasis, and pneumonia are reduced in patients without a nasogastric tube. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis89 of 33 trials with more than 5000 patients confirmed this and also found earlier return of bowel function in patients when nasogastric decompression was avoided. following 3 to 4 days, leading to a 3- to 6-kg weight gain.

98, 99 Such regimens can delay the return of normal gastrointestinal function, 98 impair wound or anastomotic healing, and affect tissue oxygenation, leading to prolonged hospitalization. 99, 100 Several trials have compared restrictive and liberal fluid or sodium regimens. 98–102 The results are not uniform and comparison is difficult as administered volumes and electrolytes in both arms differed substantially, reflecting nonuniform standard practice. Meta-analyses109, 110 have demonstrated that the use of drains after colonic surgery does not reduce the incidence or severity of anastomotic leaks or other complications. Drainage of the pelvic cavity for 24 hours following low anterior resection is supported by the Dutch total mesorectal excision trial, 111 although this remains to be proven in RCTs specifically designed to answer this question.

The RCTs of early enteral or oral feeding vs "nil by mouth" conclude that there is no advantage of keeping patients fasted after elective gastrointestinal resection. 131–133 Early feeding reduced both the risk of infection and the length of hospital stay and was not associated with an increased risk of anastomotic dehiscence. However, the risk of vomiting increased in patients fed early, and in the absence of multimodal anti-ileus therapy, early feeding was associated with bloating, impaired pulmonary function, and delayed mobilization. 134, 135.

### Postoperative complications and outcomes after elective colon resection… [^114sXdqb]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The effect of complications, such as urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, and myocardial infarction, on these outcomes was comparatively small. Conclusions and Relevance Anastomotic leak has a large overall effect on 30-day clinical and economic outcomes after elective colon resection. The findings of our study support the adoption of a procedure-targeted approach to surgical quality improvement and describe a practical method for assessing complication effect. The primary predictor variables for our analysis were the presence or absence of the following index complications within 30 days after colorectal surgery: incisional SSI, bleeding, anastomotic leak, ileus, pneumonia, VTE, urinary tract infection, and myocardial infarction.

Based on the size of their risk-adjusted PAFs, ileus, pneumonia, and bleeding also demonstrated relatively large effects on the clinical outcomes of study population. Conversely, urinary tract infection, incisional SSI, and VTE all had estimated PAFs of less than 8% for both EOD and mortality, indicating that the effect of these complications on the physiologic outcomes of elective colon resection patients is relatively small. Anastomotic leak was also the complication that contributed the most to the incidence of reoperation and hospital readmission, while ileus was the complication with the largest overall effect on length of postoperative hospitalization. Also, we selected outcome measures based on the data that were available in ACS NSQIP and made no attempt to prioritize these measures.

Finally, by including organ/space SSI in our study definition of postoperative leak, our analysis may overestimate the frequency with which this complication has occurred in our study population. Our study identified anastomotic leak to be the complication with the greatest overall effect on 30-day clinical and economic outcomes after elective colon resection. Given the significant contribution of anastomotic leak to these outcomes and the relatively small effect of other complications that are currently targeted by CMS-endorsed process measures, the findings of our study provide strong support for the adoption of process and/or outcome measures that focus on this complication. Extension of the methods described in our analysis to other surgical populations will facilitate the development of a more targeted and thus more effective national approach to surgical quality improvement.

### Factors affecting early postoperative feeding following elective open colon resection… [^111asKCH]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

For all patients, immediate postoperative complications, the ability to tolerate early feeding, and length of hospitalization were recorded. Daily interviews and examinations of patients were performed with special attention to nausea, emesis, and other indications of intolerance of early postoperative diet. Patients who experienced 2 episodes of emesis underwent NG tube insertion. Any patient who initially tolerated early postoperative feeding, but returned to the hospital within 2 weeks of discharge with emesis that required bowel rest and intravenous hydration/nutrition, was defined as a hospital readmission. Five of these 16 patients required NG tube insertion. Their mean hospital stay was 7. 5 days; none were readmitted to the hospital. Eleven patients initially tolerated the early postoperative feeding protocol and were discharged home, but required later readmission due to emesis. Of these 11 patients, 6 required NG tube insertion.

Three patients required 2 or more readmissions owing to persistent ileus. The mean duration of rehospitalization was 4. 6 days. The overall length of stay for these 11 patients, inclusive of all admissions, was 9. 7 days. Including the length of hospitalization time for readmissions, the mean hospital stay for all 200 patients was 4. 2 days. Based on the assumption that smaller incisions and decreased bowel manipulation would produce less ileus, laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted colectomy provided evidence that early postoperative feeding could be tolerated without a significant increase in complications. This protocol was designed to take advantage of well-recognized differences between the average time of return of gastric, small-bowel, and colonic motor activity following laparotomy. Because gastric and small-bowel motility normally return within 48 hours of operation, postoperative feeding was started then.

Since colonic ileus generally lasts 3 to 5 days, solid food was given on POD 3. Oral liquids were routinely begun on POD 2 and a regular diet on POD
3. Patient-controlled analgesia using morphine was employed until POD 3 when oral narcotics were substituted. The 86. 5% overall success rate of the protocol is undeniable evidence that early postoperative feeding is safe and effective. The results also demonstrate that postoperative adynamic ileus is uncommonly so profound as to preclude early feeding and hospital discharge.

### Colorectal enhanced recovery after surgery… [^112BJB6J]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Laparoscopic approach, narcotic use, length of stay, 30-day readmission, ileus, and intra-abdominal infection and association between colorectal cancer diagnosis and these outcomes. Results. tubes and drains, opioid-sparing analgesia, and early mobilization and resumption of oral intake. 4–7 Enhanced recovery after surgery programs have been notably effective for reducing length of stay after elective colorectal surgery. 8–11 There is concern, however, that readmission rates may be higher using advanced recovery pathways. 8, 10. Intraoperative fluid management was at the discretion of the anesthesia provider. This protocol is used for all patients undergoing elective colorectal resections. Key to the success of the program are clear and consistent messages about expectations for patients regarding activity, diet, and pain management before, during, and after their hospital stay.

Postoperative goals are communicated each day with the patient and multidisciplinary care team, aiming for discharge by postoperative day 3, if deemed clinically safe. Discharge criteria remained unchanged from prior to program implementation: adequate pain control with oral analgesia, tolerance of a general diet, adequate fluid intake, nondistended abdomen, and either flatus or a bowel movement. Perioperative outcomes for all patients who underwent laparoscopic or open surgery are summarized in Table 2. Moreover, we have shown that in this setting, data assessment can be successfully executed to report and self-evaluate outcomes. Despite literature supporting that increased compliance with ERAS protocol improves outcomes, many studies do not measure this. 16, 21 We demonstrated compliance with the program, with a statistically significant increase in use of the laparoscopic approach, preoperative DVT prophylaxis, and regional anesthetics, with a complementary decreased narcotic use.

Because of the well-known effects of narcotics on postoperative bowel functional recovery, 22 we focused attention on this aspect of the protocol. In concordance with the literature, our LOS decreased overall from 6. 7 days prior to the protocol to
3. 7 days in 2012. 12, 23–25 The reduction in LOS was also notably observed within patients who underwent a laparoscopic procedure. Though some authors report that their decreased LOS comes at a cost of increased readmissions, 8, 10 in our study, there was no significant difference in readmission rates throughout the study period.
