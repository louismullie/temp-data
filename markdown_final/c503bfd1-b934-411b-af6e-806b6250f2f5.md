## Question

A 78-year-old man presents to the hospital because of shortness of breath and chest pain that started a few hours ago. 3 weeks ago he had surgery for a total hip replacement with a prosthesis. The patient was treated with prophylactic doses of low-weight heparin until he was discharged. He did not have a fever, expectoration, or any accompanying symptoms. He has a history of right leg deep vein thrombosis that occurred 5 years ago. His vital signs include: heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. There were no significant findings on the physical exam. Chest radiography was within normal limits. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pneumonia
B. Myocardial infarction
C. Pulmonary thromboembolism
D. Exacerbation of chronic lung disease

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 78-year-old man with recent total hip replacement, new onset dyspnea and chest pain, tachycardia, and a normal chest radiograph, and wants to determine the most likely diagnosis among pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and COPD exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and timing after surgery. Then, I should verify the key clinical features and what the normal chest X-ray does and does not exclude. Next, I will weigh each alternative diagnosis against the data, being careful not to jump to conclusions. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline immediate next steps and evidence support, while checking for pitfalls in early presentation or prophylaxis-related masking of symptoms.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and risk context. Recent major orthopedic surgery is a major venous thromboembolism risk, and total hip arthroplasty carries a nontrivial post-discharge symptomatic VTE risk despite standard prophylaxis, with meta-analytic data showing a pooled symptomatic VTE incidence around 0.53% prior to discharge and higher rates in the ensuing weeks after prophylaxis ends, particularly in hip replacement patients, which aligns with a 3-week post-op presentation window here [^111Bf34f] [^116iRhsB]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this establishes pretest probability, but I still need to check how the symptom pattern fits pulmonary embolism before concluding it's the diagnosis.

> Now, I should review the presenting symptoms. Sudden dyspnea and chest pain, particularly pleuritic in quality, in combination with tachycardia, are classic for pulmonary embolism, and a normal chest radiograph does not exclude PE; many PEs show no acute parenchymal abnormality early on, which means a normal CXR can't safely rule it out in this context [^116GX9uU]. Wait, let me verify — yes, large PEs can even be painless due to collateral perfusion, so the presence of pain does not argue against a central clot; I need to keep both large and small emboli in mind as I proceed [^116GX9uU].

> Next, I will examine alternative diagnoses against the clinical picture. For pneumonia, the absence of fever, cough, and sputum production and a normal chest radiograph substantially lower the likelihood; although some pneumonias can present atypically in older adults, the lack of respiratory signs and the normal CXR make this less compelling right now [^notfound]. For COPD exacerbation, the lack of chronic lung disease history and the absence of wheeze or other obstructive features on exam reduce plausibility; again, a normal chest film is less specific for excluding PE than for excluding COPD flare, but it still doesn't point toward a parenchymal obstructive process here [^notfound]. For acute coronary syndrome, I initially thought "typical" exertional chest pain argues strongly for MI, but wait, let me reconsider — exertional chest discomfort is typical for ACS, yet the story of new dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain after recent hip surgery with tachycardia is more characteristic of PE; the absence of ischemic ECG changes and the normal CXR don't confirm ACS either, and the universal definition requires serial high-sensitivity troponins plus clinical evidence of ischemia to diagnose MI, so I should not anchor prematurely on MI here [^114ejPnc] [^111da6uC].

> I should double-check risk factor interactions that could sway probability. Prior unprovoked DVT confers lifelong elevated VTE risk and is reflected in Wells-based pretest frameworks as a strong risk enhancer, and the timing after hip replacement — often 2–4 weeks post-op — coincides with a spike in symptomatic VTE events as prophylaxis ends, which further elevates suspicion for PE in this patient [^116GX9uU]. But wait, what if prophylaxis had continued longer? Even then, meta-analyses show that despite short-duration prophylaxis, symptomatic VTE still occurs in the early post-prophylaxis period, so extended prophylaxis reduces risk but does not eliminate late events, which fits this 3-week presentation [^116iRhsB].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary thromboembolism. The pretest probability is high given recent major orthopedic surgery, the timing after cessation of prophylaxis, and prior DVT. The symptom complex of sudden dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia is classic for PE. And the normal chest radiograph is consistent with PE, particularly early or non-massive emboli that do not cause infarction or effusion [^111Bf34f] [^116GX9uU]. I should confirm that the next diagnostic steps follow guideline-based pathways — typically D-dimer if low-to-intermediate probability or CT pulmonary angiography if high probability or D-dimer is positive, recognizing that clinical judgment in this case favors direct imaging given the high pretest probability and concerning features [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure the immediate workup is explicit. Hold on, I should verify the escalation plan: obtain an ECG to look for S1Q3T3 or new right heart strain, send baseline troponin and BNP because PE can elevate both and it helps with risk stratification, and arrange urgent CT pulmonary angiography or, if contraindicated, a ventilation–perfusion scan. Start empiric anticoagulation if imaging is delayed and PE is strongly suspected while awaiting results, in line with acute chest pain and PE rule-out principles in the emergency setting [^notfound]. Let me reconsider the initial MI bias — given the atypical features here and the strong PE signal, PE remains the leading diagnosis until proven otherwise, with ACS evaluation pursued in parallel based on troponins and ECG as indicated [^111da6uC].

The most likely diagnosis is **pulmonary embolism (PE)** [^116GX9uU] because the patient has classic risk factors (recent hip replacement [^111Bf34f], prior DVT) [^116GX9uU], a typical PE presentation (acute dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia) [^116GX9uU], and a normal chest X-ray [^notfound] that does not exclude PE. Immediate workup should include **D-dimer, CT pulmonary angiography** [^111da6uC], and **ECG** to confirm the diagnosis and guide urgent anticoagulation [^notfound].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale for inclusion** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| Pulmonary embolism (PE) | - Recent hip replacement surgery [^111Bf34f] <br/> - History of DVT [^116GX9uU] <br/> - Acute dyspnea and chest pain [^116GX9uU] <br/> - Tachycardia [^116GX9uU] <br/> - Normal chest X-ray [^notfound] | No strong exclusionary features; highly consistent with PE [^notfound] |
| Myocardial infarction (MI) | - Chest pain <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypertension | - No classic MI symptoms (e.g. diaphoresis, nausea) <br/> - Normal chest X-ray [^notfound] <br/> - No ECG changes mentioned [^notfound] |
| Pneumonia | - Shortness of breath <br/> - Chest pain | - No fever <br/> - No cough or sputum production <br/> - Normal chest X-ray [^notfound] |
| Exacerbation of chronic lung disease | - Shortness of breath <br/> - Chest pain | - No history of chronic lung disease <br/> - Normal chest X-ray [^notfound] |

## Clinical evidence supporting pulmonary embolism

- **Risk factors**: Recent hip replacement surgery [^111Bf34f] and history of DVT are significant risk factors for PE [^116GX9uU].
- **Clinical presentation**: Acute dyspnea, chest pain, and tachycardia are classic symptoms of PE [^116GX9uU].
- **Diagnostic imaging**: Normal chest X-ray does not exclude PE; CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for diagnosis [^notfound].
- **Incidence**: Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in approximately 0.53% of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty despite prophylaxis [^111Bf34f].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **D-dimer test**: High sensitivity for excluding PE in low-probability patients [^notfound].
- **CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)**: Gold standard for confirming PE [^notfound].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To assess for right heart strain or other cardiac abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **pulmonary embolism (PE)** [^notfound] given the patient's risk factors, clinical presentation, and normal chest X-ray. Immediate diagnostic workup — including a D-dimer test, CT pulmonary angiography, and an ECG — is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate anticoagulation therapy [^notfound].

### Transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic drivers of cardiac regeneration [^112KmRfL]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Following injury, many organs are capable of rapid regeneration of necrotic tissue to regain normal function. In contrast, the damaged heart typically replaces tissue with a collagen-rich scar, due to the limited regenerative capacity of its functional contractile cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, this regenerative capacity varies dramatically during development and between species. Furthermore, studies have shown that cardiac regeneration can be enhanced to return contractile function to the damaged heart following myocardial infarction (MI). In this review, we outline the proliferative capacity of CMs in utero, postnatally and in adulthood. We also describe the regenerative capacity of the heart following MI injury. Finally, we focus on the various therapeutic strategies that aim to augment cardiac regeneration in preclinical animal models. These include altering transcripts, microRNAs, extracellular matrix proteins and inducing metabolic rewiring. Together, these therapies aim to return function to the damaged heart and potentially improve the lives of the millions of heart failure patients currently suffering worldwide.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) during stress SPECT MPI — The definition is "Systematic tracking of stress SPECT MPI-related serious adverse events". The rationale states, "Occurrence of major complication related to stress testing is unusual and needs to be analyzed after the event. If appropriate, preventive measures need to be taken to avoid recurrence". The reporting period is "One calendar year". Data sources are "Practice or institution's written protocols for defining and tracking SAEs (standard of good quality) and Quality Committee meeting minutes (standard of excellent quality)". Exceptions note that geographically distinct sites with identical protocols and joint meetings may submit a single protocol and minutes, but "individual SAE logs must be provided for each nuclear laboratory within a practice or institution". The metric is dichotomous: "Measure numerator: Not applicable; dichotomous ('all or nothing') metric with respect to both the standard of good quality and the standard of excellent quality" and "Measure denominator: Not applicable; dichotomous metric". Standards are "Standard of good quality: Having a protocol for identifying intervals to define SAEs, and treatment measures undertaken for each SAE; and the patient's clinical outcome after each SAE". and "Standard of excellent quality: The site conducts regular Quality Committee meetings at least twice per year and has written documentation of root cause analysis of any interval SAEs and the development of any action plans made to mitigate future occurrences".

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Spatial multi-omic map of human myocardial infarction [^112MLDVU]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide 1. Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality 2. Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease.

### Biomimetic electromechanical stimulation to maintain adult myocardial slices in vitro [^117Rt7Ki]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In the beating heart in vivo, mechanical load plays an essential role in the regulation of acute and chronic cardiac performance. Despite the known interplay between mechanical load and cardiac function, the prolonged effects of physiological mechanical load on adult cardiac tissue in vitro remain under-investigated. A recent publication has highlighted the importance of continuous electromechanical stimulation for the long-term culture of myocardial slices. However, only a single preload was tested, and myocardial slices were electrically stimulated at substantially sub-physiological rates (0.2 Hz). A detailed characterisation of the structure, function and transcriptional properties of cultured myocardial slices was not conducted and the mechanisms regulating the preservation/dedifferentiation of myocardial slices in vitro remain unresolved. We investigated the role of biomimetic electromechanical stimulation with physiological preload to regulate the adult cardiac phenotype of myocardial slices in vitro and the gene set expression patterns involved. We used an inexpensive, simple and user-friendly platform that allows the maintenance and manipulation of adult myocardial slices in vitro. We and others observe significant dedifferentiation of myocardial slices produced from all species, with the fastest rates observed in slices produced from small mammals, such as rats. We therefore performed this study with freshly prepared rat myocardial slices and subjected them to different electromechanical stimulation protocols for 24 h. Optimised protocols were then applied to human heart failure myocardial slices for 24 h and healthy rabbit myocardial slices for 5 days (120 h).

### Short-duration prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after… [^116iRhsB]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by venography after hip or knee replacement remains high despite 7 to 10 days of anticoagulant prophylaxis. However, the risk of symptomatic events in such patients is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to provide reliable estimates of the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurring within 3 months of hip or knee replacement in patients who received short-duration anticoagulant prophylaxis. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from January1993 to March 2001, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies and conference abstracts, to identify prospective studies of patients undergoing hip or knee replacement who received short-duration prophylaxis. The postprophylaxis incidence of nonfatal venous thromboembolism was 2.

2%, and the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism was
0. 05%. The postprophylaxis incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was higher after hip than after knee replacement. In patients who undergo hip or knee replacement and receive short-duration anticoagulant prophylaxis, symptomatic nonfatal venous thromboembolism will occur in about 1 of 32 patients and fatal pulmonary embolism will occur in about 1 of 1000 patients within 3 months of the surgery. Although the prevalence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis is more than 2-fold higher after knee replacement than after hip replacement 7 to 10 days after surgery, in the subsequent 3 months, symptomatic venous thromboembolism is more likely to occur after hip replacement.

IN PATIENTS undergoing total hip or knee replacement, anticoagulant prophylaxis for at least 7 to 10 days is currently recommended with fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin or adjusted-dose warfarin. 1, 2 Although anticoagulant prophylaxis reduces the risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism by 50% to 70%, 1, 2 there is concern about the high prevalence of residual deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by venography in patients who receive short-duration prophylaxis. For example, in patients who receive short-duration LMWH, the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis is 16% after hip replacement, and 31% after knee replacement. 1 Consequently, some authorities advocate extended-duration anticoagulant prophylaxis for 4 to 5 weeks in such patients. 3–6 The argument.

Well-designed prospective studies that investigated short-duration prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement were unable to provide reliable estimates of the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism because of small patient samples. 9–12 Larger studies have methodological limitations because data on thromboembolic events were obtained retrospectively, 13–15 patients did not receive anticoagulant therapy, 16–18 the anticoagulant regimen was not specified, 13, 15 and the duration of prophylaxis was at least 3 weeks. 19 Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of methodologically rigorous prospective studies investigating short-duration anticoagulant prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement.

TTC staining to observe myocardial infarction area

By staining with TTC, the myocardial infarction areas of each group of rats were visualized (Fig. 1 A) and analyzed (Fig. 1 B). The results revealed that the myocardium in the Control and Sham groups exhibited a healthy red color without any signs of infarction, indicating a myocardial infarction area percentage of 0%. In contrast, the Model group displayed a significant expansion in the extent of myocardial infarction (p < 0.01), reaching a percentage of (18.18 ± 1.72)%. Notably, treatment with DFO resulted in a remarkable reduction in myocardial infarction area compared to the Model group (p < 0.01), demonstrating a percentage decrease to (8.87 ± 1.81)%.

HE staining to observe the pathological changes of myocardial tissue

The histological sections of myocardial tissues from each experimental group are presented in Fig. 2. In the Control group, myocardial fibers exhibited organized alignment with regular interstitial spaces, devoid of cellular edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, or hemorrhage. Compared to the Control group, the Sham group displayed no significant alterations in myocardial fiber arrangement; however, a slight increase in interstitial space width was observed without evident bleeding or inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast to both the Control and Sham groups, the Model group demonstrated disrupted organization and even rupture of myocardial fibers accompanied by significantly widened interstitial spaces along with pronounced hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration. Nevertheless, in comparison to the Model group, the DFO treatment exhibited partial restoration towards normalcy regarding myocardial fiber arrangement while still showing progressive widening of interstitial spaces and minimal bleeding alongside noticeable reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration.

### Direct cardiac effects of SGLT2 inhibitors [^111iVh4s]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, while there is still much to be understood about the various factors which determine how SGLT2i's affect cardiac cells, most research clearly demonstrates that direct cardiac effects of these SGLT2i can be observed, especially in pathological conditions, and that the effects are mediated by altered intracellular sodium. Obviously, more research is needed here to further understand SGLT2i's cellular mechanisms. It is hereby important to note that whereas cardiac effects of SGLT2i's were not always observed in all studies, they were almost always observed under pathological, stressed, conditions. This makes these observed cardiac cellular effects highly relevant for the understanding of underlying mechanisms in the clinical condition where SGLT2i's are only used in diseased patients.

### Hip replacement… [^1174G5To]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Risks Risks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all joint replacements. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death. Weight loss surgery before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes. Edema appears around the hip in the hours or days following the surgery. This swelling is typically at its maximum 7 days after the operation, then decreases and disappears over the course of weeks. Only 5% of patients still have swelling 6 months after the operation. Dislocation Dislocation is one of the most common complications. Hip prosthesis dislocation mostly occurs in the first three months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues.

The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the cut tissue is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used. Infection Infection is one of the most common causes for revision of a total hip replacement. A 2009 study found that the incidence of infection in primary hip replacement was 1% or less in the United States. Risk factors for infection include obesity, diabetes, smoking, immunosuppressive medications or diseases, history of infection and previous hip surgery. There is also an alternative called DAIR that is possible if the infection presents during the first month after primary surgery. In contrast to 1- or 2-stage revision surgery, DAIR involves replacing only the removable components while retaining the prosthesis itself. Also a thourough debridement of infected tissue is performed, antibiotics are administered and the treatment continous for at least 6–12 weeks.

The success rate of DAIR is approximately 75%, saving a lot of patients from more extensive surgery. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by six months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than six months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction. The perceived difference in limb length for a patient after surgery is a common cause for lawsuits against the healthcare provider. Fracture Intraoperative fractures may occur.

After surgery, bones with internal fixation devices in situ are at risk of periprosthetic fractures at the end of the implant, an area of relative mechanical stress. Post-operative femoral fractures are graded by the Vancouver classification. Vein thrombosis Venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery. Standard treatment with anticoagulants is for 7–10 days; however, treatment for 21+ days may be superior. Extended-duration anticoagulants may prevent VTE in people undergoing hip replacement surgery. Other research suggested that anticoagulants in otherwise healthy patients undergoing a so-called fast track protocol with hospital stays under five days, might only be necessary while in the hospital. Emerging evidence supports the use of aspirin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.

Utilization of molecular imaging has significantly advanced the field of cardiovascular medicine. In addition to the targets currently in use, novel targets are being developed, including those involved in the processes of myocardial metabolism, myocardial injury, cardiac neurotransmission, and interstitial dysregulation. Further development of these imaging targets may lead to improved characterization of disease processes and guide provision of individualized therapies.

### Heparin… [^111kUAVx]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Common side effects include bleeding, pain at the injection site, and low blood platelets. Serious side effects include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Greater care is needed in those with poor kidney function. Heparin is contraindicated for suspected cases of vaccine-induced pro-thrombotic immune thrombocytopenia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as heparin may further increase the risk of bleeding in an anti-PF4/heparin complex autoimmune manner, in favor of alternative anticoagulant medications. Medical use Heparin acts as an anticoagulant, preventing the formation of clots and extension of existing clots within the blood. Heparin itself does not break down clots that have already formed, instead, it prevents clot formation by inhibiting thrombin and other procoagulant serine proteases. Heparin is generally used for anticoagulation for the following conditions:

- Hemofiltration
- Indwelling central or peripheral venous catheters Heparin and its low-molecular-weight derivatives are effective in preventing deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli in people at risk, but no evidence indicates any one is more effective than the other in preventing mortality. In angiography, 2 to 5 units/mL of unfractionated heparin saline flush is used as a locking solution to prevent the clotting of blood in guidewires, sheaths, and catheters, thus preventing thrombus from dislodging from these devices into the circulatory system. Unfractionated heparin is used in hemodialysis. Compared to low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin does not have prolonged anticoagulation action after dialysis and is low cost. However, the short duration of action for heparin would require it to maintain continuous infusion to maintain its action.

Meanwhile, unfractionated heparin has higher risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Adverse effects A serious side-effect of heparin is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, caused by an immunological reaction that makes platelets a target of immunological response, resulting in the degradation of platelets, which causes thrombocytopenia. This condition is usually reversed on discontinuation, and in general can be avoided with the use of synthetic heparins. Not all patients with heparin antibodies will develop thrombocytopenia. Also, a benign form of thrombocytopenia is associated with early heparin use, which resolves without stopping heparin. Approximately one-third of patients with diagnosed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia will ultimately develop thrombotic complications. Two non-hemorrhagic side effects of heparin treatment are known. The first is an elevation of serum aminotransferase levels, which has been reported in as many as 80% of patients receiving heparin.

This abnormality is not associated with liver dysfunction, and it disappears after the drug is discontinued. Contraindications Heparin is contraindicated in those with risk of bleeding, severe liver disease, or severe hypertension. Antidote to heparin Protamine sulfate has been given to counteract the anticoagulant effect of heparin. It may be used in those who overdose on heparin or to reverse heparin's effect when it is no longer needed. With LMWH and fondaparinux, the risk of osteoporosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is reduced. Monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time is also not required and does not reflect the anticoagulant effect, as APTT is insensitive to alterations in factor Xa.

### Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging guidelines: instrumentation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation [^115vFKoW]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

SPECT instrumentation quality assurance and performance — This publication is designed to provide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) guidelines for conventional and novel Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and states that "The proper choice of equipment to acquire clinical data and a well-designed quality assurance (QA) program are both essential requirements for optimizing diagnostic accuracy and ensuring consistent, high-quality MPI". Because "this technology is rapidly evolving, detailed guidelines for QA testing do not yet exist for these new designs", the document notes that it "is not intended to replace manufacturers' recommendations" and that "the user is responsible for assessing and following vendor recommendations, and must devise acceptable QA standards specific to the camera design". Application and governance are explicitly defined: the imaging guidelines "should be applied clinically only after review and approval by qualified local institutional physicians and technologists", and "This document was approved for publication by the governing body of ASNC and was endorsed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI)". The update details content changes including that "The instrumentation quality assurance and performance section was updated with advances in novel detectors, novel cameras, and hybrid SPECT/computed tomography (CT) equipment", with acquisition protocols adding "new protocols added for MPI with semiconductor detector cameras", processing expanded to "iterative reconstruction and attenuation correction (AC)" with "reduced count density reconstruction techniques" and "reconstruction for solid state cameras", interpretation guidance for "dedicated cardiac cameras", and new sections on "myocardial blood flow with SPECT, stress-first/stress-only imaging, and patient centered MPI", while "The section on reporting of SPECT MPI has been removed and is now included in the new American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) reporting guideline document".

Imaging techniques in myocardial infarction — scope and viability assessment — are outlined with modality roles. This section addresses "only its role in the diagnosis and characterization of myocardial injury and MI", highlighting parameters such as "myocardial perfusion, myocyte viability, myocardial thickness, thickening and motion", and contrast kinetics indicating fibrosis or scar. "Commonly used imaging techniques in acute and prior MI are echocardiography, MPS using SPECT or PET, CMR, and possibly computed tomography (CT)". Notably, "only the radionuclide techniques provide a direct assessment of myocyte viability", whereas other techniques provide indirect assessments, including "the contractile response to dobutamine by echocardiography, or increased extracellular space… by CMR or CT".

Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury — clinical distinction emphasizes that Type 2 MI and myocardial injury are frequently encountered in clinical practice and both are related to a poor outcome, and that acute MI requires a rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values. Acute myocardial injury may also manifest such a pattern but if the injury is related to structural heart disease, the cTn values may be stable and unchanging; Type 2 MI and nonischemic myocardial injury may coexist, and abnormal cTn values in the setting of acute and/or chronic heart failure are often better categorized as a myocardial injury condition.

### Reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction [^115PaX3D]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Each year, around 240,000 people in England and Wales have an acute myocardial infarction. Of these, around half die within a month, many before reaching medical help. The likelihood of early and longer-term morbidity (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmias) and death is related to the extent of myocardial damage. Rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected muscle (reperfusion) limits the damage and improves the clinical outlook. Here we discuss different methods of achieving reperfusion in patients with myocardial infarction.

The current review outlines the multifocal mechanisms of reperfusion injury and focuses on understanding the potential role of each element and its contribution to the injury pattern inflicted upon the myocardium. We evaluate the spectrum of contemporary therapies that have been tested in an attempt to reduce myocardial injury. Finally, we explore promising innovative strategies targeting novel reperfusion injury pathways to protect ischemic myocardium during reperfusion.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111cqFtf]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is defined by elevated postoperative cardiac troponin concentrations that exceed the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit of the assay and are attributable to a presumed ischemic mechanism, with or without concomitant symptoms or signs. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery occurs in ≈20% of patients who have major inpatient surgery, and most are asymptomatic. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is independently and strongly associated with both short-term and long-term mortality, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, or imaging evidence of myocardial ischemia consistent with myocardial infarction. Consequently, surveillance of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is warranted in patients at high risk for perioperative cardiovascular complications. This scientific statement provides diagnostic criteria and reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. This scientific statement also presents surveillance strategies and treatment approaches.

### Implementing an early rule-out pathway for acute myocardial infarction in clinical practice [^112c9CuP]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition of myocardial infarction

The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction is a consensus statement endorsed by the world's major cardiovascular associations. Myocardial infarction is defined in those with symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia who have a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin concentration, with at least one measurement above the 99th centile.hs-cTn assays are recommended, and given that the 99th centile differs in men and women for all troponin assayssex-specific thresholds are recommended to ensure equity of care. The 99th centile is also influenced by age and presence of comorbidities, such as renal and heart failure, and this should be considered in patients with chronically elevated cardiac troponin concentrations.

The universal definition of myocardial infarction recognises five subtypes based on the underlying mechanism and clinical situation in which myocardial infarction occurs (table 1). Given the majority of these events are due to systemic or non-coronary conditions or arise in specific clinical situations, studies evaluating the performance of early rule-out pathways have focused on type 1 myocardial infarction. Patients presenting with a systemic condition that results in major haemodynamic compromise are unlikely to be considered for early discharge whether or not they have secondary myocardial ischaemia.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^114a3QxU]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Pathological characteristics of myocardial ischemia and infarction — MI is defined pathologically as myocardial cell death due to prolonged ischemia. Diminished cellular glycogen, relaxed myofibrils, and sarcolemmal disruption are the first ultrastructural changes and are seen as early as 10–15 minutes after the onset of ischemia, with mitochondrial abnormalities observed as early as 10 minutes after coronary occlusion by electron microscopy and being progressive. It can take hours before myocyte necrosis can be identified by postmortem examination in humans; in contrast to animal models, biochemical evidence of myocardial cell death due to apoptosis can be detected within 10 minutes of induced myocardial ischemia in association with myocyte death. Experimentally, necrosis progresses from the subendocardium to the subepicardium over several hours, and the time course may be prolonged by increased collateral flow, reduced determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, and intermittent occlusion/reperfusion, which can precondition the heart.

Complete knowledge of myocardial structure, metabolism, and function is crucial to understanding the response of the heart to injury such as ischemia. Increasingly, this type of knowledge is required at multiple levels, from that of the isolated myocyte to the functioning organism, to provide basic scientists and clinical investigators a common framework for translation of findings and information feedback. This article focuses on the utilization of imaging methods to assess myocardial viability in vivo. It discusses the advantages and pitfalls of different imaging techniques, with particular emphasis on available data in humans and large animal models. Because of their novelty and potential for accurate phenotyping of human pathophysiology, magnetic resonance modalities will be highlighted.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scar patterns — ischemic versus nonischemic are differentiated by distribution, where ischemic scar/fibrosis typically extends from the subendocardium toward the epicardium and nonischemic scar is located at the epicardium, mid‑wall, or right ventricular insertion points. These patterns are described as ischemic and nonischemic, with ischemic encompassing subendocardial, non‑transmural versus transmural involvement and nonischemic encountered at epicardium, mid‑wall, or insertion points of the right ventricle.

SPECT processing techniques and reconstruction — software modernization is advised, as many perceived shortcomings of myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging can be traced to outdated processing software and every laboratory should review their processing software and identify the opportunities to modernize. For reconstruction, filtered backprojection (FBP) has been the primary algorithm since the beginning of SPECT imaging and is prone to image artifacts such as the ramp filter artifact and noise amplification. Iterative reconstruction uses a stepwise approach, with the maximum likelihood/expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm most common, and ordered subsets expectation maximization has been used to accelerate MLEM reconstruction times.

### Exosomes and cardiac repair after myocardial infarction [^114e1JZk]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death among all cardiovascular diseases. The analysis of molecular mechanisms by which the ischemic myocardium initiates repair and remodeling indicates that secreted soluble factors are key players in communication to local and distant tissues, such as bone marrow. Recently, actively secreted membrane vesicles, including exosomes, are being recognized as new candidates with important roles in intercellular and tissue-level communication. In this review, we critically examine the emerging role of exosomes in local and distant microcommunication mechanisms after myocardial infarction. A comprehensive understanding of the role of exosomes in cardiac repair after myocardial infarction could bridge a major gap in knowledge of the repair mechanism after myocardial injury.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^111e9cgi]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence of myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and lower diagnostic thresholds into clinical practice is likely to result in a disproportionate increase in the number of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury compared with type 1 myocardial infarction, and may lead to diagnostic uncertainty with the potential for over treatment in patients who do not have acute coronary syndrome.

The majority of studies have not used high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and therefore may underrecognise the incidence of myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction. The largest reported registry to date was published by Baron et al, who assessed all patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to hospital in Sweden during 2011 (n = 20,138). All diagnoses were classified by the attending clinician, with 88.5% of patients classified as type 1 myocardial infarction and 7.1% as type 2 myocardial infarction. Of note, the frequency of diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction varied markedly between centres (0–13%), perhaps illustrating the challenge of consistently applying the current diagnostic classification. In studies which classified all patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations, the reported incidence of type 2 myocardial infarction varies between 2% and 37% in unselected hospitalised patients, and from 5% to 71% in patients attending the Emergency Department (table 2).

### Assessment of oxygen supply-demand imbalance and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the high-STEACS cluster randomized clinical trial [^115sx7rr]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Type 2 myocardial infarction occurs owing to multiple factors associated with myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance, which may confer different risks of adverse outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of different factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this secondary analysis of a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, 6096 patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction from June 10, 2013, to March 3, 2016, were identified, and the findings were reported on August 28, 2018. The trial enrolled consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction was adjudicated according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction and the primary factor associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance in type 2 myocardial infarction was defined. This secondary analysis was not prespecified. Statistical analysis was performed from July 7 to 30, 2020.

Intervention

Implementation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause death at 1 year according to the factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

Results

Of 6096 patients (2602 women [43%]; median age, 70 years [IQR, 58–80 years]), 4981 patients had type 1 myocardial infarction, and 1115 patients had type 2 myocardial infarction. The most common factor associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance was tachyarrhythmia (616 of 1115 [55%]), followed by hypoxemia (219 of 1115 [20%]), anemia (95 of 1115 [9%]), hypotension (89 of 1115 [8%]), severe hypertension (61 of 1115 [5%]), and coronary mechanisms (35 of 1115 [3%]). At 1 year, all-cause mortality occurred for 15% of patients (720 of 4981) with type 1 myocardial infarction and 23% of patients (285 of 1115) with type 2 myocardial infarction. Compared with patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, those with type 2 myocardial infarction owing to hypoxemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.35; 95% CI, 1.72–3.18) and anemia (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14–2.88) were at greatest risk of death, whereas those with type 2 myocardial infarction owing to tachyarrhythmia (aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65–1.06) or coronary mechanisms (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.17–3.86) were at similar risk of death as patients with type 1 myocardial infarction.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, mortality after type 2 myocardial infarction was associated with the underlying etiologic factor associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Most type 2 myocardial infarctions were associated with tachyarrhythmia, with better prognosis, whereas hypoxemia and anemia accounted for one-third of cases, with double the mortality of type 1 myocardial infarction. These differential outcomes should be considered by clinicians when determining which cases need to be managed if patient outcomes are to improve.

### Assessment of oxygen supply-demand imbalance and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the high-STEACS cluster randomized clinical trial [^117ADkCu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The initial management strategy for patients with type 2 myocardial infarction should primarily address the underlying factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Although patients with tachyarrhythmia had more favorable outcomes compared with those with type 1 myocardial infarction or type 2 myocardial infarction owing to a systemic illness, more than 1 in 10 patients with tachyarrhythmia had a further myocardial infarction or died owing to a cardiovascular factor at 1 year. This finding likely reflects the risk of complications from tachyarrhythmia, such as thromboembolism or structural heart disease. The use of antiarrhythmic therapies and anticoagulants could plausibly reduce this risk.

Although coronary mechanisms, such as spontaneous coronary artery dissection, embolism, or vasospasm, were the least prevalent etiologic factor associated with type 2 myocardial infarction, patients with these mechanisms comprise a distinct group. These patients are younger, with lower prevalence rates of comorbid conditions; most present with chest pain and substantially elevated cardiac troponin concentrations similar to those with type 1 myocardial infarction. They are initially managed similarly to patients with type 1 myocardial infarction and undergo emergency coronary angiography. Once the underlying coronary mechanism is defined during angiography, treatments necessarily diverge. The rationale for including these patients in the same category as patients with other factors associated with type 2 myocardial infarction has been questioned, with the current classification causing confusion among patients and clinicians.

In addition to considering the primary factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance, it is crucial to recognize that patients who have a type 2 myocardial infarction secondary to an acute illness may have more than 1 factor associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Our data support findings from Raphael et alsuggesting that patients with multiple etiologic factors are likely to have worse clinical outcomes. For example, a patient with sepsis from pneumonia may have hypoxia but will also often have tachycardia and hypotension, adding to the magnitude of the overall insult.

Although our knowledge of the clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction continues to evolve, we now require randomized clinical trials to determine the benefits or harms associated with investigation and treatment. Our findings have the potential to inform the selection of patients for future trials. These data suggest that the competing risk of noncardiovascular mortality associated with type 2 myocardial infarction is very likely to reduce the effectiveness of proposed cardiovascular interventions. The Appropriateness of Coronary Investigation in Myocardial Injury and Type 2 Myocardial Infarction (ACT-2) trial is a randomized evaluation of the role of early invasive or computed tomography coronary angiography vs conservative management in all-cause mortality in type 2 myocardial infarction.

### Chest pain… [^1167xazA]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Management of chest pain is based on the underlying cause. Initial treatment often includes the medications aspirin and nitroglycerin. The response to treatment does not usually indicate whether the pain is heart-related. When the cause is unclear, the person may be referred for further evaluation.
- **Prinzmetal's angina**: Chest pain is caused by coronary vasospasm. It is more common in women younger than 50 years and has associations with tobacco, cocaine, or triptan use. People usually complain of chest pain at rest that is unrelated to stress or exertion. It is often relieved by cessation of the offending drug and the administration of nitrates or calcium channel blockers.
- **Cocaine use**: This condition is suspected when people with few risk factors for arteriosclerosis present with non-traumatic chest pain. Ingestion of cocaine can lead to vasoconstriction of coronary arteries, thus producing chest pain similar to heart attack. Symptoms can appear within one hour of cocaine use.
- **Cardiac tamponade**: Cardiac tamponade occurs due to fluid accumulation in the pericardial space and typically presents with chest pain often accompanied by symptoms like dyspnea, hypotension, and pulsus paradoxus. Clinical signs include Beck's triad — hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds.
- **Bronchitis**: Bronchitis occurs due to inflammation of the bronchial tubes, often triggered by viral infections or irritants like smoke, leading to excessive mucus production and airway obstruction. Common symptoms include a productive cough, wheezing, mild chest discomfort, and fatigue.
- Pulmonary embolism: Common signs and symptoms are shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, blood in sputum during cough, and lower limb swelling. Risk factors includes: recent surgery, cancer, and bedridden state. Embolus source usually comes from venous thromboembolism.
- **Lung cancer**: Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and other constitutional symptoms are commonly seen in lung cancer.
- **Hiatus hernia**: A hiatal hernia occurs when a portion of the stomach pushes upward through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. While gastroesophageal reflux, presenting as heartburn and regurgitation, is the hallmark symptom, other manifestations such as dysphagia, epigastric or chest pain, and chronic iron deficiency anemia may also occur. Chest pain that radiates to one or both shoulders or arms, chest pain that occurs with physical activity, chest pain associated with nausea or vomiting, chest pain accompanied by diaphoresis or sweating, or chest pain described as "pressure, " has a higher likelihood of being related to acute coronary syndrome, or inadequate supply of blood to the heart muscle, but even without these symptoms chest pain may be a sign of acute coronary syndrome. In some cases, chest pain may not even be a symptom of an acute cardiac event.

An estimated 33% of persons with myocardial infarction in the United States do not present with chest pain, and carry a significantly higher mortality as a result of delayed treatment. In the emergency department the typical approach to chest pain involves ruling out the most dangerous causes: heart attack, pulmonary embolism, thoracic aortic dissection, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade. By elimination or confirmation of the most serious causes, a diagnosis of the origin of the pain may be made. Often, no definite cause will be found and reassurance is then provided. HEART score The HEART score stratifies individuals with chest pain into low-risk and high-risk groups. Based on the cumulative score and associated risk of an adverse cardiac event, it recommends either discharge or admission: HEART score. Cumulative score:

- **0–3**:

2. 5% risk of adverse cardiac event.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^111D5Phb]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Applying imaging in acute myocardial infarction — use, limits, and biomarker precedence: Imaging techniques can be useful in the diagnosis of acute MI by detecting wall motion abnormalities or loss of viable myocardium with elevated cardiac biomarkers, and demonstration of new loss of myocardial viability in the absence of nonischemic causes supports the diagnosis of MI. Normal function practically excludes significant MI, but a small MI cannot be ruled out; thus imaging is useful for early triage and discharge of suspected MI patients. However, if biomarkers have been measured at appropriate times and are normal, this excludes acute MI and takes precedence over the imaging criteria. Abnormal regional myocardial motion and thickening may be caused by acute MI, or by ≥ 1 of several other conditions.

### Significance testing as perverse probabilistic reasoning [^116QAYve]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

However, medical reasoning frequently requires going beyond syllogistic reasoning. For example, consider the following argument type:

Of course, given the premise (A ⇒ B), the truth of B does not, strictly speaking, imply the truth of A, hence the use of the term 'plausible' to denote an implication that falls short of certitude. Arguments of this kind, which have been aptly called 'weak syllogisms', are indispensable in everyday medical reasoning. For example, it is reasonable to assert that patients with appendicitis will have abdominal pain, and we accept abdominal pain as grounds for suspecting appendicitis, though logically there are numerous other possible explanations for abdominal pain. In a similar vein, consider these additional typical case vignettes and possible diagnoses:

- 45 year old homeless alcoholic man brought in by police with confusion, disorderly behavior, and breath smelling of alcohol. Diagnosis: Ethanol intoxication.

- 75 year old nursing home resident with known heart failure presents with confusion and shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals rales, 3+ lower extremity pitting edema, labored breathing. Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation.

- 55 year old male presents to ED with acute onset substernal chest pain. Diagnosis: Gastric reflux.

Most physicians quickly assign rough degrees of plausibility to these diagnoses. However, in these cases it is reasonable to entertain alternative diagnoses, for example in the first case other intoxicants, or meningitis; and in the second case pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction. In the third case the stated diagnosis is only weakly plausible, and most physicians would doubt it at least until other possibilities (for example myocardial ischemia) are ruled out. In each case, there is insufficient information to make a certain (that is logically deductive) diagnosis; nevertheless, we are accustomed to making judgements of plausibility.

### Cardiac imaging after myocardial infarction [^11188RtE]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

After myocardial infarction, optimal clinical management depends critically on cardiac imaging. Remodelling and heart failure, presence of inducible ischaemia, presence of dysfunctional viable myocardium, future risk of adverse events including risk of ventricular arrhythmias, need for anticoagulation, and other questions should be addressed by cardiac imaging. Strengths and weaknesses, recent developments, choice, and timing of the different non-invasive techniques are reviewed for this frequent clinical scenario.

Myocardial injury with cardiac procedures other than revascularization — cardiac procedures such as transcatheter valve interventions and ablation of arrhythmias may cause procedural myocardial injury that can be assessed by serial cardiac troponin (cTn) measurements, and increases of cTn values in this context should be considered as a procedural myocardial injury and not labeled as an MI unless the biomarker criteria and 1 of the ancillary criteria for acute myocardial ischemia listed for type 5 MI are present.

Age-specific event and 28-day case-fatality rates by age group

Rates are for patients admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction recorded during the first physician encounter or during subsequent physician encounters and patients for whom acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed only as a comorbidity. Results by sex are available in the appendix (p 1).

11 265 (23%) of 48 420 deaths within 28 days of being in hospital for acute myocardial infarction were certified to causes other than acute myocardial infarction, frequently chronic ischaemic heart diseases, other circulatory conditions, atherosclerotic heart disease, respiratory disorders, and cancer, whereas acute myocardial infarction was a contributing cause in 4460 (9%) of 48 420 deaths (figure 3).

The crude acute myocardial infarction event rate in people aged 35 years or older with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the first physician encounter, including fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction admissions and out-of-hospital deaths from acute myocardial infarction, was 288 cases (95% CI 287–289) per 100 000 people; the crude case-fatality rate was 356 deaths (354–358) per 1000 events. Figure 5 shows the effects of including diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction made in second or subsequent physician encounters and comorbid diagnoses on the national estimates of acute myocardial infarction event rate, case-fatality rate, hospitalised case fatality rate, and proportion of out-of-hospital deaths.

Figure 5
Effects of including different patient groups on national estimates of epidemiological parameters for acute myocardial infarction

Bars show the relative change in national acute myocardial infarction event rate, total case-fatality rate, hospitalised case-fatality rate, and proportion of out-of-hospital deaths with incremental inclusion of additional types of patients. All comparisons are relative to patients with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction recorded during the first physician encounter.

Our sensitivity analysis excluding patients aged 85 years and older resulted in a higher proportion of acute myocardial infarction deaths not preceded by any admission (51 291 [55%] of 93 012 deaths) than in our main analyses (69 460 [51%] of 135 950 deaths). However, the proportion of deaths occurring after an admission for a cause other than acute myocardial infarction admission or after a comorbid acute myocardial infarction admission (21 575 [23%] of 93 012 deaths) remained roughly equal to the proportion occurring after an admission for acute myocardial infarction (20 146 [22%] of 93 012 deaths; appendix p 4).

### Unrecognized myocardial infarction [^1124Ty7j]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This review addresses myocardial infarctions that escape clinical recognition. It focuses on the prevalence, predisposing factors, and prognosis of these unrecognized infarctions, and incorporates data from relevant epidemiologic studies, basic science investigations, and review articles. These data indicate that at least one fourth of all myocardial infarctions are clinically unrecognized. The demographic characteristics and coronary risk factor profiles of persons with previously unrecognized myocardial infarctions appear to be similar to those of persons whose infarctions are clinically detected. Impaired symptom perception may contribute to lack of recognition, but both patients' and physicians' perceptions about the risk for myocardial infarction may also play an important role. Finally, mortality rates after unrecognized and recognized myocardial infarction are similar. Given the public health implications of unrecognized myocardial infarction, future studies should address screening strategies, risk stratification after detection of previously unrecognized myocardial infarction, and the role of standard postinfarction therapies in affected patients.

14.1 Myocardial Infarction

The study supporting the approval of metoprolol post-myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality was conducted before the reperfusion era. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 1395 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to LOPRESSOR or placebo. LOPRESSOR reduced 3-month cardiovascular mortality by 36%.

Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of LOPRESSOR or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with LOPRESSOR or placebo was continued for 3 months. The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the LOPRESSOR - and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with LOPRESSOR, there were comparable reductions in 3- month cardiovascular mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with LOPRESSOR and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.

### Primary noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium from the morphogenetic standpoint [^111fJTEk]. Pediatric Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

This review compiles the current knowledge of normal and abnormal myocardial morphogenesis to facilitate an unambiguous diagnosis of primary myocardial noncompaction. During the early stages of development, the formation of trabeculae with the resulting increase in myocardial surface is a adaptation of the rapidly growing heart to improve nourishment by exchange diffusion from the cardiac lumen. Once the coronary vasculature has developed, the switch to cardiac nutrient supply through active circulation from the subepicardial space is paralleled by gradual compaction of the myocardial trabeculae. This results in a decrease of the inner, trabeculated myocardial layer with a parallel increase in thickness of the outer, compact myocardial layer. Similar to the direction of coronary arterial development, this process proceeds from the epicardium toward the endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Based on developmental data, congenital myocardial noncompaction represents a failure of normal embryonic myocardial maturation. The time of arrest of this process will determine the extension of myocardial noncompaction within the ventricle. Whereas disturbances of myocardial microcirculation are frequent in these hearts, direct communications between the myocardial cavity and the coronary arteries (sinusoids) do not belong to this morphogenetic entity.

### Reducing myocardial infarct size: challenges and future opportunities [^116wfvB3]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Despite prompt reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), the mortality and morbidity of patients presenting with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remain significant with 9% death and 10% heart failure at 1 year. In these patients, one important neglected therapeutic target is 'myocardial reperfusion injury', a term given to the cardiomyocyte death and microvascular dysfunction which occurs on reperfusing ischaemic myocardium. A number of cardioprotective therapies (both mechanical and pharmacological), which are known to target myocardial reperfusion injury, have been shown to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size in small proof-of-concept clinical studies — however, being able to demonstrate improved clinical outcomes has been elusive. In this article, we review the challenges facing clinical cardioprotection research, and highlight future therapies for reducing MI size and preventing heart failure in patients presenting with STEMI at risk of myocardial reperfusion injury.

### Transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic drivers of cardiac regeneration [^117B28Ch]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Following injury, many organs are capable of rapid regeneration of necrotic tissue to regain normal function. In contrast, the damaged heart typically replaces tissue with a collagen-rich scar, due to the limited regenerative capacity of its functional contractile cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, this regenerative capacity varies dramatically during development and between species. Furthermore, studies have shown that cardiac regeneration can be enhanced to return contractile function to the damaged heart following myocardial infarction (MI). In this review, we outline the proliferative capacity of CMs in utero, postnatally and in adulthood. We also describe the regenerative capacity of the heart following MI injury. Finally, we focus on the various therapeutic strategies that aim to augment cardiac regeneration in preclinical animal models. These include altering transcripts, microRNAs, extracellular matrix proteins and inducing metabolic rewiring. Together, these therapies aim to return function to the damaged heart and potentially improve the lives of the millions of heart failure patients currently suffering worldwide.

Study Selection Reports of incidence of symptomatic postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis before hospital discharge in patients who received VTE prophylaxis with either a low-molecular-weight heparin or a subcutaneous factor Xa inhibitor or oral direct inhibitor of factors Xa or IIa. Results The analysis included 44 844 cases provided by 47 studies. The pooled rates of symptomatic postoperative VTE before hospital discharge were 1. 09% for patients undergoing TPKA and
0. 53% for those undergoing TPHA. Systematic prophylaxis of VTE has been implemented for more than 20 years, 4 supported by numerous guidelines. 3, 4, 6–10 For example, low-molecular-weight heparin, a proven efficacious prophylactic therapy, has been increasingly used since 1995.

11 More recently, other efficacious prophylactic therapies have been studied, including indirect and direct inhibitors of factors Xa and IIa.
12. Accordingly, there is a need to fully understand the risk of symptomatic VTE when appropriate prophylactic therapy is given perioperatively. In this systematic review, we establish a contemporary literature-based estimate of symptomatic VTE event rates prior to hospital discharge in patients undergoing total or partial hip arthroplasty, and total or partial knee arthroplasty who received recommended VTE prophylaxis during their hospitalization. We searched studies that reported symptomatic postoperative DVT, pulmonary embolism, or both that occurred during the hospital stay in adult patients undergoing TPKA, TPHA, or both who received recommended VTE prophylaxis. We followed the PRISMA statement for conduct and reporting of systematic reviews. 13.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^115ZaBH4]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of a specific cardiac biomarker to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction and the increasing frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury poses challenges to clinicians in practice on a daily basis. As observed in this trial, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are responsible for almost half of all elevations in cardiac troponin concentration, and have been shown to be more frequent than type 1 myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients over the age of 75. Less than half of these patients are referred to cardiology, with the majority managed by general physicians, and a lack of evidence has led to inconsistency in investigation and treatment.

The classification of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury is based on expert consensus, and to date no prospective clinical trials have evaluated the utility of this classification. These conditions arise because of a wide range of pathologies including coronary or structural heart disease, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and many noncardiac conditions. The latest guidance, requiring evidence of myocardial ischemia and oxygen supply-demand imbalance, has reduced the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction. Our observations add to previous studies suggesting that any myocardial injury is prognostically important, irrespective of whether myocardial ischemia was present, but strategies to guide further investigation and treatment in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction require prospective evaluation.

### Cardiac muscle membrane stabilization in myocardial reperfusion injury [^111WiBSn]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Overview: Cardiac Muscle Membrane Integrity and Heart Performance

Cardiac muscle membrane instability is a hallmark of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. It is well-documented that in the very earliest moments of reperfusion cardiac myocytes swell markedly due to significant myoplasmic osmolyte accumulation during the ischemic period. Myocyte swelling, along with myocyte contracture, exerts a severe stress on the cardiac membrane (sarcolemma), leading to membrane tears, pores, blebs, and instability. Loss in the primary barrier function of the cardiac membrane leads to catastrophic outcomes in terms of overall myocyte viability and function. It follows that preserving cardiac sarcolemma integrity in I/R holds promise for enhancing cardiac muscle viability thus improving overall heart function during reperfusion (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Health Relevance

Clinically relevant pathways to cardiac reperfusion injury with focus on cardiac membrane instability and the novel use of synthetic membrane stabilizers. CPR = cardiopulmonary resuscitation; MI = myocardial infarction.

Myocardial I/R causes millions of deaths per year, underscoring the urgency for detailed understanding. There are multiple pathological pathways to cardiac reperfusion injury; nonetheless, in the face of this complexity, a key unifying component of I/R injury centers on cardiac muscle membrane instability. In cardiac I/R, sarcolemmal rupture and necrotic cell death are well documented in the critical minutes of reperfusion after an ischemic event. Whereas the pathways leading to cardiac I/R injury are multifold and complex, we and others have established a sound premise that a clear approach for a clinically meaningful treatment would be one that would directly enhance cardiac membrane stability in I/R. Given that cardiac sarcolemma damage is a well-established hallmark of I/R injury, it is surprising this has received relatively little direct investigation as a possible target for I/R treatment development.

### New myocyte formation in the adult heart: endogenous sources and therapeutic implications [^111Uyswo]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Death of adult cardiac myocytes and supportive tissues resulting from cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction is the proximal driver of pathological ventricular remodeling that often culminates in heart failure. Unfortunately, no currently available therapeutic barring heart transplantation can directly replenish myocytes lost from the injured heart. For decades, the field has struggled to define the intrinsic capacity and cellular sources for endogenous myocyte turnover in pursuing more innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at regenerating the injured heart. Although controversy persists to this day as to the best therapeutic regenerative strategy to use, a growing consensus has been reached that the very limited capacity for new myocyte formation in the adult mammalian heart is because of proliferation of existing cardiac myocytes but not because of the activity of an endogenous progenitor cell source of some sort. Hence, future therapeutic approaches should take into consideration the fundamental biology of myocyte renewal in designing strategies to potentially replenish these cells in the injured heart.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^111R1Rvr]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) — The clinical definition of MI denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. Myocardial injury is defined by an elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) value, is frequently encountered clinically, and is associated with an adverse prognosis, and although myocardial injury is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of MI, it is also an entity in itself. To establish a diagnosis of MI, criteria in addition to abnormal biomarkers are required; for patients with increased cTn values, clinicians must distinguish whether patients have suffered a nonischemic myocardial injury or one of the MI subtypes, because nonischemic myocardial injury may arise secondary to many cardiac conditions such as myocarditis, or may be associated with noncardiac conditions such as renal failure. If there is no evidence to support the presence of myocardial ischemia, a diagnosis of myocardial injury should be made, and this diagnosis can be changed if subsequent evaluation indicates criteria for MI.

### A 56-year-old woman with breathlessness [^115rCtyB]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Answer: B

The correct answer is methylprednisolone. Echocardiography demonstrated an apical mass with obliteration of the left ventricular apex and extensive apical late gadolinium enhancement confirmed on CMR. Left ventricular function was preserved with no evidence of thrombus formation (see online supplementary movies 1 and 2). In combination with the clinical presentation, these findings were suggestive of acute eosinophilic myocarditis with an apical eosinophilic infiltrate. Myeloperoxidase immunofluorescence pointed towards a unifying diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome). This acute presentation differs from the 'classical' subacute appearance on CMR where there is usually ventricular thinning with superimposed endocardial thrombus. The first-line treatment is immunosuppression with methylprednisolone.

Figure 1
(A) Two-chamber echocardiogram. (B) Four-chamber steady-state free precession cardiac MRI. (C) Phase-sensitive inversion recovery cardiac MRI following gadolinium contrast.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome with cardiac involvement has been characterised in three stages: an acute necrotic stage with eosinophilic infiltration, a subacute phase with thrombus formation overlying the disrupted endocardium and chronic fibrotic progression to a restrictive cardiomyopathy. In the acute stage, medical therapy for chronic systolic heart failure is not indicated in the context of preserved left ventricular function. Antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of bacterial infection. Endocardiectomy with preservation of the atrioventricular valve apparatus is advocated for advanced endomyocardial fibrosis to reduce ventricular filling pressures; however, it is not warranted during the acute phase. Primary ICD therapy is not indicated in the absence of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. After 12 months of treatment, she had fully recovered with resolution of her peripheral eosinophilia and cardiac findings. Eosinophilic myocarditis has a high mortality rate, but early identification and treatment can lead to a regression of fulminant myocardial necrosis.

1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems

The physician should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thromboembolic thrombotic disorders as discussed below. Should any of these occur or be suspected the drug should be discontinued immediately.

a. Myocardial Infarction

An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six. The risk is very low under the age of 30.

Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older, with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and nonsmokers over the age of 40 (Figure 1) among women who use oral contraceptives.

### Cell proliferation fate mapping reveals regional cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activity in subendocardial muscle of left ventricle [^112mKv56]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac regeneration involves the generation of new cardiomyocytes from cycling cardiomyocytes. Understanding cell-cycle activity of pre-existing cardiomyocytes provides valuable information to heart repair and regeneration. However, the anatomical locations and in situ dynamics of cycling cardiomyocytes remain unclear. Here we develop a genetic approach for a temporally seamless recording of cardiomyocyte-specific cell-cycle activity in vivo. We find that the majority of cycling cardiomyocytes are positioned in the subendocardial muscle of the left ventricle, especially in the papillary muscles. Clonal analysis revealed that a subset of cycling cardiomyocytes have undergone cell division. Myocardial infarction and cardiac pressure overload induce regional patterns of cycling cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity requires the Hippo pathway effector YAP. These genetic fate-mapping studies advance our basic understanding of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity and generation in cardiac homeostasis, repair, and regeneration.

### Epicardial outgrowth inhibition leads to compensatory mesothelial outflow tract collar and abnormal cardiac septation and coronary formation [^1159jTg7]. Circulation Research (2000). Low credibility.

In the present study, we investigated the modulatory role of the epicardium in myocardial and coronary development. Epicardial cell tracing experiments have shown that epicardium-derived cells are the source of interstitial myocardial fibroblasts, cushion mesenchyme, and smooth muscle cells. Epicardial outgrowth inhibition studies show abnormalities of the compact myocardial layer, myocardialization of cushion tissue, looping, septation, and coronary vascular formation. Lack of epicardial spreading is partly compensated by mesothelial outgrowth over the conotruncal region. Heterospecific epicardial transplant is able to partially rescue the myocardial development, as well as septation and coronary formation.

### Performance of the GRACE 2.0 score in patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction [^116MKoUF]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary heart disease is responsible for around 2 million deaths across Europe every year. To improve prognostication and promote consistency in the investigation and management of patients with acute coronary syndrome, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score was developed. The score applies clinical variables, the electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers to estimate risk of future all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. The use of the GRACE 2.0 score in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome has a class Ia recommendation for guiding prognosis and IIa recommendation for guiding management across all international guidelines.

Since the introduction of the GRACE score, there have been significant changes in the way we diagnose myocardial infarction, driven by major improvements in the sensitivity of cardiac troponin. The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays and a sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold for myocardial injury and infarction. These assays have the ability to quantify myocardial injury at a threshold 10-fold lower than was in use at the time of the original GRACE study. This increase in diagnostic sensitivity has led to an understanding that myocardial infarction can occur in a number of different clinical settings.

The Fourth Universal Definition recognizes myocardial infarction may occur due to atheromatous plaque rupture and thrombosis (type 1 myocardial infarction), or secondary to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or demand without coronary atherothrombosis (type 2 myocardial infarction). Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are older and more often have comorbidities and are at higher risk of adverse outcomes with as few as 30% of patients alive at 5 years. Despite a significant increase in risk of non-cardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction appear to have a similar risk of future cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. To date, there are no validated prognostic tools to estimate all-cause mortality or future cardiovascular events in this population. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the GRACE 2.0 score for the prediction of all-cause death in patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction.

### Mechanisms of cardiac repair and regeneration [^111aczrh]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular regenerative therapies are pursued on both basic and translational levels. Although efficacy and value of cell therapy for myocardial regeneration can be debated, there is a consensus that profound deficits in mechanistic understanding limit advances, optimization, and implementation. In collaboration with the TACTICS (Transnational Alliance for Regenerative Therapies in Cardiovascular Syndromes), this review overviews several pivotal aspects of biological processes impinging on cardiac maintenance, repair, and regeneration. The goal of summarizing current mechanistic understanding is to prompt innovative directions for fundamental studies delineating cellular reparative and regenerative processes. Empowering myocardial regenerative interventions, whether dependent on endogenous processes or exogenously delivered repair agents, ultimately depends on mastering mechanisms and novel strategies that take advantage of rather than being limited by inherent myocardial biology.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Management narrative for myocardial involvement with COVID‑19 — "Management of patients with myocardial involvement in the setting of COVID-19 is primarily dictated by the clinical presentation and course", and "a proactive management plan should be in place". Asymptomatic myocardial involvement "has been reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection", and it is "reasonable to manage these individuals expectantly, with instruction to share any worrisome symptoms or signs (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, edema) should they occur". For symptomatic myocardial involvement, "The treatment approach… greatly depends upon the patient's clinical presentation, as well as the severity of abnormalities noted on testing", and "patients who have chest pain as their only symptom, preserved LV systolic function, and no ventricular arrhythmias can likely be managed in the ambulatory setting with close monitoring for worrisome symptoms".

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113cMaa7]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Myocarditis — diagnosis and classification emphasize that myocarditis requires histological or immunohistological confirmation by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), surgical heart specimens, or an autopsy, yet it is often suspected clinically but infrequently confirmed by biopsy and in many cases rests on compatible clinical scenarios with noninvasive biomarker and imaging features rather than a pathological diagnosis; when myocarditis is suspected and EMB is infeasible or not clearly indicated, noninvasive diagnostic criteria can be used to diagnose suspected or probable acute myocarditis, with a recent definition including heart failure (HF) of < 3 months' duration associated with otherwise unexplained elevation in troponin or electrocardiographic features of cardiac injury, and new wall motion abnormalities, a pericardial effusion on echocardiography, or characteristic tissue features on MRI strengthen the diagnosis.

### Machine learning for diagnosis of myocardial infarction using cardiac troponin concentrations [^1133nWcj]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Given that the features that inform diagnosis differ for ruling in and ruling out myocardial infarction, we developed separate models for those with and without myocardial injury at presentation. Here, myocardial injury was defined as a cardiac troponin I concentration above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit (16 ng l −1 in women and 34 ng l −1 in men) on the first measurement. Furthermore, given that practice guidelines recommend diagnostic pathways that use a single measure of cardiac troponin to rule in or rule out myocardial infarction, we also trained these models separately using the first cardiac troponin measurement alone and then, incorporating the second serial measurement at a flexible time point, resulting in four separate models for each method. For all models in the derivation cohort, we multiply imputed 10 datasets to account for missing dataand performed 10 iterations of 10-fold crossvalidation to compute a score (0–100) that corresponded to an individual patient's probability of having myocardial infarction.

We then identified the scores that would classify the highest proportion of patients as high or low probability at prespecified performance criteria for rule in (80% positive predictive value and 80% specificity) myocardial infarction in those with myocardial injury and to rule out (99.5% negative predictive value and 90% sensitivity) myocardial infarction in those without myocardial injury. These criteria were based on prior analysis and an international survey of acceptable risk by physicians. It is important to highlight that these performance criteria are for the evaluation of scores separately in patients with and without myocardial injury at presentation. When these scores are applied to all patients with possible myocardial infarction, higher sensitivity and specificity would be anticipated and required in practice.

The model with the best discrimination in those without myocardial injury at presentation that identified the largest proportion of patients as low probability according to our prespecified performance criteria was selected and integrated into our CoDE-ACS clinical decision support system.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^114PaYoV]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence for chest pain first aid — The use of EMS transportation is associated with a substantial reduction in ischemic time and treatment delays compared with transportation by personal vehicle, and in 1 study, ≈1 in 300 patients with chest pain transported to the ED by private vehicle had a cardiac arrest en route. Two observational studies with a total of 2122 patients with acute myocardial infarction demonstrated higher survival with early administration (median, 1.6 hours from pain onset) of aspirin by health care professionals compared with late administration (median, 3.5 hours from pain onset), and one observational study with 1200 patients demonstrated higher survival at 1 year with early compared with late administration. These same studies found no significant difference in the risk of complications from early as opposed to late aspirin administration, and if there are potential contraindications to the use of aspirin by the lay first aid provider, it is reasonable not to encourage aspirin use while awaiting the arrival of EMS.

### Hypoxia in myocardial infarction and natriuretic peptides [^1132hwoD]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

About 40 years ago, the isolation and characterisation of natriuretic peptides from the heart profoundly changed our perspective of this organ. 20 years earlier, a cell biology article had been published that showed that mammalian heart atria had small granules near atrial nuclei which, the authors concluded, were 'presumably secretory in nature'. Strong cardiovascular effects (natriuresis and diuresis) of the A-type and then B-type natriuretic peptides revealed that the heart was also an endocrine organand the granules were the source of natriuretic peptides. This discovery provoked tremendous scientific activity in cardiology: the search term 'natriuretic peptide' identified more than 48 000 articles in the PubMed database in December 2024. However, there has been a failure to truly capitalise on natriuretic peptides and their derivatives in diagnosing and following up cardiac diseases. These issues stem from the fact that the results achieved on the cardiac cell physiology of natriuretic peptides have not been fully implemented, and, therefore, interpretations of their measurements in diverse cardiac conditions have varied. Nonetheless, their use has been increasing in other medical branches.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^115ZLu9Y]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging — diagnostic capabilities in myocardial infarction: The high tissue contrast and resolution of CMR provides an accurate assessment of myocardial structure and function and, although less commonly used in the acute setting, it has similar capabilities to echocardiography in suspected MI. Paramagnetic contrast agents can assess myocardial perfusion and the increase in extracellular space associated with fibrosis of prior MI (detected by LGE-CMR), with localized delay in contrast enhancement able to detect even small areas of subendocardial MI, thought to be as little as 1 g; CMR also identifies myocardial edema/inflammation, allowing distinction of acute versus chronic injury.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction — Class I recommendations state that aggressive attempts should be made to treat heart failure (HF) in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to prior myocardial infarction (MI) and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and aggressive attempts should be made to treat myocardial ischemia in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Coronary revascularization is indicated to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) when direct, clear evidence of acute myocardial ischemia immediately precedes the onset of VF. If coronary revascularization cannot be carried out and there is evidence of prior MI and significant LV dysfunction, the primary therapy of patients resuscitated from VF should be the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in those receiving chronic optimal medical therapy with a reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y. ICD therapy is recommended for primary prevention to reduce total mortality by a reduction in SCD in patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 d post-MI, have an LVEF less than or equal to 30% to 40%, are New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III, are receiving chronic optimal medical therapy, and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y. The ICD is effective therapy to reduce mortality by a reduction in SCD in patients who present with hemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), are receiving chronic optimal medical therapy, and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y.

### Cardiac structure and function in patients with schizophrenia taking antipsychotic drugs: an MRI study [^11679ydy]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Our findings are in keeping with previous studies examining relationships between interstitial myocardial fibrosis and broader myocardial structure and function in the general population and in systemic inflammatory disease states such as rheumatoid arthiritis. These studies, after controlling for metabolic syndrome diagnoses, observe an inverse relationship between myocardial fibrosis and end-diastolic volumes and LV mass. In preclinical models of aging, the mechanism underlying reductions in LV mass in the context of fibrosis seem to relate to myocardial collagen fibre deposition and myocyte cell death occurring at a greater rate than concomitant hypertrophy in remaining myoctes. Reductions in end diastolic volumes are thought to be a consequence of the accumulation of collagen within the myocardium impacting its elasticity and limiting torsional recoil and ventricular suction.

Compared with the general population, people with schizophrenia are both twice as likely to have a diagnosis of CVD, and die as a consequence of CVD. Thus, the overall findings of this study, compatible with early diffuse myocardial fibrosis and/or sub-clinical myocardial inflammation in medicated patients with schizophrenia even in the absence of metabolic disease, could have significant clinical implications. For example, in various cardiac disease states, including non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular pathology, myocardial fibrosis independently predicts both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. If antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia is indeed associated with a myocardial fibrotic process, then establishing the mechanism of these myocardial tissue alterations could potentially lead to identification of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce mortality rates in schizophrenia.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116oEi4E]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of dilated cardiomyopathy — dilated cardiomyopathy is an important cause of heart failure with a common phenotype of ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance, and its pathogenesis varies significantly across metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, rheumatologic, infiltrative, genetic, infectious, and cardiotoxin causes. Demographics and treatment also vary significantly according to the cause. Treatment should be individualized and should target the underlying cause, in addition to the standard systolic heart failure therapies. In certain cases, with elimination of the cause and the appropriate treatment, reversal of myocardial remodeling and recovery of cardiac dysfunction can occur. Future studies targeting specific cardiomyopathies will be critical for detection and treatment of specific cardiomyopathies.

### Cardiac molecular imaging [^116h64Kv]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Molecular imaging enables the visualization and interrogation of specific biologic targets and pathways that precede or underlie changes in morphology, physiology, and function of the heart. Accordingly, it aims at identifying precursors or early stages of cardiac disease, and it may facilitate monitoring and guidance of novel, increasingly specific and versatile cardiovascular therapies. Although SPECT and PET imaging of myocardial metabolism and autonomic innervation are already embedded in clinical practice, various additional targets, probes, and techniques are under development. These techniques hold promise to become a future key in personalizing cardiovascular care.

99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP interpretation — begin with visual assessment of planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images to confirm diffuse myocardial uptake and exclude nonmyocardial sources; if excess blood pool activity is noted, repeat SPECT at 3 h. If myocardial tracer uptake is visually present on SPECT, proceed to semi-quantitative visual grading; if no myocardial tracer uptake is present on SPECT, the visual grade is 0. Grade 0 is no myocardial uptake with normal bone uptake, grade 1 is myocardial uptake less than rib uptake, grade 2 is myocardial uptake equal to rib uptake, and grade 3 is myocardial uptake greater than rib uptake with mild/absent rib uptake. For heart/contralateral lung (H/CL) assessment, draw a circular ROI over the anterior heart and mirror it over the contralateral chest above the diaphragm, then calculate H/CL as the fraction of heart ROI mean counts to contralateral lung ROI mean counts. An H/CL ratio of ≥ 1.5 at 1 h can accurately identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis if myocardial PYP uptake is visually confirmed on SPECT and systemic AL amyloidosis is excluded; an H/CL ratio of ≥ 1.3 at 3 h can identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. Diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis cannot be made solely based on H/CL ratio with PYP and is not recommended if there is absence of myocardial uptake on SPECT; if the visual grade is 2 or 3, a diagnosis is confirmed and H/CL assessment is not necessary, though it may help classify equivocal grade 1 vs 2. Grade 2 or Grade 3 uptake is consistent with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis if a monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia is excluded, as this degree of uptake can be seen in > 20% of patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis; Grade 0 and Grade 1 uptake may be observed in AL cardiac amyloidosis and warrants further evaluation to exclude AL amyloidosis, emphasizing serum immunofixation and a serum free light-chains assay in all patients with suspected amyloidosis. 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP uptake could also be seen in pericarditis, myocardial infarction (regional uptake), and chemotherapy or drug-associated myocardial toxicity.

### Frequency, associated variables, and outcomes of acute myocardial injury according to the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^111Gsikk]. European Stroke Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings provide an estimate of the burden and outcome of acute myocardial injury after AIS. According to the 4th UDMI, acute myocardial injury is present in a relevant proportion of patients with AIS and associated with a two- to threefold increase of in-hospital mortality. These findings support recommendations that serial hs-cTn measurements should be applied for timely identification of ongoing myocardial involvement after stroke. Our results may inform the design of future studies investigating the burden of post-stroke cardiac complications and the underlying pathways leading to acute myocardial injury after AIS.

### Pulmonary embolism… [^116GX9uU]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery, lower leg exercises during periods of sitting, and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery. Treatment is with anticoagulant medications such as heparin, warfarin, or one of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants. These are recommended to be taken for at least three months. However, treatment using low-molecular-weight heparin is not recommended for those at high risk of bleeding or those with renal failure. Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator given intravenously or through a catheter, and some may require surgery. If blood thinners are not appropriate or safe to use, a temporary vena cava filter may be used.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms of pulmonary embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or many of the following: dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain of a "pleuritic" nature, cough and hemoptysis. As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation, they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions, but not hypoxia, dyspnea, or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and fainting, but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs.

Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs are often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels.
- Those that undergo orthopedic surgery at or below the hip without prophylaxis.
- This is due to immobility during or after the surgery, as well as venous damage during the surgery.
- Pancreatic and colon cancer patients
- This is due to the release of procoagulants.
- The risk of VTE is at its greatest during diagnosis and treatment but lowers in remission. There are additional prediction rules for PE, such as the Geneva rule. More importantly, the use of any rule is associated with reduction in recurrent thromboembolism. The Wells score:

People in this low-risk category without any of these criteria may undergo no further testing for PE: low oxygen saturations – SaO₂ < 95%, unilateral leg swelling, coughing up blood, prior DVT or PE, recent surgery or trauma, age > 50, hormone use, fast heart rate. The rationale behind this decision is that further testing may cause more harm than the risk of PE. Prevention Pulmonary embolism may be preventable in those with risk factors. People admitted to the hospital may receive preventative medication, including unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux, and anti-thrombosis stockings to reduce the risk of a DVT in the leg that could dislodge and migrate to the lungs. Following the completion of anticoagulation in those with prior PE, long-term aspirin is useful to prevent recurrence. Treatment Anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment.
