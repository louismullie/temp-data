## Question

At which spinal cord level can an injury lead to autonomic dysreflexia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at which spinal cord level an injury can lead to autonomic dysreflexia [^114bh72B] [^111PVLmL]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiological basis and the relevant sympathetic outflow anatomy. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence quantifying risk by neurological level. Next, I will examine the apparent T5 versus T6 discrepancy and resolve it. After that, I should define the consensus clinical threshold used in studies and guidelines. Finally, I will consider variables that modify risk and the practical implications for monitoring and management [^112h8gNY] [^116dRtK1].

> Let me first confirm what autonomic dysreflexia is and why the injury level matters: AD is a life-threatening hypertensive surge triggered by noxious stimuli below the lesion due to unopposed sympathetic reflexes from preserved spinal circuits with loss of descending inhibitory control; the cardiac vagus remains intact, producing bradycardia that cannot fully counter the massive vasoconstriction, especially in the splanchnic bed, leading to severe hypertension and end-organ risk [^111peMN3] [^113F5Jyf].

> I need to check the relevant neuroanatomy next; the splanchnic vascular bed is the main resistance and capacitance reservoir for blood pressure control and receives sympathetic outflow from thoracic segments roughly T5–T12, so injuries that disconnect supraspinal control rostral to this outflow permit unchecked reflex sympathetic discharge from afferent stimuli below the lesion, a prerequisite for AD physiology [^111peMN3] [^115ofPMk].

> Now, I will examine the clinical evidence by level; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I verify multiple data sets: large prospective urodynamics cohorts consistently show that lesions at T6 or above have markedly higher odds of AD compared with T7 or below (OR about 5.5), with greater SBP rises and bradycardic responses, and this persists after adjustment for confounders, while multiple clinical series and trials operationalize the risk group as "at or above T6" or "above T6" for inclusion and monitoring [^111PVLmL] [^114bPdFX] [^113SdkZj] [^112h8gNY] [^1132WFNC].

> Wait, let me verify historical and specialty literature alignment; indeed, physical medicine and rehabilitation, surgical, and peri-procedural sources all describe AD as occurring in patients with spinal cord lesions above the splanchnic outflow, practically denoted as T6, reinforcing T6 as the working threshold in clinical communication and perioperative risk stratification [^114bh72B] [^113BcDGs] [^113DN1t6].

> But wait, what about that T5 mention; hmm, wait a minute, one source explicitly states AD "only occurs with lesions above the level of sympathetic outflow to the splanchnic vascular bed" and labels this as the fifth thoracic level, which initially suggests T5 as the anatomical boundary, but I should double-check whether that anatomical upper bound alters the clinical cutoff used in studies and practice [^111peMN3].

> Hold on, I should verify how to reconcile this; the anatomical statement about the rostral extent of splanchnic outflow including T5 is correct, yet the clinical inflection point for AD risk in cohorts, trials, and case series is consistently defined as T6 or above, with risk sharply higher at T6 compared to T7 and standard operationalization in research and procedural protocols using T6 to demarcate those requiring AD monitoring and prophylaxis, so the consensus clinical threshold remains T6 despite acknowledgment that "above T6" (i.e. T5+) is a more conservative phrasing some may adopt [^111PVLmL] [^114bPdFX] [^113SdkZj].

> Let me think about the practical bottom line; I should confirm the standard answer: a spinal cord injury at or above T6 creates the neuroanatomical substrate and observed clinical risk for autonomic dysreflexia, with very high prevalence among individuals with tetraplegia and high paraplegia, frequently triggered by bladder or bowel stimuli, and associated with large, rapid BP surges that warrant immediate recognition and treatment [^111PVLmL] [^111peMN3].

> Next, I should review terminology and clinical application; injuries "at or above T6" should be managed as AD-risk with education, home BP monitoring, and procedure-specific precautions, and during urodynamics or other invasive procedures, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored and bladder drainage optimized, with escalation of pharmacologic management if AD persists despite drainage per urologic guidelines [^116dRtK1] [^116HUfeo].

> I will now examine modifiers of risk and phenotype; completeness of injury, higher neurological level, detrusor overactivity, high detrusor pressures, and indwelling catheter use correlate with greater AD severity, and during provoked testing (e.g., urodynamics), T6+ and motor complete injuries exhibit larger SBP rises and vagal slowing, while bladder-focused interventions like intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA can reduce bladder-related AD burden in selected patients [^113SdkZj] [^111jNBSS] [^112h8gNY] [^117By4Kw].

> Finally, let me reconsider the central question to ensure no gaps: despite the anatomical note that the splanchnic sympathetic outflow reaches as rostral as T5, the evidence-based, consistently applied clinical threshold for AD risk is spinal cord injury at or above T6, and patients at or above this level should be presumed at risk and managed accordingly in both everyday care and procedural settings [^111peMN3] [^111PVLmL] [^116dRtK1] [^114bh72B].

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in spinal cord injuries at or above the T6 level, with the highest risk in cervical and upper thoracic lesions [^113tMWUC] [^115ofPMk]. Injuries below T6 rarely cause AD because descending sympathetic control to the splanchnic bed is preserved [^111peMN3] [^117PsxJe]. The risk and severity of AD increase with higher lesion levels and completeness of injury [^113SdkZj], and it can be triggered by noxious stimuli below the lesion, especially bladder or bowel distension [^112h8gNY] [^1132WFNC].

---

## Anatomical basis of autonomic dysreflexia

- **Sympathetic outflow**: The sympathetic nervous system originates from the thoracolumbar spinal cord (T1-L2), with major splanchnic sympathetic outflow from T5-T6 [^111peMN3].

- **Descending control**: Supraspinal pathways modulate sympathetic activity; lesions above T6 disrupt this control, causing unopposed sympathetic reflexes [^117PsxJe].

- **Splanchnic bed**: The splanchnic vascular bed is a key resistance and capacitance region for blood pressure regulation; loss of descending control above T6 predisposes to AD [^111peMN3].

---

## Clinical evidence for injury level and autonomic dysreflexia

Multiple studies and clinical guidelines consistently identify **T6 as the critical level** above which AD occurs:

- **Urodynamics**: A prospective cohort showed lesions at T6 or above had significantly higher odds of AD during urodynamics (OR 5.5) than T7 or below [^111PVLmL].

- **Splanchnic outflow**: AD is well recognized in lesions above T6, where descending control of sympathetic outflow is disrupted [^113BcDGs].

- **Case reports**: AD has been documented in cervical and upper thoracic injuries, including C5 tetraplegia [^114bh72B] [^112jcfYQ].

---

## Risk factors influencing severity and frequency

Several factors influence the **severity and frequency of AD episodes**:

| **Risk factor** | **Influence on AD** |
|-|-|
| Level of injury | Higher lesions (cervical, upper thoracic) increase risk and severity [^111PVLmL] [^113SdkZj] |
| Completeness of injury | Complete injuries have more severe and frequent AD [^111PVLmL] [^113SdkZj] |
| Neurogenic detrusor overactivity | Increases AD risk during bladder events [^111PVLmL] [^112h8gNY] |
| Bladder management | Indwelling catheters and high detrusor pressures increase AD [^111jNBSS] [^111hHXHP] |
| Age | Older patients have higher AD risk during urodynamics [^111jNBSS] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Recognition**: AD is a medical emergency; prompt identification and removal of triggers are critical [^1172VJG2] [^116HUfeo].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous blood pressure monitoring is essential during procedures in patients with injuries at or above T6 [^116dRtK1].

- **Prevention**: Prophylactic measures, such as lidocaine anal block, can reduce AD during anorectal procedures [^113DN1t6].

- **Education**: Patients and caregivers should be educated about triggers and management strategies [^116fFNtt].

---

## Summary of key findings

T6 is the threshold above which **autonomic dysreflexia** occurs; cervical and upper thoracic injuries carry greater risk and severity [^113tMWUC]. Bladder and bowel distension are common triggers, and effective management relies on prompt recognition, **blood pressure monitoring**, and rapid removal of the precipitating stimulus [^112h8gNY] [^1132WFNC]. Recognizing and managing AD promptly is essential to prevent **life-threatening complications** [^1172VJG2].

### Prediction of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamics: A prospective cohort study [^111PVLmL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition in patients with spinal cord injury, as it can lead to myocardial ischemia, brain hemorrhage, or even death. Urodynamic investigation is the gold standard to assess neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction due to spinal cord injury and reveal crucial pathological findings, such as neurogenic detrusor overactivity. However, neurogenic detrusor overactivity and urodynamic investigation are known to be leading triggers of autonomic dysreflexia. Therefore, we aimed to determine predictors of autonomic dysreflexia in individuals with spinal cord injury during urodynamic investigation.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study included 300 patients with spinal cord injuries and complete datasets of continuous non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring, recorded during the same session repeat urodynamic investigation. We used logistic regression to reveal predictors of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation.

- **Results**: We found that the level of injury and presence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity were the only two independent significant predictors for autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation. A lesion at spinal segment T6 or above (odds ratio (OR) 5.5, 95% CI 3.2–9.4) compared to one at T7 or below, and the presence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (OR 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–4.9) were associated with significantly increased odds of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic investigation. Both odds persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and completeness and status.

### Autonomic dysreflexia after intramuscular injection in traumatic tetraplegia: A case report [^114bh72B]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome characterized by a massive imbalance of reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with spinal cord lesions above the splanchnic outflow (T6). It is marked by a sudden onset and severe increase in blood pressure, which is potentially life-threatening. The most common causes are bladder and rectum distention. In this case study, we report an autonomic dysreflexia case that developed after intramuscular injection in a 29-year-old tetraplegic patient with a C5 American Spinal Injury Association grade A lesion. After a careful review of the English literature, this clinical manifestation appears to be an unusual event.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome characterized by a massive imbalance of reflex sympathetic discharge occurring in patients with a spinal cord injury, particularly those with a lesion above the splanchnic outflow (Thoracic 6). It is marked by a sudden and severe rise in blood pressure and is potentially life-threatening. Due to the rapid onset and severe potential morbidity, it is crucial for caregivers of spinal cord injury patients to be aware of this syndrome. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and familiarizes the reader with the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of autonomic dysreflexia. It also presents two illustrative case reports.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111peMN3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

One factor that impinges on bowel management for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) is the impact of injury to descending spinal autonomic (sympathetic) pathways on cardiovascular function — the severity of autonomic injury. Disrupted cardiovascular function post-SCI leads to numerous cardiovascular abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality post-SCI. Of particular concern is the phenomenon of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), in which sudden and extreme hypertension is elicited by afferent stimuli originating from below the lesion level. These episodes can be life-threatening and may result in vascular dysfunction, seizures, cardiac arrest, cerebral vascular accidents, and death. AD is described in up to 90% of individuals with tetraplegia or high paraplegia, and only occurs with lesions above the level of sympathetic outflow to the splanchnic vascular bed (the fifth thoracic level), the most important vascular resistance and capacitance region and a key site for blood pressure regulation.

AD can occur in response to any afferent stimulus below the lesion level, but the most potent triggers are visceral stimuli, such as during bowel care. The blood pressure rise is secondary to vasoconstriction in resistance and capacitance vessels below the lesion, attributed to reflex sympathetic activity triggered by afferent input to the isolated spinal cord that proceeds unchecked by regulation from injured descending spinal autonomic pathways. The cardiac vagus nerve does not pass through the spinal cord, so it is unaffected by SCI, producing a baroreflex-mediated increase in blood pressure.

### Spinal cord injury impairs cardiac function due to impaired bulbospinal sympathetic control [^117PsxJe]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Spinal cord injury chronically alters cardiac structure and function and is associated with increased odds for cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigate the cardiac consequences of spinal cord injury on the acute-to-chronic continuum and the contribution of altered bulbospinal sympathetic control to the decline in cardiac function following spinal cord injury. By combining experimental rat models of spinal cord injury with prospective clinical studies, we demonstrate that spinal cord injury causes a rapid and sustained reduction in left ventricular contractile function that precedes structural changes. In rodents, we experimentally demonstrate that this decline in left ventricular contractile function following spinal cord injury is underpinned by interrupted bulbospinal sympathetic control. In humans, we find that activation of the sympathetic circuitry below the level of spinal cord injury causes an immediate increase in systolic function. Our findings highlight the importance of early interventions to mitigate the cardiac functional decline following spinal cord injury.

### National survey of bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction in people with spinal cord injury [^114ABpXt]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Low credibility.

Small-scale studies indicate that spinal cord injury (SCI) may lead to significant gastrointestinal and bladder dysfunction. However, how the prevalence of chronic disease related to these dysfunctions compares with non-SCI individuals and whether there are robust relationships to the level and severity of injury are still unclear. Our goal was to provide high-level evidence on the association between bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction and SCI using population-level data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and the SCI Community Survey.

Data from more than 60,000 individuals in the 2010 CCHS and 1,500 individuals with SCI from the SCI Community Survey were analyzed. We used bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression to examine relationships between explanatory and outcome variables. We found that SCI was associated with increased odds of urinary incontinence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4–7.1), bowel disorders (aOR = 2.3, CI: 1.5–3.4), as well as gastric ulcers (aOR = 3.3, CI: 2.1–4.8), even after adjusting for key confounding variables. Additionally, we found that complete SCI was associated with increased odds of urinary tract infections (aOR = 2.0, CI: 1.6–2.5) and bowel incontinence (aOR = 2.1, CI: 1.7–2.6).

Individuals with SCI are at increased odds for having bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction, certain aspects of which are dependent on the level and severity of injury. Targeted intervention and prevention strategies to manage bladder and bowel problems after SCI should be a priority for both caregivers and healthcare providers.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^115CTZAM]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Bowel care and symptoms of cardiovascular dysfunction are a significant concern for individuals living with SCI, with a profound impact on quality of life. Despite these concerns, most individuals are not making changes to their bowel care, highlighting gaps in bowel management education and raising questions about guidelines for bowel management. These data demonstrate the need for better information and resources about this topic for individuals with SCI and their caregivers.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^112jcfYQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to autonomic dysreflexia, scabies has been reported to trigger numerous other systemic diseases. Nine cases of scabies causing leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been reported. Scabies infestation has also been associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bullous pemphigoid. In all these disorders, it is hypothesized that the presence of the scabies mite causes a hypersensitivity-like reaction and immune response to an unknown antigen in affected individuals.

Recently, there has been increased data supporting that patients with a history of treated scabies are at a long-term higher risk for other systemic diseases, such as autoimmune disease or stroke. A recent population-based cohort study revealed that, compared with matched controls, patients with a history of scabies showed an increased risk of developing hypersensitivity vasculitis, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, myasthenia gravis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis over a 7-year period. Similarly, another population-based study showed an elevated risk of stroke in patients with a history of scabies during a 7-year follow-up period; however, patients with scabies also had a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome, which is a well-established risk factor for stroke alone.

More research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis to better counsel patients with scabies, like the patient described in our case, about their imminent and long-term risks.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^115MQa5a]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

On univariate analysis, higher autonomic dysreflexia (AD) scores were reported among people with complete injuries (3.91 vs 3.37, p = 0.03) and multiple urinary tract infections (UTIs) (4.39 vs 2.66, p < 0.0001). Higher AD scores were also expectedly reported for individuals with cervical/thoracic (CT) injuries versus lumbar/sacral (LS) injuries (3.83 CT vs 1.53 LS, p < 0.0001).

Higher AD scores showed a positive correlation with worse neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) (r = 0.243, p < 0.0001) and more years since injury (r = 0.056, p = 0.03). A negative correlation was observed between AD scores and age (r = −0.189, p < 0.0001). Participants with chronic pain scored significantly higher than those without (3.89 vs 2.86, p = 0.0004).

Both the mental (r = −0.173) and physical (r = 0.107) components of the SF-12 health survey were negatively correlated with AD scores (p < 0.0001), indicating that individuals with worse AD reported a lower quality of life (QoL). There was no significant correlation between participant sex (p = 0.19) and AD scores or between the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) and AD scores (r = 0.041, p = 0.11).

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^112dCv9Z]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

These guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of select demographic and clinical variables as well as prediction models when counseling patients, families, and surrogates of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI). We categorized these predictors as reliable, moderately reliable, or not reliable based on a GRADE-based assessment of certainty in the body of evidence, as well as effect size (quantification of predictor accuracy) across published studies, as detailed in Supplementary Appendix 1 and Table 1.

Reliable predictors and prediction models, for the purposes of these guidelines, may be used to formulate a prognosis when the appropriate clinical context is present in the absence of potential confounders. These predictors have clear, actionable thresholds or clinical/radiographic definitions and a low rate of error in prediction of outcomes, with at least moderate certainty in the body of evidence. When prognosis is formulated on the basis of one or more reliable predictors, the clinician may describe the outcome as "very likely" during counseling. Given the inherent limitations in neuroprognostication research, the clinician must nevertheless acknowledge the presence of uncertainty — even if low — in the prognosis during counseling.

Moderately reliable individual predictors may be used for prognostication only when additional reliable or moderately reliable individual predictors are present, in addition to the appropriate clinical context. These are also predictors with clear, actionable thresholds or clinical/radiographic definitions.

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^112h8gNY]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Bladder-related events, including neurogenic detrusor overactivity, are the leading cause of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord-injured individuals. Self-reported autonomic dysreflexia is reduced following onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity; however, none of these trials have assessed autonomic dysreflexia events using the clinical cutoff of an increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg.

This study used a prospective, open-labeled design from 2013 to 2014 to quantitatively assess the efficacy of one cycle of 200 U intradetrusor-injected onabotulinumtoxinA (20 sites) on reducing the severity and frequency of bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events and improving quality of life. Twelve men and five women with chronic, traumatic spinal cord injuries at or above the sixth thoracic level, along with concomitant autonomic dysreflexia and neurogenic detrusor overactivity, underwent blood pressure monitoring during urodynamics and over a 24-hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring pre- and 1 month post-treatment.

- **Reduction in severity**: Post-onabotulinumtoxinA, autonomic dysreflexia severity was reduced during urodynamics (systolic blood pressure increase: 42 ± 23 mm Hg vs. 20 ± 10 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and during bladder-related events across the 24-hour period (systolic blood pressure increase: 49 ± 2 mm Hg vs. 26 ± 22 mm Hg, p = 0.004).
- **Reduction in frequency**: Frequency of 24-hour bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia events was also decreased post-onabotulinumtoxinA (4 ± 2 events vs. 1 ± 1 events, p < 0.001).

Autonomic dysreflexia and incontinence quality of life indices were also improved, although details were not fully provided.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^116Q2hTB]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates a phenotype for at-risk patients for worse autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in addition to establishing an independent relationship between AD symptoms, more severe bladder and bowel symptoms, and long-term bladder management strategy. In an unadjusted assessment of the phenotype of individuals at risk for AD, the greatest risk factors were younger age, greater time from injury, chronic pain, more urinary tract infections (UTIs), higher injury levels, worse bowel symptoms, quadriplegia, completeness of injury, and worse quality of life (QoL) symptom scores for both mental and physical portions. We found no association between sex and AD; these results align with similar studies demonstrating AD to be gender-independent and more common among younger patients.

In the univariate model, the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) was not associated with AD severity; however, worse urinary and bowel symptoms independently correlate with higher AD severity in the multivariate model. One explanation for this disparity may be that in the univariate model, worsening bladder symptoms are not stratified by injury level or bladder management type. Our data show a robust relationship between bladder management, urinary symptoms, and AD severity independently, so injury level and bladder management may have confounded the relationship between AD and urinary symptom severity. Overall, these findings build on previously reported relationships between AD severity and worse bladder and bowel symptoms in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^112bEge9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, high autonomic dysreflexia (AD) scores are noted not only in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with cervical injuries but also among those with worse bladder and bowel symptoms. Patients using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for bladder management reported fewer AD symptoms than those using indwelling catheters (IDC) and surgical reconstruction. Bladder augmentation was associated with a higher AD score compared to urinary diversion.

### Basal metabolic rate and autonomic nervous system dysfunction in men with spinal cord injury [^116BuiNS]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between autonomic nervous system dysfunction and basal metabolic rate (BMR), as well as the effect of spasticity on BMR.

Twenty men (11 paraplegic and 9 tetraplegic) with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)-A and -B grade chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in this study. Total body fat mass and lean tissue mass were measured in all participants using DXA by standard methods. Patients were allocated into two groups to determine the effect of autonomic nervous system dysfunction on BMR: Group I (T6 and upper-level injuries with a history of autonomic dysreflexia) and Group II (T7 and lower-level injuries without a history of autonomic dysreflexia). Measurements of BMR were determined by indirect calorimetry under standardized conditions.

There were 13 patients in Group I and 7 patients in Group II, and the differences between these two groups in terms of time since injury, BMI, age, weight, lean tissue mass, BMR, and BMR/kg were not significant.

In conclusion, we determined that autonomic nervous system dysfunction does not affect BMR, and it might be ignored when considering energy needs in spinal cord injury.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^113jYmxJ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is common in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and leads to numerous abnormalities, including profound cardiovascular and bowel dysfunction. In those with high-level lesions, bowel management is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which is hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury level. Improving bowel care is integral for enhancing quality of life (QoL). We aimed to describe the relationships between bowel care, AD, and QoL in individuals with SCI.

We performed an online community survey of individuals with SCI. Those with injury at or above T7 were considered at risk for AD. Responses were received from 287 individuals with SCI with injury levels ranging from C1 to sacral, and an average duration of injury of 17.1 ± 12.9 years (standard deviation). The survey completion rate was 73% (n = 210). Bowel management was a problem for 78% of respondents: it interfered with personal relationships (60%) and prevented staying (62%) and working (41%) away from home. The normal bowel care duration was over 60 minutes in 24%, and most used digital rectal stimulation (59%); 33% reported bowel incontinence at least monthly.

Of those at risk for AD (n = 163), 74% experienced AD symptoms during bowel care, and 32% described palpitations. AD interfered with activities of daily living in 51%. Longer durations of bowel care (p < 0.001) and more severe AD (p = 0.04) were associated with lower QoL. Bowel management is a key concern for individuals with SCI and is commonly associated with symptoms of AD. Further studies should explore ways to manage bowel dysfunction, increase self-efficacy, and ameliorate the impact of bowel issues on quality of life.

### Non-surgical urologic management of neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury [^115AXyRi]. World Journal of Urology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neurogenic bladder, specifically in the context of bladder expression, the ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend not offering bladder expression or triggered bladder voiding to patients with spinal cord injury if any of the following video-urodynamic findings are present:

- **Small bladder capacity**: Patients with reduced storage capacity should not undergo bladder expression.

- **High leak point pressure**: Elevated pressure may indicate inadequate bladder function.

- **Low compliance**: Poor bladder compliance is a contraindication for bladder expression.

- **Vesicoureteral reflux at any point of the study**: Presence of reflux indicates a risk of renal damage.

- **Closed bladder neck during voiding or high voiding pressure**: This condition suggests an obstruction which contraindicates triggered voiding.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112GquEJ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Our study displays several strengths. We were able to gather extensive information on a range of bowel care and related concerns from a large group of community-dwelling individuals living with SCI, covering a wide range of ages, duration of injury, and level and severity of lesion. Survey completion rates were notably high at 73%.

Despite achieving a diverse array of respondents from different locations, the majority of our respondents were from Canada (55%). This may have had an effect, as the rehabilitation and localization of resources in Canada could lead to homogeneous approaches to bowel management. Nonetheless, we were able to collect information beyond the Canadian perspective, and the trends discussed were consistent through all respondents, regardless of location.

As with any survey, it is possible that our sample does not fully represent all individuals with SCI. In particular, we likely have a higher representation of individuals for whom issues around bowel care resonate, and who may be dissatisfied with their bowel management routine. These individuals might be more inclined to share their experiences and seek alternative bowel care management options. However, this population would not necessarily have a higher propensity for cardiovascular concerns, making the cardiovascular findings more likely to be robust and representative of the general SCI population.

When considering those at high risk for cardiovascular concerns post-SCI, we used a self-reported lesion level cutoff of T7 and above to designate high risk. This is a conservative measure, acknowledging the severity of autonomic dysreflexia.

### Sympathetic skin responses and autonomic dysfunction in spinal cord injury [^115jrSjL]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Sympathetic skin responses (SSRs), a measure of sympathetic cholinergic sudomotor function, have been used in the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). This review highlights the basic mechanisms underlying SSRs, as well as their application to the SCI population.

- **Utility of SSRs in assessing autonomic function**: We address the utility of SSRs in assessing autonomic function, the relationship between autonomic and sensorimotor impairment, and the association between SSRs and the sequelae of autonomic dysfunction in SCI, particularly autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension.

Overall, SSRs are a rapid, convenient, and non-invasive method illustrating that the severity of autonomic impairment can be independent from sensorimotor impairment. We suggest that SSRs be used in conjunction with other validated autonomic tests in order to predict or document autonomic dysfunction in SCI.

### Reduction in bladder-related autonomic dysreflexia after onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in spinal cord injury [^111iyzuw]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

From a clinical perspective, intravesical injections of Botox have an approximated average efficacy of nine months. The duration of Botox's efficacy in reducing bladder-related AD frequency and severity beyond one month is not known.

- **Limitations**: Other limitations included a small sample size, loss to follow-up, and lack of a control arm. Future research studies can confirm our preliminary findings through the conduction of a large-scale randomized controlled clinical design.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^116fFNtt]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Most individuals (84%) were aware of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and whether they had experienced it. This suggests that education strategies in this area have largely been effective. However, a number of respondents with lesion levels placing them at risk for AD did not know if they had it, despite describing symptoms of AD during their bowel care. This suggests there is still some room for improvement in education about the risk profile, identifying signs and symptoms of AD, and knowing when to seek assistance for AD management.

More generally, although AD awareness was high in this sample, AD was described as impacting quality of life (QoL) and interfering with activities of daily living. This suggests that education and resources concerning the management of AD are a priority for those living with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Those who were particularly likely to experience severe symptoms of AD were younger individuals, those with more complicated bowel care routines, and those for whom bowel care takes a long time. It is probable that the longer duration and magnitude of the afferent stimulus for AD during more complex and longer duration routines underlies the more severe symptoms of AD. This highlights the need to ameliorate symptoms in these individuals, either pharmacologically or behaviorally, through reductions in the time to complete bowel care and decreases in the number of stimuli used.

### The management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction after spinal cord injury [^1178SHtJ]. Nature Reviews Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with neurogenic bladder has changed substantially over the past decades. Obtaining balanced lower urinary tract function has become possible in most patients, although urological complications remain among the most serious these patients are likely to have, and even today, these can negatively affect quality of life. Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are likely to develop neurogenic bladder, and data are available on most aspects of neurogenic bladder in these patients.

Data on physiology and pathophysiology form the basis of our understanding of patients' symptoms and also provide a basis for the management of these patients. The use of conservative and/or more invasive treatment measures, their complications, and measures to prevent these complications are all important clinical aspects that merit discussion. Considerable progress has been made in the urological management of patients with SCI over the past decades, but opportunities remain to make diagnosis more accurate and therapy more successful.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112duGmx]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Sixteen common symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (OH) were also assessed using the same frequency range and severity. These symptoms were assigned a composite severity score in the same manner as the autonomic dysreflexia (AD) data described above. We also asked about symptoms of OH in response to ten other common OH stimuli and provided an opportunity for individuals to add a category "other" to identify additional stimuli. Participants were asked about their fainting history.

Participants were asked whether symptoms of OH or AD had ever interfered with their ability to participate in common activities such as activities of daily living, work, exercise, sexual activity, rehabilitation, household chores, driving, and social activities. A category "other" was available for participants to identify additional activities.

Participants were asked if they experienced symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia, such as heart palpitations, irregular heartbeats, or a feeling of "fluttering in the chest" during bowel care. If yes, they were asked how often this occurred (daily, weekly, monthly, rarely, or never).

Fatigue was scored on a linear scale from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (severe fatigue).

- **Stratification of participants by injury level**: For analysis of cardiovascular symptoms, participants were stratified by their self-reported injury level into two subgroups: those with injury at or above the seventh thoracic segment (T7) and those with injuries below T7. High-level injuries can disrupt sympathetic control of the heart and the vasculature in the splanchnic bed, increasing susceptibility to OH, AD, and cardiac arrhythmias.

### Cardiovascular monitoring during video urodynamic studies in persons with spinal cord injury [^117By4Kw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to observe cardiovascular responses during video urodynamic studies and to identify correlations between autonomic dysreflexia events and video urodynamic study findings in spinal cord injuries.

Thirty-four persons with spinal cord injury were enrolled and investigated using continuous cardiovascular monitoring during video urodynamic studies. Associations between cardiovascular responses and video study variables were analyzed.

Bladder type-specific cardiovascular responses occurred during the study. The incidence of overactive detrusor during urodynamic study and bladder trabeculation on voiding cystourethrogram was significantly higher in persons with autonomic dysreflexia and spinal cord injury (P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure changes showed a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.402, P = 0.020) with bladder compliance and a high positive correlation (r = 0.810, P = 0.000) with maximum detrusor pressure. However, no significant differences in neurological level of injury, injury completeness, autonomic dysreflexia symptoms, and voiding type were found. The increase in spinal cord injury at each section was significantly higher in the overactive detrusor group (P < 0.05). Significant bradycardia or tachycardia correlating with autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic studies was not observed.

Unpredictable cardiovascular reactions during urodynamic study should be considered carefully in persons with a spinal cord injury above T6.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^1169CukB]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

The registry consisted of 1,473 people with autonomic dysreflexia (AD) scores, of which 889 (60%) were men, and the mean age was 45 years. Among the participants, 904 (62%) were paraplegic, and 563 (38%) had complete injuries. The mean time since injury was 14.5 ± 11.8 years. Bladder management strategies were categorized as clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) in 750 (51%), indwelling catheterization (IDC) in 269 (18%), surgery in 195 (13%), and voiding in 259 (18%).

Regarding spinal cord injury (SCI) level, 627 participants had cervical injuries (43%), 677 had thoracic injuries (46%), and 126 had sacral or lumbar injuries (9%). There were 43 participants who did not report their level of injury. The mean AD score among all participants was 3.58 ± 4.70. The mean AD scores for each SCI level were 5.16 ± 4.92 for cervical, 2.59 ± 4.28 for thoracic, and 1.53 ± 3.48 for sacral and lumbar patients, with a significant difference (p < 0.001). The mean neurogenic bladder symptom score (NBSS) was 24.14 ± 10.77, while the mean neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) score was 12.49 ± 6.48.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111YaR9k]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). High credibility.

A large proportion of respondents (71% [137 of 192]) reported intentionally restricting their fluid intake (reporting intentional fluid restriction rarely 22% [43 of 192], sometimes 29% [55 of 192], and often 20% [39 of 192]) because of concerns about their bladder management. Fluid restriction was associated with younger age (p = 0.0092) and more severe symptoms of OH (p = 0.0146), AD (p = 0.0003), and fatigue (p = 0.0178).

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^111jM4uu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Severity of symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia during bowel care in individuals with SCI is considered at risk for cardiovascular dysfunction. Individuals were considered at risk for cardiovascular abnormalities if they had a self-reported lesion level at or above T7. Each symptom was classified according to its perceived severity. SCI stands for spinal cord injury.

We considered individuals with injuries at or above T7, who had at least one symptom of AD triggered during bowel care, to have AD (n = 123). The analysis of the following AD-specific questions was conducted on this subset of individuals. AD was reported to interfere with at least one activity by 68% (83 of 122) of respondents with AD, and the impact was wide-ranging. At least 50% of these respondents identified AD as interfering with social activities, activities of daily living, work, exercise, and sleep. Only 4% (4 of 110) of those with injuries at or above T7 reported deliberately provoking AD to boost sports performance. The majority of respondents who experienced AD identified a number of other stimuli that triggered these symptoms, most notably bladder care (89%; [101 of 114]) and pain (75%; [84 of 112]).

- **Influence of AD outside of bowel care**:
	- Prevalence of autonomic dysreflexia interfering with common activities.
	- Additional stimuli that trigger autonomic dysreflexia symptoms in those with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia during bowel care.

More severe symptoms of AD were associated with a younger age (p = 0.009).

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in spinal cord injury: Clinical practicability [^113F5Jyf]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Trauma to the spinal cord often results not only in sensorimotor but also autonomic impairments. The loss of autonomic control over the cardiovascular system can cause profound blood pressure (BP) derangements in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) and may therefore lead to increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this population. The use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) allows insights into circadian BP profiles, which have been shown to be of good prognostic value for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in able-bodied subjects.

Past studies in SCI subjects using ABPM have shown that alterations in circadian BP patterns are dependent on the spinal lesion level. Tetraplegic subjects with sensorimotor complete lesions have a decreased daytime arterial BP, loss of the physiological nocturnal BP dip, and higher circadian BP variability, including potentially life-threatening hypertensive episodes known as autonomic dysreflexia (AD), compared with paraplegic and able-bodied subjects. The proposed underlying mechanisms of these adverse BP alterations mainly are attributed to a lost or decreased central drive to sympathetic spinal preganglionic neurons controlling the heart and blood vessels.

In addition, several maladaptive anatomical changes within the spinal cord and the periphery, as well as the general decrease of physical daily activity in SCI subjects, account for adverse BP changes. ABPM enables the identification of adverse BP profiles and the associated increased risk for CVD in SCI subjects. Concurrently, it also might provide a useful clinical tool for managing these health challenges.

### Selective alpha adrenergic antagonist reduces severity of transient hypertension during sexual stimulation after spinal cord injury [^115m2s8k]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2015). Low credibility.

On a daily basis, the majority of individuals with high-level spinal cord injury experience autonomic dysreflexia, a life-threatening episode of transient extreme hypertension, with blood pressure reaching levels as high as 300 mm Hg, affecting up to 90% of this population. Unfortunately, ejaculation serves as a primary initiating factor for autonomic dysreflexia, discouraging sexual activity. Clinically, penile vibrostimulation is performed to obtain a sperm specimen or for initial assessment of fertility. Nifedipine, a selective calcium channel blocker, is commonly prescribed for the management of autonomic dysreflexia secondary to ejaculation or other causes. However, its use is limited due to its potential exacerbation of low resting blood pressure, which also affects this population.

This study examined the effect of a short-acting selective α1 antagonist (prazosin) on autonomic dysreflexia severity using a randomized placebo-controlled trial during medically supervised penile vibrostimulation in six males with cervical spinal cord injury. Beat-by-beat blood pressure and heart rate were recorded throughout penile vibrostimulation during placebo and prazosin-treated days. The increase in systolic blood pressure was significantly mitigated during vibrostimulation in subjects administered prazosin compared to those administered a placebo (+140 ± 19 mm Hg vs. +96 ± 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05). On average, the peak in systolic blood pressure was 46 mm Hg lower during penile vibrostimulation with prazosin administration (p < 0.05), while resting blood pressure remained unaffected.

### Development of a systems medicine approach to spinal cord injury [^116CWfj4]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Low credibility.

Normal network physiology requires rapid stabilizing feedback, regulated mainly by the central and peripheral nervous and neuroendocrine systems. Allostasis refers to the dynamic regulatory adaptations within normal physiological ranges that maintain stability in systems such as autonomic, central nervous, neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems. Allostatic mechanisms restore "homeostasis" after perturbations through feedback loop corrections, including thermoregulation, peripheral vascular resistance, and inflammation control.

Following spinal cord injury (SCI), the adaptive capacity of allostatic feedback is variably lost, mainly due to distributed autonomic system disruptions. When a physiological system is destabilized beyond homeostatic boundaries, allostatic load (AL) is generated. Chronic AL contributes to accumulating damage, reduced resilience, accelerated system aging, and potentiation of adverse health conditions. After SCI, many systems cannot "normalize", resulting in measurable AL, increasing vulnerability to metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infection, chronic pain, and chronic inflammation due to neuroendocrine and immune dysfunction. Overall, these changes may reduce resilience and increase frailty. At a genetic level, polymorphisms may increase vulnerability to developing AL, and AL can drive epigenetic change within the individual genome.

### Charcot arthropathy in relation to autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury: Case report and review of the literature [^111nq8nM]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Charcot spinal arthropathy has been described as a late complication of spinal cord injury. In patients with these injuries, where the spine below the level of injury is insensate, joint trauma can progress until spinal instability ensues. The authors describe the case of a 50-year-old man with complete C-8 tetraplegia who experienced a 4-month history of episodic severe headaches, profuse sweating over his face and arms, and episodic severe hypertension, in addition to a "grinding" sensation in the lower back. Neuroimaging demonstrated Charcot arthropathy at the T11–12 levels with pathological mobility. Intraoperatively, a complete spinal cord transection was identified. Anterior and posterior thoracolumbar fusion across the mobile segment resulted in complete amelioration of signs and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. This entity, common in the setting of spinal cord injury, has many triggers. Definitive treatment is targeted at the removal of the underlying cause. As demonstrated here, Charcot spinal arthropathy can act as a powerful trigger for the induction of autonomic dysreflexia. Treatment of the associated spinal instability resulted in eradication of all signs and symptoms of the dysreflexia.

### Autonomic dysreflexia: A plastic surgery primer [^113tMWUC]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Plastic surgeons are integral to the management team for patients with spinal cord injuries, with responsibilities including pressure sore management and upper extremity reconstruction. Injury to the spinal cord profoundly disrupts the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. In particular, the autonomic system can become unregulated, resulting in a massive sympathetic discharge called autonomic dysreflexia.

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in the majority of patients with injuries above the sixth thoracic vertebra and causes sudden, severe hypertension. If left untreated, autonomic dysreflexia can result in stroke or death. Because this syndrome causes morbidity and mortality, it is crucial for plastic surgeons to be able to recognize and treat autonomic dysreflexia. This article reviews the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of this syndrome.

### Hypothermia associated with autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury [^114pqTnh]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Individuals with traumatic upper thoracic and cervical spinal cord injuries are at increased risk for the development of both thermoregulatory dysfunction and autonomic dysreflexia. It is unclear, however, what effect reflex autonomic sympathetic outflow has on thermoregulatory dysfunction during episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. This case involving an individual with C5 tetraplegia and both thermoregulatory dysfunction and autonomic dysreflexia illustrates the profound effects that the autonomic nervous system may have on body temperature in individuals at risk for this complication.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^117Su8NQ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Although we were primarily interested in the relationships between autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and bowel care, it was interesting that AD was reported to interfere with numerous other common activities, including sleep, exercise, normal daily activities, and sexual function. Many of these triggers are well known and underscore the need to find effective management strategies for AD. However, the association between AD interfering with sleep has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. This may seem surprising, as we do not typically think of many triggers for AD being present during sleep.

Considering that most respondents reported conducting their bowel care first thing in the morning or in the evening, it is possible the colon filling initiates AD ahead of morning bowel care, or that evening bowel care triggers symptoms of AD that continue unabated — even once the offending stimulus has been removed. Further, bladder triggers for AD may also be peaking in the night as the bladder progressively fills. Urine production is also higher at night than during the day in individuals with high-level lesions, which could further exacerbate the nocturnal bladder stimulus. Together, these triggers could combine to exacerbate AD and interfere with sleep.

Disruption of sleep is particularly concerning among individuals with high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) who experience AD because many already experience profound fatigue related to low resting cerebral blood flow during the day, and poor sleep further exacerbates fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

### Neuroprotection, plasticity manipulation, and regenerative strategies to improve cardiovascular function following spinal cord injury [^113KnVh7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2015). Low credibility.

Damage to the central nervous system, as in the case of spinal cord injury (SCI), results in disrupted supraspinal sympathetic influence and subsequent cardiovascular control impairments. Consequently, people with SCI suffer from disordered basal hemodynamics and devastating fluctuations in blood pressure, as in the case of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which likely contribute to this population's leading cause of mortality: cardiovascular disease. The development of AD is related, at least in part, to neuroanatomical changes that include disrupted descending supraspinal sympathetic control, changes in propriospinal circuitry, and inappropriate afferent sprouting in the dorsal horn. These anatomical mechanisms may thus be targeted by neural regenerative and protective therapies to improve cardiovascular control and reduce AD.

- **Abnormal cardiovascular control**: We discuss the relationship between abnormal cardiovascular control and its underlying neuroanatomy.

- **Biochemical strategies**: Studies investigate biochemical strategies to reduce the severity of AD through:
	1. Reducing aberrant calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactive afferent sprouting.
	2. Inhibiting inflammatory processes.
	3. Re-establishing descending supraspinal sympathetic control.

Finally, we discuss why additional biochemical agents and combinational approaches may be needed to completely ameliorate this condition.

Cervical spine injuries are often associated with various forms of neck trauma and symptoms. These injuries may occur due to neck deformity, sports participation, or motor vehicle accidents. Additionally, symptoms may include neck pain, visual disturbances, neck stiffness, or tenderness, as well as more severe manifestations such as dysarthria, bradycardia, and altered mental status. Other potential signs include headaches, hypotension, falls, altered level of consciousness, and traumatic injuries. Patients may also experience arm weakness, upper limb paresis, neck bruising, and arm numbness. Recognizing the diverse symptoms and potential causes is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.

### Silent autonomic dysreflexia during a routine bowel program in persons with traumatic spinal cord injury: a preliminary study [^1132WFNC]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the existence and frequency of silent autonomic dysreflexia in subjects with a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) above the neurologic level of T6, a prospective design was employed. The study involved blood pressure monitoring of subjects during a routine bowel program. Ten subjects with chronic (> 1 year), complete (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale class A) SCI with a neurologic level of injury above T6 participated in the study.

- **Main outcome measures**: An increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of greater than 20 to 40 mmHg above baseline or an SBP greater than 150 mmHg was examined. The mean resting blood pressure for the subject group was 104/65 mmHg. During the bowel program, no subject reported experiencing any of the classic symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. The mean maximum blood pressure recorded during the bowel program was 160/90 mmHg. All patients had an increase in SBP greater than 20 mmHg above baseline, and 70% had an increase in SBP greater than 40 mmHg above baseline. Additionally, 60% of subjects had an increase in SBP greater than 150 mmHg, with 40% of subjects reaching an SBP greater than 170 mmHg at least once during their bowel program.

Silent autonomic dysreflexia occurs frequently in SCI during bowel programs. Further study is recommended to determine whether preventative measures or treatment is needed.

### Risk factors to develop autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamic examinations in patients with spinal cord injury [^111jNBSS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

The risk factors for developing autonomic dysreflexia (AD) during urodynamic (UD) examination in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) above Th6 remain unclear. The main goal of our study is to investigate the risk factors that could be associated with AD in these particular patients. This study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey method.

The study involved 83 patients with SCI above Th6 who were referred to our center for a UD examination. AD was defined as a rise in systolic blood pressure above 15 mm Hg with a pulse rate below 60 beats per minute.

- **Results**:
	- The prevalence rate of AD among our patients was 54%. Univariate analysis showed several risk factors, including the patient's age, SCI completeness, traumatic etiology, indwelling catheter, presence of chills or sweating, anticholinergic treatment, maximum detrusor voiding pressure, detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate, detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia, and bladder outlet obstruction. Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent risk factors: patient's age equal to or above 45 years (OR = 10.995) and maximum detrusor voiding pressure equal to or above 31 cm H₂O (OR = 3.879).

- **Conclusions**:
	- According to our results, patient's age and maximum detrusor voiding pressure should be considered during UD examinations to prevent the sudden onset of AD in patients with SCI above Th6. Neurourology and Urodynamics, 36:171–175, 2017. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Transurethral sphincterotomy provides significant relief in autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injured male patients: long-term follow-up results [^116uP9py]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

An evaluation of the results of transurethral sphincterotomy in spinal cord-injured patients for the relief of autonomic dysreflexia is presented.

- **Materials and methods**: The study describes experience with the treatment of 46 consecutive spinal cord-injured males presenting with frequent symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and inadequate voiding. The selection criteria include patients injured above the thoracic 6 level with subjective symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who did not want to be catheterized or were unable to perform intermittent catheterization. Patients were studied with complex urodynamics before and at least 3 months after undergoing transurethral sphincterotomy. During the cystometrogram, the maximum increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded. After transurethral sphincterotomy, patients were followed for a mean of 5.4 ± 3.1 years (range 1 to 12).

- **Results**: There was subjective relief in autonomic dysreflexia following transurethral sphincterotomy in all patients, which correlated well with a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001). The mean decrease in maximal systolic and diastolic blood pressure after transurethral sphincterotomy was 55 ± 25 and 29 ± 17 mm Hg, respectively. The mean post-void residual urine decreased significantly from 233 ± 151 to 136 ± 0.34 mL after transurethral sphincterotomy. However, there was no significant change in mean maximum voiding pressures.

- **Conclusions**: Blood pressure monitoring during cystometrogram provides an objective assessment of the presence of autonomic dysreflexia.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^11591ZFk]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Crusted scabies, also referred to as Norwegian scabies, is caused by an infestation with the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mite. Unlike classic scabies, where a human host may be infected with 10 to 15 mites, an aberrant host response in crusted scabies leads to colonization with millions of mites. This condition is most often observed in patients with decreased sensory function and in those who are immunocompromised, such as the elderly and those with underlying HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 infection, and malignancy. Clinically, patients present with generalized thick, hyperkeratotic, psoriasiform, or eczematous-like plaques, most notable on acral surfaces. Pruritus may be absent. Systemically, generalized lymphadenopathy, peripheral eosinophilia, elevated immunoglobulin E levels, sleep disturbances, and secondary superinfections with *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes* are reported. Here, we present a rare case of untreated crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with underlying spinal cord injury.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^113x2Tp8]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

While it is recognized that bowel care is a concern for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), the relationships between bowel care, cardiovascular dysfunction, and domains of quality of life (QoL) are poorly understood. This makes it challenging to target components of bowel care that might be modified to improve QoL for those affected. We sought to conduct a survey of the experts in this area — individuals living with SCI — to identify common bowel practices used by individuals with SCI, describe the presence of cardiovascular symptoms during bowel care, and elucidate the impact of bowel management and associated cardiovascular concerns on QoL.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112AUD8F]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Worldwide, many are living with the devastating consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition to the well-known motor and sensory consequences, descending spinal autonomic pathways can also be affected, leading to profound autonomic dysfunction. Although the autonomic consequences of SCI are widespread, key areas of concern identified by individuals living with SCI include issues regarding continence and cardiovascular dysfunction. These devastating effects are major problems for individuals with SCI: they represent frustrating and limiting secondary complications that are too often forgotten by the clinical and research communities. Indeed, improving bowel function has been identified by individuals with SCI, both those with tetraplegia and paraplegia, as a key target in order to enhance quality of life (QoL). Notably, issues surrounding bowel management are complicated by cardiovascular dysfunction that is triggered by bowel care itself.

Bowel management concerns post-SCI are multifactorial but most commonly relate to neurogenic bowel, a colonic dysfunction resulting from a lack of central nervous system control. Accordingly, individuals with SCI often experience impairments in QoL related to fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, constipation, hemorrhoids, and abdominal distention. Changes in bowel motility, sphincter control, and impaired hand function and mobility combine to make bowel management a key cause of morbidity post-SCI. Successful bowel management requires a multi-factorial approach, with important roles for dietary approaches.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neurogenic bladder, specifically with respect to bladder expression, ICUD/SIU 2018 guidelines recommend considering offering triggered bladder emptying in selected patients with suprasacral injury and a contractile bladder if videourodynamics confirms normal bladder capacity, low leak point pressure, good compliance, no vesicoureteral reflux, an open bladder neck during voiding, and low voiding pressures.

### Discitis following urinary tract infection manifesting as recurrent autonomic dysreflexia related to truncal movements in a person with tetraplegia [^114s5cPf]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old male person with tetraplegia (C-5 AIS-A, American Spinal Cord Injury Association Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale) developed a urinary tract infection and received appropriate antibiotics. Subsequently, he started sweating and shivering when he was sitting up; these symptoms resolved while lying on his back. Autonomic dysreflexia, triggered by truncal movements, continued to occur for 3 months.

CT of the spine showed L5-S1 discitis. MRI of the spine revealed diffuse marrow oedema in the L5 and S1 vertebrae and a large abscess at the L5/S1 level. Blood culture yielded Serratia marcescens, sensitive to meropenem. Meropenem, followed by ertapenem, was given for 12 weeks. After 11 months, an MRI showed resolution of discitis and epidural collection. The patient was able to sit up for 9 hours without developing autonomic dysreflexia.

If a person with cervical spinal cord injury develops posture-related autonomic dysreflexia (e.g. in a sitting position, lying on sides, or while hoisted), disco-vertebral pathology should be suspected.

### Cardiac consequences of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury [^1172VJG2]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which describes episodic hypertension, is highly prevalent in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In non-SCI, primary hypertension depresses cardiac contractile reserve via β-adrenergic mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether AD contributes to the impairment in cardiac contractile function that accompanies SCI. We induced SCI in rodents and stratified them into sham, SCI, or SCI plus repetitive induction of AD. At 6 weeks post-SCI, we assessed cardiac function using in vivo (speckle-tracking echocardiography), ex vivo (working heart), and molecular approaches (Western blot). We also provide unique translational insight by comparing the relationship between the number of daily AD events and cardiac function in 14 individuals with cervical SCI.

We found that SCI and SCI plus repetitive induction of AD exhibited a reduction in left ventricular dimensions at 6 weeks post-SCI versus preinjury (P < 0.049). Compared with sham, SCI exhibited a reduction in peak radial strain along with a down and rightward shift in the Starling curve (P < 0.037), both of which were further depressed in SCI plus repetitive induction of AD (P < 0.042). In response to β-adrenergic stimulation, SCI plus repetitive induction of AD exhibited an attenuated increase in contractile indices (P < 0.001), despite no differences in β-receptor expression within the left ventricle.

Our clinical data confirm our experimental findings by demonstrating significant associations between the number of daily AD events and markers of systolic and diastolic function, along with left ventricular measurements.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^113N5Yto]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Lower AD and NBSS scores in the CIC population may also reflect a different bladder physiology compared to those managed with IDC. The NBSS-QoL is based on three domains: incontinence, physical factors (voiding and urine storage), and social factors. Patients using CIC to empty their bladder at timed intervals may minimize bladder distension, which could explain why their AD is better managed. However, their urinary QoL scores are likely worse due to the frequency with which the bladder needs to be emptied and the mechanical difficulty of performing CIC. Furthermore, the QoL differences observed in our previous report may also have reflected perceived improvements in other domains impacting QoL, such as time burden and independence, which is not always possible with CIC. At a minimum, these findings contribute to the shared decision-making discussion regarding the potential impact of bladder management strategy on AD symptoms.

People with reconstructive bladder surgery also experienced more associated AD symptoms compared to those using CIC, and bladder augmentation was associated with worse AD symptoms than urinary diversion. This may be related to several possible reasons. First, patients with a bladder augment still have a native bladder that can trigger AD symptoms when distended, whereas those with a conduit or orthotopic diversion do not. Second, bladder augment surgeries could potentially negatively impact bowel function compared to a urinary diversion, since a bladder augment requires more bowel (30–50 cm) than an ileal or colon loop diversion (8–12 cm). Supportive evidence for this is seen in a previous publication.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^112h6XR1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were asked whether they had experienced autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and orthostatic hypotension (OH), and how frequently. Five-point ordered Likert scales were used to assess symptoms of AD during bowel care and at other times of the day. Frequencies of AD symptoms were categorized as "Never", "Rarely", "Monthly", "Weekly", and "Daily", whereas severity was assessed as "Not experienced", "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe", and "Very severe".

- **Symptoms during bowel care**: In addition to considering the full item response, symptoms during bowel care were also considered in a dichotomized form, independent of severity, as "experienced" (mild, moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms reported) and "not experienced" (no symptoms experienced).

- **Response to stimuli**: Participants were also asked about symptoms of AD in response to 12 other common AD stimuli and were provided an opportunity to add a category, "other", to identify additional stimuli.

An overall symptom severity score of AD both overall and during bowel care was determined by assigning numerical values to the Likert scale ("Never" or "Not experienced" = 0; "Rarely" or "Mild" = 1; "Monthly" or "Moderate" = 2; "Weekly" or "Severe" = 3; and "Daily" or "Very severe" = 4) and summing the responses to individual symptoms. "Other" symptoms were scored similarly when identified and incorporated into the overall symptom score, as the study was particularly interested in the overall symptom burden of AD. The use of "boosting" through deliberate initiation of AD was also considered.

### Spinal cord injury in the pediatric population: A systematic review of the literature [^1169xcXf]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2011). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) in the pediatric population is relatively rare but carries significant psychological and physiological consequences. An interdisciplinary group of experts composed of medical and surgical specialists treating patients with SCI formulated the following questions:

- **The epidemiology of pediatric spinal cord injury and fractures**: What is the epidemiology of pediatric spinal cord injury and fractures?

- **Unique features of pediatric SCI**: Are there unique features of pediatric SCI which distinguish the pediatric SCI population from adults?

- **Neuroprotective approaches in treatment**: Is there evidence to support the use of neuroprotective approaches, including hypothermia and steroids, in the treatment of pediatric SCI?

A systematic review of the literature using multiple databases was undertaken to evaluate these three specific questions. A search strategy composed of specific search terms (spinal cord injury, paraplegia, quadriplegia, tetraplegia, lapbelt injuries, seatbelt injuries, cervical spine injuries, and pediatrics) returned over 220 abstracts that were evaluated by two observers. Relevant abstracts were then evaluated, and papers were graded using the Downs and Black method.

A table of evidence was then presented to a panel of experts using a modified Delphi approach, and the following recommendation was formulated using a consensus approach: Pediatric patients with traumatic SCI have different mechanisms of injury and have a better neurological recovery potential when compared to adults. Patients with SCI before their adolescent growth spurt have a high likelihood of developing scoliosis. Because of these differences, traumatic SCI should be highly suspected in the presence of injury.

### Prediction of autonomic dysreflexia during urodynamics: a prospective cohort study [^113SdkZj]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Exploring cardiovascular changes during UDI within the group of patients with autonomic dysreflexia, we found several significant differences related to SCI severity, i.e. the level and the completeness of the lesion, and the presence of clinical symptoms. Specifically, patients with cervical lesions experienced a significantly higher increase in SBP during UDI compared to those with thoracic and lumbar lesions. Patients with lesions at T6 or above showed a significantly higher increase in SBP and a greater decrease in HR compared to those with a lesion at T7 or below. When stratifying patients with autonomic dysreflexia according to the AIS, significantly different changes in HR were discovered between AIS A and AIS C, AIS A and AIS D, and AIS B and AIS D. Patients with a complete lesion (AIS A) compared to those with an incomplete lesion (AIS B–D) showed a significantly greater decrease in HR.

Patients with a motor complete lesion (AIS A–B) compared to those with a motor incomplete lesion (AIS C–D) had a significantly higher increase in SBP and a greater decrease in HR. Patients with symptomatic compared to asymptomatic autonomic dysreflexia demonstrated a significantly higher increase in both SBP and DBP, as well as a greater decrease in HR. No significant cardiovascular changes were found for patients with acute compared to those with chronic suprasacral SCI.

### Impact of bladder management strategies on autonomic dysreflexia severity in people with spinal cord injuries [^111hHXHP]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

We investigated whether the severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD) was associated with more patient-reported bladder and bowel symptoms and compared AD severity by bladder management strategy in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The Neurogenic Bladder Research Group SCI Registry is a prospective study evaluating quality of life after SCI. Bladder and bowel symptoms were assessed through the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score and Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction score, respectively. AD severity was assessed with the Autonomic Dysreflexia Following Spinal Cord Injury (ADFSCI) instrument. Bladder management was classified as volitional voiding, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), indwelling catheter (IDC), and surgery (augmentation and diversion).

AD scores were identified for 1,473 people. The mean age was 45. Bladder management was CIC in 754 (51%), IDC in 271 (18%), surgery in 195 (13%), and voiding in 259 (18%). On univariate analysis, higher ADFSCI scores occurred with complete injuries (3.1 vs. 3.4, p = 0.03), cervical/thoracic injuries (3.8 vs. 1.5, p < 0.0001), and chronic pain (3.9 vs. 2.9, p = 0.0004). IDC (5.2) and surgery (4.5) had higher ADFSCI scores than CIC (3.0) and volitional voiding (2.8) (p < 0.0001). Sub-analysis showed bladder augmentation had significantly higher ADSCI scores than diversion (4.7 vs. 3.7, p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, the level of injury, bladder management, and bowel and bladder symptoms remained associated with worse AD.

Level of injury, age, and worse bowel and bladder symptoms, as well as the type of bladder management, were factors influencing AD severity.

### Baroreflex function after spinal cord injury [^115ofPMk]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

Significant cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). It is now recognized that cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCI. Patients with SCI may also suffer severe orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Baroreflex sensitivity, which refers to the capability of the autonomic nervous system to detect and respond effectively to acute changes in blood pressure, has been recognized for its predictive value for cardiovascular events and its role in effective short-term regulation of blood pressure.

The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms underlying effective baroreflex function, describe the techniques available to measure baroreflex function, and summarize the literature examining baroreflex function after SCI. Finally, we describe the potential mechanisms responsible for baroreflex dysfunction after SCI and propose future avenues for research.

Briefly, although cardiovagal baroreflex function is reduced markedly in those with high-level lesions (above the T6 level), the reduction appears to be partially mitigated in those with low-level lesions. Although no studies have examined the sympathetic arm of the baroreflex in those with SCI — despite this being arguably more important to blood pressure regulation than the cardiovagal baroreflex — nine articles have examined sympathetic responses to orthostatic challenges; these findings are reviewed. Future studies are needed to describe whether dysfunctional baroreflex sensitivity after SCI is due to arterial stiffening or a neural mechanism.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with traumatic spinal cord injury [^1154vu2d]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Low credibility.

- **Evidence to recommendation criteria**: Quality of evidence and certainty in the evidence and effect size are crucial. For these guidelines, predictors described as "reliable" have both higher overall certainty in the evidence and greater effect size than "moderately reliable" predictors (Table 1). For "reliable" predictors and prediction models, one downgrade was permitted for risk of bias, but none for inconsistency, imprecision, or indirectness. The overall quality of evidence had to be high or moderate. "Reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of > 0.8 with no evidence of miscalibration in external validation studies that reported calibration.

- **Criteria for moderately reliable predictors**: Single downgrades within each domain of risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness were allowed for "moderately reliable" predictors, but not for inconsistency. "Moderately reliable" prediction models were required to demonstrate an AUC > 0.7, and some miscalibration in external populations was allowed, given the lower risk of withdrawal of life support in this disease. Predictors not fitting the "reliable" or "moderately reliable" criteria were classified as "not reliable".

- **Balance of desirable and undesirable consequences**: Accurate prognostication of functional outcomes after acute traumatic spinal cord injury supports patients, families, and clinicians in planning for future needs and focusing rehabilitation activities on recovery of function versus adaptation. An inaccurate prediction of a poor functional outcome may lead to…

### Passive hindlimb cycling enhances tolerance of cardiac electrical conduction in rats with spinal cord injuries [^112Qbtaa]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2025). Low credibility.

High-level spinal cord injury (SCI) often disrupts supraspinal control of sympathetic input to the heart. The resulting imbalance in the autonomic nervous system increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. It was previously demonstrated that passive hindlimb cycling (PHLC) effectively maintains or improves bodily function, including cardiovascular performance, following SCI. However, it remains unclear whether the exercise can affect cardiac electrical disorders. To address this specific question, we complemented a complete SCI at a high-thoracic level in rats and then performed PHLC for 5 or 10 weeks. Naive rats or those receiving injury alone served as controls. Subsequently, a telemetric transmitter was implanted to record blood pressure and electrocardiogram.

In 24-hour resting recordings, cycling training did not influence SCI-induced hypotension but significantly reduced the events of spontaneous autonomic dysreflexia. When colorectal distension was employed to artificially trigger autonomic dysreflexia, fewer severe arrhythmias (e.g. atrioventricular block, premature ventricular contraction single, and sinus pause) were found in animals with 10-week PHLC compared with injury controls. As a stress test, a series of increasing concentrations of dobutamine was administered to stimulate cardiac sympathetic activity. Consequently, various types of arrhythmias occurred in animals with SCI alone, whereas very few were detected in animals obtaining exercise training for 10 weeks. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention disclosed that exercise appeared to reduce the prevalence of arrhythmias.

### A community perspective on bowel management and quality of life after spinal cord injury: The influence of autonomic dysreflexia [^114rJFBE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction is common in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and leads to numerous abnormalities, including profound cardiovascular and bowel dysfunction. In those with high-level lesions, bowel management is a common trigger for autonomic dysreflexia (AD; hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury level). Improving bowel care is integral for enhancing quality of life (QoL).

We aimed to describe the relationships between bowel care, AD, and QoL in individuals with SCI. We performed an online community survey of individuals with SCI. Those with injury at or above T7 were considered at risk for AD. Responses were received from 287 individuals with SCI (injury levels C1-sacral and average duration of injury 17.1 ± 12.9 [standard deviation] years). The survey completion rate was 73% (n = 210).

Bowel management was a problem for 78%: it interfered with personal relationships (60%) and prevented staying (62%) and working (41%) away from home. The normal bowel care duration was > 60 min in 24%, and most used digital rectal stimulation (59%); 33% reported bowel incontinence at least monthly. Of those at risk for AD (n = 163), 74% had AD symptoms during bowel care; 32% described palpitations. AD interfered with activities of daily living in 51%. Longer durations of bowel care (p < 0.001) and more severe AD (p = 0.04) were associated with lower QoL.

Bowel management is a key concern for individuals with SCI and is commonly associated with symptoms of AD. Further studies should explore ways to manage bowel dysfunction, increase self-efficacy, and ameliorate related challenges.

### Cardiovascular responses to endotracheal intubation in patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries [^115KUR4c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Endotracheal intubation usually causes transient hypertension and tachycardia. We investigated whether the cardiovascular responses to intubation change as a function of the time elapsed in patients with spinal cord injury. One hundred six patients with traumatic complete spinal cord injury were grouped into acute and chronic groups according to the time elapsed (less than and more than four weeks after injury). They were also grouped by the level of injury (above C7 and below T5) into acute quadriplegia (n = 26), chronic quadriplegia (n = 27), acute paraplegia (n = 24), and chronic paraplegia (n = 29). Twenty-five patients with no spinal cord injury served as controls.

Systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), heart rate, and plasma concentrations of catecholamines were measured. The intubation did not affect SAP in either the acute or chronic quadriplegics but significantly increased SAP in both acute and chronic paraplegics. The heart rate was significantly increased in all groups; however, the magnitude of change was less in acute quadriplegics than in the other groups. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine increased in every group except the acute quadriplegics. The magnitude of increase was attenuated in chronic quadriplegics, accentuated in acute paraplegics, and similar in chronic paraplegics when compared with controls. The incidence of arrhythmias did not differ among groups.

We conclude that the cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to endotracheal intubation may change as a function of the time elapsed and the level of spinal cord injury.

### Lidocaine anal block limits autonomic dysreflexia during anorectal procedures in spinal cord injury: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113DN1t6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous hypertensive response to stimulation below the level of injury that occurs in patients with spinal cord injury at T6 or above. Rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation are among the stimuli that may precipitate autonomic dysreflexia. Instillation of topical local anesthetic into the rectum is the recommended prophylaxis against autonomic dysreflexia of anorectal origin. However, a previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that topical lidocaine in the rectum does not blunt the autonomic dysreflexia response to anorectal procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine whether lidocaine anal sphincter block would be effective in limiting anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury above T6, who were having anorectal procedures (flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or anoscopic hemorrhoid ligation). In a double-blind fashion, patients were randomized for intersphincteric anal block with 1 percent lidocaine or normal saline (placebo) before the procedure. Blood pressure was measured before, during, and after the block and procedure.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients received lidocaine, and 13 received placebo. The groups were similar in age, level of injury, duration of spinal cord injury, type of procedure, and procedure duration. The mean maximal systolic blood pressure increase for the lidocaine group was 22 ± 14 mmHg, significantly lower than the placebo group's 47 ± 31 mmHg (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**:
