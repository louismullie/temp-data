## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Tradjenta (linagliptin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and basic pharmacology. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and dosing. Next, I will review efficacy data across monotherapy and combination settings, followed by safety, including cardiovascular and renal outcomes. After that, I need to check special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing pearls and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality sources and correct any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism. Tradjenta is the brand name for linagliptin, a once-daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that increases active incretin levels (GLP-1 and GIP), thereby enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon, which reduces hepatic glucose output; importantly, it is not an insulin secretagogue itself, so hypoglycemia risk is low when used alone [^1157NdEV] [^116vVCcq].

> I should confirm the labeled indication and dose. The FDA approves linagliptin 5 mg orally once daily for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it can be taken with or without food; no dose adjustment is required for renal or hepatic impairment, which is a practical advantage over some other DPP-4 inhibitors [^116vVCcq] [^117WRBby] [^115VMPnW] [^115VMPnW].

> Next, I will examine efficacy as monotherapy. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 18–24 weeks, linagliptin 5 mg reduced A1C by about 0.4% versus placebo, with consistent effects across subgroups; rescue therapy was needed less often with linagliptin, and body weight did not change meaningfully, supporting a weight-neutral profile in this context [^113sFoUY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combination therapy; I should review key add-on data. When added to metformin, linagliptin produced a placebo-subtracted A1C reduction around 0.5–0.7% in 24-week trials, with low hypoglycemia and no weight gain; similar benefits were seen with pioglitazone co-therapy, again with weight neutrality and low hypoglycemia risk, reinforcing its role as a combination agent [^115MkzXQ] [^11357ZW1].

> I need to check insulin-based regimens. Adding linagliptin to basal insulin (with or without metformin) reduced A1C by about 0.6–0.7% versus placebo at 24 weeks, with no increase in hypoglycemia and minimal insulin dose changes; this is clinically useful when insulin titration is limited by hypoglycemia or when oral therapy is preferred alongside insulin [^114PMWJ9] [^116R9m8F].

> Let me consider early combination strategies. In patients with marked hyperglycemia at diagnosis, initial linagliptin plus metformin achieved greater A1C reductions than linagliptin alone and increased the proportion reaching A1C ≤ 6.5% without excess hypoglycemia; pooled analyses suggest this approach can accelerate glycemic control early in disease, though metformin remains foundational when tolerated [^113LoboR] [^1178oGxL].

> I should confirm the head-to-head versus sulfonylurea data. In a 104-week randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial, linagliptin was noninferior to glimepiride for A1C change, with substantially less hypoglycemia (7% vs 36%) and less weight gain; importantly, cardiovascular events were fewer with linagliptin, although this was a secondary outcome and should be interpreted cautiously [^117R6Mde].

> Now, I will examine cardiovascular safety, since this is often decisive. In CARMELINA, a large placebo-controlled outcomes trial in high cardio-renal risk patients, linagliptin met noninferiority for 3-point MACE (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89–1.17), with the upper bound below the 1.3 margin; there was no excess heart failure hospitalization, supporting cardiovascular neutrality in this population [^115r9fa7] [^1117gK1C].

> Wait, let me verify the active-comparator cardiovascular data. In CAROLINA, linagliptin was noninferior to glimepiride for 3-point MACE over a median 6.3 years (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84–1.14), again meeting noninferiority; this addresses a common clinical question about choosing linagliptin over a sulfonylurea when both are reasonable options [^1118RLHq].

> I should double-check renal outcomes and use in CKD. Linagliptin requires no dose adjustment across eGFR ranges, and in a pooled analysis of 13 trials, it reduced a composite kidney disease endpoint by 16% versus placebo, suggesting favorable renal safety signals, although this was a secondary analysis and warrants confirmation; nonetheless, this supports use in CKD where metformin may be limited [^1166nvwx] [^111yT69t].

> Let me review safety and tolerability comprehensively. Common adverse effects include nasopharyngitis and mild gastrointestinal symptoms; serious but uncommon risks include acute pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema), severe arthralgia, and bullous pemphigoid; hypoglycemia is uncommon with monotherapy but increases when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, so dose reduction of the secretagogue should be considered [^111owndA] [^1165aamv].

> I need to ensure I cover special populations. In adults 65 years and older, linagliptin maintains efficacy and a favorable safety profile with low hypoglycemia, and no dose adjustment is needed; in severe renal impairment, exposure increases modestly but no dose change is required, and clinical experience supports continued use; in hepatic impairment, no adjustment is needed either, though clinical data are more limited [^117WRBby] [^113TFdKH] [^112M7iZU].

> But wait, what about pediatrics and pregnancy. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in adolescents with type 2 diabetes in the DINAMO trial, so linagliptin is not established for pediatric use; in pregnancy, animal data suggest potential fetal risk, and insulin remains first-line, so linagliptin should generally be avoided in pregnancy unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^117WRBby] [^117HAd3h] [^115kVbGz].

> I should confirm drug interactions. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein (for example, rifampin) can reduce linagliptin exposure and efficacy; if coadministration is necessary, consider alternative glucose-lowering therapy or close monitoring, recognizing the evidence base is limited for clinical outcomes in this scenario [^112wVHFZ].

> Let me synthesize practical prescribing pearls. Linagliptin is a good option when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, in older adults at high hypoglycemia risk, in CKD where dose adjustments are burdensome, or as an add-on to metformin, pioglitazone, or insulin when additional A1C lowering is needed; it is weight-neutral and has a low hypoglycemia risk, but I should counsel on pancreatitis symptoms, hypersensitivity, and arthralgia, and adjust secretagogue doses when combined to mitigate hypoglycemia [^115HPdQM] [^111SDmez] [^1165aamv].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line. Linagliptin 5 mg once daily is an effective, generally well-tolerated DPP-4 inhibitor with a favorable renal/hepatic profile and cardiovascular neutrality in outcomes trials; it offers modest A1C lowering (~0.4–0.7% depending on background therapy), low hypoglycemia risk, and weight neutrality, making it a reasonable choice across a broad range of adults with type 2 diabetes, particularly when hypoglycemia avoidance, CKD, or polypharmacy are priorities [^116vVCcq] [^113sFoUY] [^115MkzXQ] [^115r9fa7] [^1118RLHq].

---

## Drug interactions

Strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers (e.g. rifampin) **reduce linagliptin exposure**; consider alternatives or monitor closely [^115YniBS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines position linagliptin as a **second-line option** after metformin, especially for patients with CKD, older adults, or those at hypoglycemia risk [^115HPdQM] [^111SDmez].

---

## Patient counseling points

After 52 and 104 weeks, TRADJENTA and glimepiride both had reductions from baseline in A1C (52 weeks: -0.4% for TRADJENTA, -0.6% for glimepiride; 104 weeks: -0.2% for TRADJENTA, -0.4% for glimepiride) from a baseline mean of 7.7% (Table 8). The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was 0.2% with 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval (0.1%, 0.3%) for the intent-to-treat population using last observation carried forward. These results were consistent with the completers analysis.

Patients treated with linagliptin had a mean baseline body weight of 86 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean decrease in body weight of 1.1 kg at 52 weeks and 1.4 kg at 104 weeks. Patients on glimepiride had a mean baseline body weight of 87 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean increase from baseline in body weight of 1.4 kg at 52 weeks and 1.3 kg at 104 weeks (treatment difference p < 0.0001 for both timepoints).

Active-Controlled Trial vs Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin

The efficacy of TRADJENTA was evaluated in a 104-week, double-blind, glimepiride-controlled, non-inferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control despite metformin therapy. Patients being treated with metformin only entered a run-in period of 2 weeks' duration, whereas patients pretreated with metformin and one additional antihyperglycemic agent entered a run-in treatment period of 6 weeks' duration with metformin monotherapy (dosage of ≥ 1,500 mg/day) and washout of the other agent. After an additional 2-week placebo run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily or glimepiride. Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (< 8.5% vs ≥ 8.5%), and the previous use of antidiabetic drugs (metformin alone vs metformin plus one other OAD). Patients receiving glimepiride were given an initial dosage of 1 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 12 weeks to a maximum dosage of 4 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glimepiride dosage was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TRADJENTA have not been established in pediatric patients.

Effectiveness of TRADJENTA was not demonstrated in a 26-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03429543) in 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In linagliptin studies, 1,085 linagliptin-treated patients were 65 years of age and older and 131 patients were 75 years of age and older. In these linagliptin studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness of linagliptin were observed between geriatric patients and younger adult patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In the TRADJENTA treatment arm of the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14)], 2,200 (63%) patients had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Approximately 20% of the population had eGFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², 28% of the population had eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²and 15% had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The overall incidence of adverse reactions were generally similar between the TRADJENTA and placebo treatment arms.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Monotherapy

A total of 730 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18 weeks' and another of 24 weeks' duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRADJENTA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 6 weeks that included an open-label placebo run-in during the last 2 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. In the 18-week trial, only patients ineligible for metformin were recruited. In the 18-week trial, 76 patients were randomized to placebo and 151 to TRADJENTA 5 mg; in the 24-week trial, 167 patients were randomized to placebo and 336 to TRADJENTA 5 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the 18-week trial received rescue therapy with pioglitazone and/or insulin; metformin rescue therapy was used in the 24-week trial.

Treatment with TRADJENTA 5 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 5). In the 18-week trial, 12% of patients receiving TRADJENTA 5 mg and 18% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week trial, 10.2% of patients receiving TRADJENTA 5 mg and 20.9% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared with placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, baseline BMI, or a standard index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, the mean reduction in A1C with TRADJENTA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, the changes from baseline in A1C were -0.4% and -0.4%, respectively, for those given TRADJENTA, and 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, for those given placebo. Change from baseline in body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.

Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin

A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of TRADJENTA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin (n = 491) at a dosage of at least 1,500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (n = 207) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 6 weeks on metformin (at a dosage of at least 1,500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either TRADJENTA 5 mg or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glimepiride rescue.

In combination with metformin, TRADJENTA provided statistically significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 6). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 7.8% of patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg and in 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Add-On Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone

A total of 389 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of TRADJENTA in combination with pioglitazone. Therapy was stopped in patients on oral antihyperglycemic therapy for a period of 6 weeks (4 weeks followed by a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period). Drug-naïve patients entered directly into the 2-week placebo run-in period. After the run-in period, patients were randomized to receive either TRADJENTA 5 mg or placebo, both in addition to pioglitazone 30 mg daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and FPG.

In initial combination with pioglitazone 30 mg, TRADJENTA 5 mg provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 9). Rescue therapy was used in 7.9% of patients treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg/pioglitazone 30 mg and 14.1% of patients treated with placebo/pioglitazone 30 mg. Patient weight increased in both groups during the trial with an adjusted mean change from baseline of 2.3 kg and 1.2 kg in the TRADJENTA 5 mg/pioglitazone 30 mg and placebo/pioglitazone 30 mg groups, respectively (p = 0.0141).

The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of one of three composite outcomes which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE.

The results of CARMELINA, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 13. The estimated hazard ratio for MACE associated with TRADJENTA relative to placebo was 1.02 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.17). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.17, excluded the risk margin of 1.3. The Kaplan-Meier curve depicting time to first occurrence of MACE is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1	Kaplan-Meier: Time to First Occurrence of MACE in the CARMELINA Trial

CAROLINA

The cardiovascular risk of TRADJENTA was evaluated in CAROLINA, a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing TRADJENTA (N = 3,023) to glimepiride (N = 3,010) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of established cardiovascular disease and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between TRADJENTA and glimepiride when these were added to standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. The trial was event driven, the median duration of follow-up was 6.23 years and vital status was obtained for 99.3% of patients.

Patients were eligible to enter the trial if they were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control (defined as HbA1c of 6.5% to 8.5% or 6.5% to 7.5% depending on whether treatment-naïve, on monotherapy or on combination therapy), and were defined to be at high cardiovascular risk with previous vascular disease, evidence of vascular related end-organ damage, age ≥ 70 years, and/or two cardiovascular risk factors (duration of diabetes mellitus > 10 years, systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, current smoker, LDL cholesterol ≥ 135 mg/dL).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety evaluation of TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is based on 14 placebo-controlled trials, 1 active-controlled trial, and one trial in patients with severe renal impairment. In the 14 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 3,625 patients were randomized and treated with TRADJENTA 5 mg daily and 2,176 with placebo. The mean exposure in patients treated with TRADJENTA across studies was 29.6 weeks. The maximum follow-up was 78 weeks.

TRADJENTA 5 mg once daily was studied as monotherapy in three placebo-controlled trials of 18 and 24 weeks' duration and in five additional placebo-controlled studies lasting ≤ 18 weeks. The use of TRADJENTA in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents was studied in six placebo-controlled trials: two with metformin (12 and 24 weeks' treatment duration); one with a sulfonylurea (18 weeks' treatment duration); one with metformin and sulfonylurea (24 weeks' treatment duration); one with pioglitazone (24 weeks' treatment duration); and one with insulin (primary endpoint at 24 weeks).

14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

TRADJENTA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, and insulin. TRADJENTA has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe chronic renal impairment.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with TRADJENTA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared with placebo.

Regarding the use of linagliptin PO (also known as Tradjenta) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Insulin is the preferred first-line treatment for diabetes in pregnancy. The drug linagliptin PO (also known as Tradjenta) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Strong P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inducer: The efficacy of TRADJENTA may be reduced when administered in combination (e.g., with rifampin). Use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended. (7.1)

7.1 Inducers of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 Enzymes

Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of TRADJENTA may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when linagliptin is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Coadministration of TRADJENTA with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower dosages of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Linagliptin (Tradjenta) [^1157NdEV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in better regulation of glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4, but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100 mg dose. At the 100 mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5 mg dose.

Elimination

Linagliptin has a terminal half-life of about 200 hours at steady-state, though the accumulation half-life is about 11 hours. Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min.

Metabolism

Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin.

Excretion

Following administration of an oral [14C]-linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepatic system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing.

Patients with Renal Impairment

An open-label pharmacokinetic study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin 5 mg in male and female patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment. The study included 6 healthy subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 80 mL/min), 6 patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to < 80 mL/min), 6 patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 50 mL/min), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), and 11 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects.

In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linagliptin increased (AUCτ, ssby 71% and Cmaxby 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-life, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUCτ, ssby 42% and Cmaxby 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose.

These findings were further supported by the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses.

### Linagliptin for patients aged 70 years or older with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with common antidiabetes treatments: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113wFtbf]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

A substantial proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes are elderly (≥ 65 years) but this group has been largely excluded from clinical studies of glucose-lowering drugs. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multinational phase 3 study, patients aged 70 years or older with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7.0% or more, receiving metformin, sulfonylureas, or basal insulin, or combinations of these drugs, were randomised (by computer-generated randomisation sequence, concealed with a voice-response system, stratified by HbA1c level [< 8.5% vs ≥ 8.5%] and insulin use [yes vs no], block size four) in a 2:1 ratio to once-daily oral treatment with linagliptin 5 mg or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Investigators and participants were masked to assignment throughout the study. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01084005.

Findings

241 community-living outpatients were randomised (162 linagliptin, 79 placebo). Mean age was 74.9 years (SD 4.3). Mean HbA1c was 7.8% (SD 0.8). At week 24, placebo-adjusted mean change in HbA1c with linagliptin was -0.64% (95% CI -0.81 to -0.48, p < 0.0001). Overall safety and tolerability were much the same between the linagliptin and placebo groups; 75.9% of patients in both groups had an adverse event (linagliptin n = 123, placebo n = 60). No deaths occurred. Serious adverse events occurred in 8.6% (14) of patients in the linagliptin group and 6.3% (five) patients in the placebo group; none were deemed related to study drug. Hypoglycaemia was the most common adverse event in both groups, but did not differ between groups (24.1% [39] in the linagliptin group, 16.5% [13] in the placebo group; odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.78–3.78, p = 0.2083).

Interpretation

In elderly patients with type 2 diabetes linagliptin was efficacious in lowering glucose with a safety profile similar to placebo. These findings could inform treatment decisions for achieving individualised glycaemic goals with minimal risk in this important population of patients.

### 2-year efficacy and safety of linagliptin compared with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin: a randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^117R6Mde]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Addition of a sulphonylurea to metformin improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, but is associated with hypoglycaemia and weight gain. We aimed to compare a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (linagliptin) against a commonly used sulphonylurea (glimepiride).

Methods

In this 2-year, parallel-group, non-inferiority double-blind trial, outpatients with type 2 diabetes and glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) 6.5–10.0% on stable metformin alone or with one additional oral antidiabetic drug (washed out during screening) were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated random sequence via a voice or web response system to linagliptin (5 mg) or glimepiride (1–4 mg) orally once daily. Study investigators and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 104. Analyses included all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one dose of treatment, had a baseline HbA(1c) measurement, and had at least one on-treatment HbA(1c) measurement. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00622284.

Findings

777 patients were randomly assigned to linagliptin and 775 to glimepiride; 764 and 755 were included in analysis of the primary endpoint. Reductions in adjusted mean HbA(1c) (baseline 7.69% [SE 0.03] in both groups) were similar in the linagliptin (-0.16% [SE 0.03]) and glimepiride groups (-0.36% [0.03]; difference 0.20%, 97.5% CI 0.09–0.30), meeting the predefined non-inferiority criterion of 0.35%. Fewer participants had hypoglycaemia (58 [7%] of 776 vs 280 [36%] of 775 patients, p < 0.0001) or severe hypoglycaemia (1 [< 1%] vs 12 [2%]) with linagliptin compared with glimepiride. Linagliptin was associated with significantly fewer cardiovascular events (12 vs 26 patients; relative risk 0.46, 95% CI 0.23–0.91, p = 0.0213).

Interpretation

The results of this long-term randomised active-controlled trial advance the clinical evidence and comparative effectiveness bases for treatment options available to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The findings could improve decision making for clinical treatment when metformin alone is insufficient.

### Cardiovascular safety with linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified, prospective, and adjudicated meta-analysis of a phase 3 programme [^112ZzKRE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were based on individual patient data in the treated set, which was defined as all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication, in all Phase 3 studies. Descriptive statistics (incidence and incidence rates per 1000 patient-years) were determined for all endpoints in each of the pooled treatment groups within the treated set.

The primary analyses assessed the CV risk for all primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints associated with linagliptin versus total comparators. Risk estimates were calculated using several common statistical methods that included: (i) the hazard ratio (HR) for time to first event calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model with adjustments for study and treatment group; (ii) the incidence-rate risk ratio (RR) for time to first event calculated using Poisson regression with adjustment for study and treatment group; (iii) the odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of events calculated using a stratified Exact test; and (iv) the RR for occurrence of events calculated using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with continuity correction for trials with zero events.

Sensitivity analyses included evaluation of the primary endpoint associated with linagliptin versus total comparators in pre-specified subgroups based on age, gender, race, and use of rescue medication, as well as further exploratory subgroups based on occurrence of hypoglycaemia and Framingham 10-year CV risk score. In addition, a post hoc analysis of the primary endpoint assessed events in linagliptin- and placebo-treated patients, taken only from placebo-controlled trials and placebo-controlled periods within trials. In addition, the influence on the primary endpoint of the factors: study, treatment, gender, race and time since diagnosis of diabetes, was investigated using Cox regression.

This combined study analysis was developed to fully adhere to the recent FDA guidance on assessment of CV safety for the development of oral glucose-lowering drugs.

### Effects of adding linagliptin to basal insulin regimen for inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes: a ≥ 52-week randomized, double-blind study [^1112VcDG]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

End points and assessments

The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in HbA 1c after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included changes from baseline in HbA 1c and FPG with time, change from baseline in FPG after 52 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients achieving HbA 1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol), the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA 1c, and the change from baseline in mean basal insulin dose after 52 weeks of treatment. Other end points included the use of rescue medication and mean change in body weight to the end of treatment.

Safety end points included the frequency and intensity of adverse events (AEs), including hypoglycemia and clinically relevant new or worsening findings in physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, lipid parameters, and clinical laboratory assessments. An independent external adjudication committee reviewed treatment-emergent fatal events and suspected events of stroke or cardiac ischemia (including myocardial infarction), hospitalization for heart failure, stent thrombosis, and revascularization procedures. Follow-up for all AEs, including those persisting after a patient had completed (or withdrawn prematurely from) the trial, continued until the event had resolved or been sufficiently characterized.

Exploratory Analyses: Linagliptin versus Sitagliptin

Additional exploratory sensitivity analyses, including all three study treatments, compared the effects of linagliptin (n = 39) and sitagliptin (n = 40) on the primary and secondary endpoints, between baseline and day 28. The reduction of WMG was numerically greater with sitagliptin compared with linagliptin on day 28 (difference of 0.3 ± 0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI −0.1 to 0.8; P = 0.1274). The corresponding increase in intact GLP-1 AUEC 0–2h was numerically greater with linagliptin than with sitagliptin (difference of 2.8 ± 2.7 pmol/h/L; 95% CI −2.7 to 8.2; P = 0.3130). For FPG and glucose AUEC 0–3h, the reductions were numerically greater for sitagliptin versus linagliptin, with differences of 0.3 ± 0.2 mmol/L (95% CI −0.2 to 0.8; P = 0.2281) and 1.3 ± 1.0 mmol/h/L (95% CI −0.8 to 3.3; P = 0.2230), respectively. None of the observed differences between linagliptin and sitagliptin, for primary and secondary endpoints, were statistically significant.

### Initial combination of linagliptin and metformin compared with linagliptin monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and marked hyperglycaemia: a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group, multinational clinical trial [^113LoboR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate glucose-lowering treatment strategies with linagliptin and metformin in people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and marked hyperglycaemia, a prevalent population for which few dedicated studies of oral antidiabetes drugs have been conducted.

Methods

A total of 316 patients, with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for ≤ 12months and with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration in the range 8.5–12.0%, were randomized 1:1 to double-blind, free-combination treatment with linagliptin 5mg once daily and metformin twice daily (uptitrated to 2000mg/day maximum) or to linagliptin monotherapy. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c concentration from baseline at week 24 (per-protocol completers' cohort: n = 245).

Results

The mean (standard deviation) age and HbA1c at baseline were 48.8 (11.0) years and 9.8 (1.1)%, respectively. At week 24, the mean ± standard error (s.e.) HbA1c decreased from baseline by -2.8 ± 0.1% with linagliptin/metformin and -2.0 ± 0.1% with linagliptin; a treatment difference of -0.8% (95% confidence interval -1.1 to -0.5; p < 0.0001). Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis based on intent-to-treat principles: adjusted mean ± s.e. changes in HbA1c of -2.7 ± 0.1% and -1.8 ± 0.1%, respectively; treatment difference of -0.9% (95% CI -1.3 to -0.6; p < 0.0001). A treatment response of HbA1c < 7.0% was achieved by 61 and 40% of patients in the linagliptin/metformin and linagliptin groups, respectively. Few patients experienced drug-related adverse events (8.8 and 5.7% of patients in the linagliptin/metformin and linagliptin groups, respectively). Hypoglycaemia occurred in 1.9 and 3.2% of patients in the linagliptin/metformin and linagliptin groups, respectively (no severe episodes). Body weight decreased significantly with the combination therapy (-1.3kg between-group difference; p = 0.0033).

Conclusions

Linagliptin in initial combination with metformin in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and marked hyperglycaemia, an understudied group, elicited significant improvements in glycaemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia, weight gain or other adverse effects. These results support early combination treatment strategies and suggest that newly diagnosed patients with marked hyperglycaemia may be effectively managed with oral, non-insulin therapy.

### Linagliptin (BI 1356), a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor, is safe and efficacious in combination with metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [^114TXR19]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, added to ongoing metformin therapy, were assessed in patients with Type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 10%; ≥ 58.5 to ≤ 85.8 mmol/mol) with metformin alone.

Methods

Patients (n = 333) were randomized to receive double-blind linagliptin (1, 5 or 10 mg once daily) or placebo or open-label glimepiride (1–3 mg once daily). The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in HbA(1c) at week 12 in patients receiving combination therapy compared with metformin alone.

Results

Twelve weeks of treatment resulted in a mean (sem) placebo-corrected lowering in HbA(1c) levels of 0.40% (± 0.14); 4.4 mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 1 mg linagliptin, 0.73% (± 0.14); 8.0 mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 5 mg, and 0.67% (± 0.14); 7.3 mmol/mol (± 1.5) for 10 mg. Differences between linagliptin and placebo were statistically significant for all doses (1 mg, P = 0.01; 5 mg and 10 mg, P < 0.0001). The change in mean (sem) placebo-corrected HbA(1c) from baseline was -0.90% (± 0.13); -9.8 mmol/mol (± 1.4) for glimepiride. Adjusted and placebo-corrected mean changes in fasting plasma glucose were -1.1 mmol/l for linagliptin 1 mg (P = 0.002), -1.9 mmol/l for 5 mg and -1.6 mmol/l for 10 mg (both P < 0.0001). One hundred and six (43.1%) patients reported adverse events; the incidence was similar across all five groups. There were no hypoglycaemic events for linagliptin or placebo, whereas three patients (5%) receiving glimepiride experienced hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

The addition of linagliptin to ongoing metformin treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes was well tolerated and resulted in significant and clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control, with 5 mg linagliptin being the most effective dose.

Linagliptin treatment versus comparators was associated with reduced CV risk for the primary endpoint. The HR for the primary endpoint indicated a significant risk reduction, as did the OR and RR, for linagliptin versus comparator (i.e. upper bound of 2-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] < 1.0) (Figure 1). The difference in CV risk for the primary endpoint emerged after approximately 8 weeks and did not tend to plateau thereafter (Figure 2). Further analysis of the primary endpoint for linagliptin against placebo in those patients taken from the same placebo-controlled trials confirmed that linagliptin was associated with no significantly increased risk for the primary endpoint. The HR, OR, and RR with linagliptin versus placebo ranged from 0.69 to 0.90, but all had upper limits of 95% CIs that included 1.0.

The incidence rates for the primary endpoint and the associated CV risk reductions with linagliptin versus comparators in a number of subgroups (based on age, gender, race, rescue medication use, hypoglycaemia occurrence, or Framingham CV risk score) were generally consistent with the results in the overall population (Table 5 and Additional file 2). There were no significant increases in risk based on the HR and RR for the primary endpoint with linagliptin relative to comparators in any subgroup. However, linagliptin did achieve significant risk reductions over comparators in several subgroups, including males, whites, those receiving no rescue medication, those reporting no hypoglycaemia, and those with higher CV risk (Framingham CV risk score > 15%). Further, in the Cox regression analysis the HR was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17–0.74) in a model where study, treatment, gender, race and time since diagnosis of diabetes were taken into account, i.e. fully in line with the HR seen in the simple Cox model (0.34).

### Linagliptin increases incretin levels, lowers glucagon, and improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112z5F9Q]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical Analyses

The primary, secondary, and other quantitative pharmacodynamic endpoints were evaluated using an analysis of covariance model with treatment as the fixed effect. For each endpoint, the corresponding baseline value (obtained at day −1) was included in the model as a linear covariate. The variables, previous use of antidiabetic agents, and HbA 1c [< 8.5% vs. ≥ 8.5% (< 69.4 vs. ≥ 69.4 mmol/mol)] at baseline, were included in the model, as the randomization was stratified using these parameters. Testing of superiority of linagliptin versus placebo for the primary and secondary endpoints after 4 weeks of treatment was performed (one-sided at the 0.025 level). The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was used for treatment comparisons of DPP-4 inhibition, and Hodges–Lehmann estimates for the median differences and their confidence intervals (CIs).

For sample size estimation, the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in WMG was assumed to be −17.2 mg/dL (0.95 mmol/L), with a SD of 22.6 mg/dL (1.25 mmol/L) (based on a study by Brazg et al.). Lower variability was assumed for the other primary endpoint, GLP-1 AUEC 0–2h. Based on these assumptions, 38 completers per treatment arm were needed to achieve a power of 90% for the change in WMG, whereas the power was greater than 98% for GLP-1 AUEC 0–2h.

A per protocol set of patients was created for analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints to compare linagliptin with placebo. In addition, an exploratory analysis was performed using the data obtained from subjects receiving sitagliptin treatment. However, the trial was not designed or sufficiently powered to compare the efficacy or tolerability of linagliptin with sitagliptin.

Results

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across the patient groups. The mean (SD) baseline values for HbA 1c were 7.3% (0.53%), and for FPG were 9.25 (1.53) mmol/L. Diabetes medications used previously (67.8% of patients) were metformin (55.4%), sulfonylureas (9.1%), and glinides (3.3%). A total of 121 patients was randomly assigned (40 to placebo, 40 to linagliptin, and 41 to sitagliptin). Three patients (2.5%) withdrew from the study prematurely: two patients in the placebo arm who experienced hyperglycemia, and one patient in the linagliptin group for whom there was difficulty in obtaining blood samples. One subject in the placebo group had a protocol violation that was considered to be important during blinded review (incorrect timing of administration of trial medication). The analysis of secondary, but not the primary, endpoints excluded this patient and was performed using data obtained from the 117 patients who completed the study without relevant protocol violations. Data on demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety were derived from the complete patient set (n = 121).

Primary and Secondary Endpoints

After 4 weeks of treatment, linagliptin elicited decreases in 24-h WMG and increases in GLP-1 AUEC 0–2h (Table 1). These changes were significantly larger than those seen with placebo (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Likewise, linagliptin achieved significant placebo-corrected changes from baseline for FPG and for glucose AUEC 0–3h.

### Effects of adding linagliptin to basal insulin regimen for inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes: a ≥ 52-week randomized, double-blind study [^114PMWJ9]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of linagliptin added to basal insulins in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin with or without oral agents.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 1,261 patients (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% [53 mmol/mol] to ≤ 10.0% [86 mmol/mol]) on basal insulin alone or combined with metformin and/or pioglitazone were randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment with linagliptin 5 mg once daily or placebo for ≥ 52 weeks. The basal insulin dose was kept unchanged for 24 weeks but could thereafter be titrated according to fasting plasma glucose levels at the investigators' discretion. The primary end point was the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. The safety analysis incorporated data up to a maximum of 110 weeks.

Results

At week 24, HbA1c changed from a baseline of 8.3% (67 mmol/mol) by -0.6% (-6.6 mmol/mol) and by 0.1% (1.1 mmol/mol) with linagliptin and placebo, respectively (treatment difference -0.65% [95% CI -0.74 to -0.55] [-7.1 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001). Despite the option to uptitrate basal insulin, it was adjusted only slightly upward (week 52, linagliptin 2.6 IU/day, placebo 4.2 IU/day; P < 0.003), resulting in no further HbA1c improvements. Frequencies of hypoglycemia (week 24, linagliptin 22.0%, placebo 23.2%; treatment end, linagliptin 31.4%, placebo 32.9%) and adverse events (linagliptin 78.4%, placebo 81.4%) were similar between groups. Mean body weight remained unchanged (week 52, linagliptin -0.30 kg, placebo -0.04 kg).

Conclusions

Linagliptin added to basal insulin therapy significantly improved glycemic control relative to placebo without increasing hypoglycemia or body weight.

### Linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: two 24-week randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials [^112ysLqM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin vs placebo as add-on to empagliflozin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

Patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite stable-dose metformin received open-label empagliflozin 10 mg (study 1) or 25 mg (study 2) as add-on therapy for 16 weeks. Subsequently, those with HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.5% (> 53 and ≤ 91 mmol/mol) (N = 482) were randomized to 24 weeks' double-blind, double-dummy treatment with linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in study 1, or to linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in study 2; all patients continued treatment with metformin and empagliflozin 10 mg (study 1) or metformin and empagliflozin 25 mg (study 2). The primary endpoint was change from baseline (defined as the last value before first intake of randomized, double-blind treatment) in HbA1c at week 24.

Results

At week 24, HbA1c (mean baseline 7.82–8.04 [62–64 mmol/mol]) was significantly reduced with linagliptin vs placebo; adjusted mean (SE) differences in change from baseline in HbA1c with linagliptin vs placebo were -.32% (.10) (-3.59 [1.08] mmol/mol) (P = 0.001) for patients on empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin, and -0.47% (0.10) (-5.15 [1.04] mmol/mol) (P < 0.001) for patients on empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin. Adverse events were reported in more patients receiving placebo than in those receiving linagliptin: 55.5% vs 48.4% in study 1 and 58.9% vs 52.7% in study 2.

Conclusions

Linagliptin as add-on to empagliflozin and metformin for 24 weeks improved glycaemic control vs placebo, and was well tolerated.

Endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA 1c after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose over time, the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose after 24 weeks, the percentage of patients who attained HbA 1c levels < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and < 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) after 24 weeks, and the percentage of patients who achieved a reduction of ≥ 6 mmol/mol (0.5%) in HbA 1c after 24 weeks. Other endpoints included the use of rescue therapy and changes in homeostasis model assessment [β-cell function (HOMA-%B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], disposition index, body weight and plasma lipids after 24 weeks.

Safety endpoints included the frequency and intensity of adverse events, including hypoglycaemia, and clinically relevant new or worsening findings in physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory variables. An independent external clinical event committee reviewed treatment-emergent fatal events and suspected events of stroke, myocardial ischaemia (including myocardial infarction), hospitalization for heart failure, stent thrombosis and revascularization procedures.

### Efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus placebo and the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin versus placebo in young people with type 2 diabetes (DINAMO): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group, phase 3 trial [^117HAd3h]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of type 2 diabetes in young people is increasing, but treatments remain limited. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of an empagliflozin dosing regimen versus placebo and linagliptin versus placebo on glycaemic control in young people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done in 108 centres in 15 countries, participants with type 2 diabetes (aged 10–17 years; HbA 1c 6.5–10.5% [48–91 mmol/mol]) who had been previously treated with metformin or insulin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to oral empagliflozin 10 mg, oral linagliptin 5 mg, or placebo. Participants in the empagliflozin group who did not have HbA 1c below 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) by week 12 underwent a second double-blinded randomisation (1:1) at week 14, either remaining on 10 mg or increasing to 25 mg. Participants in the placebo group were randomly reassigned (1:1:1) in a double-blinded manner at week 26 to linagliptin 5 mg or one of the empagliflozin doses (10 mg or 25 mg). Investigators were masked throughout the trial and received assignments of blinded medication kits through interactive response technology for all participants at the initial randomisation and for the re-randomisations at weeks 14 and 26. The primary outcome was change from baseline in HbA 1c at 26 weeks. For empagliflozin, results were based on a pooled analysis for all participants on empagliflozin. Safety was assessed until week 52. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429543.

Findings

Between April 26, 2018, and May 26, 2022, of 262 screened participants, 158 (60%) were randomly assigned to treatment (53 [34%] to placebo, 52 [33%] to empagliflozin 10 mg, and 53 [34%] to linagliptin). For the primary outcome, the adjusted mean HbA 1c change from baseline at week 26 was -0.84% [-9.2 mmol/mol] in the empagliflozin pooled group versus placebo (95% CI -1.50 to -0.19 [-16.4 to -2.1]; p = 0.012); the corresponding change from baseline for linagliptin versus placebo was -0.34% [-3.8 mmol/mol; 95% CI -0.99 to 0.30 [-10.8 to 3.3]; p = 0.29). Adverse events occurred in 34 (64%) participants in the placebo group, 40 (77%) in the empagliflozin pooled group, and 37 (71%) in the linagliptin group, up to week 26. Of these, severe adverse events were reported in two (4%) participants in the placebo group, one (2%) in the empagliflozin pooled group, and one (2%) in the linagliptin group. Hypoglycaemia was the most frequently reported adverse event with higher rates for those on active drug treatment compared with placebo. No severe hypoglycaemia cases were reported.

Interpretation

Empagliflozin provided clinically relevant placebo-corrected reductions in HbA 1c, whereas linagliptin did not, and might offer a new treatment option for young people with type 2 diabetes.

14.4 Active-Controlled Study vs Glimepiride in Combination with
Metformin

The efficacy
of linagliptin was evaluated in a 104-week double-blind, glimepiride-controlled
non-inferiority study in type 2 diabetic patients with insufficient
glycemic control despite metformin therapy. Patients being treated
with metformin only entered a run-in period of 2 weeks' duration,
whereas patients pretreated with metformin and one additional antihyperglycemic
agent entered a run-in treatment period of 6 weeks' duration with
metformin monotherapy (dose of ≥ 1500 mg per day) and washout of the
other agent. After an additional 2-week placebo run-in period, those
with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized
1:1 to the addition of linagliptin 5 mg once daily or glimepiride.
Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (< 8.5% vs ≥ 8.5%),
and the previous use of antidiabetic drugs (metformin alone vs metformin
plus one other OAD). Patients receiving glimepiride were given an
initial dose of 1 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next
12 weeks to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic
control. Thereafter, the glimepiride dose was to be kept constant,
except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the CArdiovascular safety and renal microvascular outcomE study with LINAgliptin (CARMELINA): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardio-renal risk [^114cGghx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 611 primary (3P-MACE) events provides 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of linagliptin versus placebo at the overall one-sided α-level of 2.5% if the hazard ratio is 1.0. The sample size and event estimates were based on the primary hypothesis.

If non-inferiority has been demonstrated, then superiority with regard to the primary outcome will be tested. Assuming 611 patients with an event and a hazard rate for linagliptin at any time 20% less than the risk for placebo, then the resulting power to demonstrate superiority at the final analysis is 79% for a test at the α-level of 2.5%.

Assuming 432 patients with a composite kidney outcome, an annualized event rate of 2.5% in the placebo group and a hazard rate for linagliptin of 0.75, then the resulting power to demonstrate superiority for the key secondary outcome at the final analysis is 85% if the test can be performed at the α-level of 2.5%.

The primary and key secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the treated set (all patients treated with at least one dose of study drug) with treatment assignment at randomization and including all adjudication-confirmed events that occur until study end. The primary and key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model of time to the first event, with randomized treatment and geographical region as factors.

Sensitivity analyses will be conducted on the per-protocol set, which excludes patients with important protocol violations such as incorrect study drug taken; the on-treatment set with a minimum treatment duration of 30 days; and the treated set with censoring at 30 days after last dose of study drug (treated set + 30). For these analyses, events will be considered that have occurred no later than 30 days after last intake of study drug. An additional analysis will only include outcome events until last study drug intake (treated set + 0).

### Cardiovascular safety with linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified, prospective, and adjudicated meta-analysis of a phase 3 programme [^112nhwcF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics and drug exposure

The current analysis included eight trials with a total of 5239 treated patients: 3319 received linagliptin once daily (5 mg: n = 3159, 10 mg: n = 160) and 1920 comparators (placebo: n = 977, glimepiride: n = 781, and voglibose: n = 162) (see Additional file 1). Patients were followed for a median (min, max) period of 175 (1, 617) days for linagliptin and 179 (1, 619) days for total comparators (169 [1, 367] for placebo and 409 [3, 619] for active comparators). Cumulative exposure (patient-years) was 2060 for linagliptin and 1372 for total comparators (422 for placebo, 872 for glimepiride, and 78 for voglibose).

### Cardiovascular safety with linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified, prospective, and adjudicated meta-analysis of a phase 3 programme [^112dahj8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The incidence rates for CV events in this meta-analysis of linagliptin Phase 3 trials were relatively consistent with those observed in previous CV meta-analyses of other DPP-4 inhibitors' clinical trial programmes. The incidence rates (per 1000 patient-years) for the primary CV endpoint were 5.3 for linagliptin versus 16.8 for total comparators. In comparison, other CV meta-analyses reported incidence rates for custom MACE ranging from 5.8 to 14.6 with sitagliptin, saxagliptin, or vildagliptin and 9.0 to 14.1 with comparators. Importantly, these CV meta-analyses have all reported relative risk for CV outcomes with DPP-4 inhibitors versus comparators that were below 1.0. However, not all of these risk estimates achieved statistical significance (based on upper bounds of 95% CI below 1.0). Risk reductions were significant in the present meta-analysis of linagliptin [HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.16–0.70)] and in the previous analysis of saxagliptin 2.5–10 mg [HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.23–0.80)]. In contrast, risk estimates were non-significant for sitagliptin 100 mg [RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.41–1.12)] and vildagliptin 50 mg and 100 mg [RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.64–1.14) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.37–2.11)].

Although the results of the different meta-analyses of DPP-4 inhibitors are not entirely comparable (due to differences in primary composite endpoints and CV adjudication methods), all are supportive of the hypothesis that, in general, DPP-4 inhibitor treatment does not have a deleterious impact on the incidence of CV events. The present analysis shows that linagliptin treatment does not increase CV risk and may even yield CV benefits in patients with T2DM. Meta-analyses of other DPP-4 inhibitors were frequently retrospective in nature. However, the pre-specified design of the present meta-analysis involved prospective and blinded adjudication of CV events, which should strengthen the validity of the current findings. In addition, this meta-analysis was based on individual patient data from a consistently designed, large clinical development programme; this allows consistent derivation of endpoints and extensive subgroup analyses and minimizes between-study heterogeneity that can confound analyses of unrelated studies.

### Linagliptin (Jentadueto) [^1126okkz]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Individualize the starting dose of JENTADUETO based on the patient's current regimen (2.1)
The maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin twice daily (2.1)
Should be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin (2.1)

2.1 Recommended Dosing

The dosage of JENTADUETO should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily. JENTADUETO should be given twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with metformin use. For available dosage forms and strengths see [Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

Recommended starting dose:

In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily
In patients already treated with metformin, start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of the two daily meals (e.g., a patient on metformin 1000 mg twice daily would be started on 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily with meals).
Patients already treated with linagliptin and metformin individual components may be switched to JENTADUETO containing the same doses of each component.

No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of JENTADUETO in patients previously treated with other oral antihyperglycemic agents and switched to JENTADUETO. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.

2.2 Concomitant Use
with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

When JENTADUETO is used
in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or
with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin
may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings
and Precautions (5.5)].

### Efficacy and safety of linagliptin as add-on therapy to insulin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116R9m8F]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

This 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in 206 Chinese patients with inadequately controlled (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5%-10.0%) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving insulin (basal or premixed)± metformin. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive linagliptin 5 mg/d or placebo. The decrease from baseline in HbA1c (primary endpoint) was greater with linagliptin than with placebo (-0.61% vs. -0.20%, adjusted mean difference -0.40%; P = 0.0016). Linagliptin demonstrated significantly greater improvement in 2-hour postprandial glucose (-1.77 mmol/L [-31.95mg/dL]; P < 0.001), and a numerical reduction in fasting plasma glucose (-0.34 mmol/L [-6.2 mg/dL]; P = 0.2241) versus placebo. Proportionally more patients on linagliptin achieved a HbA1c reduction of ≥ 0.5% versus those on placebo (odds ratio 2.293, P < 0.01). Adverse events in both groups were similar, with no new safety findings or clinically relevant changes in body weight. Among investigator-defined hypoglycaemic events (linagliptin: 17.3%; placebo: 12.7%; odds ratio 1.48, P = 0.337), none were severe. In Chinese patients with T2DM, linagliptin add-on to insulin improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain.

### Cardiovascular safety with linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified, prospective, and adjudicated meta-analysis of a phase 3 programme [^114BWGHL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study investigated the cardiovascular (CV) safety profile of the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor linagliptin versus comparator treatments.

Methods

This was a pre-specified meta-analysis of CV events in linagliptin or comparator-treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from eight Phase 3 studies. All suspected CV events were prospectively adjudicated by a blinded independent expert committee. The primary endpoint was a composite of CV death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for unstable angina. Three secondary composite endpoints derived from the adjudicated CV events were also pre-specified. Risk estimates were calculated using several statistical methods including Cox regression analysis.

Results

Of 5239 treated patients (mean ± SD HbA1c 65 ± 10 mmol/mol [8.0 ± 0.9%], age 58 ± 10 years, BMI 29 ± 5 kg/m²), 3319 received linagliptin once daily (5 mg, 3159; 10 mg, 160) and 1920 received comparators (placebo, 977; glimepiride 1–4 mg, 781; voglibose 0.6 mg, 162). Cumulative exposure (patient-years) was 2060 for linagliptin and 1372 for comparators. Primary CV events occurred in 11 (0.3%) patients receiving linagliptin and 23 (1.2%) receiving comparators. The hazard ratio (HR) for the primary endpoint showed significantly lower risk with linagliptin than comparators (HR 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16–0.70]) as did estimates for all secondary endpoints (HR ranging from 0.34 to 0.55 [all upper 95% CIs < 1.0]).

Conclusions

These results from a large Phase 3 programme support the hypothesis that linagliptin may have CV benefits in patients with T2DM.

### Effect of linagliptin vs glimepiride on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: the CAROLINA randomized clinical trial [^1118RLHq]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety trials, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin demonstrated noninferiority, but it has not been tested against an active comparator.

Objective

This trial assessed cardiovascular outcomes of linagliptin vs glimepiride (sulfonylurea) in patients with relatively early type 2 diabetes and risk factors for or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trial, with participant screening from November 2010 to December 2012, conducted at 607 hospital and primary care sites in 43 countries involving 6042 participants. Adults with type 2 diabetes, glycated hemoglobin of 6.5% to 8.5%, and elevated cardiovascular risk were eligible for inclusion. Elevated cardiovascular risk was defined as documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, aged at least 70 years, and evidence of microvascular complications. Follow-up ended in August 2018.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive 5 mg of linagliptin once daily (n = 3023) or 1 to 4 mg of glimepiride once daily (n = 3010) in addition to usual care. Investigators were encouraged to intensify glycemic treatment, primarily by adding or adjusting metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or insulin, according to clinical need.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke with the aim to establish noninferiority of linagliptin vs glimepiride, defined by the upper limit of the 2-sided 95.47% CI for the hazard ratio (HR) of linagliptin relative to glimepiride of less than 1.3.

Results

Of 6042 participants randomized, 6033 (mean age, 64.0 years; 2414 [39.9%] women; mean glycated hemoglobin, 7.2%; median duration of diabetes, 6.3 years; 42% with macrovascular disease; 59% had undergone metformin monotherapy) were treated and analyzed. The median duration of follow-up was 6.3 years. The primary outcome occurred in 356 of 3023 participants (11.8%) in the linagliptin group and 362 of 3010 (12.0%) in the glimepiride group (HR, 0.98 [95.47% CI, 0.84–1.14]; P < .001 for noninferiority), meeting the noninferiority criterion but not superiority (P = 0.76). Adverse events occurred in 2822 participants (93.4%) in the linagliptin group and 2856 (94.9%) in the glimepiride group, with 15 participants (0.5%) in the linagliptin group vs 16 (0.5%) in the glimepiride group with adjudicated-confirmed acute pancreatitis. At least 1 episode of hypoglycemic adverse events occurred in 320 (10.6%) participants in the linagliptin group and 1132 (37.7%) in the glimepiride group (HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.21–0.26]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with relatively early type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk, the use of linagliptin compared with glimepiride over a median 6.3 years resulted in a noninferior risk of a composite cardiovascular outcome.

### Early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycemic control to HbA1c ≤ 6.5% without increasing hypoglycemia: pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^1178oGxL]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines suggest a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target of ≤ 6.5% for type 2 diabetes patients with short duration of disease, few comorbidities and/or long life expectancy-provided this goal can be achieved safely. We explored whether initial combination treatment with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin and metformin could provide better glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) than metformin alone without increasing hypoglycemia.

Methods

We pooled and analyzed individual patient data from two randomized clinical trials of early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin versus metformin monotherapy. The primary outcome in both trials was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. We evaluated the percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at week 24 and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Most (> 70%) of the 1160 patients analyzed were treatment naive, and more than half had had diabetes for ≤ 1 year; mean baseline HbA1c was approximately 8.7%. Combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin resulted in more patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5% than metformin alone, both for a metformin dose of 500 mg (40.1 vs. 22.9%, respectively, odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87–4.32) and 1000 mg (49.5 vs. 35.4%, respectively, OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.54–3.40). Hypoglycemia occurred in < 3% of patients, with a comparable incidence between treatment groups. Other adverse events were also balanced between groups.

Conclusion

Early combination treatment with linagliptin and metformin can improve the chances of achieving tight glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or other adverse events.

### Cardiovascular outcomes and safety with linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, compared with the sulphonylurea glimepiride in older people with type 2 diabetes: a subgroup analysis of the randomized CAROLINA trial [^115W1UR8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants were randomly assigned, with equal probabilities, to receive oral once‐daily treatment with linagliptin 5 mg or glimepiride 1 to 4 mg, with treatment allocation masked. SUs and meglitinides were discontinued at the randomization visit. Individuals naive to glimepiride were initiated at 1 mg and uptitrated every 4 weeks to a maximal dose of 4 mg, while those previously taking glimepiride started on their pretrial dose. During follow‐up, investigators were encouraged to use additional glucose‐lowering drugs (glycaemic rescue therapy) when glycaemic control was considered insufficient, and to manage other CV risk factors according to applicable local guidelines and standards of care. Doses could be reduced for hypoglycaemia or other medical reasons.

The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of three‐point MACE. A key secondary endpoint was time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina (four‐point MACE). Additional key secondary endpoints were two composite outcomes of "treatment sustainability": (1) the proportion of participants who were receiving treatment and maintaining HbA1c ≤ 7.0% = 53 mmol/mol at the final visit and had not had glycaemic rescue medication, any episodes of moderate or severe hypoglycaemia, or > 2% weight gain between end of titration (week 16) and final visit; and (2) the proportion of participants who were receiving treatment and maintaining HbA1c ≤ 7.0% at the final visit and had not had rescue medication or > 2% weight gain between end of titration and final visit. Additional secondary or tertiary endpoints were the individual components of three‐point MACE and four‐point MACE, other CV events, non‐CV mortality and all‐cause mortality. CV outcomes, deaths and cases of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer were centrally adjudicated by committees masked to treatment assignment. Hypoglycaemia endpoints included: any episodes of hypoglycaemia reported as adverse events by investigators; moderate hypoglycaemia, defined as investigator‐reported episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia with plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL = 3.9 mmol/L; and severe hypoglycaemia, defined as episodes requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions. Other adverse events, including falls and fractures, were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 21.0.

### Efficacy and safety of linagliptin as add-on therapy to basal insulin and metformin in people with type 2 diabetes [^113yt8PQ]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in people with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin and metformin.

Methods

This was a post hoc subanalysis of participants who received basal insulin and metformin in a global phase III study that randomized participants (1:1) to receive linagliptin 5 mg once daily or placebo for ≥ 52 weeks as add-on therapy to basal insulin alone or in combination with metformin and/or pioglitazone. During the first 24 weeks, the background dose of basal insulin remained stable; thereafter, adjustments based on glucose concentrations were recommended. The primary endpoint of the subanalysis was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks. The safety analysis incorporated data up to a maximum of 110 weeks.

Results

A total of 950 participants receiving background insulin and metformin were included in this subanalysis (linagliptin and placebo, both n = 475). At week 24, the placebo-corrected adjusted mean (± se) change from baseline in HbA1c with linagliptin was -7 (± 1) mmol/mol [-0.7 (± 0.1) %; 95% CI -0.8, -0.6; P < 0.0001]. The overall frequency of drug-related adverse events (linagliptin, 18.9%; placebo, 21.9%) and investigator-reported hypoglycaemia (linagliptin, 30.7%; placebo, 31.6%) were similar in both groups at the end of treatment. The frequency of severe hypoglycaemia was low (linagliptin, 1.7%; placebo, 0.8%). No meaningful changes in mean (± sd) body weight were noted in either group [week 52: linagliptin, -0.5 (± 3.2) kg; placebo, 0.0 (± 3.1) kg].

Conclusions

Linagliptin added to basal insulin and metformin improved glycaemic control, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or body weight gain.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the CArdiovascular safety and renal microvascular outcomE study with LINAgliptin (CARMELINA): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardio-renal risk [^116EUm56]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes and adjudication

The primary outcome is the time to the first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke — the so-called 3-point major adverse CV events (3P-MACE) composite outcome. The adoption of 3P-MACE as the primary outcome resulted from a study protocol amendment in 2016 from the original primary outcome of 4P-MACE (3P-MACE plus hospitalization for unstable angina). Although no longer a component of the primary composite, hospitalization for unstable angina continued to be an adjudicated endpoint. This amendment was made by the CARMELINA ® steering committee based on emerging evidence from other CV outcomes studies accumulated since study start indicating that 3P-MACE is the more suitable primary outcome for studies of glucose-lowering medications and, accordingly, is now preferred by the FDA as a CV outcome over the 4P-MACE composite outcome. This change aligns CARMELINA ® with other recent and ongoing studies of novel glucose-lowering drugs. The steering committee had neither access to unblinded data nor input from the independent data monitoring committee when making this amendment, and the study remained fully blinded to the steering committee, sponsor, trial team, investigators and participants during these deliberations.

The key secondary outcome is a kidney composite of time to first occurrence of sustained ESKD, renal death (adjudicated death due to kidney disease), or a sustained decrease of ≥ 40% in eGFR from baseline. This kidney composite outcome had been amended in 2016 to lower the threshold for sustained eGFR decrease from ≥ 50 to ≥ 40%. This amendment was made on the basis of evolving clinical evidence and multi-disciplinary workshops convened by the US National Kidney Foundation and the FDA, where it was concluded that there is strong evidence for a sustained decline of ≥ 40% in eGFR being an appropriate outcome for clinical trials seeking to identify evidence of kidney protection. Furthermore, both the FDA and the EMA have acknowledged that a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR is a suitable outcome in kidney outcome studies to improve trial efficiency. The original key secondary composite outcome (time to first occurrence of ESKD, renal death, or a sustained decrease of ≥ 50% in eGFR from baseline) will be evaluated as a tertiary endpoint.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment: a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^114onvJ8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patient disposition

A total of 133 patients were randomized to receive either linagliptin or placebo in addition to their glucose-lowering background therapy (68 vs. 65 patients, respectively). The primary efficacy analysis was performed for 128 patients (FAS). Of those, 106 patients (linagliptin, 56; placebo, 50) had data available from baseline to week 12, and data for the remaining patients were imputed using LOCF either because they were missing or their data were recorded after intake of rescue medication. The 1-year study was completed by 97 (72.9%) patients (linagliptin, 72.1; placebo, 73.8%) (Fig. 1). The primary reasons for discontinuation were AEs (linagliptin, 11.8; placebo, 16.9%) and refusal to continue medication (linagliptin, 10.3; placebo, 1.5%). One patient in the linagliptin group refused to continue due to perceived lack of efficacy. The others who refused to continue gave no cause. Other reasons for discontinuation were lack of therapeutic effect (linagliptin, 1.5; placebo, 1.5%) and loss to follow-up (linagliptin, 1.5; placebo, 4.6%). Mean exposure to study treatment was 313 and 299 days in the linagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Median exposure was 364 days in both groups.

### Cardiovascular safety of linagliptin in type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive patient-level pooled analysis of prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events [^11228Qni]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

Linagliptin is a selective and potent DPP-4 inhibitor with a xanthine-based molecular structure, and is indicated for the treatment of T2DM. The pharmacokinetic properties of linagliptin permit DPP-4 inhibition over 24 hours following once-daily dosing, and the drug is primarily excreted via the bile and gut. In 2010, a pre-specified meta-analysis of CV events from 8 phase 3 studies was performed for linagliptin versus overall comparator-treated patients with T2DM. All suspected CV events and fatalities were prospectively adjudicated by a blinded, independent clinical event committee (CEC). The primary end point was a composite of CV death, stroke, MI, and hospitalization for unstable angina (4P-MACE). Although the analysis was limited in terms of patient numbers (n = 5239) as well as total number of primary events (n = 34), this initial pooled CV analysis did not indicate any increased risk of CV events with linagliptin.

Following completion of several other phase 3 studies of linagliptin, contributing to a larger database than was previously available, the pooled analysis presented here provides a more comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the CV safety profile of linagliptin versus comparator treatments in patients with T2DM. In addition, investigator-reported events suggestive of CHF are presented, using a pooling of 24 placebo-controlled trials.

### Review of linagliptin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112wVHFZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that was approved in 2011 by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment adjunctive to diet and exercise for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, tolerability including drug-drug interactions, contraindications/precautions, and dosage and administration of linagliptin, and the potential role of linagliptin in the management of glycemia in adults with T2DM.

Methods

MEDLINE (1966-January 12, 2012), PubMed (1950-January 12, 2012), Science Direct (1994-January 12, 2012), Web of Science (1980-January 12, 2012), and the American Diabetes Association Scientific Abstracts (2008–2011) were searched using the term linagliptin. Articles and abstracts published in English, both original research and review articles, were identified for review. Reference lists from identified articles were also searched for additional references of interest. Manufacturers' prescribing information was additionally examined.

Results

Data from clinical trials of linagliptin suggest clinical efficacy in terms of reductions in hemoglobin A(1c) (A(1c)), fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose when linagliptin was administered as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic agents, with placebo-subtracted A(1c) changes ranging from -0.47% to -0.69% in placebo-controlled trials. Adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients treated with linagliptin and at a prevalence of ≥ 2-fold greater compared with placebo were nasopharyngitis, hyperlipidemia, cough, hypertriglyceridemia, and weight increase (when used in combination with a thiazolidinedione [TZD]). Although linagliptin administered as monotherapy or in combination with metformin or a TZD may convey a low risk for hypoglycemia (0%-1.2%), caution is warranted when linagliptin is administered in combination with insulin secretagogues due to an increased risk for hypoglycemic events. Dosage adjustments based on renal or hepatic function are not required. Additionally, according to the currently approved prescribing information, the efficacy of linagliptin may be limited in patients receiving concurrent inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme or P-glycoprotein (eg, rifampin).

Conclusions

Based on the findings from the present review, patients and clinicians should be aware of the risk for hypoglycemia when linagliptin is prescribed as a treatment adjunctive to a regimen of an insulin secretagogue. An initial dose decrease in the secretagogue should be considered to prevent hypoglycemic events. Dosage adjustment of linagliptin is not required in patients with renal impairment.

### Efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with linagliptin and pioglitazone in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^117UK3cw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of linagliptin or placebo administered for 24 weeks in combination with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibiting insufficient glycaemic control (HbA1c 7.5–11.0%).

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive the initial combination of 30 mg pioglitazone plus 5 mg linagliptin (n = 259) or pioglitazone plus placebo (n = 130), all once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment, adjusted for baseline HbA1c and prior antidiabetes medication.

Results

After 24 weeks of treatment, the adjusted mean change (± s.e.) in HbA1c with the initial combination of linagliptin plus pioglitazone was -1.06% (± 0.06), compared with -0.56% (± 0.09) for placebo plus pioglitazone. The difference in adjusted mean HbA1c in the linagliptin group compared with placebo was -0.51% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.71, -0.30; p < 0.0001). Reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were significantly greater for linagliptin plus pioglitazone than with placebo plus pioglitazone; -1.8 and -1.0 mmol/l, respectively, equating to a treatment difference of -0.8 mmol/l (95% CI -1.2, -0.4; p < 0.0001). Patients taking linagliptin plus pioglitazone, compared with those receiving placebo plus pioglitazone, were more likely to achieve HbA1c of < 7.0% (42.9 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0051) and reduction in HbA1c of ≥ 0.5% (75.0 vs. 50.8%, respectively; p < 0.0001). β-cell function, exemplified by the ratio of relative change in adjusted mean HOMA-IR and disposition index, improved. The proportion of patients that experienced at least one adverse event was similar for both groups. Hypoglycaemic episodes (all mild) occurred in 1.2% of the linagliptin plus pioglitazone patients and none in the placebo plus pioglitazone group.

Conclusion

Initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus pioglitazone was well tolerated and produced significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control. This combination may offer a valuable additive initial treatment option for T2DM, particularly where metformin either is not well tolerated or is contraindicated, such as in patients with renal impairment.

### Linagliptin improved glycaemic control without weight gain or hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by a combination of metformin and pioglitazone: a 24-week randomized, double-blind study [^11357ZW1]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by a combination of metformin and pioglitazone.

Methods

This was a multi-centre, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing linagliptin 5 mg once daily (n = 183) and placebo (n = 89) as add-on to metformin and pioglitazone. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) after 24 weeks.

Results

The placebo-corrected adjusted mean change in HbA 1c from baseline to 24 weeks was –6 (1) mmol/mol [–0.57 (0.13)%] (P < 0.0001). In patients with baseline HbA 1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 32.4% of patients in the linagliptin group and 13.8% in the placebo group achieved HbA 1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (odds ratio 2.94; P = 0.0033). The placebo-corrected adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at week 24 was –0.57 (0.26) mmol/l [–10.4 (4.7) mg/dl] (P = 0.0280). The incidence of serious adverse events was 2.2% with linagliptin and 3.4% with placebo. Investigator-defined hypoglycaemia occurred in 5.5% of the linagliptin group and 5.6% of the placebo group. No meaningful changes in mean body weight were noted for either group.

Conclusions

Linagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin and pioglitazone produced significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control, without an additional risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain (Clinical Trials Registry No: NCT 00996658).

Elderly patients

No changes were observed in safety and tolerability of linagliptin in patients aged over 65 years.

Cardiovascular safety

The main cause of mortality in T2DM patients is cardiovascular disease (CVD). The gliptins may exert beneficial cardiovascular effects through different mechanisms (Table 2). Recent studies also demonstrated that intensive control may be associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk; therefore, another potential benefit of gliptins would be a low risk of hypoglycemia. In studies using animal models, activation of GLP-1 receptor is associated with limiting the size of the area of myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, linagliptin has anti-oxidant properties, probably due to its xanthine-based molecular structure. Even when administered in supratherapeutic doses, linagliptin does not prolong the QT interval.

A recent meta-analysis has assessed the cardiovascular safety profile of linagliptin in patients who participated in 8 Phase III studies. Of the 5239 patients, 3319 received linagliptin, and 1920 received a comparator (placebo, glimepiride, voglibose). A composite of CV death, stroke, MI, or hospitalization for unstable angina was considered as the primary endpoint. In the linagliptin group, the primary endpoint occurred in 11 (0.3%) patients, whereas in the comparator group there were 23 cases (1.2%), demonstrating lower risk in those who received linagliptin. An important conclusion is that, as other DPP-4 inhibitors have also demonstrated, linagliptin shows no increase in CV risk. At present, various studies with DPP-4 inhibitors are currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and effects on cardiovascular endpoints (Table 3).

Conclusions

Our pooled analysis suggests that the early combination therapy of linagliptin and metformin can help improve the treatment of T2D compared with metformin monotherapy, in terms of achieving tight glycemic control (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or other adverse effects.

### Pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of linagliptin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115qrFyu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor recently approved in the US for use as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Data Sources

English-language articles in the PubMed database to October 2011 (selected using the search terms linagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or diabetes) were identified for review. Reference lists from identified articles were reviewed for additional references of interest. Abstracts published at relevant meetings were also evaluated, and information was obtained from the manufacturer.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Publications reporting the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy and safety of linagliptin were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Linagliptin therapy results in clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A(1c), as well as fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It contrasts with other agents in its class by not requiring dosage adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Oral doses of linagliptin 5 mg once daily have been shown to be clinically effective, well tolerated, and weight-neutral. An increased rate of hypoglycemia when linagliptin was used in combination with an insulin secretagogue compared to placebo was noted in clinical trials.

Conclusions

Linagliptin provides an additional therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in contrast to other agents in the DPP-4 class, can be used without dose adjustment in patients with any degree of declining renal function.

### Linagliptin monotherapy provides superior glycaemic control versus placebo or voglibose with comparable safety in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled, double-blind study [^117DmMzm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin 5 and 10 mg vs. placebo and voglibose in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

This study enrolled patients with inadequately controlled T2DM who were previously treated with one or two oral antidiabetics or were drug naÏve. After a 2 to 4-week washout and placebo run-in, 561 patients were randomized (2: 2: 2: 1) to double-blind treatment with linagliptin 5 or 10 mg qd, voglibose 0.2 mg tid or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with linagliptin vs. placebo after 12 weeks and vs. voglibose after 26 weeks.

Results

Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups (overall mean HbA1c was 8.01%). The adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) treatment differences at week 12 were -0.87% (-1.04, -0.70; p < 0.0001) and -0.88% (-1.05, -0.71; p < 0.0001) for linagliptin 5 and 10 mg vs. placebo and at week 26 were -0.32% (-0.49, -0.15; p = 0.0003) and -0.39% (-0.56, -0.21; p < 0.0001) for linagliptin 5 and 10 mg vs. voglibose. At week 12, mean HbA1c was 7.58, 7.48 and 8.34% in patients receiving linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 10 mg and placebo, respectively. At week 26, mean HbA1c was 7.63% with linagliptin 5 mg, 7.50% with linagliptin 10 mg and 7.91% with voglibose. Drug-related adverse event rates were comparable across treatment groups over 12 weeks (9.4% linagliptin 5 mg, 8.8% linagliptin 10 mg and 10.0% placebo) and 26 weeks (11.3% linagliptin 5 mg, 10.6% linagliptin 10 mg and 18.5% voglibose). There were no documented cases of hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

Linagliptin showed superior glucose-lowering efficacy and comparable safety and tolerability to both placebo and voglibose in Japanese patients with T2DM.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^114ebNSM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of one of three composite outcomes which included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. A total of 434 patients on linagliptin and 420 patients on placebo experienced MACE. The incidence rate of MACE in both treatment arms: 56.3 MACE per 1,000 patient-years on placebo vs. 57.7 MACE per 1,000 patient-years on linagliptin. The estimated hazard ratio for MACE associated with linagliptin relative to placebo was 1.02 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.17). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.17, excluded the risk margin of 1.3.

CAROLINA

The CV risk of linagliptin was evaluated in CAROLINA, a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double-blind parallel group trial comparing linagliptin (N = 3,023) to glimepiride (N = 3,010) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of established CV disease and/or multiple CV risk factors. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between linagliptin and glimepiride when these were added to standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and other CV risk factors. The trial was event driven, the median duration of follow-up was 6.23 years and vital status was obtained for 99.3% of patients.

Patients were eligible to enter the trial if they were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control (defined as HbA1c of 6.5% to 8.5% or 6.5% to 7.5% depending on treatment-naïve, on monotherapy or on combination therapy), and were defined to be at high CV risk with previous vascular disease, evidence of vascular related end-organ damage, age ≥ 70 years, and/or two CV risk factors (duration of diabetes mellitus > 10 years, systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, current smoker, LDL cholesterol ≥ 135 mg/dL).

### Cardiovascular effects of new oral glucose-lowering agents: DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors [^112YmSeu]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular Effects of DPP-4 Inhibitors

DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit the enzyme that degrades 2 gut-derived incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thereby, they stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, both effects contributing to the glucose-lowering activity (Figure 1). DPP-4 inhibitors occupy an increasing place in the management of T2DM, progressively replacing sulfonylureas in numerous countries. The reasons for this trend are that DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with hypoglycemia or weight gain, have a good safety profile and are very easy to use (generally 1 tablet a day, without titration). They can be prescribed in patients with moderate to severe CKD, provided that the daily dose is adjusted to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); of note, linagliptin does not require dose adjustment because of a biliary rather than a renal excretion.

GIP indicates glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide.

### Antidiabetic treatment with gliptins: focus on cardiovascular effects and outcomes [^114rdfBo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

Linagliptin

Linagliptin is a potent gliptin with a xanthine-based molecular structure. It inhibits DPP4 competitively and reversibly, showing a slow rate of dissociation from the active center of the DPP4 enzyme molecule, and regarding selectivity towards DPP4 in comparison to other enzymes of the DPP family, it is 40,000-fold higher towards DPP-4 than towards DPP-8 and > 10,000-fold higher towards DPP-9. Linagliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a T max of 0.7–3 h that does not differ between healthy and T2DM subjects after single or multiple doses. A pre-specified patient-level pooled analysis of all available double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the cardiovascular safety of the drug has been recently published. The study encompassed 19 trials of ≥ 12 weeks' duration, including nearly 9500 subjects receiving linagliptin versus placebo or another active treatment. Out of these patients, about 5850 received linagliptin; most of them 5 mg daily. The comparators were glimepiride, voglibose and placebo. The primary end point was time to the first occurrence of any components of the 4P-MACE composite, i.e. cardiovascular death (including fatal stroke and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris. The main limitation of this study is the mean duration of the included trials, considerably shorter than the recommended by the FDA, reducing so the extent of interpretations that can be made. Anyway, the incidence rate of 4P-MACE was 13.4 events per 1000 patient-years for linagliptin-treated patients compared with 18.9 in the active comparator group; therefore it should be pointed out that linagliptin was not associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase III trial investigating the glycemic efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination dapagliflozin and linagliptin over linagliptin monotherapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes with metformin [^111XvWno]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Analysis for the efficacy and safety was performed by per protocol set (PPS) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, respectively. The between-group difference, that is, the effect size in HbA1c change from baseline, was 0.4%, and the standard deviation (SD) was 1%. The required sample size in two groups with 15% dropout was 232; without a 15% dropout it was 196 subjects (98 in each group) (supplementary material Table S1).

The primary and secondary endpoints were analysed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and stratification factor HbA1c level ≤ 9.0% and > 9.0% as factor and baseline as covariate. The ANCOVA model was used to derive a least-squares estimate of the treatment difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a corresponding two-sided p value. Furthermore, the two-sided 95% CI for the mean change within each treatment group was calculated. A full analysis set was used to evaluate the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The p value derived from the ANCOVA model or 95% CI of treatment difference least-squares estimate means would be the proof of superiority.

### Linagliptin (Jentadueto) [^1139cZvn]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Use in Renal Impairment

Linagliptin was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing
antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe renal
impairment (estimated GFR < 30 mL/min). For the initial 12 weeks
of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and
included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the
remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background
therapy were allowed.

In general,
the incidence of adverse events including severe hypoglycemia was
similar to those reported in other linagliptin trials. The observed
incidence of hypoglycemia was higher (linagliptin, 63% compared to
placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemic events
especially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies
were kept stable. Ten linagliptin-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated
patients (17%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic
hypoglycemia (accompanying finger stick glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL). During
the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as an event
requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer
carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported
in 3 (4.4%) linagliptin-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-treated
patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required
hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on linagliptin
and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo.

Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance
did not change over 52 weeks' treatment compared to placebo.

Laboratory Tests

Changes in laboratory findings were similar
in patients treated with linagliptin + metformin compared to patients
treated with placebo + metformin. Changes in laboratory values that
occurred more frequently in the linagliptin + metformin group and
≥ 1% more than in the placebo group were not detected.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were
observed in patients treated with linagliptin.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been
identified during postapproval use of linagliptin. Because these reactions
are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is
generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish
a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema,
and exfoliative skin conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

### Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride (Jentadueto) [^113L56dp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of one of three composite outcomes which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE.

The results of CARMELINA, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 12. The estimated hazard ratio for MACE associated with linagliptin relative to placebo was 1.02 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.17). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.17, excluded the risk margin of 1.3. The Kaplan-Meier curve depicting time to first occurrence of MACE is shown in Figure 2.

CAROLINA

The cardiovascular risk of linagliptin was evaluated in CAROLINA, a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing linagliptin (N = 3,023) to glimepiride (N = 3,010) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of established cardiovascular disease and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between linagliptin and glimepiride when these were added to standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. The trial was event driven, the median duration of follow-up was 6.23 years and vital status was obtained for 99.3% of patients.

Patients were eligible to enter the trial if they were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control (defined as HbA1c of 6.5% to 8.5% or 6.5% to 7.5% depending on whether treatment-naïve, on monotherapy or on combination therapy), and were defined to be at high cardiovascular risk with previous vascular disease, evidence of vascular related end-organ damage, age ≥ 70 years, and/or two cardiovascular risk factors (duration of diabetes mellitus > 10 years, systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, current smoker, LDL cholesterol ≥ 135 mg/dL).

### Initial combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^113NrHpj]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin/linagliptin in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Subjects not receiving antidiabetes therapy for ≥ 12 weeks were randomized to empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 137), empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 136), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 135), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 134), or linagliptin 5 mg (n = 135) for 52 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24.

Results

Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.99–8.05% (64 mmol/mol). At week 24, adjusted mean (SE) changes from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg were -1.08 (0.06)% (-11.8 [0.7] mmol/mol), -1.24 (0.06)% (-13.6 [0.7] mmol/mol), -0.95 (0.06)% (-10.4 [0.7] mmol/mol), -0.83 (0.06)% (-9.1 [0.7] mmol/mol), and -0.67 (0.06)% (-7.3 [0.7] mmol/mol), respectively. Reductions in HbA1c were significantly greater for empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg compared with linagliptin 5 mg (P < 0.001) but not compared with empagliflozin 25 mg and were significantly greater for empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg compared with the individual components (P < 0.001 for both). At week 24, 55.4%, 62.3%, 41.5%, 38.8%, and 32.3% of subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% (≥ 53 mmol/mol) reached HbA1c < 7% with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, and linagliptin 5 mg, respectively. Efficacy was maintained at week 52. The proportion of subjects with adverse events (AEs) over 52 weeks was similar across groups (68.9–81.5%), with no confirmed hypoglycemic AEs.

Conclusions

Reductions from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin/linagliptin were significantly different versus linagliptin and empagliflozin 10 mg but not versus empagliflozin 25 mg. Empagliflozin/linagliptin was well tolerated.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the CArdiovascular safety and renal microvascular outcomE study with LINAgliptin (CARMELINA): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardio-renal risk [^115gMRQP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular (CV) outcome trials in type 2 diabetes (T2D) have underrepresented patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to uncertainty regarding their kidney efficacy and safety. The CARMELINA ® trial aims to evaluate the effects of linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, on both CV and kidney outcomes in a study population enriched for cardio-renal risk.

Methods

CARMELINA ® is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 27 countries in T2D patients at high risk of CV and/or kidney events. Participants with evidence of CKD with or without CV disease and HbA1c 6.5–10.0% (48–86 mmol/mol) were randomized 1:1 to receive linagliptin once daily or matching placebo, added to standard of care adjusted according to local guidelines. The primary outcome is time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. The key secondary outcome is a composite of time to first sustained occurrence of end-stage kidney disease, ≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, or renal death. CV and kidney events are prospectively adjudicated by independent, blinded clinical event committees. CARMELINA ® was designed to continue until at least 611 participants had confirmed primary outcome events. Assuming a hazard ratio of 1.0, this provides 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of linagliptin versus placebo within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.3 at a one-sided α-level of 2.5%. If non-inferiority of linagliptin for the primary outcome is demonstrated, then its superiority for both the primary outcome and the key secondary outcome will be investigated with a sequentially rejective multiple test procedure.

Results

Between July 2013 and August 2016, 6980 patients were randomized and took ≥ 1 dose of study drug (40.6, 33.1, 16.9, and 9.4% from Europe, South America, North America, and Asia, respectively). At baseline, mean ± SD age was 65.8 ± 9.1 years, HbA1c 7.9 ± 1.0%, BMI 31.3 ± 5.3 kg/m², and eGFR 55 ± 25 mL/min/1.73 m². A total of 5148 patients (73.8%) had prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or macroalbuminuria [albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g]) and 3990 patients (57.2%) had established CV disease with increased albuminuria; these characteristics were not mutually exclusive. Microalbuminuria (n = 2896 [41.5%]) and macroalbuminuria (n = 2691 [38.6%]) were common.

Conclusions

CARMELINA ® will add important information regarding the CV and kidney disease clinical profile of linagliptin by including an understudied, vulnerable cohort of patients with T2D at highest cardio-renal risk.

### Safety and efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive analysis of data from 1331 individuals aged ≥ 65 years [^111Y3qav]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate individual patient data from a comprehensive trials programme to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin across a range of glucose-lowering regimens in a large elderly population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

Data were pooled from individuals aged ≥ 65 years, who participated in seven phase III, placebo-controlled clinical trials of linagliptin (24–52 weeks). Safety was assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) with a focus on hypoglycaemia. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c).

Results

In total, 841 subjects received linagliptin 5 mg once a day and 490 received placebo. At baseline, the population had a mean ± s.d. age of 71.0 ± 4.6 years and a mean HbA1c concentration of 8.0 ± 0.8%; 63.5% of subjects received ≥ 2 antidiabetes drugs. Overall AEs and drug-related AEs were experienced by similar proportions of patients (linagliptin 71.3, placebo 73.3; linagliptin 18.1, placebo 19.8%, respectively). The incidence of investigator-reported hypoglycaemia was 21.4% with linagliptin and 25.7% with placebo. Severe hypoglycaemic events were rare and there were fewer in the linagliptin group (1.0 vs. 1.8%). At week 24, the placebo-corrected adjusted mean ± s.e. reduction in HbA1c with linagliptin was -0.62 ± 0.06% (95% CI: -0.73, -0.51).

Conclusions

Data from this large cohort show that linagliptin is a well-tolerated and efficacious therapy for elderly patients with T2DM. Treatment with linagliptin may support individualized treatment goals, while effectively managing the risk of hypoglycaemia or drug-related side effects.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

JENTADUETO

JENTADUETO combines 2 antihyperglycemic agents with complementary
mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus: linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)
inhibitor, and metformin, a member of the biguanide class.

Linagliptin

Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an
enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus,
linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones,
stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and
decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin
hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis.
Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the
day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase
insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the
presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore,
GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells,
resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.

Metformin

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves
glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering
both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms
of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic
agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases
intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike SUs,
metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus or normal subjects (except in special circumstances) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy,
insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and
day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Linagliptin improved glycaemic control without weight gain or hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by a combination of metformin and pioglitazone: a 24-week randomized, double-blind study [^112kprFc]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite an expanding range of therapeutic treatment options, patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus often fail to achieve and maintain glycaemic targets. Many patients who initially achieve treatment goals with metformin eventually experience deterioration of glycaemic control because of the progressive decline of β-cell function over time. Consequently, the addition of one or more oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs is often necessary.

The combination of metformin and pioglitazone is often prescribed to patients with Type 2 diabetes. These two separate classes of drugs have distinct, but complementary, molecular and organ-specific mechanisms of action on insulin resistance, which, when used in combination, may provide a broader coverage of the defects underlying the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. The efficacy of pioglitazone and metformin combination therapy has been proven in clinical trials–.

When HbA 1c goals are not achieved with this dual therapy combination, current treatment guidelines recommend that a third oral anti-hyperglycaemic drug may be added, avoiding the need for insulin therapy. The addition of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor to this combination is an attractive treatment option, offering an additional complementary mechanism of action. DPP-4 inhibitors increase active levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, increasing insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion. The increase in GLP-1 may also improve β-cell function. Linagliptin is a once-daily oral DPP-4 inhibitor that is primarily excreted via the enterohepatic system and therefore does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Phase 3 studies have shown that linagliptin improves glycaemic control and has a good tolerability profile, including a low risk for hypoglycaemia and weight gain–.

### Kidney disease end points in a pooled analysis of individual patient-level data from a large clinical trials program of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor linagliptin in type 2 diabetes [^111yT69t]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although assessment of cardiovascular safety is mandated by regulatory agencies for the development of new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes, evaluation of their renal safety has been relatively neglected.

Study Design

Individual patient-level data pooled analysis of 13 phase 2 or 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor linagliptin.

Setting & Participants

Participants who participated in any of 13 randomized clinical trials and fulfilled predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as being drug-naive (hemoglobin A1c, 7.0%-11.0% [53–97 mmol/mol]) or being on background glucose-lowering therapy (hemoglobin A1c, 6.5%-10.5% [48–91 mmol/mol]).

Intervention

Of 5,466 consenting individuals with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, 3,505 received linagliptin, 5mg/d, and 1,961 received placebo.

Outcomes

The primary kidney disease outcome was defined as first occurrence during the study of 6 predefined safety end points: new onset of moderate elevation of albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR] > 30 mg/g with baseline values ≤ 30 mg/g), new onset of severe elevation of albuminuria (ACR > 300 mg/g with baseline values ≤ 300 mg/g), reduction in kidney function (serum creatinine increase to ≥ 250 μmol/L from a baseline value < 250 μmol/L), halving of estimated glomerular filtration rate (loss of baseline eGFR > 50%), acute renal failure (ascertained from diagnostic codes), or death from any cause.

Measurements

Albuminuria was assessed using ACR. GFR was estimated using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation.

Results

Cumulative exposure (person-years) was 1,751 for linagliptin and 1,055 for placebo. The primary composite outcome occurred in 448 (12.8%) and 306 (15.6%) participants in the linagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Linagliptin treatment significantly reduced the hazard of kidney disease events by 16% compared with placebo (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.97; P = 0.02).

Limitations

Retrospective and hypothesis-generating study involving short- to midterm clinical trials.

Conclusions

Linagliptin was not associated with increased kidney disease risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. The potential of this drug to improve kidney disease outcomes warrants further investigation.

### Comparative effectiveness of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and mixed treatment comparison [^1119UbQu]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.

Design

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), health economic evaluation studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, followed by primary Bayesian mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses (MTCs), and secondary frequentist direct-comparison meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Outcomes were reported as weighted mean change from baseline, or odds ratio (OR) with 95% credible interval.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and BIOSIS via Dialog ProQuest; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via EBSCO; four diabetes and two technical congress abstracts; and health technology assessment organization websites.

Eligibility Criteria

Patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control receiving any pharmacological anti-diabetic treatment.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Title/abstracts were reviewed for eligibility, followed by full-text review of publications remaining after first pass. A three-person team filtered articles and an independent reviewer checked a random selection (10%) of filtered articles. Data extraction and quality assessment of studies were also independently reviewed. Five DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin) were compared via meta-analysis (where data were available) as monotherapy, dual therapy (plus metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, or insulin), and triple therapy (plus metformin/sulfonylurea).

Results

The review identified 6,601 articles; 163 met inclusion criteria and 85 publications from 83 RCTs contained sufficient or appropriate data for analysis. MTCs demonstrated no differences between DPP-4 inhibitors in mean change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or body weight, or the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% or experiencing a hypoglycemic event, apart from in patients on alogliptin plus metformin, who achieved HbA1c < 7% more frequently than those treated with saxagliptin plus metformin [OR 6.41 (95% CI 3.15–11.98) versus 2.17 (95% CI 1.56–2.95)].

Conclusions

This systematic review and MTC showed similar efficacy and safety for DPP-4 inhibitors as treatment for type 2 diabetes, either as monotherapy or combination therapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and mixed treatment comparison [^115DweY8]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Esposito et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of indirect comparisons of the DPP-4 inhibitors vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin in 2011. The primary outcome of the analysis was the proportion of patients achieving an HbA 1c level < 7%, with the absolute change from baseline in HbA 1c, proportion of patients with hypoglycemic events, and change from baseline in body weight as secondary outcomes. The systematic review of published literature identified no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin and was limited to trials published up until September 2010. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for each DPP-4 inhibitor compared with placebo and other anti-diabetic agents (including metformin, SUs, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) for each of the outcomes.

We have conducted a similar review of DPP-4 inhibitors; as monotherapy compared with placebo, and as dual or triple therapy (where data were available) compared with metformin, SUs, metformin plus SU, pioglitazone, and insulin. Included studies were identified for all pharmacologic therapies for type 2 diabetes. Following this wider review, we extracted data from RCTs in patients treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor and conducted mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses (MTCs) to demonstrate the relative treatment effects of each DPP-4 inhibitor compared with a common comparator, assessing the same four outcomes as reported by Esposito et al.

The aim of the MTCs was to test the hypothesis of no difference between the DPP-4 inhibitors with regard to glycemic control [mean HbA 1c change from baseline, proportion of patients achieving target HbA 1c (< 7%)], number of patients with hypoglycemic events, and mean change from baseline in body weight.

Subgroup analysis of the overall cohort showed that the risk estimate for the primary end point associated with linagliptin versus total comparators was not increased by the following factors: age, gender, race, use of rescue therapy, occurrence of hypoglycemia, Framingham 10-year CHD risk score (≤ 15% or > 15%), renal function, microalbuminuria, or use of background medication (insulin and/or metformin) (Table 9).

CI, confidence interval; CV, cardiovascular; HR, hazard ratio; CMH test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with treatment arm continuity correction.

In line with the results for the primary end point, the incidence rates and the HRs for the secondary end points were similar for linagliptin and total comparators (Tables 7 and 8). The overall risk estimates were also similar for tertiary end points for linagliptin and total comparators (Table 7, Figure 4), with a significantly reduced HR for stroke and TIA favoring linagliptin compared with total comparators. For hospitalization for CHF, a small number of patients reported events (n = 21), and the overall risk estimate was similar for linagliptin (12 events; 2039 patients) and the total comparator group (9 events, 1275 patients), with a HR of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.43–2.47). This was also the case in a sensitivity analysis of the smaller treatment cohort, excluding data beyond 12 weeks from 1 trial (1218.64) in which 107 placebo-treated patients were switched to treatment with glimepiride. In this sensitivity analysis, the total number of adjudicated CHF events was 9 in the linagliptin group and 5 in the placebo group, yielding a non-significant HR of 1.29 (95% CI, 0.43–3.87).

Finally, most ongoing CV outcome studies have been designed to test the drug versus placebo on top of standard of care. One exception is the Cardiovascular Outcome Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes (CAROLINA) study, where the sulfonylurea glimepiride is the active comparator. This design may offer an additional benefit of testing efficacy parameters of linagliptin versus glimepiride in a long-term, head-to-head comparison; however, an FDA review had raised concerns related to the unknown CV effect of glimepiride, subsequently notifying the sponsor of their requirement to conduct a CV safety study with linagliptin versus placebo.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115HPdQM]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — incretin-based therapies are characterized as follows: Oral dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have very few side effects and minimal risk of hypoglycemia, but their cost may be a barrier to some older adults; DPP-4 inhibitors are relatively weak agents and do not reduce or increase major adverse cardiovascular outcomes generally, with no interaction by age-group; in general, these medications may be useful in older adults with multidose regimens or high risk of hypoglycemia, or when metformin is contraindicated; among DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin may be used as an alternative to metformin in older adults with low eGFR.

Pancreatitis

Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during
postmarketing use of linagliptin. Inform patients that persistent
severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may
or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of
acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue JENTADUETO promptly
and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Monitoring of Renal Function

Inform patients
about the importance of regular testing of renal function and hematological
parameters when receiving treatment with JENTADUETO.

Instruct patients to inform their doctor
that they are taking JENTADUETO prior to any surgical or radiological
procedure, as temporary discontinuation of JENTADUETO may be required
until renal function has been confirmed to be normal [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypoglycemia

Inform patients that
the risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JENTADUETO is used in combination
with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), and that a lower
dose of the insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk
of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that serious allergic reactions, such
as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions, have
been reported during postmarketing use of linagliptin (one of the
components of JENTADUETO). If symptoms of allergic reactions (such
as rash, skin flaking or peeling, urticaria, swelling of the skin,
or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty
in breathing or swallowing) occur, patients must stop taking JENTADUETO
and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions

### Linagliptin for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the pivotal clinical trials [^115Ksc25]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently require multiple therapies to effectively control hyperglycemia, and many new agents for glucose control have been developed over the past few decades. Linagliptin is a recently approved oral antidiabetic drug that acts by inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Unlike other DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin is excreted chiefly via the enterohepatic system, and can be used without dose adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Linagliptin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration based on a large development program, including four pivotal trials in patients with T2DM, assessing the efficacy and safety of linagliptin when used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes drugs. Linagliptin was associated with significant improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose, and more patients receiving linagliptin showed meaningful improvements and achieved targets for glycosylated hemoglobin. Linagliptin was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo, and low rates of hypoglycemic events. Taken together, the pivotal trials confirm linagliptin is effective and safe in patients with T2DM: the convenience of oral dosing with no requirement for dose adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic impairment make linagliptin a valuable option when considering therapies for patients with T2DM.

### Linagliptin increases incretin levels, lowers glucagon, and improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116p2WYd]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Linagliptin is a xanthine-based dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor that is now available in numerous countries worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to evaluate further the mechanisms underlying the improvements in glycemic control observed with linagliptin. The effects of linagliptin on DPP-4, pharmacodynamic parameters, and glycemic control versus placebo were assessed in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.

Methods

Patients in this phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study received placebo (n = 40) or linagliptin 5 mg (n = 40). Sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 41) once daily for 4 weeks was included for exploratory purposes. Primary endpoints for linagliptin versus placebo: change from baseline to day 28 in 24-h weighted mean glucose (WMG) and intact glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 area under the time-effect curve between 0 and 2 h (AUEC(0-2h)) following meal tolerance test on day 28.

Results

Linagliptin increased intact GLP-1 AUEC(0-2h) (+18.1 pmol/h/L) and lowered 24-h WMG (-1.1 mmol/L) versus placebo (both P < 0.0001) after 28 days. Intact glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide increased in line with GLP-1 (+91.4 pmol/h/L increase vs. placebo; P < 0.0001). Glycated hemoglobin (-0.22%; P = 0.0021), fasting plasma glucose (-0.6 mmol/L; P = 0.0283), and glucose (AUEC(0-3h)) (-5.9 mmol/h/L; P < 0.0001) improved significantly with linagliptin versus placebo. Most adverse events were mild; hypoglycemia or serious adverse events were not reported. Sustained DPP-4 inhibition (≥ 80%) throughout the treatment period was accompanied by significant reductions in glucagon starting at day 1 of linagliptin administration.

Conclusion

Linagliptin was well tolerated and effectively inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity in patients with T2DM, producing immediate improvements in incretin levels, glucagon suppression, and glycemic control that were maintained throughout the study period.

The need to improve glycaemic control while minimizing harmful side effects has led to interest in therapeutic approaches aimed at avoiding such pitfalls. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, which enhance postprandial levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), have limited side effects. The glucoregulatory actions of incretins include glucose-dependent promotion of insulin secretion, glucagon suppression, delayed gastric emptying, and increased satiety.

Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that was recently approved as a once-daily oral glucose-lowering drug in the USA, Japan, and Europe. Its molecular structure is xanthine-based, which differs from that of other DPP-4 inhibitors. Linagliptin has pharmacokinetic properties that confer a prolonged terminal half-life (t 1/2 > 100 h), and potent and durable DPP-4 inhibition (maximal inhibition of > 90% and inhibition 24 h after dosing of ~ 85% with linagliptin 5 mg at steady state); and unlike other DPP-4 inhibitors, it is primarily excreted via bile and the gut. In Phase 3 trials, linagliptin has demonstrated clinically meaningful glycaemic efficacy and favourable safety/tolerability compared with placebo as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, metformin plus sulphonylurea, or pioglitazone.

To thoroughly determine the CV safety of linagliptin, we undertook a meta-analysis of the CV risk associated with linagliptin versus placebo or active comparators in patients with T2DM participating in the linagliptin Phase 3 study programme. This was a pre-specified meta-analysis in which suspected CV events were prospectively captured and adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent CV expert committee.

### Combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin as second-line therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin [^113tWC5g]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combinations of empagliflozin/linagliptin as second-line therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin.

Research Design and Methods

Subjects were randomized to a combination of empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 137), empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (n = 136), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 141), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 140), or linagliptin 5 mg (n = 132) as add-on to metformin for 52 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24.

Results

At week 24, reductions in HbA1c (mean baseline 7.90–8.02% [62.8–64.1 mmol/mol]) with empagliflozin/linagliptin were superior to those with empagliflozin or linagliptin alone as add-on to metformin; adjusted mean (SE) changes from baseline were -1.19% (0.06) (-13.1 mmol/mol [0.7]) with empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, -1.08% (0.06) (-11.8 mmol/mol [0.7]) with empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, -0.62% (0.06) (-6.8 mmol/mol [0.7]) with empagliflozin 25 mg, -0.66% (0.06) (-7.2 mmol/mol [0.7]) with empagliflozin 10 mg, and -0.70% (0.06) (-7.6 mmol/mol [0.7]) with linagliptin 5 mg (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). In these groups, respectively, 61.8, 57.8, 32.6, 28.0, and 36.1% of subjects with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% (≥ 53 mmol/mol) had HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 24. Efficacy was maintained at week 52. The proportion of subjects with adverse events (AEs) over 52 weeks was similar across treatment arms (68.6–73.0%), with no hypoglycemic AEs requiring assistance.

Conclusions

Combinations of empagliflozin/linagliptin as second-line therapy for 52 weeks significantly reduced HbA1c compared with the individual components and were well tolerated.
