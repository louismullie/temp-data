## Question

Is there any data related to single operator tavr?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is any data on single-operator TAVR and what the evidence shows about outcomes, safety, and feasibility when a single interventionalist performs the entire procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "single-operator TAVR" precisely. Then, I should verify whether any studies explicitly isolate single-operator performance and report outcomes. Next, I will examine indirect evidence on operator experience and volume-outcome relationships that might inform single-operator practice. After that, I should review consensus documents and guidelines for any explicit stance on single-operator models. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline practical implications and limitations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the construct I'm evaluating: by "single-operator TAVR", I mean a procedural model in which one interventional cardiologist performs the entire TAVR case — planning, access, valve delivery, and immediate management — without routine dual-operator redundancy, while still working within a multidisciplinary heart team and institutional framework for selection and follow-up.

> Wait, let me verify whether any included studies directly test a single-operator model. I need to check for trials or series that explicitly attribute the entire procedure to one operator and report outcomes. On review, I do not find randomized trials, prospective registries, or dedicated cohort studies that isolate and compare single-operator TAVR versus team-based models; instead, most reports aggregate institutional or operator-level outcomes without distinguishing single-operator cases, and the closest signal is an observational note that a center had a single operator during a study period without isolating that operator's outcomes, which is insufficient to draw conclusions about the single-operator model itself [^115pEFjL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — absence of direct evidence does not prove absence of effect. I should examine indirect signals. Let me consider operator-level volume-outcome data. In New York State, higher annual operator volume (≥ 80 cases/year) was associated with lower risk of in-hospital death, stroke, or MI compared with low-volume operators (< 24/year), with a particularly notable reduction in stroke among operators performing around 200 cases/year, suggesting that individual operator experience meaningfully shapes outcomes even within institutional teams [^11274wDk]. I should also confirm institutional volume-outcome relationships; multiple analyses show higher mortality and complications at low-volume centers and a dose-response relationship with volume, reinforcing that experience — whether distributed across a team or concentrated in an individual — matters for safety and quality [^115ZhggW] [^111unisD].

> Next, I should review consensus documents to see if they endorse or discourage a single-operator approach. The AATS/ACC/SCAI expert consensus explicitly requires a multidisciplinary heart team, structured quality metrics, and minimum institutional and operator volumes, but it does not prescribe a dual-operator model nor endorse single-operator practice; rather, it emphasizes team-based care, registry participation, and continuous quality improvement, leaving room for local staffing models while maintaining rigorous standards [^111r6b5u] [^115CWess] [^117K8kn8]. Let me double-check operator requirements: new programs require a primary operator with substantial TAVR experience and a cardiac surgeon with robust SAVR volume, again reflecting a team-based framework rather than mandating dual operators per case [^117K8kn8].

> I will now examine whether procedural simplification trends could enable single-operator practice. Contemporary series describe streamlining toward fully percutaneous access, conscious sedation, and selective use of TEE, which can reduce staffing needs intra-procedurally. However, these reports still frame care within a heart team and do not isolate single-operator outcomes, so they suggest feasibility but do not validate superiority or equivalence of a single-operator model [^1151GrhR] [^115aH2xf]. But wait, what if device evolution changes the calculus? Even with newer platforms, consensus guidance continues to stress team-based evaluation, shared decision-making, and quality surveillance rather than endorsing solo-operator models, which tempers inference from procedural simplification alone [^111r6b5u] [^114ajQpy].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence. Direct data on single-operator TAVR are essentially absent. No trials or registries isolate and compare this model, so the evidence base is insufficient to make definitive claims about safety, efficacy, or noninferiority versus team-based approaches. Indirect evidence consistently shows that higher operator and institutional volume correlate with better outcomes, implying that if a single-operator model is pursued, it would likely require very high individual case volumes and robust institutional support to approximate team-level safety, which remains an untested assumption rather than proven fact [^11274wDk] [^115ZhggW] [^111unisD].

> I should confirm practical implications and limitations. If a center contemplates a single-operator pathway, it must still meet consensus requirements: a heart team, registry participation, minimum institutional and operator volumes, and continuous quality review; absent dedicated single-operator outcome data, programs should treat this as investigational and monitor closely for signals of harm or delay-to-rescue during complications, recognizing that early experience and low volumes are associated with worse outcomes and that statistical detection of poor performance is harder in low-volume settings [^111r6b5u] [^115CWess] [^113PvKMn] [^116gAXkb].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: there are no direct data demonstrating the safety, feasibility, or comparative effectiveness of a single-operator TAVR model, and current high-quality guidance continues to anchor TAVR within a multidisciplinary, quality-assured framework. Therefore, any move toward single-operator practice should be cautious, evidence-generating, and tightly linked to high individual operator volume and institutional safeguards until dedicated comparative data emerge [^111r6b5u] [^11274wDk] [^115ZhggW].

I can't find any **published data** on single-operator TAVR outcomes in the provided materials. The literature consistently emphasizes a **multidisciplinary heart team** [^113vsYN7] and institutional volume thresholds [^111wznc5] as key drivers of quality and safety, with no studies isolating single-operator performance. If you meant a specific operator or center, please clarify; otherwise, I can summarize the **team-based evidence** and volume-outcome data that inform best practices [^115ZhggW].

## Evidence supporting multidisciplinary heart team approach

- **Heart team requirement**: Contemporary guidelines and consensus documents mandate a multidisciplinary heart team [^111r6b5u] comprising interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, imaging specialists, anesthesiologists, and nursing staff to optimize patient selection, procedural planning, and outcomes [^113vsYN7].

- **Shared decision-making**: The heart team engages patients in shared decision-making [^114ajQpy], ensuring informed choices between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) based on individualized risk profiles and patient preferences [^113vsYN7].

- **Quality assurance**: Regular heart team meetings [^11344Xyw] and continuous quality improvement programs are integral to maintaining high standards of care and minimizing complications [^1115xNbz].

---

## Operator experience and institutional volume

- **Operator volume and outcomes**: Higher operator and institutional volumes are consistently associated with improved outcomes, including lower mortality, stroke, and complications [^115ZhggW] [^111unisD].

- **Learning curve**: TAVR exhibits a significant learning curve [^115mdhnG], with procedural safety and mortality improving as operator and institutional experience increases [^11274wDk].

- **Minimum volume requirements**: Consensus documents recommend minimum annual procedural volumes (≥ 50 TAVR procedures per year) [^115CWess] to ensure competency and favorable outcomes [^111wznc5].

---

## Procedural complexity and safety considerations

- **Technical complexity**: TAVR involves intricate steps, including vascular access, valve positioning, deployment, and management of complications such as vascular injury, stroke, and paravalvular regurgitation [^111mAabH].

- **Complication management**: A multidisciplinary team is essential for rapid recognition and management of procedural complications, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes [^115dvBqY].

- **Device-specific considerations**: Different TAVR devices (balloon-expandable vs. self-expanding) have unique deployment characteristics and complication profiles, necessitating specialized training and experience [^114QG4Bp].

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence supporting multidisciplinary approach** | **Evidence supporting single-operator approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Operator experience | Extensive evidence linking higher operator and institutional volumes with improved outcomes [^115ZhggW] [^11274wDk] | No specific evidence identified |
| Procedural complexity | Strong evidence emphasizing the need for coordinated team-based care [^113vsYN7] | No specific evidence identified |
| Safety and outcomes | Robust evidence demonstrating improved safety and outcomes with multidisciplinary teams [^115pEFjL] | No specific evidence identified |
| Guidelines and consensus | Universal recommendation for multidisciplinary heart team approach [^notfound] | No guideline support identified |

---

## Conclusion

There is **no published evidence** in the provided literature specifically evaluating single-operator TAVR outcomes. The available evidence consistently supports a **multidisciplinary heart team approach** [^113vsYN7] and highlights the importance of operator and institutional experience in achieving optimal patient outcomes [^115mdhnG].

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with high-risk symptomatic native aortic regurgitation (ALIGN-AR): a prospective, multicentre, single-arm study [^113Htr1p]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Surgery remains the only recommended intervention for patients with native aortic regurgitation. A transcatheter therapy to treat patients at high risk for mortality and complications with surgical aortic valve replacement represents an unmet need. Commercial transcatheter heart valves in pure aortic regurgitation are hampered by unacceptable rates of embolisation and paravalvular regurgitation. The Trilogy transcatheter heart valve (JenaValve Technology, Irvine, CA, USA) provides a treatment option for these patients. We report outcomes with transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with pure aortic regurgitation using this dedicated transcatheter heart valve.

Methods

The ALIGN-AR trial is a prospective, multicentre, single-arm study. We recruited symptomatic patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe or severe aortic regurgitation at high risk for mortality and complications after surgical aortic valve replacement at 20 US sites for treatment with the Trilogy transcatheter heart valve. The 30-day composite primary safety endpoint was compared for non-inferiority with a prespecified performance goal of 40.5%. The primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality compared for non-inferiority with a performance goal of 25%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04415047, and is ongoing.

Findings

Between June 8, 2018, and Aug 29, 2022, we screened 346 patients. We excluded 166 (48%) patients and enrolled 180 (52%) patients with symptomatic aortic regurgitation deemed high risk by the heart team and independent screening committee assessments. The mean age of the study population was 75.5 years (SD 10.8), and 85 (47%) were female, 95 (53%) were male, and 131 (73%) were White. Technical success was achieved in 171 (95%) patients. At 30 days, four (2%) deaths, two (1%) disabling strokes, and two (1%) non-disabling strokes occurred. Using standard Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 definitions, the primary safety endpoint was achieved, with events occurring in 48 (27% [97.5% CI 19.2–34.0]) patients (p non-inferiority < 0.0001), with new pacemaker implantation in 36 (24%) patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved, with mortality in 14 (7.8% [3.3–12.3]) patients at 1 year (p non-inferiority < 0.0001).

Interpretation

This study shows the safety and effectiveness of treating native aortic regurgitation using a dedicated transcatheter heart valve to treat patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe aortic regurgitation who are at high risk for mortality or complications after surgical aortic valve replacement. The observed short-term clinical and haemodynamic outcomes are promising as are signs of left ventricular remodelling, but long-term follow-up is necessary.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes in intermediate‑risk patients — Published trials were conducted in highly selected sites using inclusion and exclusion criteria, whereas real‑world results from over 500 sites in the United States are likely to involve a more diverse patient population, raising the question of whether outcomes are comparable to those noted in clinical trials.

Discussion

Significant advances in medical devices are often approached with great anticipation and substantial reservations. Following the introduction of TAVI in 2007, its uptake by the clinical community has been remarkable, yet until the publication of the PARTNER-B study in 2010 there was no comparative evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of TAVI. Understandably, the reaction by clinicians and payers has been mixed; while some have openly welcomed TAVIothers have voiced caution and concern at its widespread adoption.

With the publication of the PARTNER-B study and its encore publications, the clinical and economic case for TAVI in patients for whom surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is not an option now seems clearer. However, the PARTNER-B study was initiated in 2007, and since then there have been many advances in device, placement and patient selection, such that the patient population selected for PARTNER (especially Cohort B) no longer represents those treated in clinical practice. ADVANCE is the first study of the Medtronic CoreValve system and TAVI to have been published since PARTNER-B. A monitored, independently adjudicated 'real world' single arm study, ADVANCE was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAVI in 1015 patients considered inoperable or at high risk for SAVR.

The ADVANCE study provides good-quality data to explore the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the CoreValve system. However, as a single arm study there is no common comparator with which we could conduct quantitative evidence synthesis across trials, so we have used naïve study comparisons to compare treatment with the CoreValve system alongside MM. Such comparisons are limited in their ability to compare across trials, as there can be many confounding factors, such as differences in the baseline characteristics and trial protocols, which may introduce bias to estimates of comparative effectiveness. One way to accommodate for this bias is to compare like with like using patient-level data from all relevant trials.

Without access to the IPD from comparator studies we have characterised uncertainty in the prognosis of patients who did not get TAVI by using publicly available subgroup data from the PARTNER-B cohort to inform a range of sensitivity analyses. In all of these we have, by necessity, assumed that the resource use protocols from the main PARTNER-B cohort, in particular the hospitalisation rates, are directly applicable to all subgroups. This is a key limitation of the analyses.

### The coreValve US pivotal trial [^117A1cyj]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been developed as a less-invasive approach to address patients at high risk to extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. The CoreValve US trial enrolled patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis into 2 separate cohorts: an extreme-risk cohort and a high-risk cohort. The study of transfemoral TAVR using the CoreValve system in extreme-risk patients achieved its primary end point of all-cause mortality or stroke at 1 year. This was achieved with a low stroke rate and low paravalvular leak rate that improved with time. The CoreValve high-risk trial is the only randomized trial of TAVR vs surgical aortic valve replacement to show superior survival of TAVR. This was achieved with a numerically lower rate of major stroke and statistically superior changes in aortic valve function from baseline to 1 year.

Methods

Patient Population

The patient population consists of all consecutive patients who underwent an attempted TF-TAVR at our institution, from the first proctored case on May 5, 2006 (as part of the three center FDA feasibility trial) through December 2012. This includes patients enrolled in various clinical trials, as well as patients undergoing commercial valve replacement. The trials in which patients were enrolled include: transcatheter endovascular implantation of valves (REVIVAL), placement of aortic transcatheter valve (PARTNER) trial (randomized cohorts A and B as well as continued access registries), and PARTNER II (randomized cohorts A and B as well as continued access registries); the inclusion and exclusion criteria for these trials have been previously published–. All patients who underwent TF-TAVR were assessed by both cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.

The following evaluations were performed: clinical assessment, complete metabolic profile, complete blood count, CT scan to evaluate the aortic annulus and iliofemoral access, transthoracic echocardiogram, coronary angiography, and full pulmonary function testing. In patients with impaired renal function, noncontrast CT scan was used to assess the chest, but iliofemoral access was assessed using a CT scan performed with intra-arterial contrast injection (total 12–14 cc dye) via a pigtail catheter placed in the infrarenal aorta. After 2009, all patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before the procedure to assess the aortic annulus size, the presence of other valvular heart disease, aortic atheroma, and intracardiac masses including thrombus. In some patients with "borderline" iliofemoral vasculature for the TF approach, intravascular ultrasound was used to further evaluate vessel diameter.

5 MAJOR TAVR TRIALS

Several pivotal trials have compared TAVR with the conventional SAVR to evaluate factors such as efficacy and safety. These trials can also be classified based on the surgical risk profile of the selected patients, using the mean STS‐PROM score. For example, the patient that was selected for the first TAVR was considered to be a "last‐resort" caseand, for the first few years, TAVR was exclusively performed on patients who were unsuitable for surgery. Due to innovations in technology, increased data and operator experience, there has been a growing interest in assessing the efficacy of TAVR in patients with lower risk profiles. Therefore, the participants in the PARTNER 1A, and 1B trials, which began in 2007 had a higher risk profile than those assessed in the PARTNER 3 trial, several years later. Table 2 summarizes the landmark TAVR trials that have been published to date.

Table 2
Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve Trial (PARTNER), Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (SURTAVI), Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION).

The trials which fall under the extreme‐risk category consist of the PARTNER 1B, and CoreValve Extreme Risk (CoreValve ER)trials. The participants of these trials were deemed inoperable, so TAVR was compared with standard medical therapy or an objective performance goal. The PARTNER 1B trial found that TAVR performed with the first‐generation Edwards Sapien heart‐valve system superseded standard medical therapy with an absolute risk reduction in all‐cause mortality of over 20% after 1and 5 years, despite the increased incidence of neurovascular events at 30 days and 1 year. This positive finding was supported by the single‐arm nonrandomised CoreValve ER trial which investigated the Medtronic self‐expanding CoreValve prosthesis instead. In this study, the rate of all‐cause mortality or major stroke following TAVR was 26.0% after 1 year and 38.0% after 2 years, but these negative outcomes were primarily due to the participants' co‐morbidities rather than valve performance.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) clinical registries — The original purpose of clinical registries was to provide an assessment of the quality of care delivered and to enable quality improvement for sites utilizing data that they had submitted to the registry, and national benchmarks are established by aggregating and analyzing the large volume of patients being treated at all sites whose data passes a quality and completeness check. Voluntary public reporting has started for cardiac surgery, PCI, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion and will be launched for TAVR in the near future, and another use of registry-based assessment will start in 2019 with the publication of AUC for patients with severe AS that includes use of TAVR. Plans are underway to include the necessary data elements in the STS/ACC TVT Registry to provide sites with standardized reports on the indication for TAVR in their patients, site results are self-reported to the STS/ACC TVT Registry, and improvements in the completeness and accuracy of the data are part of an ongoing effort; the assessment of predicate site quality of care using valid measures and the multifaceted critical uses of performance metrics underscore the need for clinical registries and justify the time and expenses associated with data submission by sites. In this update on TAVR, there has been an emphasis on the need for programs to monitor the quality of their care for both TAVR and SAVR, the 2 national registries provide regular reports to all participating sites that include risk-adjustment of key outcomes and national benchmarks that allow a site to compare themselves to others, and this document on TAVR operator and institutional requirements also provides a blueprint for sites using these quarterly reports for the MDT to meet, discuss their results, and take actions to improve.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Edwards SAPIEN) — procedural success and early outcomes are summarized as follows: The SOURCE registry included 1038 consecutive patients (575 apical and 463 transfemoral) from 32 sites, with overall short-term procedural success 93.8% and valve embolization 0% with coronary obstruction 0.3%; thirty-day mortality was 6.3% in transfemoral and 10.3% in transapical patients. A single institution experience of 113 patients noted that mortality fell from 12.3% in the initial half to 3.6% in the second half of the experience. In the PARTNER trial Cohort B, 1-year survival was 50.7% in the TAVI arm vs. 30.7% in the medical arm; Cohort A (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score ≥ 10 or a predicted operative mortality ≥ 15%) was reported as showing non-inferiority with regard to mortality at 1 year. Across PARTNER and 1-year SOURCE, vascular complications at the time of intervention were associated with reduced survival.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis in people with low surgical risk [^114tt12b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open-heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding.

Main Results

We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short-term outcomes: all-cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). TAVI may reduce the risk of short-term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long-term follow-up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population.

### Predictors of mortality and symptomatic outcome of patients with low-flow severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1125xvSz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Impaired left ventricular (LV) function is a frequent finding in patients with calcific aortic stenosis (AS). 1 LV ejection fraction (LV‐EF) has affected survival after surgical aortic valve replacement 2, 3, 4 and has consequently been incorporated in statistical models for assessment of operative risk. 5 Conversely, in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which has been a safe and effective treatment for patients at intermediate 6 and high surgical risk, 7 the relationship is less clear. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

A more comprehensive indicator of LV function is stroke volume index (SVI) because of the fact that in the setting of marked LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, LV‐EF does not reflect the complex capacity of the LV. 13 Reduced stroke volume (eg, low flow [LF]) leads to a reduced pressure gradient despite severe AS creating the entity of "LF–low‐gradient (LG) AS". 14 This can be further subdivided into a "classic" type with reduced LV‐EF and a "paradoxical" type with preserved LV‐EF, with the latter characterized by impaired longitudinal deformation, diastolic dysfunction, and a small LV volume causing the impairment in LV function. 15 LF states are associated with either poor prognosis, if treated medically, 16 or with increased operative mortality, if treated by surgical aortic valve replacement 16, 17, 18 or TAVR. 19 Data in TAVR cohorts are characterized by different definitions of AS entities and missing information on SVI, leading to an inconclusive assessment on the impact of LV‐EF, mean pressure gradient (MPG), and SVI on outcome. 1, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Beyond survival, it is also recognized that some patients fail to experience a benefit in functional capacity or morbidity after TAVR. 24 Therefore, the need for identifying the subgroups of patients in whom TAVR is likely to be futile remains a priority.

In this study, we examined the impact of SVI, MPG, and LV‐EF on mortality and functional capacity after TAVR in a large, single‐center, all‐comers cohort.

Access choice for TAVR requires evaluation of the patient's atherosclerotic load and location, arterial size and tortuosity, and presence of mural thrombus to assess the best possible delivery site, and when possible, transfemoral access is the preferred TAVR delivery route. Nontransfemoral options include transaortic, trans-subclavian, and transapical (the latter only with the balloon-expandable valve platform), with other approaches feasible (transcarotid, transcaval, and antegrade aortic) but restricted to operators and hospitals with specialized skillsets and experience.

### Procedural volume and outcomes for transcatheter aortic-valve replacement [^115ZhggW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

During the introduction of transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) in the United States, requirements regarding procedural volume were mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a condition of reimbursement. A better understanding of the relationship between hospital volume of TAVR procedures and patient outcomes could inform policy decisions.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry regarding procedural volumes and outcomes from 2015 through 2017. The primary analyses examined the association between hospital procedural volume as a continuous variable and risk-adjusted mortality at 30 days after transfemoral TAVR. Secondary analysis included risk-adjusted mortality according to quartile of hospital procedural volume. A sensitivity analysis was performed after exclusion of the first 12 months of transfemoral TAVR procedures at each hospital.

Results

Of 113,662 TAVR procedures performed at 555 hospitals by 2960 operators, 96,256 (84.7%) involved a transfemoral approach. There was a significant inverse association between annualized volume of transfemoral TAVR procedures and mortality. Adjusted 30-day mortality was higher and more variable at hospitals in the lowest-volume quartile (3.19%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.78 to 3.67) than at hospitals in the highest-volume quartile (2.66%; 95% CI, 2.48 to 2.85) (odds ratio, 1.21; P = 0.02). The difference in adjusted mortality between a mean annualized volume of 27 procedures in the lowest-volume quartile and 143 procedures in the highest-volume quartile was a relative reduction of 19.45% (95% CI, 8.63 to 30.26). After the exclusion of the first 12 months of TAVR procedures at each hospital, 30-day mortality remained higher in the lowest-volume quartile than in the highest-volume quartile (3.10% vs. 2.61%; odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.40).

Conclusions

An inverse volume-mortality association was observed for transfemoral TAVR procedures from 2015 through 2017. Mortality at 30 days was higher and more variable at hospitals with a low procedural volume than at hospitals with a high procedural volume.

SAVR-only programs — program requirements and shared decision-making are specified as follows: In an effort to attain equivalence for the care of patients with aortic valve disease at all institutions, emphasis at SAVR-only sites must be placed on the larger context and specifically on the broader goal of optimizing patient care, and therefore, programs that offer SAVR only should have the resources and processes in place to ensure adherence to the following recommendations, including that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) is an essential requirement; MDT evaluation of patients should include a thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation, as well as appropriate cardiac imaging (electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, coronary angiography, and computed tomography as needed); incorporation of best practices for educating patients and their families to facilitate true shared decision-making (SDM); implementation of patient-family SDM that incorporates patient preferences, with the patient and family as first priority; documentation by the MDT that each patient has been made aware of all types of techniques for AVR as well as the risks and benefits of each, whether the patient is a candidate for treatment with TAVR, SAVR, or both; education of patients regarding the MDT's recommendations regarding different treatment options based on objective and validated resources and decision aids; submission of data on all commercial SAVR cases to the STS National Database, which is an NCD requirement for all SAVR technologies; and a process of self-examination in which every SAVR-only site must have a process for critical self-examination and continuous improvement using objective data and national benchmarks from the STS National Database; to ensure meaningful SDM, each SAVR program should ensure that patients 1) are well-informed regarding their options, 2) understand risks and benefits presented using validated objective data on treatment options that are as patient-specific as possible, 3) articulate their treatment-related goals, 4) identify their preferences and values in relation to their care, and 5) synthesize this knowledge to make a final treatment choice.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — trial scope and long-term outcomes note that "at present, 2 trials are randomizing low-risk patients to SAVR or TAVR", while earlier controlled trials excluded many coexistent diseases and thus "a substantial minority of patients (so-called Cohort C patients) were not included", and "frailty and liver disease" were not incorporated. Despite exclusions, "the all-cause 5-year mortality rates of patients who received TAVR in the PARTNER 1B and PARTNER 1A trials were 72%… and 68%…, respectively". Current evaluation has "focused on… predictors of optimal, suboptimal, or bad outcomes, both early and at 1-year follow up", and such outcomes "are best understood when they are compared before and after TAVR".

### Outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the United States [^111mAabH]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and inoperable status (in 2011) and high-risk but operable status (starting in 2012). A national registry (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy [STS/ACC TVT] Registry) was initiated to meet a condition for Medicare coverage and also facilitates outcome assessment and comparison with other trials and international registries.

Objective

To report the initial US commercial experience with TAVR.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We obtained results from all eligible US TAVR cases (n = 7710) from 224 participating registry hospitals following the Edwards Sapien XT device commercialization (November 2011-May 2013).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included all-cause in-hospital mortality and stroke following TAVR. Secondary analyses included procedural complications and outcomes by clinical indication and access site. Device implantation success was defined as successful vascular access, deployment of a single device in the proper anatomic position, appropriate valve function without either moderate or severe AR, and successful retrieval of the delivery system. Thirty-day outcomes are presented for a representative 3133 cases (40.6%) at 114 centers with at least 80% complete follow-up reporting.

Results

The 7710 patients who underwent TAVR included 1559 (20%) cases that were inoperable and 6151 (80%) cases that were high-risk but operable. The median age was 84 years (interquartile range [IQR], 78–88 years); 3783 patients (49%) were women and the median STS predicted risk of mortality was 7% (IQR, 5%-11%). At baseline, 2176 patients (75%) were either not at all satisfied (1297 patients [45%]) or mostly dissatisfied (879 patients [30%]) with their symptom status; 2198 (72%) had a 5-m walk time longer than 6 seconds (slow gait speed). The most common vascular access approach was transfemoral (4972 patients [64%]), followed by transapical (2197 patients [29%]) and other alternative approaches (536 patients [7%]); successful device implantation occurred in 7069 patients (92%; 95% CI, 91%-92%). The observed incidence of in-hospital mortality was 5.5% (95% CI, 5.0%-6.1%). Other major complications included stroke (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%), dialysis-dependent renal failure (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.6%-2.2%), and major vascular injury (6.4%; 95% CI, 5.8%-6.9%). Median hospital stay was 6 days (IQR, 4–10 days), with 4613 (63%) discharged home. Among patients with available follow-up at 30 days (n = 3133), the incidence of mortality was 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7%-8.6%) (noncardiovascular cause, 52%); a stroke had occurred in 2.8% (95% CI, 2.3%-3.5%), new dialysis in 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%), and reintervention in 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.8%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing TAVR at US centers in the STS/ACC TVT Registry, device implantation success was achieved in 92% of cases, the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5.5%, and the stroke rate was 2.0%. Although these postmarket US approval findings are comparable with prior published trial data and international experience, long-term follow-up is essential to assess continued efficacy and safety.

### Single center TAVR experience with a focus on the prevention and management of catastrophic complications [^112JtwW9]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an important treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who are inoperable or at high risk for complications with surgical aortic valve replacement. We report here our single-center data on consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR since the inception of our program, with a special focus on minimizing and managing complications.

Methods

The patient population consists of all consecutive patients who underwent an attempted TF-TAVR at our institution, beginning with the first proctored case in May 2006, through December 2012. Clinical, procedural, and echocardiographic data were collected by chart review and echo database query. All events are reported according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2.

Results

During the study period, 255 patients with AS had attempted TF-TAVR. The procedure was successful in 244 (95.7%) patients. Serious complications including aortic annular rupture (n = 2), coronary occlusion (n = 2), iliac artery rupture (n = 1), and ventricular embolization (n = 1) were successfully managed. Death and stroke rate at 30 days was 0.4% and 1.6%, respectively. One-year follow-up was complete in 171 (76%) patients. One-year mortality was 17.5% with a 3.5% stroke rate. Descending aortic rupture, while advancing the valve, was the only fatal procedural event. There were 24.4% patients with ≥ 2+ aortic regurgitation.

Conclusions

TAVR can be accomplished with excellent safety in a tertiary center with a well-developed infrastructure for the management of serious complications. The data presented here provide support for TAVR as an important treatment option, and results from randomized trials of patients with lower surgical risk are eagerly awaited.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) volume–outcome commentary — Figure 2 shows the categorization of sites based on their TAVR volume and risk-adjusted outcome measures, such as the observed-to-expected ratio of an outcome measure (e.g., risk-adjusted in-hospital, 30-day, and ultimately, 1-year mortality). It is anticipated that most low-volume sites will steadily increase their number of procedures due to the approval of moderate-risk patients for TAVR, FDA approval of additional indications for TAVR usage, and ongoing aging of the U.S. population. Preliminary data note that many low-volume sites have seemingly acceptable outcomes; however, due to the low number of cases in such sites, the assessment of their outcomes is statistically challenging, resulting in substantial random sampling variation (i.e., wide confidence intervals). The volume-outcome relationship and learning curve shown during the initial U.S. experience in TAVR require updating.

The study PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) was published by Mack MJ and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: is TAVR superior to SAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the population was: 950 patients (292 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk of death with surgery. The key exclusion criteria were clinical frailty; bicuspid aortic valves; other anatomical features increasing the risk of complications. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 496 TAVR (with a third-generation balloon-expandable valve) n = 454 SAVR (with a bioprosthetic valve). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year (8.5% vs. 15.1%; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke (0.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) Significant decrease in death or stroke (1% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.83) Significant decrease in new-onset AF (5% vs. 39.5%; HR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in safety endpoints at 30 days, including major vascular complications and new permanent pacemaker insertions. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk of death with surgery, TAVR was superior to SAVR with respect to death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement — shared decision making (SDM) requirements: It should be the goal of each TAVR program that patients participate meaningfully in their healthcare decisions, and to this end patients should 1) be well-informed regarding their options; 2) understand the risks and benefits presented using data on treatment options that are as patient-specific as possible; 3) articulate their treatment- and recovery-related goals; 4) identify preferences and values relative to their care; and 5) integrate these to make a final treatment choice. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identifies strengthening beneficiary engagement as an agency goal and envisions care that is person-centered, emphasizes coordinated care and SDM, and relies on transparency of quality and cost information, and the 2017 AHA/ACC valvular heart disease guideline gives a Class I, Level of Evidence: C-LD recommendation that "The choice of type of prosthetic heart valve should be an SDM process that accounts for the patient's values and preferences and includes discussion of the indications for and risks of anticoagulant therapy and the potential need for and risk associated with reintervention". The document also notes SDM can be challenging and time-consuming, with CMS citing difficulties integrating SDM into routine workflows.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with cardiogenic shock [^114gWsW6]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) in the setting of severe aortic stenosis (AS) carries a poor prognosis. It leads to a vicious cycle of subendocardial ischaemia, reduced preload and increased afterload, ultimately resulting in acute decompensation and death. Previous studies in AS patients with CS who underwent successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) reported a 30-day mortality of 33%–47%, 1-year mortality of 70%, and 2-year mortality of 90%. Therefore, conservative therapy leads to poor outcomes in these patients. Most patients in CS are denied surgical aortic valve replacement because of increased peri-operative risk of morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an attractive alternative because of the less invasive nature of this procedure.

It is estimated that 1%–4% of the patients undergoing TAVR may present with CS. Because of the low prevalence, prior single and multi-centre studies have been limited by a small sample size. An earlier study from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry (TVT-R-R) reported the outcomes of TAVR in 2220 patients in CS from 2014 to 2017. However, many of these patients underwent TAVR with older generation valves, the primary endpoint was limited to 30-day outcomes, and only patients > 65 years were included. Meanwhile, TAVR volumes continue to increase, operator volume and experience continue to grow, and newer device platforms have been introduced. The safety and efficacy of TAVR with new generation transcatheter heart valves in patients with CS remains largely unknown. Accordingly, we analysed the TVT-R-R data to report in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes of TAVR with balloon-expandable bioprosthesis in patients with AS and CS in a contemporary real-world setting. We also report the predictors of 1-year mortality in this population.

### TAVR procedural volumes and patient outcomes: analysis of recent data [^111yz2Bj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

In less than 15 years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has progressed from a procedure of last resort in patients at prohibitively high perioperative risk for major morbidity and mortality from surgical valve replacement to a viable alternative option to surgery in most patients with native (non-bicuspid) aortic valve stenosis. The number of medical centers offering TAVR has rapidly proliferated. There is mounting evidence that there are variations in patient outcomes associated with the yearly number of TAVR cases performed at each respective center. This review outlines the evolution of TAVR indications, common complications, the current literature addressing the association between procedural volumes and patient outcomes in TAVR, and offers a synopsis of risk factor assessment for patients considered for TAVR.

Discussion

Since the advent of TAVR in the early 2000s, there has been a tremendous amount of research and evolution in the field of aortic valve replacement. This led to considerable improvements in patient identification, along with procedural and technical improvements especially for patients undergoing TAVR but also for SAVR given the contemporary mini-thoracotomy approach utilized in many patients. Subsequently, there has been a vast amount of data from both large, randomized trials and smaller cohort studies that have evaluated the outcomes of these patients. Some level of clinical equipoise has been noted between these two techniques and cardiovascular societies have been engaged in improving the adverse clinical outcomes of TAVR and SAVR including reduction in post-procedural stroke, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. TAVR being a minimally invasive technique, appears to be an attractive alternative and is now considered the treatment of choice for patients with prohibitive surgical risk, and an equivalent option for high surgical risk. TAVR is also considered an alternative option for intermediate surgical risk patients and recently approved for selected low surgical risk patients from the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well. The threshold of performing TAVR is gradually declining with ongoing advancement in operator experience, technique and valvular specifications. Cost effective analysis also supports TAVR in selected patient population as demonstrated by Weintraub et al. TAVR is comparable to medical therapy (PARTNER B sub study) and comparable to SAVR if trans-femoral approach is considered (PARTNER A sub study).

### PARTNER B: where will it take us? [^114Dpq7h]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

PARTNER trial, cohort B has taken our cardiovascular community to new heights in multidisciplinary collaboration while raising awareness in the primary care community regarding the shortcomings of noninterventional treatment of symptomatic AS. With a rate of death from any cause at 1 year that is 20% lower with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in comparison with standard medical therapy, TAVR should be considered the new standard of care for patients with AS who are not suitable candidates for surgery. Despite TAVR's initial success, this landmark trial leaves questions about durability, paravalvular regurgitation, and procedural complications unanswered. Nonetheless, TAVR is clearly and unequivocally a new and successful treatment for symptomatic AS. Complication rates in this early stage of experience with a first-generation device are much lower than many had expected, and will not prevent TAVR from moving steadily down the risk spectrum.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus surgery for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a reconstructed individual patient data meta-analysis [^114nkM9E]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We wished to undertake a reconstructed individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgery for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Background

TAVR and surgery are both well-established methods for treating patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at low, intermediate, and high risk for surgery.

Methods

Data were identified by searches of Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov for all randomized clinical trials, which compared TAVR and surgery that had published at least 1 year of follow-up. Individual patient data were reconstructed from Kaplan-Meier curves.

Results

A total of 7,770 patients from seven randomized clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis. At 1 year, TAVR was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–0.98; p = .03), disabling stroke (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.93; p = .01) and the composite end point of death or disabling stroke (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.92; p = .002). Significant interactions were found for access suitability, with TAVR associated with a lower risk of these end points in patients suitable for transfemoral access. TAVR was associated with a lower risk of periprocedural events, whereas the risk of late events was similar between TAVR and surgery.

Conclusions

At 1 year, TAVR was associated with a lower risk of death, disabling stroke and the composite end point, when compared with surgery. These associations were strongest within the subgroup of patients in whom transfemoral access was feasible.

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic-valve replacement in high-risk patients [^111A4ro6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER A was published by Smith CR and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER A study, the trial question was: is TAVR noninferior to SAVR in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER A study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER A study, the population was: 699 patients (300 female, 399 male). The inclusion criteria were high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were bicuspid or noncalcified valve, coronary artery disease requiring revascularization, LVEF < 20%, an aortic annulus diameter < 18 mm or > 25 mm, severe mitral or aortic regurgitation, recent neurologic event, and severe renal insufficiency. In the PARTNER A study, the interventions were: n = 348 TAVR (with a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial valve, either a transfemoral or a transapical approach) n = 351 surgical AVR (surgical aortic-valve replacement). In the PARTNER A study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death at 1 year (24.2% vs. 26.8%; MD -2.6, 95% CI -9.3 to 4.1). In the PARTNER A study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in major stroke, at 1 year (5.1% vs. 2.4%;) Significant increase in major vascular complications, at 30 days (11% vs. 3.2%; ARD 7.8, 95% CI 3.17 to 12.43). In the PARTNER A study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in at 30 days, major bleeding (9.3% vs. 19.5%, p < 0.001) and new-onset AF (8.6% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.006). In the PARTNER A study, the conclusion was: in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR was noninferior to surgical AVR with respect to death at 1 year.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) outcomes — contemporary risk and trends — show low operative mortality and stable stroke rates in U.S. practice. A review of isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) from 2001 to 2010 reported an overall operative mortality of 3.0%, with 80.0% of patients having an STS-PROM < 4%; among this lowest-risk stratum the observed operative mortality was 1.7%. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) observed mortality declined from 5.7% to 2.9% with concurrent shifts in STS-PROM (7% to 6% per the STS model and 4% to 3% per the TVT model), while observed surgical mortality remained stable in the lowest risk groups but declined in the intermediate- and high-risk groups (from 6.4% to 5.4% [intermediate risk, < 4% to 8% STS-PROM]; and 14.4% to 11.9% [high risk > 8% STS-PROM]). The stroke rate has remained stable at 1.5% overall, similar to TAVR at 2.1%.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^112BRZ6j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Major cardiovascular comorbidity — coronary angiography is indicated in all patients because coronary artery disease is common in patients undergoing TAVR (40% to 75%); concurrent coronary revascularization may be needed, particularly if multivessel or left main coronary disease is present, although it is unclear if 30-day mortality is influenced by revascularization status; until more definitive randomized data are available, the Heart Valve Team should decide whether to revascularize before TAVR on a case-by-case basis; in a post hoc analysis of the PARTNER 2A trial, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft in addition to TAVR did not increase the risk of death or disabling stroke at 2-year follow-up compared with TAVR or SAVR alone; other conditions that might increase procedural risk or limit benefit include LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension, and low flow — defined as stroke volume index less than 35 mL/m2 — may also be associated with poor outcomes post-TAVR regardless of EF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) multidisciplinary team (MDT) operations — Complicated postprocedural courses are common in high-risk patients and a team approach in this setting is critical. Specific and regular in-service educational conferences to impart the necessary familiarity are recommended, and long-term follow-up planning and resources are incumbent responsibilities of the MDT and the hospital administration. Post-approval registries (e.g. STS/ACC TVT Registry) (28) are required for TAVR, so a data collection/research unit and staff within the MDT should be funded by the hospital. A financial structure that shares physician reimbursement is a recommended incentive for collaboration between cardiac surgeons and cardiologists, and a dedicated full-time individual can be supportive of the efficient operational function of the MDT.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) conclusion — TAVR has matured as a therapeutic option for patients requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR). In the prior 2012 document, the operator requirements were based on skills necessary to perform TAVR, but at this time such skills are best learned by doing TAVR and therefore the prerequisite skills have been replaced by TAVR experience. The 2018 document provides additional quality metrics that complement surrogate requirements for TAVR skills, and TAVR case volume requirements provide a structural measure to ensure foundational data minimums. This remains an evolving field with continual changes in indications, equipment, technique, and clinical outcomes; as indications expand to younger patients, assessing the structural durability of the valve is critical. This document reflects the current state of the art and is designed to evolve with the field.

### Effect of procedural refinement of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation on outcomes and costs: a single-centre retrospective study [^115aH2xf]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an effective alternative for patients who are poor candidates for surgery.TAVI has become the treatment of choice for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in patients who are not suitable for surgery, and it is non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement in 'high-risk' operable patients. Furthermore, there is ongoing research into the use of TAVI in intermediate and low risk patients, making TAVI a viable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement.

While developments continue to be made to improve the devices and techniques used for TAVI, there is less solid data on the effects of non-device related procedural refinement on the outcomes and costs of TAVI. First, in the early days of TAVI, general anaesthesia was most commonly used; however, it is also proved to be feasible to perform the procedure using conscious sedation, and this approach has gained favour in some centres. Observational studies suggest that conscious sedation can be used without adversely affecting the overall success or safety of the TAVI procedureand may result in lower costs. Second, percutaneous access and closure has been associated with improvements in patients' comfort and satisfaction as well as in time to haemostasis, but needs to be balanced against periprocedural and anatomic risk factors. Third, periprocedural transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been extensively used historically, but the focus is shifting from routine use of TEE and general anaesthesia to 'as needed' use. It has been shown that its omission was associated with similar rates of paravalvular leak, similar gradients and velocities across the aortic valve and comparable 30-day outcomes but with a reduced procedure length and length of stay. Finally, postprocedural length of stay has been shown to be a major determinant of patient outcomes and quality of life after surgical and interventional procedures. It is associated with reduced hospital-borne complications, accelerated patient recovery and mobilisation, and lower costs.

### Single center TAVR experience with a focus on the prevention and management of catastrophic complications [^115kR9RU]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the management of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) since the first valve was implanted by Professor Alan Cribier in 2002 (Rouen, France). Our understanding of the procedure and insights into patient selection has rapidly evolved, supported by encouraging retrospective and prospective clinical outcomes data–. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons have worked together in an unprecedented manner to ensure the success of this joint venture, resulting in the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a transcatheter valve in November 2011.

Since commercial approval, many centers in the US have begun offering TAVR to patients with AS. Essential criteria for the performance of TAVR by these sites have been carefully delineated through a joint effort by cardiology and cardiac surgery organizations, including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS), and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions–. An imperative for the performance of commercial TAVR is the comprehensive reporting of patient and procedural data to the STS/ACC Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) national database. This will provide an understanding of patient selection and outcomes as TAVR is applied on a broader scale.

These newer centers face important challenges including team-building, patient selection, physical infrastructure, and procedural education and competency, all while maintaining the high standard to which this new therapy must be held. One of the most difficult challenges to overcome is unexpected complications. The potentially catastrophic complications of TAVR can be managed successfully only when the entire team is fully prepared. Although guidelines for this exist, many insights can be gained by analyzing a single-center's comprehensive experience with TAVR. We have learned a great many lessons in our performance of transfemoral (TF)-TAVR and other access sites including TA, TAo, etc. In order to analyze our experience in a methodical fashion and focus on specific organizational and learning points, we have divided our experience into TF cases (presented here) and surgical (TA/TAo) cases.

Therefore, we provide here data on all patients undergoing TF-TAVR at our institution since the procedure's introduction to the US in 2006, with a special focus on our processes for the successful management of complications.

### Learning curve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement for native aortic regurgitation: safety and technical performance study [^115Z7hxC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a fundamentally new procedure for the treatment of native aortic regurgitation (AR). The number of cases needed to gain proficiency with the procedure is unknown.

Hypothesis

This study aimed to evaluate the learning curve for TAVR for native AR.

Methods

This study retrospectively reviewed a prospective database from 134 consecutive native AR patients who underwent the J-valve TAVR system, which performed by a single team interventional cardiologist. The cumulative sum (CUSUM) method was used to analyze the learning curve. Patients were divided into two groups in chronological order, defined by the surgeon's early (group 1: the first 52 cases) and skilled (group 2: the next 82 cases) experience. Demographic data, intraoperative characteristics, and short-term surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups.

Results

CUSUM plots revealed decreasing procedure time and fluoroscopy time after patients 52 and 43, respectively. The patient date consistently demonstrated that high-risk scores and major perioperative parameters were comparable between the two groups. The use of contrast dye (group 1, 94.22 ± 30.07mL; group 2, 70.43 ± 15.02mL, P < .05), total procedure time (group 1, 84.96 ± 17.76minutes; group 2, 59.95 ± 12.83minutes, P < .05), and fluoroscopy time (group 1, 11.52 ± 3.81minutes; group 2, 6.47 ± 1.53minutes, P < .05) were significantly reduced in group 2. The overall device success rate in group 1 was 96.2% vs 96.3% in group 2 and remained high (P = 1.0). The overall 30-day mortality was 3.8% in group 2 (group 1, 0 to group 2, 3.8%; p = 0.16). The complications rate, such as pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease were higher in group 2.

Conclusions

For a surgeon without previous TAVR experience, 52 cases of performance is the minimal requirement to gain the proficiency of TAVR for native AR. The skilled surgeons have been observed with reduced procedural time, fluoroscopy times, radiation exposure dose, and contrast volume usage. However, the overall prognosis was not significantly different between the two groups.

TAVR program performance requirements — minimum quality benchmarks for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) sites specify that risk-adjusted all-cause mortality is assessed using 95% confidence intervals and national benchmark data with performance categorized as "as expected" or "better than expected". Primary 30-day outcome metrics include 30-day all-cause neurological events (including transient ischemic attacks), 30-day major vascular complication, 30-day major bleeding, and 30-day moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and funnel plots using 95% (outlier) and/or 90% (warning) limits are used. Primary 1-year outcome metrics (in development) include 1-year risk adjusted all-cause mortality, patient-reported health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) at 30 days and 1 year versus baseline, and a 30-day and 1-year risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity composite index. A footnote clarifies that presently only in-hospital and, shortly, 30-day mortality outcomes are risk-adjusted, whereas other outcomes are not risk-adjusted.

The STS/ACC TVT Registry "started requiring a KCCQ metric" in 2017. Warning signals include "worse than expected performance… for 2 consecutive reports" or "points falling outside the selected control limits", which "mandate immediate attention to verify and remediate any quality issues". Centers "should strongly consider seeking outside review of their 1-year performance goals", and secondary outcome metrics "should be monitored, evaluated, discussed, and compared with TVT registry-generated benchmarks".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedural anesthesia details — airway, pacing, and monitoring — note that for general anesthesia cases, including transapical access, insertion of a double-lumen tube or single-lung ventilation is typically not required. A temporary transvenous lead is typically passed via femoral or internal jugular veins, or sewn directly on the epicardial surface for transapical procedures, and after ventricular pacing wire placement, thresholds are checked at a pacing of rate 10 beats/min to 20 beats/min higher than the patient's intrinsic rates. Arterial pressure monitoring may be via the radial artery, but if ipsilateral axillary bypass is present, additional monitoring from the contralateral radial or femoral artery is planned, and a monitoring pulmonary artery catheter may be helpful in certain patients.

### The learning curve and annual procedure volume Standards for optimum outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: findings from an international registry [^115mdhnG]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The authors aimed to determine the procedural learning curve and minimum annual institutional volumes associated with optimum clinical outcomes for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a complex procedure requiring significant training and experience for successful outcome. Despite increasing use of TAVR across institutions, limited information is available for its learning curve characteristics and minimum annual volumes required to optimize clinical outcomes.

Methods

The study collected data for patients at 16 centers participating in the international TAVR registry since initiation of the respective TAVR program. All cases were chronologically ordered into initial (1 to 75), early (76 to 150), intermediate (151 to 225), high (226 to 300), and very high (> 300) experience operators for TAVR learning curve characterization. In addition, participating institutions were stratified by annual TAVR case volume into low-volume (< 50), moderate-volume (50 to 100), and high-volume (> 100) groups for comparative analysis. Procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes were collected and multivariate regression analysis performed for 30-day mortality and the early safety endpoint.

Results

A total of 3,403 patients comprised the study population. On multivariate analysis, all-cause mortality was significantly higher for initial (odds ratio [OR]: 3.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.93 to 7.60), early (OR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.51 to 5.03), and intermediate (OR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.19 to 5.40) experience groups compared with the very high experience operators. In addition, the early safety endpoint was significantly worse for all experience groups compared with the very high experience operators. Low annual volume (< 50) TAVR institutions had significantly higher all-cause 30-day mortality (OR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.44 to 5.07) and worse early safety endpoint (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.17) compared with the moderate- and high-volume groups. There was no difference in patient outcomes between intermediate and high annual volume groups.

Conclusions

TAVR procedures display important learning curve characteristics with both greater procedural safety and a lower mortality when performed by experienced operators. In addition, TAVR performed at low annual volume (< 50 procedures) institutions is associated with decreased procedural safety and higher patient mortality. These findings have important implications for operator training and patient care at centers performing TAVR.

Aims

To report our single-center data, regarding the first 100 patients who underwent TAVR procedure with the new balloon-expandable MYVAL system. We report 30-day and 1-year outcomes in low to high-risk TAVR patient population.

Methods

From November 2019 to July 2021, 100 consecutive patients underwent TAVR procedure. Patient outcome was classified according to the VARC-2 definitions. The device performance was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography. Data collection was allowed by the Local Ethical Committee.

Results

The mean age was 74.7 years, 63 (63%) were male. The mean Euroscore II and STS score were 4.8 ± 4.9 and 5.6 ± 3.9, respectively. Transfemoral access was the most frequent (surgical vs. percutaneous 2% vs. 97%) and in one patient surgical subclavian access was used. VARC-2 outcomes were as follows: device success 99%, STROKE 1%, major and minor vascular complication was 1% and 11%, respectively, the rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was 30.7%. At discharge, the incidence of grade I, grade II aortic regurgitation was 39% and 1%, respectively, without relevant PVL. In-hospital mortality was only 1%. These results included a high proportion (17%) of patients with bicuspid aortic valves. At 1 year, the all-cause mortality rate was 7% (only two due to cardiac event) and only a single patient had valve-related dysfunction requiring surgical aortic replacement.

Conclusions

TAVR procedure with MYVAL transcatheter heart valve system shows excellent 30-day and 1-year outcomes regarding patient survival, technical success, and valve-related adverse events. The limitations of our study comprise a single-center study with retrospective data collection.

### Self-expanding transcatheter vs surgical aortic valve replacement in intermediate-risk patients: 5-year… [^1136aHz1]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Echocardiographic 5-year follow-up was available for 390 patients undergoing TAVR and 312 undergoing surgery. The baseline characteristics of the patients who were alive but without 5-year follow-up data are presented in eTables 5, 6, and 7 in Supplement 2. Compared with patients with follow-up data, these patients were older, had a higher STS-PROM score, and were more likely to be frail. This 5-year follow-up report of the SURTAVI trial demonstrated no difference in all-cause mortality or disabling stroke between supra-annular self-expanding TAVR and surgery in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at intermediate surgical risk. Clinical valve thrombosis and endocarditis were infrequent through 5 years with both TAVR and surgery. This compares with the 30% and 28. 7% all-cause mortality for TAVR and surgery in SURTAVI and no difference in clinical events between 2 and 5 years.

Essential differences in study population and TAVR procedures preclude detailed comparison of patient end points between the PARTNER 2A and SURTAVI trials. Patients in PARTNER 2A were older and had a higher STS-PROM risk score. Transthoracic access was used in approximately a quarter of patients in the TAVR cohort and was associated with worse outcome. Consistent with other studies that compared supra-annular self-expanding TAVR with surgery, TAVR was associated with persistently larger aortic valve areas and lower transprosthetic gradients; however, TAVR had more mild or moderate PVL than surgery. 3, 10 The transcatheter valve design that was implanted in SURTAVI was mainly the first-generation bioprosthesis and the remaining received the second-generation TAVR device. As such, and because of the 5-year mortality rates of 30. 0% and
28.

7%, we performed a joint model to examine the association between dropout and effective orifice area/mean aortic valve gradient longitudinal trend. 25 The results showed no evidence of an association between effective orifice area/mean aortic valve gradient and death.

### Durability and clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for failed surgical bioprostheses [^117DA3J5]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option when a surgical valve demonstrates deterioration and dysfunction. This study reports 3-year results following valve-in-valve with self-expanding TAVR.

Methods

The CoreValve US Expanded Use Study is a prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm study that evaluates safety and effectiveness of TAVR in extreme risk patients with symptomatic failed surgical biologic aortic valves. Study end points include all-cause mortality, need for valve reintervention, hemodynamic changes over time, and quality of life through 3 years. Patients were stratified by presence of preexisting surgical valve prosthesis-patient mismatch.

Results

From March 2013 to May 2015, 226 patients deemed extreme risk (STS-PROM [Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality] 9.0 ± 7%) had attempted valve-in-valve TAVR. Preexisting surgical valve prosthesis-patient mismatch was present in 47.2% of the cohort. At 3 years, all-cause mortality or major stroke was 28.6%, and 93% of patients were in New York Heart Association I or II heart failure. Valve performance was maintained over 3 years with low valve reintervention rates (4.4%), an improvement in effective orifice area over time and a 2.7% rate of severe structural valve deterioration. Preexisting severe prosthesis-patient mismatch was not associated with 3-year mortality but was associated with significantly less improvement in quality of life at 3-year follow-up (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Self-expanding TAVR in patients with failed surgical bioprostheses at extreme risk for surgery was associated with durable hemodynamics and excellent clinical outcomes. Preexisting surgical valve prosthesis-patient mismatch was not associated with mortality but did limit patient improvement in quality of life over 3-year follow-up.

### Single center TAVR experience with a focus on the prevention and management of catastrophic complications [^1177XMBN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this single-center experience details several important messages for centers starting their initial experience in TAVR, including procedural techniques and strategies to manage life-threatening complications. It highlights several challenges including resource utilization and infrastructure setup in the current health care environment. The encouraging outcomes presented herein provide support to previously published multicenter randomized and registry data of TF-TAVR among high-risk and inoperable patients. Given the broad base of data in these groups, more data supporting TAVR among lower risk surgical groups is eagerly awaited.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-and low-risk patients [^114zs6oD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Initially restricted to high‐risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being offered to younger and lower‐risk patients with fewer comorbidities who are otherwise good operative candidates and until now would have undergone surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This evolution in clinical practice is underpinned by robust evidence, but do the data support the universal use of TAVR in all patients with AS, or is there still a role for surgery? In this review, we will review the data of TAVR in operable patients, examine potential limitations of TAVR in younger patients, and highlight the areas in which more research is required.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement… [^1128R8eG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Median hospital stay was 6 days, with 4613 discharged home. Data elements were collected using standardized definitions, 9 which have been harmonized with the STS National Database wherever possible. The following represent several definitions of interest. The clinical indication for TAVR was based on determination by 2 experienced local cardiac surgeons using risk calculations from the STS predicted risk of operative mortality from isolated surgical aortic valve replacement 10 and clinical judgment. The STS PROM estimates expected risk of operative mortality, with a range of 0% to 100% risk.

The median STS PROM was calculated for each hospital center using the STS isolated surgical AVR risk algorithm and variables reported to the TVT Registry and shown as a function of center-level TAVR volume evaluating the relationship between observed center-level variation in patient selection and procedural volume, with the hypothesis that a larger proportion of low-volume centers would select lower-risk TAVR cases. In the Figure, each dot represents an individual center and the median PROM is the median predicted risk for patients at each center. Although the STS PROM for surgical isolated AVR may not be an accurate predictor of TAVR risk, it does provide a uniform summary statistic for assessing baseline case complexity. SAS statistical software version 9. 1 was used for all calculations, and analyses were performed at the TVT Registry Analysis Center at the Duke Clinical Research Institute.

There were 8075 TAVR cases entered into the TVT Registry between November 1, 2011, and May 31, 2013, allowing 60 days for data entry. Among these patients, 292 cases had missing data for in-hospital events, discharge status, or valve sheath access site; in addition, in 73 cases the operator assessment of procedural risk was unknown. Patients with inoperable status in the PARTNER trial had a mean STS PROM of 11. 2% and those with high-risk but operable status had a mean of
11. 8%. Although this may represent incomplete entry of variables into the risk calculator by US clinical sites, it could indicate "risk creep, " meaning patients with lower surgical risk are being treated in the United States, leading to better outcomes with TAVR.

### Impact of cancer in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a single-center study [^112iR4M2]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Major advances in the treatment of cancer, including combination chemotherapy, targeted molecular therapy, immune therapy, radiation, cancer prevention vaccines, and mitigation of treatment toxicities, have led to improved survival, resulting in a growing proportion of patients with aortic valve stenosis and concomitant cancer. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) might provide a feasible treatment option to increase life expectancy in this patient population. Patients at intermediate or high operative risk are recommended treatment with TAVR with equivalent outcomes to surgical aortic valve replacement according to current international guidelines. Recently, the safety of TAVR in surgical low-risk patients has been demonstrated in randomized trials; however, patients with cancer and an estimated life expectancy < 2 years were excluded from major TAVR trials.

Patients with cancer show unique characteristics dependent on the tumor type and treatment that need to be considered when determining strategies for aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis; however, the presence of cancer is not reflected by surgical risk calculators. Data regarding periprocedural complications and short- and long-term survival in patients with cancer treated with TAVR are scarce. Nonrandomized studies have shown either similar outcomes following TAVR in cancer and control groups, or worse outcomes due to cancer progression after 1 year. In addition, incidental malignant findings in computed tomography have been shown to be an independent predictor of all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality, but not of cardiovascular mortality. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the impact of active and stable cancer on peri-procedural complications and short- and long-term survival in a real-world, single-center cohort of patients treated with TAVR.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) structural program requirements state that the structural measures of quality include the requirement that operators and institutions have the skills, experience, foundational TAVR and SAVR volume, and facilities that are fundamental to delivering TAVR and SAVR. Nonfemoral TAVR has a learning curve with 30 to 45 cases needed to reach a plateau for procedure time and device success; early registry data show the cumulative TAVR volume–outcome relationship is strong during the learning curve and that there is a steep slope for improved major outcomes in the first 100 cases. Sites that are not in the higher-volume/experienced tier may provide high-quality TAVR care typically via the transfemoral approach, and these programs should have an active quality assessment.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a potential option for the nonsurgical patient [^1173dtFX]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

With improved life expectancy, the incidence of aortic stenosis is rising. However, up to one-third of patients who require lifesaving surgical aortic valve replacement are denied surgery due to a high operative mortality rate. Such patients can only be treated with medical therapy or percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty, neither of which has been shown to improve mortality. With advances in interventional cardiology, transcatheter methods have been developed for aortic valve replacement. Clinical trials are investigating these devices in patients with severe aortic stenosis that have been denied surgery. Preliminary results from these trials suggest that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not only feasible, but an effective way to improve symptoms. In this review, we describe the current technology and display available outcome data. Though technical challenges and operator learning curve limit optimal use of the current technology, continued experience and advancements in technology may one day make TAVR a viable alternative to traditional surgical aortic valve replacement.

### Individual operator experience and Outcomes in transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement [^11274wDk]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of individual operator experience on transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes.

Background

TAVR volume-outcome relationships have not been evaluated at the individual operator level.

Methods

New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System data from 8,771 transfemoral TAVR procedures performed by 207 operators between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Operator volume was defined as the number of TAVR procedures performed during 1 year prior to the index procedure. Hierarchical and restrictive cubic spline regression models were used to evaluate the impact of individual operator experience on risk-adjusted in-hospital outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, stroke, and/or acute myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome.

Results

After adjusting for hospital and physician characteristics, patients undergoing TAVR performed by high-volume physicians (≥ 80/year) had a significantly lower risk for death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.37 to 0.93) compared with those treated by low-volume physicians (< 24/year). Being treated by operators who performed 200 procedures during the prior year was associated with significantly lower risks for post-procedural stroke (odds ratio: 0.41; 95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.97) and composite events (odds ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.26 to 0.78). This relationship was nonlinear, and a sensitivity analysis excluding the first 10, 20, and 30 procedures for each operator mitigated the effect of the initial learning curve.

Conclusions

Increased TAVR experience of operators is associated with improved risk-adjusted in-hospital outcomes. These results have potentially important implications for individual training and hospital programs in TAVR.

### Impact of operator characteristics on outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116oNKxT]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Operator characteristics and outcome relationships have not been evaluated at the individual operator level.

Methods

From New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, 5896 elective transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures performed by 161 operators between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. We examined the following characteristics of the primary operator: specialty (surgery vs cardiology), sex, medical school location, experience of cardiology practice, interventional cardiology credentialing, past-year TAVR volume, and first year performing TAVR in New York State. The primary outcome was a composite of inhospital mortality, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction.

Results

After adjusting for patient and other provider characteristics, there was no significant difference in the risk of major events between surgeons and cardiologists in performing TAVR (3.4% vs 3.6%, P = 0.60), between male operators and female operators (P = 0.80), and between operators who graduated from a US medical school and operators educated outside the United States (3.4% vs 3.6%, P = 0.73). In the subgroup analysis, interventional cardiology credentialing was not significantly associated with the inhospital major events (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.88; p = 0.80).

Conclusions

Primary operator specialty and other characteristics for TAVR were not associated with a difference in risk-adjusted inhospital outcomes. That may be due to the heart team model that allows proceduralists of different backgrounds to lend their expertise to the procedure.

Do Clinical Trials of TAVR in Low‐Risk Patients Herald the End of Isolated SAVR?

So long as TAVR was restricted for use only in high‐ and extreme‐risk patients, there remained a clear role for surgery for the many more patients with symptomatic severe AS who were operable. However, data from PARTNER 2 and SURTAVI have convincingly demonstrated that TAVR is noninferior to SAVR in intermediate‐risk patients and, if performed via transfemoral access, is associated with improved early health status improvements compared with SAVR. 22 Thus, in 2018, it is reasonable to favor TAVR in all operable patients with symptomatic severe AS and increased surgical risk.

Table 3 summarizes the study design of currently enrolling randomized clinical trials of TAVR in low‐risk patients. 23, 24, 25, 26 The first results from these studies are expected in 2018. Assuming these results demonstrate noninferiority of TAVR versus SAVR, in the future it will likely be reasonable to consider TAVR in all patients with symptomatic severe AS, regardless of operative risk (Figure 2). If this is the case, then we wholeheartedly support continued Heart Team collaboration between interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, although the requirement for 2 surgeons to evaluate each patient for operative risk before TAVR would become obsolete. Availability of TAVR for all, regardless of operative risk, would also allow more opportunity for patient preference to direct decision‐making. Indeed, many low‐risk patients may prefer TAVR over SAVR for personal reasons that current guidelines and indications cannot encompass.

Ongoing Clinical Trials in Low‐Risk Patients

Figure 2
Evolution of the treatment algorithm for patients with aortic stenosis in the United States. SAVR indicates surgical aortic valve replacement; TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

However, risk assessment is but 1 element of the decision‐making process. Special circumstances may still favor SAVR, namely, patient life expectancy, patients' preference for a mechanical valve, aortic valve and root anatomy, available vascular access, and comorbidities (Table 4).

### TAVR vs SAVR: rising expectations and changing indications for surgery in response to PARTNER II [^113whyNf]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the criticisms and concerns raised on the data published in the PARTNER II trial and related analyses, we are undeniably witnessing a revolution in the management of aortic valve disease, in which conventional full sternotomy surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), with all related complications and clinical burden, will soon become a nonviable option. Several of the findings described in the PARTNER II trial, although considerable as points of incongruence and study biases in comparison with SAVR, could be taken as lessons to found a new course in SAVR and redesign the respective roles of surgery and interventional procedures in aortic disease. In particular, the results of these trials can actually be considered as a stimulus to invest more effort to improve the current surgical practice that should embrace alternative solutions and least invasive approaches to provide a competitive advantage over percutaneous procedures. An analysis of these points in light of the more recent findings on transcatheter valve durability, thrombosis, and postprocedural complications is provided. Considerations on the parallel progress of SAVR and on the need for a behavioral change in the surgical community are discussed.

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement in low-risk patients at five years [^114r6tuY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) was published by Michael J Mack and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: what is the role of TAVR in low-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the population was: 950 patients (292 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk. The key exclusion criteria were native aortic annulus size unsuitable for sizes 20, 23, 26, 29 mm transcatheter heart valve; evidence of acute myocardial infarction ≤ 30 days before randomization; aortic valve unicuspid, bicuspid, or noncalcified; severe aortic regurgitation; complex coronary artery disease. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 496 TAVR (TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve) n = 454 surgery (SAVR with a commercially available bioprosthetic valve). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years (22.8% vs. 27.2%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, disabling stroke, nondisabling stroke, and rehospitalizations at 5 years (221% vs. 19%; WR 1.17, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.51) No significant difference in death from any cause at 5 years (10% vs. 8.2%; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.9) No significant difference in stroke at 5 years (5.8% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.48). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk, TAVR was not superior to surgery with respect to death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years.

### Evolving paradigms in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from a high-volume, single center experience [^1151GrhR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the expanding indications toward younger patients at lower surgical risk, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) simplification and streamlining are gaining increasing importance. Patients who underwent TAVR from the year 2015 to 2020 were prospectively enrolled. The patients were divided in time tertiles according to the date of intervention. Data on preprocedural planning, including coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), procedures, and outcomes, were compared between the time tertiles. A total of 771 consecutive patients from a single institution were enrolled. We observed a trend toward the use of a fully percutaneous versus surgical approach for the index access, left radial artery versus contralateral femoral artery for the secondary access, and left ventricular pacing on the stiff guidewire versus right ventricular pacing. Immediate device success significantly increased, whereas the length of hospital stay decreased. Overall, approximately 60% of the total study population underwent CCTA instead of coronary angiography, with no adverse events. One-year survival rates significantly improved over time. A simplified TAVR approach was associated with better survival, whereas low baseline functional capacity, preexisting coronary artery disease, renal impairment, periprocedural blood transfusions, and paravalvular leak were related to worse outcomes. In conclusion, our study showed a constant tendency to procedure streamlining and improve procedural success and 1-year outcomes. A strategy based on CCTA allows sparing safely almost half of the preoperative invasive coronary angiography.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program data sources and benchmarking — registry reporting and visualization — state that requirements are fulfilled using STS/ACC TVT Registry and STS National Database data, with quarterly site reports that include national benchmarks summarized as box plots; because box‑and‑whisker plots do not convey uncertainty for small samples, the authors advocate using funnel plots. All data are "currently generated" from these registries; each metric includes a median and interquartile range from the previous rolling 4 quarters; and the method's limitations and the funnel‑plot alternative are specified.

### Effect of institutional transcatheter aortic valve replacement volume on mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111unisD]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis to examine the association between institutional transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) volume and all-cause mortality.

Background

Since inception in 2011, there has been an exponential increase in the number of TAVR centers across the world. Multiple studies have questioned if a relationship exists between institutional TAVR volume and patient outcomes.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search for relevant articles using a combination of free text terms in the title/abstract related to volume, TAVR, and patient outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts for eligibility based on pre-specified criteria. All-cause mortality data was pooled from eligible studies and centers were categorized as low-(30–50 cases), intermediate-, or high-volume (75–130 cases) based on their annual TAVR volumes.

Results

Our search yielded an initial list of 11,153 citations, 120 full text studies were reviewed and 7 studies met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 1,93,498 TAVRs. Categorized according to center's annual volume; 25,062 TAVRs were performed in low-, 77,093 in intermediate- and 91,343 in high-volume centers. Network meta-analysis showed a relative reduction in mortality rates of 37%, 23% and 19%, for high volume versus low volume centers, high volume versus intermediate volume centers and intermediate versus low volume centers, respectively.

Conclusions

Existing research clearly shows an inverse relationship between annual TAVR procedural volume and all-cause mortality. We need to focus on development of strong referral networks and consolidation rather than expansion of existing TAVR centers to improve patient outcomes, while ensuring adequate access-to-care.

### Outcomes of SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement compared with surgical valve replacement in intermediate-risk patients [^112xRf2L]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies demonstrated transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with an earlier generation balloon-expandable valve to be noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for death and disabling stroke in intermediate-risk patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis at 5 years. However, limited long-term data are available with the more contemporary SAPIEN 3 (S3) bioprosthesis.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare 5-year risk-adjusted outcomes in intermediate-risk patients undergoing S3 TAVR vs SAVR.

Methods

Propensity score matching was performed to account for baseline differences in intermediate-risk patients undergoing S3 TAVR in the PARTNER 2 (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) S3 single-arm study and SAVR in the PARTNER 2A randomized clinical trial. The primary composite endpoint consisted of 5-year all-cause death and disabling stroke.

Results

A total of 783 matched pairs of intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were studied. There were no differences in the primary endpoint between S3 TAVR and SAVR at 5 years (40.2% vs 42.7%; HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74–1.03; P = 0.10). The incidence of mild or greater paravalvular regurgitation was more common after S3 TAVR. There were no differences in structural valve deterioration-related stage 2 and 3 hemodynamic valve deterioration or bioprosthetic valve failure.

Conclusions

In this propensity-matched analysis of intermediate-risk patients, 5-year rates of death and disabling stroke were similar between S3 TAVR and SAVR. Rates of structural valve deterioration-related hemodynamic valve deterioration were similar, but paravalvular regurgitation was more common after S3 TAVR. Longer-term follow-up is needed to further evaluate differences in late adverse clinical events and bioprosthetic valve durability.

### Hemodynamics of transcatheter and surgical aortic valves in the PARTNER trial… [^111XCDhL]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

SAVR indicates surgical aortic valve replacement; TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement. aSD: 45 days. Solid lines indicate the parametric estimate of the temporal trend after procedure; dotted lines indicate 95% CIs. Filled circles indicate grouped data without regard to the repeated measurements based on time intervals, provided here as a crude verification of the model fit. DVI indicates Doppler velocity index. As the first and largest of the randomized TAVR trials, the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 1 Trial provides a rich, independently adjudicated data resource to address these issues. This report will analyze these data to determine the longitudinal hemodynamic profile of the SAPIEN THV and assess the incidence and consequences of any adverse changes as detected by echocardiography. Similar analyses are also performed in patients with surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in the PARTNER 1 Trial.

The PARTNER 1 Trial consisted of 3 cohorts: PARTNER 1A, or high risk, which randomized patients to either TAVR or SAVR; 1B, or inoperable, which randomized to either medical treatment or TAVR; and continued access. Twenty patients in the TAVR cohort and 1 in the SAVR cohort met the protocol definition of aortic valve reintervention. In the TAVR group, 9 had SAVR, 8 had late valve-in-valve TAVR, and 3 had balloon aortic valvuloplasty. One patient had a valve-in-valve TAVR placed. An absolute value of DVI of 0. 25 or less occurred in 6 patients, of whom 5 died. Reintervention was quite rare in this TAVR cohort, became less frequent over time, and was usually not due to structural deterioration of THV.

Unfortunately, protocol-driven echocardiogram data were temporally distant and uninformative, highlighting the critical importance of real-time clinical data. Collection of such information in future studies could aid considerably in finding associations between hemodynamic changes and events.

### Urgent vs elective transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis [^114Xitec]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common forms of valvular heart disease in developed countries, with a rising prevalence in the setting of an aging global population. It is characterized by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload, adverse cardiac remodeling, and ultimately heart failure with a high risk of mortality. Once symptomatic, severe AS carries a poor prognosis, with untreated patients experiencing 2-year mortality rates exceeding 50%. Current guidelines recommend prompt intervention with aortic valve replacement, either surgically or via a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), in patients with severe symptomatic AS, as well as in selected asymptomatic individuals with reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

AS typically presents as a slowly progressive chronic disease, and the majority of aortic valve replacements are performed electively. However, a subset of patients present acutely with decompensated heart failure, critical valve stenosis, or cardiogenic shock, necessitating urgent intervention. Historically, these patients — often considered too unstable for surgery — were offered balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as a bridge to definitive treatment. However, BAV has notable limitations, including a significant risk of procedural complications, high restenosis rates, exposure to multiple interventions, and poor long-term survival, leading to increasing scrutiny of its role in contemporary practice. With advancements in procedural safety and operator experience, TAVR has become a more viable alternative for urgent cases, with emerging evidence suggesting comparable immediate outcomes to BAV but with the advantage of providing a more definitive treatment.

Several studies have evaluated outcomes of patients undergoing urgent vs elective TAVR. However, most existing studies have been small, single-center investigations; lacked long-term follow-up; or were based on historical TAVR cohorts predominantly comprising high-surgical-risk patients, limiting their applicability to modern practice. Furthermore, no studies have specifically examined this issue in the Australian setting. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics, procedural risks, and outcomes of patients undergoing urgent TAVR in the contemporary era is essential to refine patient selection, optimize procedural strategies, and improve postprocedural care.

In this context, we conducted a retrospective study assessing outcomes of urgent vs elective TAVR in a contemporary Australian cohort with severe AS. Our aim was to evaluate in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes and to determine whether urgent TAVR is independently associated with increased mortality and adverse outcomes.

### Transcatheter or surgical replacement for failed bioprosthetic aortic valves… [^112rQwEb]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Data were obtained from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information, the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, and the New Jersey Discharge Data Collection System. Exclusion criteria included undergoing TAVR or redo SAVR within 5 years from initial SAVR, as well as infective endocarditis, concomitant surgical procedures, and out-of-state residency. Propensity matching yielded 375 patient pairs. Data were analyzed from January to December 2023. Interventions ViV-TAVR vs redo SAVR. Main Outcomes and Measurements The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were stroke, heart failure hospitalization, reoperation, major bleeding, acute kidney failure, new pacemaker insertion, and infective endocarditis. Results. Periprocedural mortality and stroke rates were similar between propensity-matched groups. The ViV-TAVR group had lower periprocedural rates of major bleeding, acute kidney failure, and new pacemaker implantations. In a landmark analysis, no difference in mortality was observed up to 2 years, but after 2 years, ViV-TAVR was associated with higher mortality as well as with a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization. There were no differences in 5-year incidence of stroke, reoperation, major bleeding, or infective endocarditis. Conclusions and Relevance Compared with redo SAVR, ViV-TAVR was associated with a lower incidence of periprocedural complications and a similar incidence of all-cause mortality through 2 years' follow-up. However, ViV-TAVR was associated with higher rates of late mortality and heart failure hospitalization. These findings may be influenced by residual confounding and require adjudication in a randomized clinical trial.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113vsYN7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'.

Surgical bioprosthesis durability — freedom from structural valve deterioration — shows favorable long-term metrics. Currently employed surgical valve designs demonstrate freedom from explant due to structural valve deterioration as low as 5.4% in one large, single-institution study, actuarial freedom from structural valve deterioration at 15 years of 78.6%, and an expected valve durability of 19.7 years in another study.

### Transcatheter or surgical aortic-valve replacement in intermediate-risk patients [^115kZo5N]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 2 was published by Leon MB and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 2 study, the trial question was: is TAVR noninferior to SAVR in intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 2 study, the population was: 2032 patients (924 female, 1108 male). The inclusion criteria were intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were heart team assessment of inoperability, evidence of acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month, congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve, mixed aortic valve disease, preexisting mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, complex coronary artery disease, HCM with or without obstruction, leukopenia, acute anemia, severe ventricular dysfunction. In the PARTNER 2 study, the interventions were: n = 1011 TAVR (transfemoral or transthoracic placement of SAPIEN XT valve system) n = 1021 surgery (surgical aortic-valve replacement). In the PARTNER 2 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death from all causes or disabling stroke at 2 years (19.3% vs. 21.1%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09). In the PARTNER 2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause at 2 years (16.7% vs. 18%; RR 0.93, 95% CI -1.44 to 3.3) No significant difference in disabling stroke at 2 years (6.2% vs. 6.4%; RR 0.97, 95% CI -7.32 to 9.26) No significant difference in rehospitalization at 2 years (19.6% vs. 17.3%; RR 1.13, 95% CI -0.67 to 2.93). In the PARTNER 2 study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major vascular complications (7.9% vs. 5.0%), life-threatening bleeding (10.4% vs. 43.4%), AKI (1.3% vs. 3.1%), and new-onset AF (9.1% vs. 26.4%) at 30 days. In the PARTNER 2 study, the conclusion was: in intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR was noninferior to surgery with respect to death from all causes or disabling stroke at 2 years.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program — institutional and registry requirements emphasize that a multidisciplinary team (MDT) is required. TAVR programs should undergo a similar regulatory process with CMS endorsement, and centers should be approved if they have addressed quality benchmarks with appropriate infrastructure and committed hospital support. Ancillary testing facilities should be of high quality and able to accommodate patient volume, and these procedures should only be performed in institutions that routinely perform surgical aortic valve operations and participate in the STS National Database. Only institutions with established interventional cardiology programs with outcomes that equal or exceed national standards should offer TAVR. Long-term outcome reporting is obligatory across parameters including complications, aortic regurgitation, pacemaker needs, TAVR reintervention, structural valve failure, subsequent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and quality of life (QoL), and participation in a national data registry is mandatory.

### Single center TAVR experience with a focus on the prevention and management of catastrophic complications [^115LPykx]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

While not directly comparable, the data from our single center demonstrate lower mortality than most reported series, with higher survival at 12 months in both operable and inoperable patients. Although the average STS score in our group (9.74) was slightly lower than the average in the PARTNER Cohort A (11.8) and Cohort B (11.2) trials, it remains well within the range of high-risk or inoperabality, as also deemed by our surgical team–. Interestingly, the mortality of patients who were operable versus inoperable is not substantially different. This suggests that there are other factors that determine mortality. We found that the STS score was one of the most important factors determining 1-year mortality, confirming the contribution of comorbid conditions to long-term outcome and as demonstrated in recent analyses of the PARTNER I trial. Prior BAV was also a predictor of higher mortality after TF-TAVR, likely due to the fact that BAV was invariably performed in patients whose comorbidities precluded a direct pathway to an AVR procedure.

Limitations

The most important limitation of this report is that generalizability of single-center findings may be limited. Our institution has a very large surgical experience in aortic valve surgeries and cardiovascular surgeries in general. This provides a unique infrastructure that may be difficult to duplicate in other programs. Further, our collaborative model and the utilization of multiple physicians in the same procedure are difficult to sustain. Finally, the ability to learn from our experience was influenced by several physicians who have dedicated their practices to this newer treatment modality, which may be difficult to do in other centers for a procedure with a complicated reimbursement scheme.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Valve choice for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) candidates depends on valve type preference and available sizes, with two commercially available platforms in the United States (balloon-expandable Sapien family and self-expanding CoreValve family). The largest randomized controlled trial showed similar 1-year mortality, strokes, and heart-failure readmissions with either valve. Situational preferences include self-expanding platforms for severe annulus/LVOT calcification, extremely oval annulus, or transfemoral access when femoral artery diameter is between 5.0 mm and 5.5 mm; newer self-expanding valves (CoreValve Evolut R) can be recaptured and repositioned, with potential benefit in low coronary ostia. A balloon-expandable valve may be preferable with a dilated ascending (> 43 mm) or severely angulated aorta (aorto-ventricular angle > 70°), and it is the only option for transapical approach; when either prosthesis is suitable, operator and/or institutional preference and experience generally guide choice.

### Long term outcomes of patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^117MLFSN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment option in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Intermediate and long-term follow up data of these patients is limited. Data was taken from a large all-comer single center prospective registry (2008 to 2019). The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were long-term valve hemodynamic performance; paravalvular leak (PVL) at 5-year follow-up. We also report on temporal trends in this cohort. Our cohort included 998 patients with a mean age of 82.3 ± 7.2 years and 52.2% females. TAVI was performed via the transfemoral, trans-apical, subclavian and other access routes in 93.9%, 3.6%, 2.5%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively. A self-expandable device was used in 69.4% of cases, balloon expandable device in 28.1% and in 2.5% other devices. The cumulative risk for all-cause mortality at 5 years was 43.4% (95% CI 39.1 to 47.7). The immediate and long-term valve gradients were low and maintained. On durability analysis at 5 years, severe structural valve deterioration was present in 1.6% of cases. At 5-year follow-up, PVL was moderate in 3.3% and no patients has severe PVL. On temporal trends analysis, we found that the procedural aspects of TAVI improved over time with lower rates of significant PVL and significantly lower procedural mortality. In conclusion, TAVI patients have a favorable long-term outcome, with excellent valve hemodynamic parameters and good clinical outcomes. Over time and with increasing experience, procedural and patient outcomes have improved.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patient selection requirements state that TAVR is currently approved in the United States for patients with severe native aortic stenosis and an intermediate or higher predicted operative 30-day mortality risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), as well as for valve-in-valve (ViV) treatment of degenerated aortic bioprosthetic valves in patients at high risk for reoperation. Patients with these categories of valve disease need a multidisciplinary approach for their evaluation. There should be documentation that each patient has been made aware of implantation techniques and the risks and benefits for both forms of aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient should be informed about both therapies are available at their hospital and the MDT's recommendations, and the volume and outcomes of both TAVR and SAVR for the site should be discussed. This sets the stage for SDM with the key element of incorporating patient preferences, and patients presenting to SAVR-only institutions should also be evaluated by an MDT.

### Cardiac operations after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1149NBWr]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now frequently performed for severe aortic stenosis. Data regarding cardiac operations after TAVR are limited, however. Therefore, we investigated patient characteristics, operative timing and indications, and outcomes of these operations in a single-center experience.

Methods

From January 2012 to July 2020, 59 patients (median age, 70 years) underwent cardiac operations after TAVR, 38 (64%) of which were performed in other centers. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) was calculated at the time of prior TAVRs and at applicable index cardiac operations.

Results

From 2012 to 2018, fewer than 10 operations were performed after TAVR, but 18 were performed in 2019. The interval between prior TAVR and cardiac surgery decreased exponentially from 7 years to less than 1 year over the experience. In applicable cases (19 of 59 operations [32%]), the median STS-PROM was 5.5% (15th-85th percentiles, 3.1%-25%), and 40 (68%) were complex operations with no calculable STS-PROM. The TAVR valve was explanted in 46 (78%); 5 were isolated surgical aortic valve replacements. TAVR valve stenosis/regurgitation (34 [58%]) was the leading indication, followed by paravalvular leak in 14 (24%) and endocarditis in 10 (17%). When the TAVR valve was not explanted, mitral regurgitation was the leading indication for operation. Operative death occurred in 5 (8.5%), postoperative stroke in 2 (3.4%), and postoperative dialysis in 6 (10%).

Conclusions

Cardiac operations after TAVR are increasing, and the interval between TAVR and operation is decreasing. Most cardiac operations are complex, high-risk reoperations, and isolated aortic valve replacement is rare. These findings should be considered when TAVR is selected for low- to intermediate-risk patients, particularly with multiple cardiac pathologies not addressed by TAVR.

### TAVR in the tricuspid domain: valve-in-valve transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement for bioprosthetic valve degeneration [^115BQ8XF]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

We report a novel use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for valve-in-valve tricuspid valve replacement. A man in his 50s with prohibitive risks for surgical intervention underwent this procedure to improve severe, symptomatic tricuspid stenosis. Though current literature is limited to case reports, the Valve-in-Valve International Database (VIVID) reports similar mortality rates between surgical and transcutaneous replacement. As a novel, off-label procedure, there is limited operator experience. Nonetheless, in non-operative or high-risk patients, similar outcomes are noted in between transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement and surgical replacement. This registry sets the framework for further studies with the possibility of observing outcomes as operator experience increases, while highlighting the feasibility of the procedure.

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^117JDa2d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study EARLY TAVR was published by Philippe Généreux and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the EARLY TAVR study, the trial question was: what is the role of early TAVR strategy in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis? In the EARLY TAVR study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EARLY TAVR study, the population was: 901 patients (278 female, 623 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score > 10%; LVEF < 50%; any other class I indication for aortic valve replacement. In the EARLY TAVR study, the interventions were: n = 455 early TAVR (transfemoral TAVR) n = 446 clinical surveillance (standard care in accordance with ACC and AHA guidelines). In the EARLY TAVR study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from any cause, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (26.8% vs. 45.3%; HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.63). In the EARLY TAVR study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in favorable outcome at 2 years (86.6% vs. 68%; AD 18.5%, 95% CI 12.6 to 24.3) Significant increase in integrated measures of LV and LA health at 2 years (48.1% vs. 35.9%; AD 12.2%, 95% CI 4.4 to 19.4) No significant difference in new-onset AF (13% vs. 12.4%; HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.6). In the EARLY TAVR study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in procedure-related adverse events in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement. In the EARLY TAVR study, the conclusion was: in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, early TAVR was superior to clinical surveillance with respect to death from any cause, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular causes.

Patient selection considerations for severe aortic stenosis (AS) — There are legitimate concerns that many patients with severe AS meeting the expanding indications for TAVR are not currently being provided critical information regarding their treatment options. The MDT approach provides patients and families with a comprehensive evaluation and determination as to whether TAVR, SAVR, or both are appropriate options for patients, yet it is unclear to what extent patients evaluated by physicians and hospitals without TAVR programs are being informed of potential TAVR eligibility. It is important to understand that there are over 500 programs in the United States that only offer SAVR, and the requirements for patient education and SDM outlined in this document are directed toward programs that offer TAVR and/or SAVR.

STS/ACC Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) Registry participation and outcomes reporting — The registry, via the Duke Clinical Research Institute, does adjudicate several key outcomes for TAVR and requires sites to submit data on 1-year outcomes, whereas the STS National Database has focused on 30-day outcomes; it also requires preprocedure, 30-day, and 1-year patient‑reported health status using the KCCQ questionnaire and has added frailty measures. These new measures and the 1‑year follow‑up requirement have challenged sites, but major progress has led to data collection in the majority of patients at 1 year, and reimbursement by CMS for TAVR is contingent on participation in this national registry to inform long‑term (1‑year) survival and QoL after TAVR or SAVR.

### Influence of transcatheter aortic valve replacement strategy and valve design on stroke after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a meta-analysis and systematic review of literature [^113FZrsv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study undertook a systematic review to establish and compare the risk of stroke between the 2 widely used approaches (transfemoral [TF] vs. transapical [TA]) and valve designs (CoreValve, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota vs. Edwards Valve, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Background

There has been a rapid adoption and expansion in the use of TAVR. The technique is however far from perfect and requires further refinement to alleviate safety concerns that include stroke.

Methods

All studies reporting on the risk of stroke after TAVR were identified using an electronic search and pooled using established meta-analytical guidelines.

Results

25 multicenter registries and 33 single-center studies were included in the analysis. There was no difference in pooled 30-day stroke post-TAVR between the TF and TA approach in multicenter (2.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4 to 3.4] vs. 2.8% [95% CI: 2.0 to 3.9]) and single-center studies (3.8% [95% CI: 3.1 to 4.6] vs. 3.4% [95% CI: 2.5 to 4.5]). Similarly, there was no difference in pooled 30-day stroke post TAVR between the CoreValve and Edwards Valve in multicenter (2.4% [95% CI: 1.9 to 3.2] vs. 3.0% [95% CI: 2.4 to 3.7]) and single-center studies (3.8% [95% CI: 2.8 to 4.9] vs. 3.2% [95% CI: 2.4 to 4.3]). There was a decline in stroke risk with experience and technological advancement. There was no difference in the outcome of 30-day stroke between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the risk of 30-day stroke after TAVR is similar between the approaches and valve types. There has been a decline in stroke risk after TAVR with improvements in valve technology, patient selection, and operator experience.

### Multidisciplinary transcatheter aortic valve replacement heart team programme improves mortality in aortic stenosis [^115pEFjL]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Improvement in technology and experience over time

We considered that the improvement in outcomes could be related to improved operator experience or improved device technology. At Flinders Medical Centre, there was a single operator for the entire study period, so no interoperator differences were contributory. We performed a subgroup analysis splitting the post-TAVR era subgroup into roughly equal early and late TAVR period groups, with the late TAVR era group the recipients of a more experienced operator and the latest valve technology. We found that the mortality benefit seen after the implementation of the TAVR programme occurred at the time of this implementation and then remained relatively static, with no continued improvement in mortality seen between the post-TAVR subgroups, suggesting that operator experience or improvements in technology were unlikely to contribute significantly.

Limitations

While our observational data cannot directly attribute the demonstrated improved survival to the MDHT in a causal manner, we were unable to offer any other significant inter-era alterations in the protocol as an explanation for these results, although unmeasured confounders may exist. The limitations of our data did not allow accurate comment on changing periprocedural complication rates over time, in particular due to improvements in operator experience or device technology, and so only mortality data were reported. Surgical risk scores such as the STS Score or the EuroScore were also unavailable for our population. While a formal MDHT may not have existed prior to TAVR, informal collegial discussion between cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons have been present for decades, although without the additional medical and surgical specialties of the current programme. There was also a relatively short duration of the pre-TAVR programme era included in the analysis due to the limitations of electronic data capture in the echocardiography database.

### STS-ACC TVT registry of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116KsLuE]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The STS-ACC TVT Registry (Society of Thoracic Surgeons-American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry) from 2011 to 2019 has collected data on 276,316 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at sites in all U.S. states. Volumes have increased every year, exceeding surgical aortic valve replacement in 2019 (72,991 vs. 57,626), and it is now performed in all U.S. states. TAVR now extends from extreme- to low-risk patients. This is the first presentation on 8,395 low-risk patients treated in 2019. In 2019, for the entire cohort, femoral access increased to 95.3%, hospital stay was 2 days, and 90.3% were discharged home. Since 2011, the 30-day mortality rate has decreased (7.2% to 2.5%), stroke has started to decrease (2.75% to 2.3%), but pacemaker need is unchanged (10.9% to 10.8%). Alive with acceptable patient-reported outcomes is achieved in 8 of 10 patients at 1 year. The Registry is a national resource to improve care and analyze TAVR's evolution. Real-world outcomes, site performance, and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 will be subsequently studied. (STS/ACC Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry [TVT Registry]; NCT01737528).

### Reinterventions after coreValve / evolut transcatheter or surgical aortic valve Replacement for treatment of Severe aortic stenosis [^112ZWPhL]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on valve reintervention after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are limited.

Objectives

The authors compared the 5-year incidence of valve reintervention after self-expanding CoreValve/Evolut TAVR vs SAVR.

Methods

Pooled data from CoreValve and Evolut R/PRO (Medtronic) randomized trials and single-arm studies encompassed 5,925 TAVR (4,478 CoreValve and 1,447 Evolut R/PRO) and 1,832 SAVR patients. Reinterventions were categorized by indication, timing, and treatment. The cumulative incidence of reintervention was compared between TAVR vs SAVR, Evolut vs CoreValve, and Evolut vs SAVR.

Results

There were 99 reinterventions (80 TAVR and 19 SAVR). The cumulative incidence of reintervention through 5 years was higher with TAVR vs SAVR (2.2% vs 1.5%; P = 0.017), with differences observed early (≤ 1 year; adjusted subdistribution HR: 3.50; 95% CI: 1.53–8.02) but not from > 1 to 5 years (adjusted subdistribution HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.48–2.28). The most common reason for reintervention was paravalvular regurgitation after TAVR and endocarditis after SAVR. Evolut had a significantly lower incidence of reintervention than CoreValve (0.9% vs 1.6%; P = 0.006) at 5 years with differences observed early (adjusted subdistribution HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12–0.73) but not from > 1 to 5 years (adjusted subdistribution HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.21–1.74). The 5-year incidence of reintervention was similar for Evolut vs SAVR (0.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.41).

Conclusions

A low incidence of reintervention was observed for CoreValve/Evolut R/PRO and SAVR through 5 years. Reintervention occurred most often at ≤ 1 year for TAVR and > 1 year for SAVR. Most early reinterventions were with the first-generation CoreValve and managed percutaneously. Reinterventions were more common following CoreValve TAVR compared with Evolut TAVR or SAVR.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) site volume and outcomes — registry data shows a clinically meaningful association of higher mortality and other major complications with site annual volume below the recommended threshold of 50 procedures/year, and the committee states that elimination of annual procedure volume requirements would result in a possibility of increased TAVR risk-adjusted mortality and major complications in the United States despite 5 consecutive years of improving outcomes; the assessment of site performance with low annual volumes is a major statistical challenge.
