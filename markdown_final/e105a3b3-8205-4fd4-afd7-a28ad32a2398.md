## Question

is the use of NSAIDs safe in asthmatic patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether NSAIDs are safe for patients with asthma and how to approach their use in these patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the asthma phenotype and whether the patient has aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Then, I should verify the mechanism of NSAID-induced reactions and which NSAIDs cross-react. Next, I will review guideline positions and FDA labeling to reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to examine the evidence for COX-2 selective agents and acetaminophen as alternatives. I should also consider pediatric data and aspirin desensitization strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and phenotype. Most patients with asthma tolerate NSAIDs, but a distinct subset has AERD, characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other COX-1–inhibiting NSAIDs; the prevalence is about 7% in adult asthma overall and higher in severe asthma, so I need to screen for this phenotype before making blanket recommendations [^114ssyJV] [^116QPfQ5] [^113pW54i].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is not IgE-mediated allergy. It's a cross-reactive pharmacologic effect whereby COX-1 inhibition reduces protective prostaglandin E2 and shunts arachidonic acid toward cysteinyl leukotrienes, provoking bronchospasm, rhinorrhea, and sometimes systemic symptoms within minutes to a few hours of exposure, which explains why reactions are class-wide for COX-1 inhibitors [^1115iAcw] [^116dpq1T] [^113xrZCk].

> Now, I should review guideline positions. GINA advises that aspirin and NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated in asthma unless there is a history of previous reactions, but clinicians should always ask about asthma and prior NSAID reactions before prescribing and stop NSAIDs if asthma worsens. In patients with AERD, GINA recommends avoiding aspirin and NSAIDs and, if an NSAID is absolutely needed, to prefer a COX-2 inhibitor or acetaminophen with supervised administration and observation for at least 2 hours after the first dose [^113ouL65] [^115jiFgY] [^112MZbPx] [^114ssyJV].

> Wait, let me verify how this aligns with regulatory labeling. FDA labeling for multiple NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen) carries contraindications or strong warnings for patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and advises caution in preexisting asthma due to cross-reactivity and risk of severe bronchospasm. This appears stricter than GINA's phenotype-specific stance, so I should reconcile this by emphasizing avoidance in AERD and individualized risk assessment in non-AERD asthma with explicit monitoring and patient education [^115zh7Zy] [^114mZqQW] [^112LEt8y] [^111yUiau] [^112nhpgL] [^113fFuFX].

> Next, I should review the evidence for COX-2 selective agents. Meta-analytic and controlled challenge data show that highly selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib, etoricoxib, rofecoxib) are generally well tolerated in AERD, with very low reaction rates and no significant FEV1 decline in supervised settings. However, rare reactions have been reported, so first-dose observation remains prudent, especially in unstable asthma or high-risk patients [^117GRB27] [^116r3Vsn] [^111NvH38] [^113ZNDY7] [^113xrZCk].

> I will now examine acetaminophen as an alternative. Let me consider the mechanistic angle: acetaminophen is a weak COX-1 inhibitor and is usually safe at standard doses in AERD, though high single doses (around 1000 mg) may provoke mild reactions in highly sensitive individuals. Practically, keeping doses modest and observing after the first dose is reasonable when alternatives are limited [^113xrZCk] [^114HLmEx].

> But wait, what about children with asthma? I should double-check pediatric data. High-quality randomized evidence shows no difference in asthma exacerbations or control between acetaminophen and ibuprofen in young children with mild persistent asthma; however, observational syntheses suggest that in children with confirmed ibuprofen hypersensitivity, respiratory adverse events can occur, so history-guided caution is warranted, and in children with suspected AERD features, avoid NSAIDs and consider specialty evaluation [^115fyhv9] [^113Ym727] [^112wpQPk].

> Next, I should review aspirin desensitization. For adults with AERD who require aspirin for cardiovascular indications or have refractory sinonasal disease, supervised oral aspirin desensitization followed by daily aspirin can improve quality of life, reduce polyp recurrence, and lessen systemic steroid dependence, but it carries gastrointestinal risks and must be done in specialized settings with appropriate precautions and pre-medication strategies, including leukotriene modifiers [^111yUFJq] [^112636rF] [^114PGFoh] [^114yW9jg].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure I haven't missed anything. For all patients with asthma, screen for AERD by asking about nasal polyps, chronic rhinosinusitis, and prior NSAID-induced respiratory symptoms; if AERD is suspected or confirmed, avoid aspirin and nonselective NSAIDs, and if an NSAID is absolutely necessary, use a COX-2 inhibitor or acetaminophen with supervised first-dose observation and rescue access; for patients without AERD, NSAIDs are not absolutely contraindicated, but I should start low, monitor closely, and instruct patients to stop if asthma worsens, aligning with GINA's cautionary stance and FDA labeling that emphasizes monitoring for deterioration in preexisting asthma [^112MZbPx] [^113ouL65] [^112LEt8y] [^111yUiau].

> I should confirm the documentation and follow-up plan. Record any prior NSAID reactions, provide clear avoidance counseling for AERD, and ensure patients know which analgesics are acceptable alternatives; in patients with difficult-to-control asthma, reassess medication contributors, including NSAIDs, and refer for specialist evaluation when indicated, as part of comprehensive optimization [^114FRaZc] [^112oV6Kh].

> Final check and conclusion: NSAIDs are not universally safe or unsafe in asthma. Safety depends on the presence of AERD. In AERD, avoid aspirin and nonselective NSAIDs and use COX-2 inhibitors or acetaminophen cautiously with supervision. In non-AERD asthma, NSAIDs may be used with caution and close monitoring, but I need to reconcile guideline nuance with FDA warnings by prioritizing individualized risk assessment, education, and first-dose observation when uncertainty remains [^113ouL65] [^112MZbPx] [^115zh7Zy] [^114mZqQW].

---

In general, **NSAIDs are not contraindicated in asthma** unless there is a history of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [^115jiFgY]. In patients with AERD, **avoid all COX-1 NSAIDs** due to risk of severe bronchospasm; use COX-2 inhibitors or acetaminophen with caution and observation [^112MZbPx] [^117GRB27]. For patients without AERD, NSAIDs are usually safe, but monitor for worsening asthma and discontinue if symptoms flare. Always ask about prior NSAID reactions before prescribing, and educate patients to stop NSAIDs if asthma worsens [^113ouL65].

## Prevalence and clinical significance of NSAID sensitivity in asthma

NSAID sensitivity is most clinically significant in AERD, a phenotype marked by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and **hypersensitivity to COX-1–inhibiting NSAIDs** [^114ssyJV]. Prevalence is approximately 7% in adult asthma and 15% in severe asthma; reactions typically occur within minutes to hours after NSAID ingestion and can be severe, including bronchospasm, shock, and respiratory arrest [^114ssyJV] [^116QPfQ5].

---

## Mechanisms of NSAID-induced asthma exacerbations

NSAID-induced exacerbations in AERD are primarily due to **COX-1 inhibition**, which reduces protective prostaglandin E2 and increases leukotriene production, leading to bronchospasm and inflammation [^116dpq1T]. This mechanism explains cross-reactivity among nonselective NSAIDs and the relative safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors in AERD [^113xrZCk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized risk assessment and patient education**:

- **General asthma population**: NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated unless there is a history of previous reactions [^113ouL65].
- **AERD patients**: Avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs; consider COX-2 inhibitors or acetaminophen with caution and observation [^112MZbPx].
- **Patient education**: Patients should be advised to stop NSAIDs if asthma worsens [^115jiFgY].

## Safety of specific NSAIDs

| **Nsaid class** | **Examples** | **Safety in asthma** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nonselective COX inhibitors | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Diclofenac | - Generally safe in non-AERD asthma <br/> - Contraindicated in AERD | - Use with caution <br/> - Monitor for exacerbations [^113ouL65] |
| Selective COX-2 inhibitors | - Celecoxib <br/> - Etoricoxib | - Generally safe in AERD <br/> - Low reaction rates | - Use with caution <br/> - Observe first dose [^112MZbPx] |
| Acetaminophen | Acetaminophen | Safe alternative to NSAIDs | Preferred analgesic/antipyretic in AERD [^112MZbPx] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting NSAID use in asthma

Several studies and reviews indicate that selective COX-2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated in AERD, with **low reaction rates** [^117GRB27] [^114gYA8t]. In non-AERD asthma, NSAIDs are generally safe, though monitoring for exacerbations is recommended [^115jiFgY].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Potential risks include **bronchospasm**, **exacerbations**, and rare anaphylactoid reactions, particularly in patients with AERD or a history of NSAID hypersensitivity [^111yUiau]. NSAIDs also carry gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^114CosSE] [^116nW4yC].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing NSAID safety

- **AERD history**: Strong predictor of NSAID-induced bronchospasm [^116QPfQ5].
- **Severity of asthma**: Higher risk in severe asthma [^114ssyJV].
- **Comorbidities**: Chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and other allergic conditions increase risk [^114bMu3g].
- **Age and gender**: AERD is more common in adults and females [^116dpq1T].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

Preferred alternatives include **acetaminophen**, which is generally safe in asthma, including AERD [^112MZbPx], and **selective COX-2 inhibitors**, which are generally well tolerated in AERD but should be introduced with caution and observation [^117GRB27]. For patients requiring antiplatelet therapy, **aspirin desensitization** is a viable option [^112636rF].

---

## Monitoring and precautionary measures

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for bronchospasm, exacerbations, and other adverse effects [^112LEt8y].
- **Patient education**: Instruct patients to stop NSAIDs if asthma worsens [^115jiFgY].
- **First-dose observation**: Consider observing the first dose of COX-2 inhibitors in AERD patients [^112MZbPx].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric asthma

NSAID sensitivity, including AERD, is **less common in children** than adults. Ibuprofen is generally safe in pediatric asthma, but monitor for hypersensitivity reactions [^115fyhv9].

---

NSAIDs are not universally contraindicated in asthma; they are generally safe in non-AERD patients, but **should be avoided in AERD**. Use COX-2 inhibitors or acetaminophen with caution in AERD, and monitor all patients for exacerbations. Individualized risk assessment and patient education are essential [^115jiFgY].

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are respiratory diseases with an increasing global prevalence that represent a social and economic burden for both industrialised and developing countries. The World Health Organization states that the number of patients with asthma is 300 million and predicts that this figure will rise to 400 million by 2025, while there are 600 million people with COPD worldwide and the disease is predicted to be the third ranked leading cause of death by 2020. Exacerbations are common events in the lives of patients with asthma and COPD. These episodes are often associated with infections by viruses or bacteria and cause worsening of symptoms, which can be fatal. Often these heightened symptoms are far less responsive to normal treatments and are associated with increased healthcare costs and societal impact. There is therefore an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapies for these respiratory diseases.

It has been recognised for many years that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is produced by many cell types within the lung. Furthermore, exogenous PGE 2 has been shown to have bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties in rodent modelsand human subjects. Thus, PGE 2 could represent an effective treatment, but it is associated with airway irritation and coughingand has a very short half-life and, as such, has an inappropriate pharmacokinetic profile for general clinical use.

The biological actions of PGE 2 are predominantly mediated by the activation of the four EP receptors, EP 1–4. We and others have recently shown that the bronchodilator properties of PGE 2 in human airways are mediated via activation of the EP 4 receptor, whereas the undesirable triggering of airway sensory nerves appears to be via its activity at the EP 3 receptor. However, it is still not clear which receptor is involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of PGE 2. Identification of a receptor mediating the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects of PGE 2 without the airway irritant activity would harness the beneficial effects while avoiding the undesirable properties.

To achieve this aim we profiled the inflammatory status of EP receptor knockout (KO) mice in an array of preclinical respiratory disease model systems (endotoxin: innate; allergen: asthma-like; and smoke: COPD-like). To investigate the signalling mechanisms involved, we used in vitro murine and human cell-based assay systems. In vitro assays confirmed the in vivo data which suggested that EP 4 receptor activation is responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of PGE 2 and that the effect was at the level of cytokine gene transcription via an adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) axis.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and contraindications are summarized as follows: Indication is persistent sinonasal and asthma symptoms in a patient with AERD despite conventional medical and surgical therapy. Contraindications include poorly controlled asthma, significant nasal polyp burden at time of desensitization, pregnancy, history of eosinophilic esophagitis, history of gastric and/or peptic ulcer disease, history of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, and history of medication nonadherence. A relative contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin or other NSAID; patients with such a history may undergo an aspirin desensitization and aspirin therapy, but this decision merits careful discussion with the patient and physician.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — indications and diagnostic confirmation for aspirin desensitization followed by oral aspirin therapy are specified as follows: Indications "include rapidly recurring nasal polyps following sinus surgery, uncontrolled rhinosinusitis despite use of standard medical therapies, and the need for frequent bursts of systemic corticosteroids to control respiratory or sinus symptoms", and "this therapy should only be recommended for patients with AERD because no clinical benefit has been described for aspirin-tolerant patients with CRSwNP and/or asthma". Because diagnosis matters for eligibility, "it is essential to confirm the diagnosis of AERD before desensitization", and "although the criterion standard for diagnosing AERD is a formal aspirin challenge, the diagnosis is more commonly made clinically", such that "for patients with known physician-diagnosed asthma, documented nasal polyps, and a clearly-reported history of a respiratory reaction after ingestion of an NSAID, the diagnosis of AERD does not need to be confirmed by a formal aspirin challenge". Patient report can be unreliable: "Up to 15% of patients with AERD are not able to identify whether or not they are intolerant to NSAIDs", and some "do not become aware of their hypersensitivity until a physician-administered provocative oral challenge induces a reaction", so "a provocative aspirin challenge is required" in selected groups that "fall into 1 of 4 categories": "Patients who have not used NSAIDs recently"; "Patients who are on a leukotriene-modifying drug"; "Patients who are less perceptive to their reactions"; and "Patients already on daily low-dose aspirin", including those "already taking 81 mg aspirin" who may only react "after stopping low-dose aspirin for at least 10 days" during a "provocative oral aspirin challenge".

Conclusion

The prevalence of potential drug‒drug interactions in patients with severe asthma receiving biological therapy is high. Their identification, prevention and resolution could contribute to optimizing therapy, maximizing its therapeutic effect and avoiding undesirable adverse events. These findings highlight the importance of integrating regular pDDIs assessments into clinical practice for patients with severe asthma. Comprehensive drug interaction software can aid in early detection and mitigation of pDDIs. Furthermore, multidisciplinary collaboration between pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals is essential for evaluating and managing complex medication regimens.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^114kmqh8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Choosing NSAID therapy remains confusing and controversial-the challenge for the clinician is to sum all the risks as well as analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy. COX-2 inhibitors are an important scientific advance in pain therapy, and using them in a safe and cost-effective manner is possible when all the competing risks are carefully weighed.

Although tens of millions of individuals worldwide use nsaids daily, balancing the competing risks and benefits of these agents continues to be a challenge. Evidence-based treatment guidelines and expert opinions have been promulgated, but will they actually translate to improved patient care?

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112HZuyp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS pain management — patient safety considerations: All patients should have drug allergies identified prior to administration of pain medication. Administer opioids with caution to patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15, hypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (SPO2 less than 90%) after maximal supplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of hypoventilation. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) during the previous 14 days. Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and ketorolac in patients with NSAID allergy, aspirin-sensitive asthma, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, or known peptic ulcer disease. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity). Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total amount of medication used to keep the patient comfortable.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115AuZ1K]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Adjusting ongoing asthma treatment in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6–11 years — once asthma treatment has begun, ongoing treatment decisions are based on a personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment, and review of the response, and for each patient asthma medication can be adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and medication side-effects; when good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, treatment may be stepped down to find the patient's minimum effective treatment. People's ethnic and racial backgrounds may be associated with different responses to treatment and these are not necessarily associated with genetic differences. If a patient has persisting uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite 2–3 months of ICS-containing treatment, assess and correct the following common problems before considering any step up in treatment: incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, persistent exposure at home/work to agents such as allergens, tobacco smoke, indoor or outdoor air pollution, or to medications such as beta-blockers or (in some patients) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), comorbidities that may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life, and incorrect diagnosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to advise avoiding aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications inhibiting COX-1 in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Consider preferring a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib) or acetaminophen, with appropriate healthcare provider supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, when an NSAID is indicated for other medical conditions.

### Subphenotypes of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory disease-exacerbated respiratory disease identified by latent class analysis [^116dpq1T]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to the current recommendations nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)‐exacerbated respiratory disease (abbreviated as NERD) is a proper term to describe the distinct phenotype of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid; ASA) and other NSAIDs hypersensitivity, which involves upper and lower airway mucosa. 1

It is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of upper and lower airways, an onset in early adulthood and a predilection for females. Respiratory symptoms are exacerbated by intake of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID's). 2 Diagnosis is confirmed by aspirin challenge tests. 3 NERD usually has a severe course accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis with recurrent nasal polyps, often requiring multiple sinus surgeries. 2, 4 Atopy is rather frequent in this population.

A recent meta‐analysis has indicated that 7% of asthmatics are aspirin‐sensitive but that the prevalence doubles in severe asthmatics. 5 A more insightful analysis of individual patients has shown this group to be nonhomogeneous. 6, 7

There is a consensus on the nonallergic mechanism responsible for asthmatic attacks in NERD, involving abnormal metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathways. 2 Following ingestion of NSAIDs, COX‐1 inhibition decreases biosynthesis of PGE 2 leading to enhanced or disinhibited synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). CysLTs released from eosinophils and mast cells cause abrupt onset moderate‐to‐severe bronchoconstriction and sometimes extrapulmonary signs of facial edema and skin erythema. 2 Transcellular metabolism of AA derivatives in the airway during multi‐cellular interaction generates various eicosanoids able to regulate inflammation and functional responses. The broken balance between anti‐inflammatory mediators known as lipoxins, 8, 9 PGE 2, 10, 11 and potentially pro‐inflammatory mediators such as cysLTs and PGD 2 12 has been linked to both severe asthma and NERD. 13

### Indomethacin [^112nhpgL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, indomethacin extended-release capsules should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with a NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

1.000000000000000e+00 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see Warnings].

2. Indomethacin extended-release capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects, Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).

3. Indomethacin extended-release capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.

### Safety of etoricoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in asthmatic patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^116r3Vsn]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of rheumatic conditions is limited in patients with asthma owing to concerns of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs potentially provoking asthma. Cross-sensitivity to all anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes occurs in these individuals.

Objectives

To study the safety of etoricoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, and to determine whether it cross-reacts with asthma in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

Methods

This study included 77 patients who had experienced asthma induced by aspirin and at least 1 other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Baseline evaluation included blood pressure measurement, nasal examination, spirometry, and peak expiratory flow rate measurement. Patients were given placebo the first day and then were challenged with once-daily etoricoxib in 3 different doses: 60 mg on day 2, 90 mg on day 3, and 120 mg on day 4. If no evidence of intolerance was seen, each patient was rechallenged with 60 or 90 mg of etoricoxib once daily (according to the rheumatic condition) 7 days later. Reassessment of the baseline measurements was performed daily from day 1 to day 4 after the initial challenge, on day 7 after rechallenge, and after 1 month of drug intake. If the patient developed any mucosal or skin reaction, hypotension, upper or lower airway obstruction, conjunctival reaction, or laryngeal edema during the challenge test, it was considered a positive response.

Results

Etoricoxib was well tolerated, without any signs of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity in aspirin- and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthmatic patients. None of 77 study patients experienced any symptoms or developed dyspnea, change in nasal examination, significant variation in peak expiratory flow rate greater than 20%, or decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 15% during etoricoxib challenge. The exact 1-sided confidence interval for the probability of etoricoxib inducing cross-reactions in patients with AERD was 0% to 2%.

Conclusions

These results confirm the lack of cross-reactivity between specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and aspirin in AERD. Etoricoxib was safe for treating inflammation in patients with AERD.

### Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with analgesic intolerance [^114B3ipz]. The Journal of Asthma (2005). Low credibility.

Intolerance reactions to acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common and caused by inhibition of COX-1 enzyme. Therefore, drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 enzyme may be safe in these subjects. In this study, we evaluated the tolerability of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in patients with analgesic intolerance. The eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by ASA and/or NSAIDs. A single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting. On 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib (Celebrex 200 mg, Pfizer, Turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals. Seventy-five subjects (mean age: 38.2 ± 1.4 years; F:M: 55:20) were included in the study. Twenty-one subjects had asthma. No reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation. Although celecoxib seems to be a safe alternative drug in our study group, considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature, the drug should be recommended for patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist.

### Diagnosis and management of NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD)-a EAACI position paper [^1179C3hb]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a chronic eosinophilic, inflammatory disorder of the respiratory tract occurring in patients with asthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), symptoms of which are exacerbated by NSAIDs, including aspirin. Despite some progress in understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome, which affects 1/10 of patients with asthma and rhinosinusitis, it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In order to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of N-ERD, a panel of international experts was called by the EAACI Asthma Section. The document summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of N-ERD pointing at significant heterogeneity of this syndrome. Critically evaluating the usefulness of diagnostic tools available, the paper offers practical algorithm for the diagnosis of N-ERD. Recommendations for the most effective management of a patient with N-ERD stressing the potential high morbidity and severity of the underlying asthma and rhinosinusitis are discussed and proposed. Newly described sub-phenotypes and emerging sub-endotypes of N-ERD are potentially relevant for new and more specific (eg, biological) treatment modalities. Finally, the document defines major gaps in our knowledge on N-ERD and unmet needs, which should be addressed in the future.

### Pain relievers and asthma… [^112yWpV4]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor. — We have read with interest the article by Lesko et al 1 on pain relievers and childhood asthma. In light of the article, we reviewed the study to determine whether we should change our advice to patients on the basis of its results. The study sets out to test the hypothesis that "ibuprofen is more likely than acetaminophen to increase the risk of acute bronchospasm in children with asthma and no history of aspirin sensitivity. " I'm not entirely sure, however, that any such hypothesis has ever existed in the minds of clinicians. I don't think anyone is suggesting that aspirin and ibuprofen pose a problem for asthmatic children who are not sensitive to these compounds. For us, it is not a question of whether ibuprofen generally triggers attacks in children with asthma but rather, as a clinician, being cautious about the possibility that a certain. Comments

### Caspase-11 promotes allergic airway inflammation [^1119MM4q]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Another common environmental factor involved in asthma exacerbations is the use of NSAIDs, which inhibit prostanoid production, and are well known to exacerbate asthma in over 10% of asthmatics. Furthermore, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of COX enzymes by indomethacin increases allergic lung inflammation, in murine models of asthma. By showing that endogenously produced PGE 2 is inhibitory for caspase-11 expression, we provide a putative explanation for the NSAID-driven exacerbation in asthma. Caspase-4/11 expression is therefore altered beyond bacterial infections, in this case during treatment with NSAIDs. Obtaining caspase-4 and IL-1β expression data from trials examining the effects of NSAIDs, such as a recent low-dose Aspirin trial, might confirm the physiological relevance of our findings. Although there is extensive literature, including in human studies, which describe the protective nature of PGE 2 in asthma, there is also evidence for PGE 2 –EP2 signaling contributing to asthma pathogenesis, by promoting IgE production. These controversial findings highlight the ability of PGE 2 to exert opposite effects on different cell types, which can often lead to opposing results in animal models.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ym727]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we assessed the association between ibuprofen use and asthma in children aged 0–18 years. Both observational and interventional studies were reviewed in the general population as well as the asthmatic population. Studies that benchmarked ibuprofen against an active comparator almost exclusively used paracetamol, and in both populations of children, the combined evidence suggested no difference in asthma-related adverse events between ibuprofen and paracetamol (or ketoprofen) use. A single observational study suggested a potential benefit of ibuprofen over paracetamol prescription in response to bronchiolitis in the general paediatric population after a one-year follow-up. When ibuprofen use was assessed relative to no alternative drug administration, differences emerged between the general and asthmatic populations. In the short-term follow-up (1–14 days) to ibuprofen use, two observational studies reported favourable effects in the general population, while one observational and one interventional study observed unfavourable effects in the asthmatic population. Over a longer follow-up period (12 weeks to 10 years), no clear effect emerged for either population.

The majority of research on the association between ibuprofen use and asthma-related adverse events in children has been conducted in the general population, benchmarked relative to paracetamol, and participants followed-up over a short duration. The aggregate result from five RCTs conducted in this context is driven primarily by the Boston University Fever Study, conducted almost 30 years ago on children aged 6 months to 12 years. While a single observational study conducted five years ago corroborates this finding, research is sparse. Furthermore, only a single study comparing ibuprofen with paracetamol use with a short-term follow-up was conducted in children with asthma, and this study was a second post-hoc analysis publication of the same Boston University Fever Study dataset. Given the increased vulnerability of the asthmatic population to respiratory adverse events from ibuprofen use that was observed in our review, there is a clear lack of research comparing the short-term effects of ibuprofen relative to alternative analgesics and antipyretics such as paracetamol in children with asthma.

### Meclofenamate sodium [^111v2cnt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, meclofenamate sodium should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^1117Yts9]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving diclofenac sodium delayed-release who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.

Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium delayed-release should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately (see WARNINGS).
Diclofenac sodium delayed-release, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects: Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Diclofenac sodium delayed-release, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Heart Failure and Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. (see WARNINGS, Hepatic Effects).
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactic Reactions).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium delayed-release should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium [^115yaC69]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma

Advise patients with preexisting asthma to seek immediate medical attention if their asthma worsens after taking sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. Patients with a history of aspirin-sensitive asthma should not take sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.18)].

Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

Inform patients that the concomitant use of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in "over the counter" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.

Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin

Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets until they talk to their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Crossreacting drugs and chemicals [^115CG55j]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their clinical effect through inhibition of prostaglandin H synthases 1 and 2, also known as cyclooxygenase. This shared effect of COX-inhibition is also the mechanism for shared adverse effects. Much of our understanding of cross-reacting drugs and chemicals with aspirin comes from studying asthmatics with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease is characterized by recalcitrant sinusitis/polyposis, asthma and precipitation of asthma after ingestion of aspirin and most NSAIDs. Cross-reactions between ASA and NSAIDs occur with first exposure unlike IgE-mediated allergic drug reactions. Cross-reactions between aspirin and other drugs are dependent upon inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 isoenzyme. Desensitization to aspirin will result in cross-desensitization to all NSATDs that inhibit COX-1. Despite reports in the literature, there does not appear to he cross-reactions between food coloring, hydrocortisone succinate and monosodium glutamate in individuals with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease. The new highly selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are well tolerated in AERD asthmatics who have not been desensitized to aspirin. Because low-dose ASA exerts a cardioprotective effect by irreversible inhibition of COX-1, AERD patients who are at risk for coronary artery disease should be considered for aspirin desensitization.

### The relationship between historical aspirin-induced asthma and severity of asthma induced during oral aspirin challenges [^112JcEFK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Historical aspirin- or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced reactions might provide predictive information about the severity of reactions in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) undergoing oral aspirin challenge (OAC).

Objective

We sought to assess the relationship between historical aspirin- or NSAID-induced bronchial reactions and the severity of bronchial reactions during OAC in patients with AERD.

Methods

Data regarding the provoking doses, treatments, and treatment settings of historical aspirin/NSAID-induced reactions were recorded, analyzed, and compared with the provoking doses, maintenance regimens, and observed decreases in FEV(1) that occurred during OAC in 210 consecutive patients referred with suspected AERD.

Results

Of 147 patients who reported seeking acute medical care for their historical aspirin/NSAID-induced asthma attacks, 101 (69%) were treated in an emergency department and released, and 46 (31%) required hospitalization. During OAC in these 147 subjects, 23 (16%) had a 20% to 29% decrease and 14 (10%) had a 30% or greater decrease in FEV(1) values from baseline. Of the 46 patients previously hospitalized for aspirin/NSAID-induced asthma attacks, 9 (20%) had a 20% to 29% decrease and 6 (13%) had a 30% or greater decrease in FEV(1) during OAC. By contrast, of the 63 patients who treated their prior aspirin/NSAID-induced reactions at home, 5 (8%) had a 20% to 29% decrease and 5 (8%) had a 30% or greater decrease in FEV(1) during OAC (P = not significant for both).

Conclusion

The severity of the historical aspirin/NSAID-induced asthma attack was not predictive of asthma severity during OAC.

Clinical Implications

These data provide further reassurance regarding the safety of outpatient aspirin desensitization.

### Should biologics Be used before aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease? [^114e1eJN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been a paradigm shift in the management of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It started in 2015 when the first biologic was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for severe eosinophilic asthma. Thus, there emerged a new era in the treatment of patients with type 2-mediated airway diseases. This has led to an increasing number of options for patients, undoubtably a great thing, but has left clinicians without a clear answer for how to balance the therapies that exist for AERD, what to recommend for treatment, and how to best assess the benefits and risks of each therapy. This paper aims to explore these benefits and risks, and to provide a roadmap for future studies.

### Potential dangers of aspirin use in patients with asthma… [^117GERRh]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

In aspirin-induced asthma, symptoms typically begin 30 minutes to three hours after ingestion of aspirin. These patients usually are sensitive to all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but not to acetaminophen. Estimates of the percentage of persons with asthma who are aspirin-sensitive range from 4 to 44 percent, depending on the population studied and the criteria used to define sensitivity. Jenkins and colleagues studied the syndrome to better inform these patients and their physicians about the danger of aspirin-induced asthma, given the rising prevalence of asthma and the widespread availability of aspirin and NSAIDs. They identified articles concerning aspirin sensitivity in patients with asthma and searched the references of these articles for additional relevant studies. Most studies and reports involved patients attending asthma clinics. The analysis was limited to studies that defined patients by use of an aspirin provocation challenge.

A positive test was defined as a 20 percent or greater reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second within three to four hours of the challenge. From the 66 papers initially identified, 21 were found to be suitable for inclusion in the analysis. The pooled incidence of aspirin-induced asthma in adults was 21 percent. One half of these patients responded to doses of aspirin of 80 mg or more. If only the history was used to determine aspirin sensitivity, the overall prevalence was 2. 7 percent. In children, the prevalence was 5 percent when provocation testing was used. Rates of cross-sensitivity were 98 percent to ibuprofen, 100 percent to naproxen, and 93 percent to diclofenac. Only 7 percent of adults and children showed cross-sensitivity to acetaminophen.

The authors conclude that about 21 percent of adults and 5 percent of children with asthma have significant aspirin sensitivity and high rates of cross-sensitivity to other common NSAIDs. History alone is insufficient to identify patients with asthma who are at risk of aspirin sensitivity, and some patients are sensitive to extremely low doses of aspirin. Because aspirin and many NSAIDs are available without prescription, the authors call for greater recognition of this condition, better warnings on drug packaging, and implementation of guidelines for analgesic use in patients with asthma.

### Safety of COX-2 inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin hypersensitivity [^114gYA8t]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the safety of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin hypersensitivity.

Data Sources

Clinical studies were identified using MEDLINE (1966-September 2002). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, aspirin, asthma, and hypersensitivity. English-language articles were identified and included. References from the identified articles were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The literature provides information regarding the safety of COX-2 inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). The mechanism of AERD involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase, particularly COX-1. Inhibition of COX-1 causes an increased production of certain inflammatory mediators, which results in the reactions seen with AERD. Considering this mechanism, COX-2 inhibitors may be an alternative to aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in a patient with AERD. This article analyzes 4 studies to evaluate the safety of COX-2 inhibitors in this population.

Results

The 4 studies evaluated included a total of 172 patients with AERD. All patients included demonstrated intolerance to aspirin or NSAIDs and tolerated the selective COX-2 inhibitor administered.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors provide a potentially safe alternative for treatment of inflammatory conditions in patients with AERD.

### Management options for patients with aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sensitivity [^114HLmEx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate and provide management strategies for patients with aspirin or nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) sensitivity.

Data Sources

Literature retrieval was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-March 2007) using the terms acetaminophen, aspirin, antiinflammatory agents nonsteroidal, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, leukotriene antagonists, desensitization, and tacrolimus. Article references retrieved were hand-searched for other relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies published in English were evaluated. Studies, review articles, and commentaries on aspirin-induced asthma and aspirin- or NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin sensitivity is most often manifested as respiratory reactions (eg, bronchospasm, profuse rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection) or urticaria/angioedema. The primary mechanism is believed to be inhibition of the cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) enzyme; as such, patients with aspirin sensitivity often display cross-reactions to nonselective NSAIDs that inhibit the COX-1 enzyme. Management strategies include avoidance of aspirin and cross-reacting nonselective NSAIDs. However, desensitization to aspirin is a viable option for patients with aspirin-induced respiratory reactions, especially for those who require aspirin for thromboembolic prophylaxis. Aspirin desensitization is maintained indefinitely with a daily aspirin dose. There is limited evidence of the use of leukotriene modifiers in preventing aspirin-induced asthma. COX-2 selective NSAIDs, especially in patients with aspirin-induced asthma, have not been found to cross-react. However, approximately 4% of patients with a history of aspirin-induced skin reactions may experience a cutaneous reaction following a challenge to a COX-2 selective NSAID. Since acetaminophen is a weak inhibitor of the COX-1 enzyme, patients with aspirin-induced asthma should not take more than 1000 mg of acetaminophen in a single dose.

Conclusions

Management of patients with aspirin/NSAID sensitivity includes avoidance of aspirin/nonselective NSAIDs, use of COX-2 selective NSAIDs, acetaminophen in doses less than 1000 mg, and desensitization. The role of leukotriene modifiers requires further study before they can be recommended for patients.

### Remission in asthma [^1161KjCB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

These anti-inflammatory drugs were recently summarized under the umbrella term "disease-modifying antiasthmatic drugs" (DMAADs). The strength of DMAADs is not only their remarkable efficacy and safety, but also their potential collateral efficacy (beneficial effects on comorbidities). Thus, today there are highly effective and safe immunomodulatory drugs aiming at the prevention of symptoms by targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation, with the additional advantage of improving control of co-morbidities. However, it is clear that precise phenotyping of the patients is an essential prerequisite of any individually tailored DMAAD treatment.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^114oqKY4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions

Acetaminophen

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue COMBOGESIC immediately and seek emergency medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe COMBOGESIC for patients with acetaminophen allergy [see Contraindications (4)].

Ibuprofen

NSAIDs, including the ibuprofen in COMBOGESIC, has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Instruct patients to discontinue COMBOGESIC immediately and seek emergency medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe COMBOGESIC for patients with ibuprofen or NSAID allergy [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, COMBOGESIC is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When COMBOGESIC is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9	 Serious Skin Reactions

COMBOGESIC contains acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Acetaminophen or NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, may cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of COMBOGESIC at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. COMBOGESIC is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to acetaminophen or NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114bMu3g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — defined as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and a respiratory reaction to COX-1 inhibitors including aspirin and NSAIDs — has higher incidence in patients with severe asthma. In fact, 30 to 40% of asthma patients with nasal polyps have AERD and 7% of all asthma patients have AERD, and 8% to 26% of patients with CRS and nasal polyps have AERD. Clinical reactions to NSAIDs occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion and include flushing, gastrointestinal issues, rash, and wheezing; this disease may be underdiagnosed and delay in diagnosis often leads to persistent or early recurrent disease after surgery because these patients are often not receiving targeted postoperative therapy.

### Safety of a specific COX-2 inhibitor in aspirin-induced asthma [^1117Uv6G]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

In a subset of patients with asthma, aspirin and several other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that inhibit simultaneously cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) precipitate dangerous asthmatic attacks. We tested the hypothesis that in patients with aspirin-induced asthma the attacks are triggered by inhibition of COX-1 and not COX-2. In twelve asthmatic patients (seven men, five women, average age 39 years) oral aspirin challenge precipitated symptoms of bronchial obstruction with fall in FEV1 > 20%, and a rise in urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) excretion; also in five patients the stable metabolite of PGD2, 9alpha11betaPGF2, increased in urine. The patients then entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in which they received either placebo or rofecoxib in increasing doses 1.5–25.0 mg for 5 consecutive days, separated by a 1-week wash-out period. No patient on rofecoxib developed dyspnoea or fall in FEV1 > 20%; mean urinary LTE4 and 9alpha11betaPGF2 urinary levels, measured on each study day for 6 h post-dosing, remained unchanged. Two patients on placebo experienced moderate dyspnoea without alterations in urinary metabolites excretion. At least 2 weeks after completion of the study, all patients received on an open basis 25 mg rofecoxib without any adverse effects. NSAID that inhibit COX-1, but not COX-2, trigger asthmatic attacks in patients with asthma and aspirin intolerance. Rofecoxib can be administered to patients with aspirin-induced asthma.

### Safety of triflusal (antiplatelet drug) in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory diseases [^114S1xum]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Aspirin, a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitor, is the antiplatelet drug of choice to prevent serious vascular events. Adverse reactions to aspirin are frequent particularly among patients with asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. COX-1 inhibitors but not COX-2 inhibitors precipitate asthma attacks. Triflusal is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor antiplatelet agent that is as effective as aspirin in the prevention of serious vascular events. The aim of the study was to assess the tolerability of triflusal in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

Methods

We studied 26 asthma patients [11 males, aged 52 (23–75) years] who had suffered asthma episodes triggered by one or more (23% of patients) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Aspirin sensitivity was confirmed by either intranasal or oral aspirin challenge. All subjects underwent a single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge with three doses of triflusal separated by 1 week (first cumulative dose = 225 mg; second cumulative dose = 450 mg; third cumulative dose = 900 mg). Cutaneous, respiratory, general symptoms and lung function were monitored for 4 h in the laboratory and for 24 h at home.

Results

No clinical reactions to triflusal were observed. There were no significant changes in lung function measurements.

Conclusion

Our study appears to demonstrate that triflusal is a suitable alternative to aspirin as antiplatelet agent to prevent AERD.

### Clinical and mechanistic advancements in aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease [^113pW54i]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by the clinical triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and a hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AERD is estimated to occur in as many as 15% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and/or asthma. Uniquely, patients with AERD develop respiratory symptoms within 30 to 180 minutes after ingesting NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. However, even in the absence of NSAIDs, patients tend to have more severe upper and lower respiratory disease. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms contributing to AERD are complex and intertwined; they include a systemic dysregulation in arachidonic acid metabolism, an aberrant inflammatory response, a disruption in the respiratory epithelial barrier, and an imbalance between the formation and degradation of fibrin locally in nasal polyps. This review will highlight novel mechanistic findings contributing to the pathogenesis of AERD. In addition, recent advancements in the clinical understanding and management of patients with AERD will be discussed.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^113eyWrr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are used in patients with pre-existing asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 100 mg) [^114mZqQW]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

5.13 Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients withaspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal.

Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution

in patients with preexisting asthma.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued. In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use

The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.

### Acetaminophen versus ibuprofen in young children with mild persistent asthma [^115fyhv9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Studies have suggested an association between frequent acetaminophen use and asthma-related complications among children, leading some physicians to recommend that acetaminophen be avoided in children with asthma; however, appropriately designed trials evaluating this association in children are lacking.

Methods

In a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we enrolled 300 children (age range, 12 to 59 months) with mild persistent asthma and assigned them to receive either acetaminophen or ibuprofen when needed for the alleviation of fever or pain over the course of 48 weeks. The primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations that led to treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. Children in both groups received standardized asthma-controller therapies that were used in a simultaneous, factorially linked trial.

Results

Participants received a median of 5.5 doses (interquartile range, 1.0 to 15.0) of trial medication; there was no significant between-group difference in the median number of doses received (P = 0.47). The number of asthma exacerbations did not differ significantly between the two groups, with a mean of 0.81 per participant with acetaminophen and 0.87 per participant with ibuprofen over 46 weeks of follow-up (relative rate of asthma exacerbations in the acetaminophen group vs. the ibuprofen group, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.28; P = 0.67). In the acetaminophen group, 49% of participants had at least one asthma exacerbation and 21% had at least two, as compared with 47% and 24%, respectively, in the ibuprofen group. Similarly, no significant differences were detected between acetaminophen and ibuprofen with respect to the percentage of asthma-control days (85.8% and 86.8%, respectively; P = 0.50), use of an albuterol rescue inhaler (2.8 and 3.0 inhalations per week, respectively; P = 0.69), unscheduled health care utilization for asthma (0.75 and 0.76 episodes per participant, respectively; P = 0.94), or adverse events.

Conclusions

Among young children with mild persistent asthma, as-needed use of acetaminophen was not shown to be associated with a higher incidence of asthma exacerbations or worse asthma control than was as-needed use of ibuprofen.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116iFeG9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse — Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause severe exacerbations, and beta‑blocker drugs, including topical ophthalmic preparations, may cause bronchospasm. Clinicians are advised to always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications, including eyedrops, and to always ask about asthma and previous reactions before prescribing NSAIDs, advising patients to stop using these medications if asthma worsens. Aspirin and NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated in asthma unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents (Evidence A). For people with asthma who may benefit from oral or ophthalmic beta‑blocker treatment, a decision to prescribe these medications should be made on a case‑by‑case basis, and treatment should only be initiated under close medical supervision by a specialist (Evidence D). Asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication to use cardioselective beta‑blockers when they are indicated for acute coronary events, but the relative risks and benefits should be considered (Evidence D), and the prescribing physician and patient should be aware of the risks and benefits of treatment.

### Identification and management of chronic pain in primary care: a review [^116PEdBE]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Drug Interventions

In their large-scale study of chronic pain, Breivik found that almost half of all people with chronic pain were taking non-prescription analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (55%), paracetamol (acetaminophen) (43%) and weak opioids (13%). Two thirds were taking prescription medicines, including NSAIDs (44%), weak opioids (23%), paracetamol (acetaminophen) (18%), COX-2 inhibitors (1–36%) and strong opioids (5%).

Given its good tolerability and efficacy, paracetamol has long represented a good baseline drug for management of chronic pain. However, recent studies call this into question, and we need a degree of circumspection about even this basic treatment. Additional analgesics should be targeted to the type of pain. While pain type is broadly either nociceptive or neuropathic, many pains are mixed, requiring multi-modal pharmacology.

Pain that is predominantly neuropathic should be treated with baseline regular paracetamol, followed by progression through tricyclic antidepressants, then gabapentin and then pregabalin. Topical preparations, including lidocaine and capsaicin, can be effective in managing neuropathic pain and should be considered in patients where pain is very localized and/or first-line treatments are contraindicated or have been insufficient. While tramadol can be initiated in primary care, it is recommended that morphine only be initiated for neuropathic pain by secondary care physicians. Patients requiring strong opiates for neuropathic pain should be considered for referral to secondary care pain management services.

For pain that is predominantly nociceptive, paracetamol should be trialed in the first instance and then augmented as appropriate with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, where no contra-indications exist. NSAIDs should only be used after taking into account age and comorbidities (including asthma, chronic kidney disease and risk of GI bleeding). Current research suggests that inappropriate NSAID prescribing is common and needs to be addressed urgently to improve patient safety. Topical NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen gel, can be used effectively in many causes of chronic pain and have better safety than oral NSAIDs and comparable efficacy; however, current evidence does not support their use in back pain.

### Sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1117dMmp]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin can provoke reactions ranging from respiratory to cutaneous in susceptible individuals. There has been particular attention looking at the role of cyclo-oxygenase enzymes 1 and 2 and their role in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.

Objective

Patients who present with a spectrum of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions to aspirin pose a special challenge for the physician. This article discusses proposed classification system, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis of disease, and current treatment options of aspirin-related disease.

Data Sources

Relevant articles in the medical literature were derived from searching the MEDLINE database with key terms aspirin-sensitive asthma, cyclo-oxygenase enzymes 1 and 2. Sources also include review articles, randomized control trials, and standard textbooks of allergy and immunology.

Results

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease remains a complex, heterogenous disease with varied clinical presentations. There have been many advances in trying to elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease. The classification system presented will provide greater ease when reading the literature and communicating with one another. Oral aspirin challenge remains the diagnostic test of choice for both respiratory and cutaneous reactions. Aspirin desensitization is an option for those with refractory respiratory disease or who require aspirin for other medical conditions.

Conclusions

This review discusses the challenges in classification, diagnosis, and treatment of those patients with a sensitivity to aspirin. Special attention is made to the possible mechanisms mediating disease progression and how specific therapies, such as leukotriene modifiers, may be helpful.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112636rF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization — aspirin challenge or desensitization followed by daily aspirin therapy is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) who require revision polypectomies or frequent or daily corticosteroid therapy, and any patient with a history of an acute NSAID hypersensitivity reaction with a medical indication for aspirin or other cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor should be offered desensitization. Before initiation, it is recommended that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) be greater than 60% predicted and at least 1.5 L; oral antihistamines and decongestants are discontinued 48 hours before and short-acting β-agonists the morning of desensitization; and outpatient protocols are acceptable except in patients with recent myocardial infarction, continuous β-blocker therapy, or uncontrolled asthma. A standard oral aspirin desensitization protocol begins with a dose of 40 mg of aspirin with dose escalation every 90 to 180 minutes; once patients have tolerated 325 mg without evidence of symptoms, they can increase to the recommended treatment dose of 650 mg twice daily at home; if aspirin is discontinued for more than 48 hours, the desensitized state can be lost and repeat desensitization is recommended. Use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in advance of desensitization decreases the severity of bronchospasm in AERD, though in a small subset it will potentiate symptoms; overall the added safety benefit from their use outweighs this risk.

### Ibuprofen [^111yUiau]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ibuprofen tablets. Ibuprofen tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

Pregnancy

In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Aspirin and NSAID sensitivity [^117HuKVR]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Aspirin and the older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that block cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) induce asthma attacks in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and urticaria in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Weak inhibitors of COX-1, such as acetaminophen and salsalate, crossreact also but only with high doses of the drugs. Partial inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2, such as nimesulide and meloxicam, also cross-react but only at high drug doses. COX-2 inhibitors do not cross-react; however, all NSAIDs, including the selective COX-2 inhibitors, can sensitize patients and induce urticaria or anaphylaxis on next exposure to the drug.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115jiFgY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma non-pharmacological interventions — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse: Always ask about asthma before prescribing NSAIDs, and advise patients to stop using them if asthma worsens. Always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications. Aspirin and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not generally contraindicated unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents. Decide about prescription of oral or ophthalmic beta-blockers on a case-by-case basis. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision by a specialist. If cardioselective beta-blockers are indicated for acute coronary events, asthma is not an absolute contra-indication, but the relative risks/benefits should be considered.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 50 mg) [^115zh7Zy]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

5.13 Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued.

In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use

The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.

### Safety risks for patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease after acute exposure to selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors: meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials [^117GRB27]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause bronchospasm in susceptible patients with asthma, often termed aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), with the risk being greatest after acute exposure. Selective NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 might be safer.

Objective

We sought to systematically evaluate changes in symptoms and pulmonary function after acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with the AERD phenotype.

Methods

A systematic review of databases was performed to identify all blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with AERD. Effect estimates for changes in respiratory function and symptoms were pooled by using fixed-effects meta-analysis, with heterogeneity investigated.

Results

No significant difference in respiratory symptoms (risk difference, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.01; p = 0.57), decrease in FEV1 of 20% or greater (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.02; p = 0.77), or nasal symptoms (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.02; p = 0.42) occurred with COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib). Selective NSAID exposure caused respiratory symptoms in approximately 1 in 13 patients with AERD (RD, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.14; p = 0.01). No significant differences were found according to leukotriene antagonist exposure or whether NSAIDs were randomly allocated.

Conclusion

According to clinical trial evidence in patients with stable mild-to-moderate asthma with AERD, acute exposure to COX-2 inhibitors is safe, and selective NSAIDs exhibit a small risk. Thus COX-2 inhibitors could be used in patients with AERD or in patients with general asthma unwilling to risk nonselective NSAID exposure when oral challenge tests are unavailable.

### Diclofenac sodium, capsaicin (flexipak) [^1165x25v]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dosedependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired

renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions). Avoid the use of diclofenac in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS; Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When VIMOVO is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9	Serious or Severe Skin Reactions

Naproxen

NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning.

Esomeprazole

PPIs can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including SJS, TEN, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

VIMOVO

Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious or severe skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of VIMOVO at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

### Clinical trials of aspirin treatment after desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^112qgoL5]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical efficacy of aspirin treatment after desensitization in patients with respiratory disease exacerbated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been documented in observational studies and in double-blind placebo-controlled trials. There is no general agreement with regard to the optimal maintenance dose or duration of treatment with acetylsalicylic acid after desensitization, thus further studies are necessary to offer clear guidelines to clinicians. This article summarizes data from noncontrolled, active-control, and placebo-controlled trials assessing clinical effectiveness and reporting on safety of treatment with acetylsalicylic acid in desensitized patients with respiratory disease exacerbated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation in asthma [^1129V4cy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Prostaglandins that constrict and relax airways are synthesized in reactions catalyzed by either COX-1 or COX-2. It is not known whether selective inhibition of COX-2 makes asthmatic responses better or worse.

Objective

To determine the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, etoricoxib, on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects.

Methods

Sixteen subjects with mild atopic asthma underwent rising dose inhalation challenges with allergen or methacholine to determine PD20 FEV1 during a control study period or after 10 to 13 days of treatment with etoricoxib (90 mg once daily). The order of study periods was randomized with at least 2-week washout periods. Induced sputum cells and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels were used to assess airway inflammation and blood assays for COX-1 and COX-2 activity to assess enzyme inhibition. Urinary excretion of lipids was used to assess prostaglandin biosynthesis.

Results

Etoricoxib did not change baseline lung function, nor airway responsiveness to allergen or to methacholine. Neither were the allergen-induced increase in sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels affected by treatment. The biochemical effectiveness of the treatment was established both in the blood assays and by the distinct inhibitory effect of etoricoxib on urinary excretion of tetranor-prostaglandin E2 (P < .001).

Conclusions

This first study of COX-2 inhibition in provoked asthma found no negative effects of etoricoxib on allergen-induced airflow obstruction and sputum eosinophils, basal lung function, or methacholine responsiveness. The study suggests that short-term use of COX-2 inhibitors is safe in subjects with asthma.

### Etodolac [^113siuLW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-existing Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthmas has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, etodolac should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma.

Information For Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

1.000000000000000e+00 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately (see WARNING S).

2. Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects, Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).

3. **Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS**: Advise patients to stop taking etodolac tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see WARNINGS].

It recommends empathetic adherence discussions including, 'In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you taken it?', and to confirm the diagnosis of asthma; if there is no evidence of variable airflow limitation, 'consider halving ICS dose and repeating lung function after 2–3 weeks' and 'Consider referring for challenge test'. For modifiable contributors, 'For adults/adolescents, switch to GINA Track 1, if available, to reduce exacerbations and simplify regimen', 'Check for risk factors or inducers such as smoking, beta-blockers or NSAIDs, or occupational or domestic allergen exposure… and address as possible', and 'Check for and manage comorbidities (e.g. rhinitis, obesity, GERD, obstructive sleep apnea, depression/anxiety)'. For therapy, 'Consider short-term (3–6 months) step-up to next treatment level or alternative option on present level', using shared decision-making. For persistent uncontrolled disease, 'If asthma still uncontrolled after 3–6 months on high dose ICS-LABA, or with ongoing risk factors, refer for expert advice', and 'Refer earlier than 6 months if asthma very severe or difficult to manage, or if doubts about diagnosis, or if occupational asthma is suspected'.

### Effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers on antiviral and allergic responses: EAACI task force on eicosanoids consensus report in times of COVID-19 [^114mrKJr]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers are among the most ubiquitously used medications in the general population. Their broad anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects are applied against symptoms of respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, as well as in other acute and chronic inflammatory diseases that often coexist with allergy and asthma. However, the current pandemic of COVID-19 also revealed the gaps in our understanding of their mechanism of action, selectivity, and interactions not only during viral infections and inflammation, but also in asthma exacerbations, uncontrolled allergic inflammation, and NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). In this context, the consensus report summarizes currently available knowledge, novel discoveries, and controversies regarding the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19, and the role of NSAIDs in asthma and viral asthma exacerbations. We also describe here novel mechanisms of action of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), outline how to predict responses to LTRA therapy and discuss a potential role of LTRA therapy in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, we discuss interactions of novel T2 biologicals and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers on the horizon, such as prostaglandin D2 antagonists and cannabinoids, with eicosanoid pathways, in context of viral infections and exacerbations of asthma and allergic diseases. Finally, we identify and summarize the major knowledge gaps and unmet needs in current eicosanoid research.

### Hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-classification, diagnosis and management: review of the EAACI / ENDA (#) and GA2LEN / HANNA* [^112P8sE4]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are responsible for 21–25% of reported adverse drug events which include immunological and nonimmunological hypersensitivity reactions. This study presents up-to-date information on pathomechanisms, clinical spectrum, diagnostic tools and management of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. Clinically, NSAID hypersensitivity is particularly manifested by bronchial asthma, rhinosinusitis, anaphylaxis or urticaria and variety of late cutaneous and organ-specific reactions. Diagnosis of hypersensitivity to a NSAID includes understanding of the underlying mechanism and is necessary for prevention and management. A stepwise approach to the diagnosis of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is proposed, including clinical history, in vitro testing and/or provocation test with a culprit or alternative drug depending on the type of the reaction. The diagnostic process should result in providing the patient with written information both on forbidden and on alternative drugs.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 400 mg) [^117UFtNg]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with NSAIDs in general, anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients without known prior exposure to celecoxib. In postmarketing experience, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib. Celecoxib should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

5.8 Skin Reactions

Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events can occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

5.9 Pregnancy

In late pregnancy, starting at 30 weeks gestation, celecoxib should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.10 Corticosteroid Treatment

Celecoxib cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

5.11 Hematological Effects

Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving celecoxib. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. Celecoxib does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.12 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

Objective

Available evidence to help guide efficacious nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and opioid analgesic prescribing will be reviewed.

Design

Review.

Conclusions

The available evidence can guide but cannot provide any prescriber with absolute knowledge regarding outcome for these frequently prescribed and potentially dangerous agents. Knowledge of the available evidence and application of such to our patients on an individualized basis hopefully will help to optimize therapeutic goals and minimize harms.

### Aspirin or other nonsteroidal inflammatory agent exacerbated asthma [^115wSYjw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an asthma phenotype with a prevalence that ranges from 2% to 25% of the asthma population. The 2% prevalence applies to patients with mild and 25% to severe, persistent asthma. COX-1-inhibiting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, aggravate the preexisting upper and lower respiratory disease, sometimes in a life-threatening manner. The upper airway disease is characterized by an eosinophilic, hyperplastic rhinosinusitis with polyps. Eosinophilia, both peripheral and in the airways with Th2 inflammation, characterizes this disease. The role of allergic sensitivity in AERD is unclear, even though more than 30% of affected patients produce specific IgE to environmental allergens. Clinically, the respiratory symptoms are not usually associated with allergen exposure. The mechanism responsible for this phenotype is likely related to leukotriene (LT) metabolism because patients who are affected compared with patients who were aspirin tolerant, produce greater amounts of cysteinyl LTs. The synthesis of cysteinyl LTs is further increased after aspirin challenge and symptom exacerbation. Eosinophilia as well as a variety of other biologic markers, for example, Th2 cytokines, peripheral blood periostin, and LT enzymes and receptors, are associated with AERD both in the blood and in respiratory mucosa. These markers may help identify patients with AERD, but aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs challenge is the primary means to confirm the diagnosis. A variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms and genes are associated with AERD, but the studies to date are limited to select populations and have not conclusively demonstrated a uniform genetic pattern in subjects with this disease. Treatment of AERD can be challenging because the nasal symptoms, including polyposis, are often refractory to both surgery and medical treatment, and the asthma can be difficult to control. Aspirin desensitization, followed by daily aspirin administration, can improve both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms in up to 60% of individuals.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium delayed release) [^116nW4yC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions). Avoid the use of diclofenac in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Anaphylactic Reactions

Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS; Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114ssyJV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — clinical features, diagnosis, and management — The clinical picture starts with nasal congestion and anosmia, progressing to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; asthma and hypersensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) develop subsequently, and following ingestion of aspirin or NSAIDs, an acute asthma attack develops within minutes to 1–2 hours, sometimes progressing to severe bronchospasm, shock, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest. AERD is more likely to be associated with low lung function and severe asthma, and the prevalence of AERD is 7% in general adult asthma populations and 15% in severe asthma. For diagnosis, a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive, and aspirin challenge (oral, bronchial or nasal) is the gold standard as there are no reliable in vitro tests; oral aspirin challenge tests must only be conducted in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation capabilities because of the high risk of severe reactions, while bronchial and nasal challenges with lysine aspirin are safer than oral challenges and may be safely performed in allergy centers. For management, patients with AERD should avoid aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1); when an NSAID is indicated for other conditions, a COX-2 inhibitor or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be considered with supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of asthma therapy in AERD, but oral corticosteroids (OCS) are sometimes required and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) may also be useful.

### Are COX-2 inhibitors safe in aspirin-sensitive asthma?… [^113EUM2a]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Aspirin-induced asthma is triggered by an inflammatory response of the airways to the ingestion of aspirin and most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This inflammatory response precipitates asthma attacks and rhinitis. Aspirin- or NSAID-induced asthma occurs in approximately 10 percent of adults with asthma and usually develops within three hours after taking one of these medications. The asthma attacks are often severe and may be life-threatening. The exact mechanism of this response is unknown but may be related to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme. The COX-1 isoform is responsible for the production of prostaglandins. The newer COX-2 inhibitors do not affect prostaglandins and, in theory, should not precipitate an acute asthma exacerbation. Martín-García and associates studied the effect of rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, on patients with aspirin- or NSAID-induced asthma.

Patients included in the study had asthma induced by at least two different NSAIDs or aspirin. The participants were challenged with placebo and two different doses of rofecoxib on three different days. They were treated until they reached a 25-mg dose of rofecoxib or developed intolerance to the medication. If no intolerance was noted, the patients were rechallenged with 25 mg of rofecoxib seven days later. If participants developed any mucosal or skin reaction, hypotension, upper or lower airway reaction, conjunctival reaction, or laryngeal edema during the challenge test, it was considered a positive response. All of the participants tolerated the rofecoxib challenge without any signs of immediate or delayed reactions. This included no change in spirometry measurements during the study and no significant variation in peak expiratory flow measurements. None of the participants developed any significant side effects from rofe-coxib during the challenge test.

The authors conclude that rofecoxib is suitable for use in treating inflammation in patients with aspirin- or NSAID-induced asthma. The authors caution that the study participants had asthma that was stable for at least two weeks before the use of rofecoxib, and larger studies are needed to confirm this and to determine if the other COX-2 inhibitors have a similar safety profile in these patients.

### Medications as asthma triggers [^1148ZXa4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Certain medications can generate asthma symptoms, with the potential to cause considerable morbidity. This article focuses on the common drugs that have the potential to cause distinct respiratory reactions in asthmatics: aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The means by which these medications can trigger asthma vary in terms of acuity of onset, severity, and the mechanisms involved. The general and most practical approach is avoidance and cautious use of these drugs in asthmatics. However, these classes of medications can exert a major role in the management of common and serious diseases. Fortunately, controller therapy for asthma and alternative or more selective medications for the treatment of these conditions are now available.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FmmzV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparing the asthmatic and general populations for short-term asthma-relevant outcomes after ibuprofen use, no conflicts in results were observed. The two observational studies in the general population both observed reductions in asthma-related outcomes, while one observational and one interventional study in the asthmatic population both observed increases in asthma-related outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding naïve pooling of results from studies in these different paediatric populations.

It is noteworthy that all RCTs reviewed compared ibuprofen with an active comparator. Of the studies comparing ibuprofen with a baseline of no alternative drug, three were cohort studies, and one was cross-sectional. One non-randomised interventional study compared an asthmatic sample with a healthy control sample. This highlights one of the limitations of the RCT design approach in assessing adverse events in the youngest children. As a recent RCT feasibility study found, almost three quarters of parents surveyed described the use of a placebo comparator treatment as unacceptable for treating their child's fever or pain. This ethical unacceptability of using a placebo arm in clinical trials for treating pain and fever in young children introduces an ambiguity into these active comparator RCT studies, as a lack of difference among active comparators does not exclude the possibility that both ibuprofen and active comparator use may be associated with parallel increases in asthma exacerbations. It has been argued that, given that ibuprofen and paracetamol have different mechanisms of action, it is unlikely that their use could be associated with similar increases in the rate of asthma-related complications that are known to be determined by disparate mechanisms of disease. However, this speculation requires careful examination and empirical support. Observational studies with comparator groups in which an active treatment was not prescribed or taken can be used as a baseline control to assess the impact of ibuprofen alone, acknowledging the challenges of inferring causality in observational studies. It is these advantages and disadvantages of both RCTs and observational designs that require a review of the association between ibuprofen use and asthma-related outcomes in children to consider and attempt to synthesise all study design types. This feature of our review adds substantially to two recent systematic reviews in this area that either limited the study designs to RCTs or limited the population to those under 2 years.

### Long-term safety and exploratory efficacy of fevipiprant in patients with inadequately controlled asthma: the SPIRIT randomised clinical trial [^111JHrFd]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) receptor 2 (DP 2 receptor) pathway is an important regulator of the inflammatory cascade in asthma, which can be stimulated by allergic or non-allergic triggers. Fevipiprant is an oral, non-steroidal, highly selective, reversible antagonist of the DP 2 receptor that inhibits the binding of PGD 2 and its metabolites.

Methods

SPIRIT, a 2-treatment period (52-week, double-blind and optional 104-week single-blind), randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group study, assessed the long-term safety of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg o.d.) added to standard of care in patients ≥ 12 years with uncontrolled asthma. Stratified block randomisation was used. Patients were randomised in an approximate ratio of 3:3:1 (fevipiprant 150 mg, fevipiprant 450 mg or placebo). Patients were either newly enrolled or had participated in a previous fevipiprant Phase 3 trial. Primary endpoints were: time-to-first treatment emergent adverse event (AE); serious AE; and AE leading to discontinuation from study treatment. Data from both treatment periods were combined for analyses. Data were collected during study site visits.

Results

In total, 1093 patients were randomised to receive fevipiprant 150 mg, 1085 to fevipiprant 450 mg, and 360 to placebo. Overall, 1184 patients had ≥ 52 weeks' treatment, while 163 received ≥ 104 weeks' treatment. Both doses were well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to placebo both in new patients and in those enrolled from previous studies.

In exploratory analyses, reduced rates of moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations, increased time-to-first moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbation and improved FEV 1 were observed for both doses of fevipiprant versus placebo; these were without multiplicity adjustment and should be interpreted with caution. SPIRIT was terminated early, on 16 December 2019, by the Sponsor.

Conclusions

In patients with uncontrolled asthma, the addition of fevipiprant had a favourable long-term safety profile.

### Risk of wheezing and asthma exacerbation in children treated with paracetamol versus ibuprofen: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112krG22]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is one of most commonly used over-the-counter medication to treat pain and fever. Paracetamol is perceived as a safe medication to control pain and fever in children, yet evidence from multiple epidemiological studies have shown a potential association between its use and asthma. Epidemiological studies have found an increased risk across difference populations as well as a dose-response relationship. A meta-analysis found the odds of wheezing doubles (OR 1.97; 95%CI 1.51–2.56) in children exposed to paracetamol. On the other hand, a recent study by Walsh and Rothenberg found a decreased in risk of wheezing in children when exposed to paracetamol for an episode of bronchiolitis or respiratory tract infection.

The increasing evidence accumulated over the past 30 years about the risk of asthma exacerbations associated with paracetamol has led clinicians to recommend a change in practice, particularly in children. Among the alternatives to treat pain and fever in children, one that stands out is ibuprofen. A meta-analysis by Pierce and Voss found that ibuprofen is more effective in reducing pain and fever than paracetamol in paediatric population. They also reported that ibuprofen and paracetamol had similar rates of adverse events; however, they did not assess the risk of asthma. Ibuprofen as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) and reduces prostaglandin synthesis. That in turn causes reduction in fever, inflammation, and pain. However, the inhibition of the COX pathway can also activate the lipoxygenase pathway, leading to an increase in leukotriene synthesis, and resulting in bronchospasms and asthma exacerbation.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to quantify the risk of wheezing and asthma exacerbations in paediatric population taking ibuprofen and paracetamol. Our findings are expected to help guide the paediatricians in management of fever and pain and drug choices.

Decision tree – investigate and manage difficult to treat asthma in adult and adolescent patients — applies to adolescents and adults with symptoms or acute exacerbations despite medium or high dose ICS-LABA, or taking maintenance OCS, and advises to consider referring to specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage. Confirm the diagnosis (asthma/differential diagnoses), then look for factors contributing to symptoms, exacerbations and poor quality of life, including incorrect inhaler technique, suboptimal adherence, comorbidities including obesity, GERD, chronic rhinosinusitis, OSA, modifiable risk factors and triggers at home or work (including smoking, environmental exposures, allergen exposures if sensitized; medications such as beta-blockers and NSAIDS), overuse of SABA relievers, medication side effects, and anxiety, depression and social difficulties. Optimize management, including optimize treatment (e.g. check and correct inhaler technique; add spacer; optimize adherence; switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, if available), consider non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, mucus clearance, influenza and COVID-19 vaccination), treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, and consider trial of high dose ICS-LABA, if not used. Review response after ~3–6 months; if the answer to "Is asthma still uncontrolled?" is yes, diagnosis is Severe asthma and, if not done by now, refer to a specialist, if possible. If no, consider stepping down treatment, OCS first (if used); if asthma becomes uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down, restore previous dose, otherwise continue optimizing management.

### Safety of high-dose rofecoxib in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113ZNDY7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by progressive sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma that begins and continues in the absence of exposure to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Cross-sensitivity to all NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) occurs in these individuals. Reactions to aspirin and NSAIDs in patients with AERD are largely due to inhibition of COX-1. Despite accumulating data on the safety of COX-2 selective inhibitors in AERD, concern still remains that high doses of a COX-2 inhibitor may be sufficient to induce a cross-reaction.

Objective

To determine whether high-dose rofecoxib cross-reacts in patients with AERD and asthma.

Methods

Sixty asthmatic patients underwent blinded placebo-controlled oral challenges with 50 mg of rofecoxib. Aspirin sensitivity was subsequently confirmed in all patients with the use of single-blinded aspirin challenges.

Results

None of the 60 patients experienced any symptoms, changes in nasal examination results, or declines in lung function during rofecoxib challenge. All 60 patients experienced respiratory reactions to aspirin challenge, with a mean provoking dose of 57 mg. The exact 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the underlying probability of 50 mg of rofecoxib inducing respiratory cross-reactions in patients with AERD is 0 to 0.05, or 0% to 5%.

Conclusions

These results confirm the lack of cross-reactivity of aspirin and the highly selective COX-2 inhibitors in AERD. We suggest that it is time for the labeling of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors to reflect these data and for the warning that patients with AERD in particular and asthmatic patients in general avoid selective COX-2 inhibitors to be removed.

### Safety of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [^111NvH38]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In 5 to 10% of adult patients with asthma, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) precipitate acute asthmatic attacks. Therefore, choosing an alternative anti-inflammatory agent for patients with adverse reactions to an NSAID is a common problem in clinical practice. The discoveries that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is an inducible form of COX that is involved in inflammation and that COX-1 is the major isoform responsible for the production of prostaglandins have provided a reasonable basis for the development of specific COX-2 inhibitors as a new class of anti-inflammatory agents.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, does not cause asthmatic attacks in patients with ASA and/or other NSAID-induced asthma.

Methods

We studied 40 patients, all of whom had experienced asthma induced by at least two different NSAIDs. The patients were challenged in a single-blind manner with different doses of rofecoxib on 3 different days, until either the therapeutic dose of 25 mg or intolerance was reached. Each patient was rechallenged with 25 mg of rofecoxib 7 days later if no evidence of intolerance had been observed previously.

Results

Rofecoxib, 25 mg, was proven to be well tolerated in all 40 patients with ASA-induced and NSAID-induced asthma.

Conclusion

Our study appears to demonstrate that rofecoxib is a suitable NSAID for treatment of patients with ASA and/or other NSAID-induced asthma.

### Diagnostic evaluation in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^112HfK8H]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a distinct clinical condition characterized by chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and hypersensitivity reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Distinguishing AERD from other forms of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and NSAID reactivity has important clinical implications for management. The clinical history is helpful, but not adequate for confirming the diagnosis of AERD, in most cases. Diagnostic provocation challenge remains the only way to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of AERD. This article discusses the utility of the clinical history and the current evidence regarding measures that optimize the safety of performing diagnostic NSAID provocation challenges.

### Diclofenac sodium, capsaicin (inflammacin) [^114CosSE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS].

Diclofenac is indicated:

For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis
For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to diclofenac.

Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients [see WARNINGS, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS, and PRECAUTIONS, PREEXISTING ASTHMA].

In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see WARNINGS]

WARNINGS

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as Diclofenac Sodium, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see WARNINGS, GI EFFECTS].

NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS

After antibiotics, NSAIDs are the second most common drug class causing hypersensitivity reactions, described in up to 3.5% of the population.NSAIDs may induce a variety of reactions, although most reactions occur within 6 hours and are cutaneous (eg, urticaria and angioedema). However, systemic reactions such as severe anaphylaxisand delayed skin reactions (eg, fixed drug eruptions or Stevens-Johnsons syndrome,) have also been reported from NSAIDs.

Classification of NSAID-induced reactions is based on clinical history (eg, reaction timing and characteristics), presence of comorbid conditions, and drug challenges. NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis (NIUAA) is the most common phenotype, representing > 40% of reported reactions in adults. Symptoms are typically elicited by potent cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors, with isolated cutaneous symptoms reported most commonly; however, 9% to 28% of adults may report reactions consisting of blended features with symptoms or signs extending outside of the skin or anaphylaxis. Up to 30% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) experience an acute exacerbation of their disease after NSAID exposure, (NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease [NECD]). Notably, patients with NECD may tolerate NSAIDs during CSU remission or clinical control. Patients with underlying asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis may react with acute respiratory reactions to COX-1 inhibitors in the context of aspirin- or NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD). As with the other cross-reactive phenotypes, including NIUAA and NECD, patients with N-ERD can report reactions to chemically nonrelated NSAIDs.

Less commonly, some patients may develop immediate reactions (often within an hour) to a single NSAID, or structurally related NSAIDs (single NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis [SNIUAA]). These reactions are thought to be IgE-mediated, and no cross-reactivity with other NSAIDs is expected. Although 1 study did observe cross-reactivity in some patients with reactions induced by more than 1 drug within the class of propionic acid derivatives, it is also important to note that most patients with SNIUAA in this same study demonstrated tolerance of structurally related NSAIDs.

Separately, NSAIDs can act as cofactors to aggravate hypersensitivity reactions to foods (NSAID-exacerbated or -induced food allergy), and patients may be misdiagnosed with NSAID hypersensitivity; for these patients, a food rather than drug allergy workup should take precedence.

### Efficacy of biologics in NSAID-ERD: United airways from the nose to the bronchi [^111V4ka8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease (NSAID-ERD), the clinical triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and respiratory reactions to cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitors, is often challenging to manage, with many patients failing first-line therapies for CRSwNP and asthma. There are now 6 biologic medications approved for asthma and/or severe CRSwNP: omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, and tezepelumab. With the availability of respiratory biologic treatment for both asthma and CRSwNP, clinicians now have a multitude of additional management options for patients with NSAID-ERD. Herein, we review the currently available clinical trial and real-world evidence for biologic efficacy and safety in patients with NSAID-ERD, discuss the mechanisms of biologic therapy specific to NSAID-ERD, and review evidence regarding the use of biologic therapy versus endoscopic sinus surgery for CRSwNP in patients with NSAID-ERD. We propose a management approach for choosing biologic therapy or endoscopic sinus surgery paired with aspirin therapy after desensitization for patients with NSAID-ERD.

### The joint task force on practice parameters GRADE guidelines for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [^116ezbep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — ATAD vs no ATAD: In people with AERD, the guideline panel suggests ATAD rather than no ATAD (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence). The benefit of ATAD is moderate and is balanced by the risk of adverse effects that can lead to discontinuation. Decision factors include risks that impact the safety of performing an aspirin desensitization such as severe poorly controlled asthma; risks that impact safety of long-term aspirin use such as conditions or treatments that increase bleeding risk, such as age, male, low weight or BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, prednisone use, or previous GI or intracranial bleed; that biologics may be preferred over ATAD in AERD for patients who have increased risk of harms with ATAD or who are avoiding a strict daily oral medication regimen and its associated desensitization procedure; and that patients intolerant to NSAIDs who require an NSAID for alternative indications (eg, cardiovascular disease) may prefer ATAD over other options.

### COX-2 inhibitors likely safe for aspirin-allergic asthma… [^114ctztZ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Question: Can patients with asthma who are allergic to or cannot tolerate aspirin take COX-2 inhibitors. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Synopsis: Certain patients with asthma, recurrent rhinosinusitis, or nasal polyposis experience severe bronchoconstriction after taking aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thirty-three subjects with proven aspirin-intolerant asthma were challenged under careful clinical observation with increasing dosages of celecoxib to determine whether similar patients can safely use the newer cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors. The study consisted of three phases in which patients were initially given placebo or increasing doses of celecoxib, followed by a crossover phase. The third phase was an open-label challenge with 400 mg of celecoxib. No significant bronchoconstrictor responses occurred in patients receiving placebo or celecoxib.

In addition, there were no changes in nasal symptom scores and no clinical signs of skin rash or gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of any dose of celecoxib. All of the study subjects had well-controlled asthma, so the results may not apply to patients with clinically unstable asthma. These results also do not apply to separate clinical entities of NSAID-induced urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Bottom Line: Patients with well-documented aspirin-intolerant asthma appear to tolerate the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Rofecoxib is even more COX-2 selective and, therefore, is likely to be tolerated as well as or better than celecoxib. Because this study included only 33 participants, I would recommend using COX-2 inhibitors in these patients only when absolutely necessary.

It might be better to give the first dose in the office and observe the patient for a few hours before allowing him or her to leave, but only after verifying that some injectable adrenaline or nebulized albuterol is available.

### Clinical and pathologic perspectives on aspirin sensitivity and asthma [^1176xic2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 induce unique nonallergic reactions, consisting of attacks of rhinitis and asthma. These hypersensitivity reactions occur in a subset of asthmatic subjects, thus identifying them as having this exclusive clinical presentation. We refer to these patients as having aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, a disease process that produces devastating eosinophilic inflammation of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This review focuses on a description of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, methods available to diagnose their condition, the unique ability of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 to cross-react with aspirin, an update on pathogenesis, and current thoughts about treatment.

### Aspirin-induced asthma: advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^1115iAcw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

In some asthmatic individuals, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygen-ase 1 (COX-1) exacerbate the condition. This distinct clinical syndrome, called aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), is characterized by an eosinophilic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, aspirin sensitivity, and asthma. There is no in vitro test for the disorder, and diagnosis can be established only by provocation challenges with aspirin or NSAIDs. Recent major advances in the molecular biology of eicosanoids, exemplified by the cloning of 2 cysteinyl leukotriene receptors and the discovery of a whole family of cyclooxygenase enzymes, offer new insights into mechanisms operating in AIA. The disease runs a protracted course even if COX-1 inhibitors are avoided, and the course is often severe, many patients requiring systemic corticosteroids to control their sinusitis and asthma. Aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, but highly specific COX-2 inhibitors, known as coxibs, are well tolerated and can be safely used. Aspirin desensitization, followed by daily aspirin treatment, is a valuable therapeutic option in most patients with AIA, particularly those with recurrent nasal polyposis or overdependence on systemic corticosteroids.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — pre-reassessment optimization includes to treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors where there is evidence for benefit, with the note that there is no evidence to support routine treatment of asymptomatic GERD; avoid medications that make asthma worse (beta-blockers including eye-drops, aspirin and other NSAIDs in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), and refer for management of mental health problems if relevant. Consider trial of non-biologic medication added to medium/high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), e.g., long-acting beta agonist (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) if not already tried, noting concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast LTRA; and consider trial of high-dose ICS-LABA if not currently used.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^113xrZCk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease — cross-reactivity and medication choices indicate that aspirin and NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can all cause reactions and are considered cross-reactive. Weak COX-1 inhibitors such as nonacetylated salicylates and acetaminophen may cause reactions in highly sensitive individuals if administered at higher doses (650–1000 mg) but are typically mild. NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1 at higher doses may result in reactions depending on dose, whereas reactions to selective COX-2 inhibitors are extremely rare in patients with AERD and they can typically be taken safely.

### Mechanisms of benefit with aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114k47EE]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by severe persistent asthma, hyperplastic eosinophilic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and an intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-1. For more than 30 years, aspirin desensitization has proven to be of significant long-term benefit in carefully selected patients with AERD. Despite this, the exact mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of aspirin desensitization remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms of aspirin desensitization and discuss future areas of investigation.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wpQPk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We identified four drug provocation trials in which ibuprofen hypersensitivity was confirmed in children by controlled administration of ibuprofen and respiratory adverse events were recorded. The average percentage of children with confirmed ibuprofen hypersensitivity who displayed respiratory adverse events was 12.5%. Relative to other adverse events, such as angio-oedema and urticaria (which were by far the most common adverse events), asthma and asthma-like respiratory events were less commonly reported. While adverse respiratory reactions to ibuprofen ingestion in those with ibuprofen hypersensitivity can be quite severe, as reported in a handful of case reports, fatalities appear to be very rare. In this review, only a single case of ibuprofen-induced asthma fatality was identified.

The number of studies in this review that were relevant to important clinical populations and contexts was unfortunately sparse. Only a single publication was identified for each of the following three contexts: the general population where ibuprofen is compared with an active comparator with a follow-up duration longer than 1 month; the asthmatic population where ibuprofen is compared with an active comparator with a short-term follow-up; and the asthmatic population where ibuprofen is compared with a baseline of no active comparator with a follow-up duration longer than 1 month. These limitations hinder the generalisability of findings to several important clinical contexts and are an ongoing issue to be addressed.

### Oral and intranasal aspirin desensitisation for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114yW9jg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps) or asthma. The prevalence of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is estimated to be 2%. The first line of treatment is the avoidance of NSAIDs. Another treatment option is aspirin treatment after desensitisation (ATAD). Desensitisation can be induced by repeated administration of aspirin at fixed time intervals. The clinical benefit of aspirin might occur through inhibition of interleukin 4 and a reduction in prostaglandin D2. This therapy can be useful for people who have progressive airway disease and are in great need of medical intervention (mostly systemic corticosteroids) or surgery. An up-to-date Cochrane review is vital to investigate the effects of this therapy.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral or intranasal aspirin desensitisation, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, in adults with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT and Airways Trials Registers; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 10 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared ATAD with placebo were eligible. We included studies of adults with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (i.e. intolerance to NSAID established, e.g. by aspirin challenge test), with chronic rhinosinusitis or asthma, or both. Participants had to be followed up for at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcomes were health-related quality of life, asthma control, and significant serious and non-serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were changes in airway assessments, nasal endoscopy score, medication use, symptom scores, and chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma exacerbations (description of exacerbation for which systemic corticosteroid or sinus surgery was needed). We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included five studies with a total of 211 participants (146 analysed). All studies compared oral ATAD at different dosages with placebo and were performed in tertiary care centres. All participants had a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In four studies, participants also had a confirmed diagnosis of asthma and two studies reported that participants had previous surgery for nasal polyps. Outcomes were analysed at six and 36 months follow-up. However, only one study reported data for 36 months follow-up. All but one study reported source of funding. Mid-term follow-up (six months, ATAD versus placebo) ATAD may improve health-related quality of life, assessed with Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) scores (mean difference (MD) -0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.76 to -0.31; 3 studies, 85 participants; minimum clinically important difference (MCID) 9.0 points for total score; low-certainty evidence). In this analysis, SNOT-22 scores were divided by 22 and SNOT-20 scores were divided by 20. The mean reduction (11.9 points) in SNOT score (based on SNOT-22) is larger than the MCID. It is uncertain if asthma control may be improved after ATAD. Asthma control was measured using the Asthma Control Test (ACT) in one study and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) in another study, so data were not pooled. The MD on the ACQ was -2.00 (total score 0 to 6) (95% CI -4.30 to 0.30; 1 study, 15 participants; MCID 0.5 points; very low-certainty evidence). The MD on the ACT was 5.90 (total score 5 to 25) (95% CI 2.93 to 8.87; 1 study, 30 participants; MCID 3 points; very low-certainty evidence). All but one study reported on adverse events. Seven participants in the active treatment group developed a gastrointestinal disorder and dropped out (129 participants, very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of ATAD on nasal airflow, measured by peak nasal inspiratory flow scores (MD 32.90 L/min, 95% CI -12.44 to 78.24; 1 study, 15 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if the dosage of intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids may be reduced with ATAD (inhaled corticosteroids: -1197.60 µg, 95% CI -1744.93 to -650.27; intranasal corticosteroids: -120.50 µg, 95% CI -206.49 to -34.51; 1 study; 15 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Symptom scores may not differ between ATAD and placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (sneezing: MD -0.70, 95% CI -1.45 to 0.05; smell: MD -2.20, 95% CI -4.74 to 0.34; nasal blockage: MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.90 to 0.10; 1 study, very low-certainty evidence). No study assessed nasal endoscopy at this time point. Long-term follow-up (36 months, ATAD versus placebo) ATAD may improve quality of life, as measured with the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI) score (MD-18.10, 95% CI -32.82 to -3.38; 1 study; 31 participants; low-certainty evidence). ATAD may result in little to no difference in the size of nasal polyps (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.72 to 0.32; 1 study, 31 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group over the total study period of 36 months (1 study; 31 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Data on peak nasal inspiratory flow, changes in dosage of inhalation or intranasal corticosteroids and symptom scores were not reported at this time point.

Authors' Conclusions

Aspirin treatment after desensitisation may improve health-related quality of life for people with N-ERD with a follow-up of six months. With respect to asthma control, adverse events, peak nasal inspiratory flow score, nasal endoscopy scores, changes in dosage of inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids, nasal and bronchial symptom scores, exacerbations or worsening of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (including the need for surgery), the evidence is inconclusive for the short-term and long-term. We did not find data on peak expiratory flow. It is difficult to interpret the results adequately, due to the potential influence of the use of any co-medications for chronic rhinosinusitis or asthma. Future research should emphasise longer duration of follow-up, report baseline disease characteristics and report on compliance and exacerbations for which additional medication or surgery is warranted.

### Diclofenac sodium [^112LEt8y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin reaction or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and a clinical diagnosis of NSAID-ERD: results from two randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^114zHd9v]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 were two multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, phase 3 studies of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled severe CRSwNP. The study design, randomization process, and methodology for SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 have been reported previously. In both studies, randomization was stratified by asthma or NSAID‐ERD disease status at screening, previous surgery at screening, and country.

2.2 Participants

The eligibility criteria were identical for both studies and previously published (see Table S1). Briefly, adults with bilateral NPs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis despite intranasal corticosteroid therapy, who had received SCS in the preceding 2 years (or had a medical contraindication or intolerance to SCS) or previous sinonasal surgery were included. A pre‐specified enrollment goal was to have at least 50% of patients with asthma, NSAID‐ERD, or both, and 50% of patients having had previous polyp surgery. Written informed consent was provided by all patients in the SINUS‐24 and SINUS‐52 trials.

To ascertain a diagnosis of NSAID‐ERD, a two‐question survey based on a diagnostic algorithm endorsed by an expert panelwas administered during the medical/surgery history interview. The two questions were as follows: Have you ever had respiratory, nasal, and/or bronchial symptoms following the intake of aspirin or/and NSAID? and While having a positive clinical history of NSAID‐ERD, have you ever undergone an aspirin provocation test, either nasal, bronchial, or oral? An affirmative response to either question was considered to indicate a clinical diagnosis of NSAID‐ERD.

Details of study sites have been previously published.
