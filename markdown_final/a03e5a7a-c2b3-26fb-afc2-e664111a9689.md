## Question

What is the optimal timing for resuming oral anticoagulation therapy after a procedure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timing for resuming oral anticoagulation therapy after a procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of oral anticoagulant and its pharmacokinetics. Then, I should verify the procedure-related bleeding risk and how that modifies timing. Next, I will assess the patient's thrombotic risk and whether bridging is indicated. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and neuraxial procedures. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm it aligns with major guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the drug-specific factors because timing hinges on them. DOACs have rapid onset within 1–3 hours and short half-lives around 9–14 hours, so they can be held 1–2 days pre-procedurally and resumed 1–2 days post-procedurally without bridging, whereas warfarin has a long half-life and slow onset, so it is typically held 5 days pre-procedurally and resumed 12–24 hours post-procedurally once hemostasis is secured, with full anticoagulation taking 4–8 days to re-establish [^d70a4ab3] [^f0a48c84] [^5195efdb].

> Wait, let me verify the procedure-related bleeding risk categories because they directly drive post-procedural timing. Low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures include minor dental work, cataract surgery, diagnostic endoscopy without intervention, and many outpatient procedures, whereas high bleeding risk procedures include major orthopedic surgery, cancer surgery, complex abdominal operations, and high-risk endoscopic interventions like polypectomy or ESD; for DOACs, guidelines suggest resuming 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk and 48–72 hours after high-risk procedures, and for warfarin, resumption within 24 hours is reasonable if hemostasis is secure, with the understanding that INR will be subtherapeutic for several days [^d70a4ab3] [^9a1a5891] [^5195efdb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thrombotic risk without a structured assessment. High thrombotic risk includes mechanical heart valves, recent stroke or TIA, very high CHA2DS2-VASc scores, recent VTE, or active cancer; in these cases, earlier resumption and consideration of bridging may be appropriate, whereas low-to-moderate thrombotic risk allows standard timing without bridging; importantly, bridging with LMWH increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism in most AF patients, so it should be avoided unless there is a compelling indication such as mechanical valves or very recent thromboembolism [^07d37ea4] [^fb5ed55a] [^c22b707b].

> I need to check special scenarios next, starting with intracranial hemorrhage, because timing is uniquely controversial. For spontaneous ICH, most guidelines advise delaying anticoagulation for about 4–6 weeks, with some recommending 7–8 weeks in AF patients after weighing lobar versus nonlobar location, microbleeds, and mechanism; for traumatic ICH, expert consensus supports individualized timing often in the 1–4 week range, balancing early expansion risk against thromboembolism, and emerging data suggest potential net benefit when restarting around 2 weeks in selected patients, though this remains low-certainty evidence [^0d6d0ee2] [^03493e00] [^e6ce34f1].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal bleeding, since observational data shape practice. After GI bleeding, resuming anticoagulation is associated with lower thromboembolism and mortality but higher rebleeding; many guidelines suggest resuming 7 days after hemostasis in low thrombotic risk patients, and earlier with heparin bridging in high thrombotic risk patients, with some data indicating that timing within 7 days may optimize net benefit, though this remains conditional and should be individualized [^52e062d2] [^191eea09] [^1b583dba].

> But wait, what if the patient had a neuraxial procedure or epidural catheter. I should confirm that neuraxial blocks require extra caution due to spinal hematoma risk; generally, DOACs are held 2–3 days pre-procedurally and resumed 24–48 hours post-removal of catheters, with decisions individualized to renal function and bleeding risk, and any early resumption mandates close neurologic monitoring [^74792263].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and double-check it aligns with guidelines. For DOACs: resume 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk procedures and 48–72 hours after high-risk procedures, with earlier resumption considered only in very high thrombotic risk and with careful monitoring; for warfarin: resume 12–24 hours post-procedurally once hemostasis is secured, recognizing the delayed attainment of therapeutic INR; for all agents, confirm hemostasis before restarting, avoid routine bridging unless there is a specific high-risk indication, and reassess the ongoing need for anticoagulation after any major bleeding event using a multidisciplinary, shared decision-making approach [^d70a4ab3] [^5195efdb] [^dd8aa921].

> I should confirm a few implementation details to avoid common pitfalls. DOACs reach peak effect within 1–3 hours, so if bleeding risk is dynamic, consider delaying the dose or using a split dose strategy; for warfarin, avoid loading doses and simply resume the maintenance dose, as doubling the dose does not reliably shorten time to therapeutic INR and may increase bleeding; and document the exact timing and rationale for resumption in the chart and patient instructions to reduce errors and support adherence [^8a5c2483] [^d70a4ab3].

> Finally, I will examine the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainty. Much of the perioperative DOAC guidance is based on pharmacokinetic reasoning, observational data, and the PAUSE protocol rather than randomized trials, and warfarin timing is supported by low-certainty evidence and expert consensus; therefore, individualized decisions and close follow-up are essential, especially in high-risk patients or after major bleeding, and ongoing trials may refine these thresholds in the future [^d70a4ab3] [^c22b707b] [^e2869daa].

The optimal timing to resume oral anticoagulation after a procedure depends on **procedure bleeding risk** and **patient thrombotic risk**. For low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures, restart DOACs 24 hours and warfarin 12–24 hours after hemostasis; for high bleeding risk procedures, delay to 48–72 hours for DOACs and 48–72 hours for warfarin, with earlier resumption if thrombotic risk is very high and hemostasis is secure. Bridging is generally not needed for DOACs and is reserved for select high thrombotic risk scenarios (e.g. mechanical valves or recent VTE). After major bleeding (e.g. GI or ICH), delay 7–14 days or longer, balancing rebleeding versus thrombosis risk, and use a multidisciplinary plan [^d70a4ab3] [^9a1a5891] [^52e062d2] [^0d6d0ee2].

---

## General principles guiding resumption

- **Hemostasis**: Confirm secure hemostasis before restarting anticoagulation.
- **Risk stratification**: Balance thrombotic risk against bleeding risk.
- **Agent-specific pharmacokinetics**: DOACs act within 2–4 hours; warfarin takes 2–4 days to reach therapeutic INR.
- **Individualized decision-making**: Tailor timing to patient and procedure factors [^d928a590].

---

## Timing based on procedure bleeding risk

| **Procedure bleeding risk** | **Doac resumption** | **Warfarin resumption** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-to-moderate risk (e.g. minor dental, cataract, diagnostic endoscopy) | 24 hours after hemostasis [^d70a4ab3] | 12–24 hours after hemostasis [^5195efdb] |
| High risk (e.g. major surgery, joint replacement, complex endoscopy) | 48–72 hours after hemostasis [^d70a4ab3] | 48–72 hours after hemostasis; consider bridging if high thrombotic risk [^93746bde] |

---

## Special considerations

### Major bleeding events

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Delay 7–14 days; earlier with heparin bridging if high thrombotic risk [^52e062d2].
- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Delay 4–8 weeks; individualize based on location, mechanism, and thrombotic risk [^0d6d0ee2] [^03493e00].
- **Traumatic brain injury**: Resume 14–90 days after injury, individualized [^d1e19ba8].

---

### High thrombotic risk patients

In high thrombotic risk patients, **mechanical heart valves or recent VTE** may warrant bridging with LMWH or UFH when warfarin is interrupted, and **early resumption** can be considered once hemostasis is secure [^9b79f7dc] [^2ba0cf87].

---

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid onset/offset; minimal residual effect after 24–48 hours [^ae0a7074].
- **Bridging**: Not recommended due to increased bleeding without added benefit [^43fadb94].
- **Standard approach**: Resume 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk; 48–72 hours after high risk [^d70a4ab3].

---

### Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin)

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Slow onset; full effect in 4–8 days [^f0a48c84].
- **Early resumption**: 12–24 hours after hemostasis for low-to-moderate risk [^5195efdb].
- **Delayed resumption**: 48–72 hours for high risk; consider bridging if high thrombotic risk [^93746bde].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low-to-moderate risk procedures**: DOACs 24 hours; warfarin 12–24 hours after hemostasis [^d70a4ab3] [^5195efdb].
- **High risk procedures**: DOACs 48–72 hours; warfarin 48–72 hours after hemostasis [^d70a4ab3] [^9a1a5891].
- **Major bleeding**: Delay 7–14 days or longer, individualized [^52e062d2] [^0d6d0ee2].
- **High thrombotic risk**: Consider bridging and earlier resumption if hemostasis is secure [^9b79f7dc] [^2ba0cf87].

---

The optimal timing to resume oral anticoagulation after a procedure is **individualized** based on procedure bleeding risk, patient thrombotic risk, and agent pharmacology, with earlier resumption after low-to-moderate risk procedures and delayed resumption after high-risk procedures or major bleeding.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^51f5ce31]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. For dual-antiplatelet therapy post stent placement, management depends on the time since stent placement.

If the patient is within 12 weeks postcoronary stenting, either delaying elective surgery or continuing both medications is recommended because of the high risk of stent thrombosis. For patients who are more than three months after coronary stent placement, the recommendation is to stop the P2Y. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy. Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. |Overall – useful| Editor's Note: This is the first update to these guidelines for management of antithrombotic medications since 2012, when direct oral anticoagulants were very new. Direct oral anticoagulants are now the recommended anticoagulant medication for most patients, and their management is relatively simple because of their short onset and rapid degradation. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin.

The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor. Guideline source: American College of Chest Physicians Published source: Chest. November 2022; 162: e207–e243.

Discussion

Clinical equipoise in treatment timing after tICrH, and therefore uncertainty in best course of action, is distributed within the range of current guidelines. Restarting oral anticoagulants after most cases tICrH appears to be supported by broad clinical consensus, but clinical equipoise still exists for the timing, although most clinicians and experts surveyed state they prefer to restart in the first month after injury. The demonstrated existence of competing risks for hemorrhage and thrombosis suggests that there is an optimal timing that can be identified within the time windows offered by current consensus. It is also likely that this timing varies by individual cases' presentation and risk factors. Many of the observational studies described in this review excluded cases with contraindications for anticoagulation such as hematoma expansion on follow-up imaging. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will shed more light on these important clinical questions. The results of these clinical trials offer unique insights, based on the differences in sample criteria and timing of interventions offered.

If the answer to "Is the patient willing to restart anticoagulation at this time?" is no, proceed to "Initiate clinician/patient discussion (see Table 7)". If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

### Timing to restart direct oral anticoagulants after… [^5a875342]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

When a scan shows blood in the brain, oral anticoagulation is nearly always stopped. However, this leaves the question of when it is safe to restart them. The risk of making the bleeding in the brain worse must be balanced against the risk of having a stroke or blood clots. There is no clear evidence on the safest time to restart oral anticoagulation, but most neurosurgeons advise restarting them 1–4 weeks after head injury. Despite a low risk of new or on-going Intracranial Hemorrhage 48 hours after injury, there is a reluctance from clinicians to restart OACs for fear of evoking re-bleeding. This must be balanced against the increased risk of thromboembolism in patients not taking their OAC, predisposing AF patients to increased risk of stroke, systemic thromboembolism and all-cause mortality. Studies suggest evidence of early tICrH expansion on routine repeat imaging occurs in 10–37% of patients on OAC, indicating the need to stop OAC.

This risk reduces substantially over time. A recent trial assessing patients with a major bleed on OACs, reported re-bleeding rates of 4. 3% within 30 days, when excluding the first 3 days from the initial bleed. The bleeding rate was only 4. 5% in those who restarted their OAC within 2 weeks, with a net benefit when compared to those that did not restart OAC within 2 weeks. Another study focusing on tICrH reported a 5% readmission rate for re-bleeding within 30-days in patients who did not restart their DOAC. At 3 months, patients who have restarted OAC have fewer strokes and deaths, despite increased bleeding compared to those who have not restarted OAC. Drug: Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants

Clinical guidelines

Current trauma guidelines do not address the use of anticoagulant treatment after ICrH. The 2014 update to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for stroke prevention in stroke and temporary ischemic attack includes a special section on the use of antithrombotic therapy after ICrH. These guidelines clearly demonstrate shortcomings of the available evidence as they endorse individualized assessment of the restart decision. To this end, they advise consideration of the risks of subsequent thromboembolism, recurrent ICrH and overall 'patient status'. It subsequently suggests that cases with higher risk of recurrent ICH relative to cerebral infarction may consider antiplatelet therapy instead of anticoagulation. With regard to timing of anticoagulation reinitiation, 'the optimal timing is uncertain. For most patients, however, it might be reasonable to wait ≥ 1 week'. None of the evidence provided rises above class IIb, level B in strength.

The European Stroke Organization also released guidelines in 2014 for sICH, which recognize a lack of trial evidence on this subject. The guidelines state that a firm recommendation about whether or when to resume antithrombotic medication after ICH cannot be made, and rate the evidence as 'very low' quality. The timing suggestions reviewed by that committee range from 14 days up to 30 weeks.

An Austrian expert-consensus panel focused exclusively on traumatic brain injury found that there was 'insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption' of oral anticoagulation following tICrH and that clinical decisions should be made on a 'case-by-case basis'. In spite of this, the practice of restarting anticoagulation in tICrH is far more common than with spontaneous cases as the decision of whether to resume treatment appears already to have been answered in most patients with tICrH and transformed into clinical practice.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^015ae8a3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium, and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists), and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment: the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

Managing nonmajor bleeds on oral anticoagulants (OAC) — for patients with a nonmajor bleed, the writing committee does not support routine reversal of the OAC, although it is often advisable to temporarily discontinue OAC therapy until the patient is clinically stable and hemostasis has been achieved. Whether to hold OAC should depend on individual patient characteristics, the nature of the bleed, and the intensity of anticoagulation with shared decision making, and guiding questions include whether baseline severe anemia requires transfusion of ≥ 1 units of RBCs. For any of these situations, the writing committee advises that the OAC be discontinued (at least temporarily) and consideration be given to whether concomitant antiplatelet agents could be discontinued safely; if OAC is stopped yet an indication remains, it is expected that patients should be able to restart when the concern for additional bleeding has resolved. If hospitalization, a procedure, or a transfusion is not required and hemostasis has been achieved, the writing committee supports continuing the OAC, and for those on concomitant antiplatelet agents the risks versus benefit of stopping should be weighed; temporary discontinuation of irreversible antiplatelet agents may not have a clinical effect for several days, with the 1 exception of ticagrelor, which has a half-life of 7 to 9 hours.

### What to do after the bleed: resuming anticoagulation after major bleeding [^bfff11b9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Resuming anticoagulation therapy after a potentially life-threatening bleeding complication evokes high anxiety levels among clinicians and patients trying to decide whether resuming oral anticoagulation to prevent devastating and potentially fatal thromboembolic events or discontinuing anticoagulation in hopes of reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding is best. The available evidence favors resumption of anticoagulation therapy for gastrointestinal tract bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage survivors, and it is reasonable to begin postbleeding decision making with resuming anticoagulation therapy as the default plan. After considering factors related to the index bleeding event, the underlying thromboembolic risk, and comorbid conditions, a decision to accept or modify the default plan can be made in collaboration with other care team members, the patient, and their caregivers. Although additional information is needed regarding the optimal timing of anticoagulation resumption, available evidence indicates that waiting ∼14 days may best balance the risk of recurrent bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality after gastrointestinal tract bleeding. When to resume anticoagulation after intracranial hemorrhage is less clear, but most studies indicate that resumption within the first month of discharge is associated with better outcomes.

Methods and scope — factors addressed in the ECDP algorithms: The guidance in this ECDP is designed to address the clinical problem of bleeding management of patients treated with anticoagulants and will consider both DOACs and VKAs used for any indication. The ECDP considered the severity of the bleed (major versus nonmajor), acute medical and surgical management, the need for reversal, the appropriateness and time of restarting anticoagulation, and the impact of pertinent comorbidities and concomitant drug therapy. At each step in the ECDP algorithms, patient-specific factors should be considered.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

ACC 2020 bleeding pathway — considerations for restarting anticoagulation: The algorithm first asks "DOES ≥ 1 OF THE FOLLOWING CLINICAL INDICATIONS APPLY?" including "Nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women", "Temporary indication for OAC (e.g., post-surgical prophylaxis, OAC after an anterior MI without left ventricular thrombus, post-LAA closure device placement)", "Recovered acute stress cardiomyopathy (e.g. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)", "First-time provoked VTE ≥ 3 months ago", and "Bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 mos ago". If yes, the pathway states "Suggest discontinuing anticoagulation". If no, it asks "DOES ≥ 1 OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS APPLY?" including "Bleed occurred at a critical site (see Table 1)", "Patient is at high risk of rebleeding or of death/disability with rebleeding", "Source of bleed has not yet been identified", "Surgical/invasive procedure planned", or "After informed discussion, patient declines or does not wish to restart OAC at this time (see Table 7)". If any apply, it says "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation (see Figure 6)", and if none apply, it says "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". OAC is defined as oral anticoagulant, including VKAs and DOACs.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: unique properties and practical approaches to management [^1c83f7bc]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Since 2009, four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. While they are currently first-line therapy for a majority of patients, there are a number of clinical situations where warfarin is preferable. In both randomised trials and real-world populations, use of DOACs significantly reduces the risk of intracranial haemorrhage as compared with warfarin. While drug-specific reversal agents are currently only available for dabigatran, andexanet alpha is pending approval for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors, reducing concerns about major bleeding for many patients and providers. DOACs can be held for 2–4 days prior to a procedure, depending on a patient's renal function, but should not be restarted too rapidly post-procedurally given their fast time to peak activity (∼2 hours). The anticoagulation clinic should play an important role in managing patients on all oral anticoagulation, both warfarin and DOACs.

Restart of anticoagulation — Begin by asking, "Does the patient fall into 1 of the following groups?": NPO, awaiting an invasive procedure, pregnancy, high risk of rebleeding, or being bridged back to VKA with high thrombotic risk (see Table 6). If yes, suggest temporary or long-term parenteral anticoagulation. If no, determine if the patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy; if so, reassess the need for aspirin in stable CAD and reassess the need for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients after PCI and/or ACS and consider discontinuation of aspirin. Next, evaluate whether the patient is taking concurrent medications that interact with OAC levels (e.g., antiretrovirals, antifungals, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics); if present, suggest pharmacy consultation and consideration of switching either OAC or the interacting medication. If no interacting medications are identified, suggest restarting anticoagulation, then choose OAC and consider switching OAC if a reversible cause related to the OAC contributed to the bleed (e.g., high INR, renal function variation). After resumption, if bleeding reoccurred, reassess the severity of the bleed (see Figure 2).

Perioperative warfarin (VKA) restart dose — PICO 3: In patients requiring VKA (warfarin) interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming the first post-operative VKA dose at the patient's usual dose over resuming VKA with double the usual dose (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). One randomized trial of 98 patients compared post-operative resumption of warfarin at patients' usual dose vs doubling the warfarin dose for the first 2 post-operative days, finding by the fifth post-operative day an INR ≥ 2.0 in 13% of the usual-dose group and 50% of the doubling dose group (RR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60) and by the tenth post-operative day 68% and 87% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.00). A 40-patient randomized trial reported median days to reach an INR ≥ 2.0 of 7.8 vs 9.0 days (95% CI: −3.1 to 4.9), and observational studies reported mean durations to attain an INR ≥ 2.0 of 4.6 and 5.1 days, respectively. Implementation notes caution that although doubling for 1 to 2 days may lead to a more rapid attainment of an INR ≥ 2.0 in some patients, there are concerns in applying this approach in practice, including in patients expected to be hospitalized for > 1 day.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^04fb5c27]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

Regarding medical management for colonoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, postprocedural, ASGE 2016 guidelines recommend to consider delaying reinitiation of direct acting anticoagulants after high-risk endoscopic procedures until adequate hemostasis is ensured, given their rapid onset of action and lack of reversal agents. Consider administering thromboprophylaxis (UFH, bridge) if therapeutic doses of direct acting anticoagulants cannot be restarted within 12–24 hours after a high-risk endoscopic procedure, to decrease the risk of thromboembolism, given the short half-life of the direct acting anticoagulant agent, in patients with a high risk for thromboembolism.

Gastrointestinal bleeding — resumption of oral anticoagulation (OAC) is supported by observational evidence showing reduced thromboembolism and mortality but higher rebleeding, and the document states reinitiation is reasonable once hemostasis is achieved. In a systematic review of 12 observational studies (3,098 patients), resumption after OAC‑associated GI bleeding was linked to lower thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68; 9 studies) and lower death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70; 8 studies) but higher recurrent bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48; 11 studies). Additional studies reported discharge‑time restart after a median 5 days with fewer thromboembolic events at 90 days but more bleeding, and warfarin restart > 7 days after a bleed in AF with improved survival and no increase in recurrent GI bleeding; accordingly, "it is reasonable to reinitiate OAC once hemostasis has been achieved".

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^3d54dad2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy — post-procedure anticoagulation and antiplatelet resumption — unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be restarted as soon as bleeding stability allows and continued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic; UFH may be restarted 2 to 6 hours after a therapeutic procedure; the 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend delaying reinitiation of LMWH 48 to 72 hours after surgery in patients believed to be at high risk for bleeding adverse events; there are no data to inform optimal timing for resuming non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and if a NOAC cannot be restarted within 24 hours after a high-risk procedure because of hemostasis concerns, thromboprophylaxis (ie, a UFH bridge) should be considered for patients at high risk for thromboembolism; cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should not be discontinued in most cases, and other antiplatelet agents should be resumed once hemostasis has been achieved.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^9a1a5891]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — perioperative management based on procedure bleed risk is outlined, including timing for resumption and optional post-procedure prophylaxis. DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures, and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures; in selected patients at high risk for VTE, low-dose anticoagulants such as enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin, 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48–72 hours post-procedure. This figure pertains to patients receiving a DOAC and provides guidance on whether to interrupt DOAC therapy perioperatively and how to interrupt based on surgical/procedural bleed risk in the pre- and postoperative period.

ACC 2020 bleeding pathway — timing of anticoagulation reinitiation: "In general, all such decisions should be made by a multidisciplinary care team". Conditions with high thrombotic risk favor early reinitiation "once hemostasis is achieved and the patient is clinically stable", and "OAC may be reinitiated with close monitoring in patients with high thrombotic risk; for patients with moderate or high rebleeding risk, individualized strategies are appropriate". As an example of early reinitiation, "parenteral anticoagulants can often be started with close monitoring within 1 to 3 days in most patients". For high rebleeding risk when thrombotic risk is unacceptably high and therapeutic anticoagulation is necessary, "it is suggested that unfractionated heparin be administered by intravenous infusion owing to its short half-life and the availability of a reversal agent (protamine sulfate) that can rapidly stop and/or reverse anticoagulation in the event of rebleeding".

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^f3b3b8ce]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of recurrent bleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding. In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and recurrent bleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of recurrent GI bleeding.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^aa1dc6cc]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Correction of coagulopathy, when required, should not delay urgent endoscopic or radiological interventions when indicated, as these procedures can be safely and effectively performed at therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in the context of acute haemorrhage.

After bleeding cessation, observational studiesand two meta-analysesconsistently indicate there is a net clinical benefit of restarting anticoagulation, due to a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, despite an increased risk of rebleeding. However, evidence on the optimal timing for restarting anticoagulation is limited. A single retrospective study indicates an excess risk of GI bleeding and of thromboembolism for an interval of warfarin interruption shorter than 7 days and longer than 30 days, respectively. Since there is a trend toward a reduced incidence of thromboembolic events the earlier warfarin is introduced, it is reasonable to restart warfarin as soon as possible by day seven following its interruption. Data on the optimal timing of DOAC resumption are lacking. In analogy with warfarin, restarting DOACs as soon as possible by day seven after their interruption seems reasonable in most cases. The DOAC rapid onset of action, resulting in a full anticoagulation within 2–4 hours, warrants some caution with an earlier resumption.

In patients at very high thrombotic risk (e.g. prosthetic metal heart valve in mitral position), cardiology societies recommend an earlier resumption of anticoagulation with UFH in those at highest risk, rapid titration of prophylactic doses of LMWH to therapeutic doses within 48–72 hours. The choice of strategy should be discussed with the patient's cardiologist. If the risk of restarting anticoagulation is estimated to outweigh the benefits, a consultation with the referral specialist (hematologist, neurologist, and/or cardiologist) is advisable, and alternatives to anticoagulation, such as a left atrial appendage occlusion in AF, or inferior vena cava filter for acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), may be considered.

### Rivaroxaban [^f2929305]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, rivaroxaban tablets should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of rivaroxaban tablets, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. Rivaroxaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

- For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg rivaroxaban tablets dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.

- **For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily**: The patient should take rivaroxaban tablets immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban tablets per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once.

- **For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily**: The patient should take the missed rivaroxaban tablets dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.

Pediatric Patients

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening.

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

### Periprocedural antithrombotic management: a review of the literature and practical approach for the hospitalist physician [^11d93b48]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients who are on long-term antithrombotic therapy (e.g. warfarin and/or antiplatelet agents) must be assessed for temporary discontinuation for a procedure or surgery, making this a salient topic for the hospitalist physician. Discontinuation of antithromhotic therapy can place patients at increased risk of thromboembolic complications while continuing antithrombotic therapy can increase procedure-related bleeding risk. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparins is often used in the periprocedural period, but a great deal of uncertainty exists about how and when to use bridging anticoagulation. Because there is very little Level 1 evidence to define optimal care, both clinical practice and expert consensus guideline opinions vary. For the hospitalist, it is of critical importance to understand the available data, controversies, and management options in order to approach patient care rationally. This review provides a step-wise literature-based discussion addressing the following four questions: (1) What is the optimal management of antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period? (2) Are there very low bleeding risk procedures that do not require interruption of oral anticoagulation? (3) Are there low thromboembolic risk populations who do not require periprocedural bridging? (4) How do you manage patients who must discontinue anti-coagulants but are at an increased thrombotic risk?

### Recurrent bleeding and thrombotic events after resumption of oral anticoagulants following gastrointestinal bleeding: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on control of anticoagulation [^9006fce4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal bleeding frequently complicates anticoagulant therapy causing treatment discontinuation. Data to guide the decision regarding whether and when to resume anticoagulation based on the risks of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding are scarce.

Objectives

We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of these events after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding and assess their relationship with timing of anticoagulation resumption.

Methods

Patients hospitalized because of gastrointestinal bleeding during oral anticoagulation for any indication were eligible. All patients were followed up to 2 years after the index bleeding for recurrent major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, venous or arterial thromboembolism, and mortality.

Results

We included 948 patients hospitalized for gastrointestinal bleeding occurring during treatment with vitamin K antagonists (n = 531) or direct oral anticoagulants (n = 417). In time-dependent analysis, anticoagulant treatment was associated with a higher risk of recurrent clinically relevant bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–2.22), but lower risk of thromboembolism (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.21–0.55), and death (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.36–0.68). Previous bleeding, index major bleeding, and lower glomerular filtration rate were associated with a higher risk of recurrent bleeding. The incidence of recurrent bleeding increased after anticoagulation restart independently of timing of resumption.

Conclusions

Anticoagulant treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, but higher risk of recurrent bleeding. The latter seemed to be influenced by patient characteristics and less impacted by time of anticoagulation resumption.

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^1e8a8bd1]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

To the Editor Dr Gross and colleagues reviewed the management options for cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage to help guide clinical decision-making. 1 The review captured the most up-to-date evidence for clinical management of IPH; however, the authors' suggestion to resume oral anticoagulation therapy 1 to 2 months after deep IPH unrelated to cerebral amyloid angiopathy may not be supported by firm evidence. We believe the recommendations should be more cautious.

### Timing to restart direct oral anticoagulants after traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (RESTARTtlCrH) [^e6ce34f1]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

When a scan shows blood in the brain, oral anticoagulation is nearly always stopped. However, this leaves the question of when it is safe to restart them. The risk of making the bleeding in the brain worse must be balanced against the risk of having a stroke or blood clots. There is no clear evidence on the safest time to restart oral anticoagulation, but most neurosurgeons advise restarting them 1–4 weeks after head injury. Despite a low risk of new or on-going Intracranial Hemorrhage 48 hours after injury, there is a reluctance from clinicians to restart OACs for fear of evoking re-bleeding. This must be balanced against the increased risk of thromboembolism in patients not taking their OAC, predisposing AF patients to increased risk of stroke, systemic thromboembolism and all-cause mortality. Studies suggest evidence of early tICrH expansion on routine repeat imaging occurs in 10–37% of patients on OAC, indicating the need to stop OAC.

This risk reduces substantially over time. A recent trial assessing patients with a major bleed on OACs, reported re-bleeding rates of 4. 3% within 30 days, when excluding the first 3 days from the initial bleed. The bleeding rate was only 4. 5% in those who restarted their OAC within 2 weeks, with a net benefit when compared to those that did not restart OAC within 2 weeks. Another study focusing on tICrH reported a 5% readmission rate for re-bleeding within 30-days in patients who did not restart their DOAC. At 3 months, patients who have restarted OAC have fewer strokes and deaths, despite increased bleeding compared to those who have not restarted OAC. Drug: Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants

### What surgeons should know about non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: a review [^2f1795d2]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed for patients to treat or prevent arterial or venous thromboembolism. The following 4 NOAC agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, edoxaban tosylate, and rivaroxaban. A good understanding of these agents' pharmacologic properties is important for surgeons given their marked differences compared with warfarin sodium. This review highlights key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting.

Observations

The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language studies from May 1, 2009, until May 1, 2017, for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical guidelines. From a systematic review of the published literature that included 70 articles and 166 404 patients, this study identified 5 key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting. These include patient populations for which NOAC use is indicated and contraindicated, the timing of NOAC treatment cessation before invasive interventions, management of NOAC-treated patients requiring urgent interventions, the need for "bridging", and the timing of NOAC treatment's reinitiation after invasive interventions. Important findings are as follows: NOAC agents are not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves or advanced kidney disease (creatinine clearance, < 15 mL/min); minimal to no anticoagulant effect remains when therapy with a NOAC is withheld for 48 to 72 hours before surgery in the context of normal kidney function; a reversal agent is clinically available for dabigatran, while reversal agents for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are under regulatory review; and laboratory testing of the anticoagulant effects of NOACs are not routinely available. There is a paucity of high-quality data on the optimal timing of NOAC cessation and resumption in the perioperative period, particularly for patients who undergo procedures with high bleeding risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

The anticoagulant effect of NOAC agents is predictable but not readily measurable in routine clinical practice. A number of uncertainties remain surrounding the use of these agents in the perioperative setting. Ongoing prospective studies and randomized clinical trials will provide greater clarity on these management issues in the near future.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^784041c7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant. (1) Does the oral anticoagulant need to stop for the procedure? (2) If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure? (3) Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant? (4) When should anticoagulation be re-started post procedure? Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

### A narrative review for perioperative physicians of the 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants [^655ac337]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2017 the American College of Cardiology issued an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway dedicated specifically to the management of bleeding in patients on anticoagulants. The consensus document is both timely and important as indications for more novel anticoagulants expand rapidly. The document reviews in detail recommendations for interruption, management and re-initiation of anticoagulation in bleeding scenarios. Numerous points within the document are relevant to perioperative physicians managing patients on anticoagulation with either bleeding complications or undergoing surgical procedures. The intent of this narrative review is to highlight the salient points within the expert consensus for perioperative physicians.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^8580c98a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^aeb38c4f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI 2) is a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan/Blue Care Network‐funded multicenter collaborative of anticoagulation management services in the state of Michigan. MAQI 2 was formed in 2008 with the goal of improving patient safety and outcomes by collecting and comparing patient clinical data, identifying best practices, and conducting quality improvement initiatives. Currently, there are six hospitals in Michigan participating in the program. Patients initiated on either a DOAC or warfarin are randomly selected for entry into the MAQI 2 database and followed longitudinally so long as they remain on therapy and are managed at the participating health system. All data abstractors undergo training, and each center undergoes regular audits to ensure high‐quality data collection and agreement with predefined data element definitions. More information about MAQI 2 has been previously described. Institutional review board approval has been obtained at each site and the coordinating center (University of Michigan).

2.1 Patient selection

Patients who had a temporary interruption of DOAC or warfarin therapy for an elective surgical procedure were included if they had follow‐up for at least 3 months after the procedure. Patients with indications for anticoagulant use other than AF or VTE were excluded.

2.2 Data collection

Baseline patient information, including demographics, medications, and comorbidities were abstracted from patient charts at the time of anticoagulation initiation. Information about medication changes, new comorbidities, procedures, and bleeding or thrombotic events were abstracted for each patient interaction with the anticoagulation management service for warfarin‐treated patients and at regular 6‐month follow‐up intervals for DOAC‐treated patients. Procedural data abstracted from the medical record included the date of procedure, anticoagulation interruption and restart dates, whether or not heparin bridging was used, and the type of procedure. The procedures were categorized into having low or high bleed risk based on categories from the BRIDGE trial.

2.3 Outcomes

The primary outcomes of our study were 30‐day postoperative thromboembolic or bleeding events. Thromboembolic events included the composite of transient ischemic attacks, ischemic stroke, and VTE. Bleeding events were classified into minor bleeds, major bleeds, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds (CRNMB). Criteria for major and CRNMBs were based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to post-procedural resumption of anticoagulation, CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider resuming oral anticoagulation after hemostasis is established (within 24 hours for a procedure with a low risk of bleeding and within 48–72 hours for a procedure with a high risk of bleeding).

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants… [^d2fea35a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Direct oral anticoagulants, comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism. Observations For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal, low to moderate, or high risk. For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure.

Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent or urgent surgical procedures experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^21dc7bcb]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, postprocedural, ASGE 2016 guidelines recommend to consider delaying reinitiation of direct acting anticoagulants after high-risk endoscopic procedures until adequate hemostasis is ensured, given their rapid onset of action and lack of reversal agents. Consider administering thromboprophylaxis (UFH, bridge) if therapeutic doses of direct acting anticoagulants cannot be restarted within 12–24 hours after a high-risk endoscopic procedure, to decrease the risk of thromboembolism, given the short half-life of the direct acting anticoagulant agent, in patients with a high risk for thromboembolism.

Post-operative DOAC/LMWH resumption timing — flexibility with the timing of post-operative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) resumption is warranted because a peak anticoagulant effect occurs within 2 to 4 hours after administration, and this is especially pertinent if patients develop greater than expected post-operative bleeding.

### Risks associated with discontinuation of oral anticoagulation in newly diagnosed patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the GARFIELD-AF registry [^f8091ca0]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedures and outcome measures

Collection of follow‐up data occurred at 4‐monthly intervals up to 24 months. In accordance with the study protocol, 20% of all electronic case report forms were monitored against source documentation. Timing of treatment is based upon the date treatment was started and the date treatment was discontinued. Changes in treatment type were recorded. Defining discontinuation based solely on stopping and never restarting a drug in a study where patients die or stop follow‐up at different points will likely produce biased results. For example, patient A stops drug and dies 2 days later. Patient B stops drug and restarts 3 days later. Patient A would be defined as discontinued and B would not. Yet at day 2, the day of the event, they were both off drug. Therefore, permanent discontinuation based on never restarting is not an appropriate approach — a defined time window for discontinuation is necessary. Discontinuation was defined as the cessation of OAC treatment for ≥ 7 consecutive days (whether or not OAC was restarted later), based on a consensus from the GARFIELD‐AF Steering Committee, which considered that the duration of most nonpermanent treatment interruptions would continue for < 1 week. OAC switching, without a ≥ 7 consecutive day suspension of treatment, was not considered OAC discontinuation. This prespecified criterion was applied to both those who survived and those who did not, to reduce bias in patient allocation to the discontinuation group. Thus, patients remained in the nondiscontinuation group until discontinuation had continued for ≥ 7 consecutive days, without patient mortality. As a sensitivity analysis, the interruption of OAC treatment for at least 30 days was also assessed.

Endpoints of interest were the occurrence of the following combined outcomes as well as their individual components: death/stroke/systemic embolism (SE)/acute myocardial infarction (MI), death/stroke/SE, and death, stroke/SE, and MI. All strokes included in this analysis were nonhemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic strokes were considered major bleeds.

### Perioperative anticoagulation management in patients who are receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: a practical guide for clinicians [^fc1cdf98]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The management of patients who require temporary interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy because of surgery or other invasive procedures is a clinically important topic because of the increasing prevalence of patients who are receiving oral anticoagulants and the availability of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), which allow out-of-hospital perioperative anticoagulation. The optimal management of such patients has been hampered by the lack of well-designed prospective studies investigating the efficacy and safety of different perioperative management strategies. The two main issues that need to be considered in perioperative anticoagulant management is the patient's risk of thromboembolic event when anticoagulant therapy is interrupted and the risk of bleeding that is associated with the surgery or procedure. An assessment of these factors will determine the perioperative management approach. The objectives of this review are to focus on practical issues relating to perioperative anticoagulation and the implementation of a perioperative anticoagulation management approach that can be used in everyday clinical practice.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^fb3f2a3e]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical question: Should therapeutic anticoagulation be resumed after hemorrhagic TBI? If yes, what is the optimal timing?

There is insufficient evidence to support or discourage the resumption of therapeutic antithrombotic treatment following TBI. Expertise from a multidisciplinary team with experience of clinical practice should be sought to guide decision-making on a case-by-case basis.

After hemostasis is achieved and traumatic ICH has stopped, decisions on resuming anticoagulation therapy can be challenging because of the potential to increase the risk of hemorrhagic progression in the acute phase and the risk of bleeding in any future TBI. There is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimal timing for resuming oral anticoagulation after TBI. This uncertainty is reflected by the results of a survey of practice patterns in patients with central nervous system hemorrhage and a history of atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke. The most common times for restarting anticoagulation after the index hemorrhage were 1 month (43.5%) followed by 1 week (33.7%), respectively. Only 13.3% of respondents indicated they would prefer an earlier restart time (3 days), and 8% indicated they would not restart anticoagulation. Interestingly, 47.7% of respondents indicated that they face dilemmas at least once per week concerning anticoagulation restart time and intensity, and 59.4% stated that they relied predominantly on intuition or past experience.

In a retrospective study, Albrecht et al. compared the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in patients who did or did not restart warfarin therapy during the 12-month period following hospitalization for TBI. Resumption of warfarin treatment was associated with decreased risks of thrombotic events (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88) and hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96). Although there was also an increased risk of hemorrhagic events (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.29–1.78), the authors concluded that recommencing anticoagulation provided an overall net benefit for most patients. A more recent retrospective study showed that there is no additional risk of neurological deterioration related to the administration of anticoagulation within 60 days after injury. In this study, intravenous heparin was the most commonly used agent (70.8%) for therapeutic anticoagulation.

### Who should get long-term anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism and with what? [^1668805f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

After an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians and patients face an important question: "Do we stop anticoagulants or continue them indefinitely?" The decision is easy in some scenarios (eg, stop in VTE provoked by major surgery). In most scenarios, which are faced on a day-to-day basis in routine practice, it is a challenging decision because of uncertainty in estimates in the long-term risks (principally major bleeding) and benefits (reducing recurrent VTE) and the tight trade-offs between them. Once the decision is made to continue, the next question to tackle is "Which anticoagulant?" Here again, it is a difficult decision because of the uncertainty with regard to estimates of efficacy and the safety of anticoagulant options and the tight trade-offs between choices. We conclude with the approach that we take in our clinical practice.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^d928a590]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently under way to answer these questions. Because the half lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents. Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision making and suggest strategies to minimize complications. From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding risks and benefits of treatment options and demonstration of effective communication among medical and surgical providers are essential.

Restarting antithrombotic therapy for elective procedures

There are few data to inform us on the optimal time to restart antithrombotic therapy, if discontinued, after elective endoscopic therapy. Decisions in all cases will be based on the perceived risk of haemorrhage following the procedure versus the risk of thrombosis to an individual patient. It should be remembered that DOACs exert an anticoagulant effect within hours, compared with days for warfarin. Data from the PAUSE study indicates that restarting a DOAC 2–3 days after a high-risk procedure has a low risk of thromboembolic events. Data on restarting therapy after acute GI haemorrhage are discussed in that section. A prospective cohort study in Italyevaluated the risks of haemorrhage and thrombosis in relation to compliance with the previous version of this BSG/ESGE guideline. For cases who underwent polypectomy there was a trend to more intraprocedural bleeding if DOAC was not stopped as per the guideline for high-risk procedures. Stopping longer than the guidelines did not reduce the intraprocedural bleeding risk. Also, restarting the DOAC immediately after polypectomy, rather than a delay of 24–48 hours (as suggested by the guidelines) in high-risk patients led to an almost doubling of the delayed bleeding risk without a reduction in thrombosis, although these measures did not reach statistical significance.

For procedures with a very high risk of haemorrhage such as ESD, it may be desirable to delay restarting antithrombotics beyond the intervals recommended in these guidelines. In a meta-analysis, post-ESD bleeding risk was not significantly increased if antithrombotic therapy was resumed at least 1 week after ESD whereas resumption of antithrombotic therapy immediately or within 1 week after ESD was significantly associated with post-ESD bleeding. The incidence of thrombosis was not analysed, however, and this needs to be considered on an individual patient basis.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^5195efdb]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative warfarin (VKA) resumption — PICO 2: In patients requiring VKA (warfarin) interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming VKA (warfarin) within 24 hours over a delay to > 24 hours after an elective surgery/procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). There are no studies comparing early (12–24 hours) with delayed (> 24 hours) postoperative warfarin resumption, and uncontrolled observational studies reported with resumption within 24 hours major bleeding and ATE of 2.7% (95% CI: 1.6–3.9) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1–1.8) versus delayed resumption bleeding and ATE of 8.6% (95% CI: 0–17.7) and 2.4% (95% CI: 0–7.0), respectively. Implementation notes state that for most patients resuming VKAs within 24 hours implies resumption on the evening of the surgery/procedure, that early resumption implies it takes typically 2 to 3 days for a partial anticoagulant effect and 4 to 8 days for a full effect, and that resumption may be delayed in certain postoperative circumstances.

### Spontaneous rectus sheath hematomas: when to restart anticoagulation? [^ce3ac7ff]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the present study was to obtain data regarding the timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients with spontaneous rectus sheath hematomas (RSH).

Patients and Methods

The study is based on review of patients receiving anticoagulation medication who were diagnosed with a spontaneous RSH (traumatic and iatrogenic excluded) between 14 July 1997 and 17 March 2012.

Results

There were 156 patients (37% male; aged 73 ± 13 years) with an average body mass index of 29 ± 7 (procedure group 28 ± 6). Anticoagulants included coumadin (64%), intravenous heparin (21%), aspirin (8%), and others (7%). An intervention was needed in 29 (19%) of the patients (5% operative; 16% embolization). Sixty-two percent of patients had their anticoagulation restarted during their hospitalization, with a median re-initiation time of 4 days after RSH diagnosis (range 2–8 days). Timing of anticoagulant resumption did not differ regardless of the need for intervention (3 vs. 4 days). The complication rate was 19% (42% in the procedure group, none specific to the procedure), with the most common being acute renal failure (n = 8; 5%), death (n = 8; 5%), and thrombotic events (n = 5; 3%). After resumption of anticoagulation, two patients suffered enlargement of their RSH, both 2 days after resumption.

Conclusions

Intervention to control hemorrhage was unnecessary in the majority of patients with RSH. In those with resumption of anticoagulation, the majority of patients were safely restarted by day 4. Even though complications secondary to anticoagulation were few, thrombotic complications outnumbered bleeding complications, suggesting that anticoagulation was withheld for too long after RSH diagnosis.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c22b707b]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^31d109c4]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of VKAs — evidence for timing — notes that no randomized trials compared a 5-day and a < 5-day preoperative interruption of warfarin. In a cohort where warfarin was stopped 5 days before surgery in 224 patients, 15 (7%) had INR > 1.5 the day before surgery, and a randomized trial of 5-day vs 1-day interruption (with 1 mg oral vitamin K for the 1-day group) reported a mean INR of 1.2 at surgery in the 5-day group. A subanalysis assessing longer vs shorter interruption (≥ 3 days vs < 3 days) found it conferred a decrease risk for major bleeding (RR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15–0.55) without affecting ATE risk (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.19–1.3). Observational and uncontrolled studies support a longer (≥ 5-day) interruption with low rates of major bleeding (approximately 2%) and ATE (< 0.5%).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to long-term medical therapy, resumption of antithrombotics, AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider starting anticoagulation ≈ 7–8 weeks after ICH after weighing specific patient characteristics to optimize the balance of risks and benefits in patients with AF, if the decision is made to restart anticoagulation.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) — restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) requires caution due to high baseline risk; nonlobar ICH reinitiation "may be considered", observational data suggest resumption yields "50% to 70% lower" thrombosis and death without more recurrent bleeding versus discontinuation, timing in studies ranges "72 hours to 30 weeks", current guidelines "recommend avoiding anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks" without mechanical valves and using aspirin initially if indicated, and the authors "favor delaying" OAC for "at least 4 weeks" in patients without high thrombotic risk. ICH accounts for "approximately 20%" of spontaneous cases with "30-day mortality rates approaching 50%", recurrence risk is influenced by bleed mechanism, lobar location, microbleeds, and ongoing anticoagulation; DOAC safety after ICH switch "has not been evaluated". A randomized trial of 537 post‑ICH patients restarting aspirin showed a trend to less recurrent ICH (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03; p = 0.060) without reduction in ischemic events (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65–1.60; p = 0.92), and a large retrospective study reported median OAC restart "approximately 1 month" after bleeding.

### Delphi consensus statement for the management of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding [^48de0a1c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation resumption

Statement 18
SEED recommends resuming anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants) following delayed post-polypectomy bleeding in patients with an indication for anticoagulation.
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. (Strongly agree: 82.1%; agree: 17.9%)
Statement 19
SEED suggests resuming anticoagulants following delayed post-polypectomy bleeding on day 7 or earlier. In patients with high thrombotic risk, anticoagulation should preferably be restarted within 72 hours, provided hemostasis has been achieved.
Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. (Strongly agree: 57.7%; agree: 34.6%)

Overall, current recommendations suggest resumption within 7 days of the bleeding event, given the overall benefit in reducing thromboembolic complications. According to the ESGE, it is reasonable to restart warfarin and DOACs from day 7 onwards in patients at low thrombotic risk after interruption. In those with high thrombotic risk, heparin bridging is recommended, preferably within 72 h.

The benefits of resuming anticoagulation after hospitalization for LGIB are well established. In a large cohort study of patients experiencing diverticular hemorrhage, discontinuation of anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, while no significant association was found with rebleeding. Similarly, in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation, resumption of VKAs or DOACs following LGIB was linked to a lower hazard of all-cause mortality and a comparable risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding compared to those who did not resume anticoagulation. An analysis of patients from the UK audit of LGIB on anti-thrombotics revealed that rebleeding rates in the DOAC (20.0%) and warfarin groups (23.1%) were similar to the unexposed group (19.4%). The use of DOACs or warfarin was not associated with either in-hospital rebleeding or hospital readmission due to further bleeding. Moreover, an analysis of 150 patients with LGIB while on anticoagulants found that resumption of anticoagulation was not associated with recurrent bleeding. When the cohort was expanded to include all patients with GIB, resumption of anticoagulation was linked to a reduced risk of ischemic events during follow-up and decreased mortality.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

Medication reconciliation — Before discharge, medication reconciliation must update and document all medications, including duration of DAPT; particular attention should be given to patients on "triple therapy", which due to bleeding risk should be maintained for the least amount of time possible (e.g., 1 week to 1 month). Consider a single antiplatelet agent with oral anticoagulation to minimize bleeding risk. Patients on a direct oral anticoagulant can restart the same or next day, while those on warfarin should restart within 1 week of discharge; LMWH bridging is not routinely recommended except in high thrombosis risk, metformin should be held for 48 h in those at risk of CKD or with CIN, and proton‐pump inhibitors should be considered for bleeding risk on DAPT and routinely prescribed for all on triple therapy.

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Figure 3
Algorithm for perioperative bridging of warfarin. INR, International Normalized Ratio; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; UFH, unfractionated heparin.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

### New oral anticoagulants and regional anaesthesia [^74792263]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are approved for a variety of clinical syndromes, including the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndromes, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prevention of venous thrombosis after total joint surgery or hip fracture. Published guidelines have differing recommendations on the safe interval between discontinuation of the anticoagulant and performance of neuraxial procedures and between the interventional procedure and redosing of the drug. While two to three half-life intervals might be acceptable in patients who are at high risk for VTE or stroke, an interval of four to six half-lives between discontinuation of the drug and neuraxial injections is probably safer in most patients at low risk of thrombosis. In those with renal disease, the interval should be based on creatinine clearance. After a neuraxial procedure or removal of an epidural catheter, anticoagulants can be resumed within 24–48 h in most patients, but they can be taken sooner in patients who are at higher risk for VTE or stroke, that is, 24 h minus the time to peak effect of the drug. The new antiplatelet drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor should be stopped 7 or 5 days, respectively, before a neuraxial injection and can be restarted 24 h later. In selected situations, laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect is appropriate, and reversal agents are suggested when there is a need to rapidly restore haemostatic function.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^99d220f4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is key to the treatment/prevention of thromboembolic events. The primary complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt anticoagulation reversal; this could also be required for nonbleeding patients requiring urgent/emergent invasive procedures. The decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit-risk ratio of supporting hemostasis versus post-reversal thrombosis. We appraise the available guidelines/recommendations for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal in the management of major bleeding, and also assess recent clinical data that may not yet be reflected in official guidance. In general, available guidelines are consistent in their recommendations, advocating administration of vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) rather than fresh frozen plasma to patients with VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage and life-threatening bleeding, and specific reversal agents as essential therapy for DOAC reversal in those same severe conditions. However, guidelines also recommend off-label use of PCCs for DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are unavailable. Limited recent evidence generally support the latter recommendation, but guidelines are likely to evolve as more data become available.

Post-procedural Recovery

Patients should be monitored for varying periods of time, depending on the intervention, after the end of the procedure. The development of any symptoms could indicate the presence of a procedure-related complication. Before patient discharge, written instructions including post-procedural restrictions on activity and diet should be provided to the patient. Finally, for patients that were previously under anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy clear, instructions need to be provided on when and how to restart the above treatments.

Inpatient rounds should be made regularly for interventions performed on an inpatient basis. A progress note should be kept on the patient's chart, including patient status, clinical findings, treatment plan and ongoing medication therapies.

Peri-interventional management needs to be structured, including standardised measures for enhancing the safety of the procedure. These measures include, for instance, a pre-procedural "time-out" and institutional guidelines for the use of anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy and antibiotics. Interventional radiologists have to be able to manage most states of post-procedural pain. A structured post-procedural note is an important tool for documenting and communicating post-procedural recommendations.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^96c92ccc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, XARELTO should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of XARELTO, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. XARELTO should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg XARELTO dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.
For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily: The patient should take XARELTO immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg XARELTO per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once.
For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily: The patient should take the missed XARELTO dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.

Pediatric Patients

If XARELTO is taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.
If XARELTO is taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening.
If XARELTO is taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^df0c6a3c]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient considerations

We recommend that all patients are advised of the thrombotic risks of discontinuing antiplatelets or anticoagulants, as well as the haemorrhagic risks of continuing therapy (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

For all patients on antiplatelets or anticoagulants we recommend advising that there is an increased risk of post-procedure haemorrhage compared to patients not on these drugs (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

As discussed, management of antithrombotic drugs is a balance of the risks of haemorrhage from the procedure versus the risks of thrombosis if antithrombotic medication is discontinued or modified. Haemorrhage secondary to high-risk endoscopic procedures can often be controlled by further endoscopic therapeutic measures, and is rarely fatal. A thrombotic stroke may result in lifelong disability, and a major cardiac event may result in death. Not only do the risks of thrombosis vs haemorrhage need to be assessed on an individual patient basis, but patients should be fully informed, and involved in this decision-making process. The risk of a potentially catastrophic thrombotic event such as a stroke may not be acceptable to a patient even if that risk is very low.

Once the decision to modify antithrombotic medication is made, then a personal plan for that patient should be made. This should include written as well as verbal information regarding the precise timing of any changes. This should include the time of last dose of a drug, and first dose when restarting. If multiple drugs are involved, or substitutions including bridging with heparin, then timing respective to each drug should be clearly communicated. Simple algorithms such as those illustrated in the PAUSE trial for DOACsmay be useful (Fig. 3). Late haemorrhagic complications may occur one to two weeks after endoscopic therapy, and antithrombotic therapy will have often been reinstituted prior to this. Patients on antithrombotics should be advised that there is a possible increase in post procedure haemorrhage, and also advised how to seek urgent medical advice at any time of the day or night. We have produced a patient information sheet based on this guideline to assist with patient engagement (online supplemental file).

### Discontinuation and management of direct-acting anticoagulants for emergency procedures [^d142ab43]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) who then need an emergency invasive procedure require specialized management strategies. Appropriate patient evaluation includes assessment of the current anticoagulation state, including timing of the last dose. DOACs require particular coagulation assays to measure anticoagulation levels accurately, although standard coagulation screening tests may provide qualitative guidance. Specialty societies have endorsed general recommendations for patient management to promote hemostasis in anticoagulated patients requiring surgery or other invasive procedures. These include general stopping rules (such as ≥ 24 hours for low-risk procedures and ≥ 48 hours for high-risk surgery with normal renal function) for elective procedures. Bridging therapy when oral anticoagulant treatment is interrupted has recently been questioned, depending on the clinical scenario. Novel agents for the reversal of DOAC-induced anticoagulation have recently been developed. Idarucizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that selectively binds dabigatran, was recently approved for clinical use in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, and for patients requiring emergency interventions. Idarucizumab can streamline the pre- and periprocedural anticoagulation management of dabigatran-treated patients, as it provides fast, complete, and sustainable reversibility. Andexanet alfa is an inactive, decoy factor Xa (FXa) molecule that binds FXa inhibitors, and ciraparantag is a synthetic molecule designed to bind fractionated and unfractionated heparins, and each of the currently approved DOACs. As clinical development of the additional anti-FXa-specific anticoagulant reversal agents proceeds, the respective role of each in the management of emergency bleeding events and invasive procedures will be better defined, and it is hoped they will make important contributions to patient care.

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

- age greater than or equal to 80 years

- body weight less than or equal to 60 kg

- serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

- In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.

- In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Missed Dose

If a dose of apixaban tablets is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

2.3 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping apixaban tablets and prior to the intervention is not generally required. Apixaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^f0a48c84]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — elective surgery interruption timing — is informed by elimination half-lives and expected international normalized ratio (INR) kinetics: values are 36 to 42 hours for warfarin, 8 to 11 hours for acenocoumarol, and 96 to 104 hours for phenprocoumon; typically 5 days of interruption are needed to normalize INR, while 6 or more days may be required in selected patients, including those with an elevated INR (> 3.5). After resumption, a full anticoagulant effect (INR ≥ 2.0) occurs 4 to 8 days after VKA resumption. Routine INR measurement in the immediate pre-operative (day before) and post-operative (1–2 days after) period would not be needed, but may be warranted when the pre-operative INR is high (> 3.5).

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb3858e4]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^e2869daa]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

Observations

For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (eg, minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (eg, major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent (eg, prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet-α) prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^e8a6708e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

For high-risk procedures in patients who are at high thrombotic risk, it is recommended to discontinue warfarin 5 days before the procedure, to start a daily therapeutic dose of LWMH (100 UI/kg b.i.d.) 3 days before the examination, and to withhold it 24 h prior to the procedure. Subsequently, warfarin can be resumed at the usual daily dose on the day of the procedure, while the daily dose of LWMH should be restarted on the following day, if the risk of post-procedural bleeding is deemed acceptably low, and continued until a therapeutic INR is achieved (approximately 5 days later). In patients believed to be at high risk for adverse bleeding events, delayed restarting of LWMH 48 h after the procedures can be a reasonable option, according to the 2012 ACCP guidelines. LMWH are usually preferred to unfractionated heparin, as they have similar efficacy, even in high-risk patients such as those with metal heart valves, but are more convenient to use and do not require intensive monitoring. Intravenous unfractionated heparin may be a reasonable alternative in patients with renal insufficiency and/or those requiring hemodialysis, as their dosing is unaffected by renal clearance.

Some GI endoscopic procedures are associated with cautery-induced injury, which may result in delayed bleeding, usually 7–10 days after the procedure. The resumption of antithrombotic therapy, particularly full-dose therapy, is a major determinant of the bleeding risk after invasive procedures, and the use of bridging anticoagulation further increases this risk. Thus, all patients should be advised that there is an increased risk of post-procedural bleeding compared to non-anticoagulated patients.

### The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant in ischemic stroke combined with non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: a real-world big data analysis [^94cde268]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with ischemic stroke (IS) combined with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), oral anticoagulants (OAC), especially new oral anticoagulants (NOAC), are recommended as the standard of care in current clinical practice guidelines. However, anticoagulation therapy is also accompanied by the risk of bleeding. At present, there is still a lack of unified standards and guidance on how to balance the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy and how to determine the best time to commence OAC following IS. The timing of restarting OAC mainly depended on the infarct size and the severity of stroke in patients. Therefore, the recommended anticoagulation method followed the "1-3-6-12″ principle of the 2021 European Heart Rhythm Association/European Society of Cardiology Guidelines to determine the severity of neurological disease in patients based on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Anticoagulation should be performed 1 day after transient ischemic attack, 3 days after mild stroke, 6 days after moderate stroke, and 12 days after severe stroke. The Chinese expert consensus had previously recommended that patients with mild to moderate stroke (NIHSS ≤ 15) and low risk of bleeding should initiate anticoagulation therapy within 2–14 days after onset, while the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for patients with severe stroke (NIHSS > 15) should be postponed until 14 days later.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^fb5ed55a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anticoagulation management — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption, bridging, and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) resumption — is summarized as follows: In atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on VKA, the BRIDGE trial randomized 1844 patients to low-molecular-weight heparin bridging or placebo starting 3 days preoperatively and continued 5 days postoperatively, with warfarin held from preoperative day 5 through postoperative day 1, and bridging anticoagulation was noninferior for prevention of thromboembolism but increased the risk of major bleeding; a simple DOAC interruption strategy without heparin bridging resulted in minimal time off DOAC with low bleeding and low thromboembolic risk, and among approximately 11% of DOAC-treated patients who received heparin bridging bleeding risk increased without reduction in thromboembolic risk, so most patients with AF will not benefit from bridging anticoagulation. For resumption after interruption, once hemostasis is achieved after a low or moderate bleeding risk procedure it is reasonable to restart VKA as early as 12 to 24 hours and it is suggested to resume VKA at the previous therapeutic dose, whereas DOACs should be resumed when full anticoagulation is clinically appropriate, which may be as early as 6 hours postoperatively if hemostasis has occurred; in the PAUSE trial, DOACs were resumed 48 to 72 hours after high bleeding risk procedures.

Restarted post-procedure, resumption timing varies among the guidelines. ○ JGES-Specific Approach: Supports cilostazol as an alternative to ASA in select cases. ○ DOACs: ● ASGE/ESGE/APAGE: Discontinuation based on CrCl, no bridging recommended. ● JGES: Bridging advised in certain cases. ● Post-procedural resumption (all guidelines): Once hemostasis confirmed.
Bridging and international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring ● Warfarin bridging (all guidelines): ○ LMWH/heparin substitution before high-risk procedures. ○ Variability in bridging duration. ● INR assessment (all guidelines): ○ Preprocedure INR check mandatory to guide discontinuation. ○ Heparin stopped once INR therapeutic post-procedure.

### Between a rock and a hard place: resumption of oral anticoagulant therapy after intracranial hemorrhage [^ea9538a4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most feared and lethal complication of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. Resumption of OAC after ICH has long posed a challenge for clinicians, complicated by the expanding range of anticoagulant agents available in modern clinical practice, including direct OACs and, more recently, factor XI and XII inhibitors. A review of the current literature found support for resuming OAC in the majority of patients after ICH based on pooled retrospective data showing that resumption is associated with a lower risk of mortality and thromboembolism without a significantly increased risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The optimal time to resume OAC is less clear; however, the available evidence suggests that the composite risk of both recurrent hemorrhage and thromboembolism is likely minimized, somewhere between 4 and 6 weeks, after ICH in most patients. Specific considerations to guide the optimal resumption time in the individual patient include ICH location, mechanism, and anticoagulant class. Patients with mechanical heart valves and intracerebral malignancy represent high-risk groups who require more nuanced decision making. Here, we appraise the literature with the aim of providing a practical guide for clinicians while also discussing priorities for future investigation.

### Timing of oral anticoagulation in acute ischaemic stroke and non-valvular atrial fibrillation: early', timely' or late? [^4dd355a5]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The 1-3-6-12-day rule was designed to mitigate the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage by delaying anticoagulation based on stroke severity. However, several factors beyond stroke severity can influence the risk of haemorrhagic transformation, including age, the type of reperfusion therapy administered (thrombolysis or thrombectomy), recanalisation status, blood pressure variability and hyperglycaemia. Risk stratification approaches, such as those proposed by the ELAN trial based on neuroimaging criteria alone or the NIHSS-based stratification used in the 1-3-6-12 day rule, do not account for these additional factors. It is unlikely that there will be a one-size-fits-all approach and that the emerging evidence will reveal a need to tailor restarting anticoagulation to a range of individual patient factors. In the era of personalised medicine, leveraging big data could help in the multivariable risk versus benefit stratification for optimising the timing of OAC reinitiation in patients with AIS with AF (figure 1).

This real-world study by Olma et al highlights the significant variability in clinical practices regarding the timing of anticoagulation resumption after ischaemic stroke. It may be informative to explore further the factors influencing clinicians' decisions to delay or initiate anticoagulation earlier. Besides stroke size and severity, other factors that could impact timing include whether the patient received reperfusion therapy and their individual systemic bleeding risk. Current clinical trials do not provide clear guidance on managing these specific subgroups. There are, however, observational data to suggest that early (within 2 weeks) restart of OAC in patients who have acute reperfusion therapy does not significantly increase the risk of symptomatic haemorrhagic transformation or reinfarction.

Stroke populations display diverse clinical phenotypes, necessitating larger trials to determine the optimal timing of restarting anticoagulation across different demographics. Future studies, such as OPTIMAS and START, may provide further clarity on the optimal timing for resuming anticoagulation in patients who had ischaemic stroke. Indeed, OPTIMAS showed that early Direct Oral Anticoagulation (DOAC) initiation within 4 days after ischaemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation was non-inferior to delayed initiation for the composite outcome of ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, unclassifiable stroke, or systemic embolism at 90 days. Similarly, START did not identify a clearly superior day to initiate DOAC for secondary stroke prevention in AF, although early DOAC initiation was better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset.

### Endoscopy in patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy: British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline update [^191eea09]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulant therapy, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, BSG/ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend to resume anticoagulation following acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with an indication for long-term anticoagulation.
Consider resuming anticoagulation as soon as possible after 7 days of anticoagulant interruption in patients at low thrombotic risk.
Resume anticoagulation earlier with heparin bridging, preferably within 3 days, in patients at high-thrombotic risk.
