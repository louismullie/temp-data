Answer Choices:
A. Advertising.
B. Public relations.
C. Sales promotion.
D. Direct marketing.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which marketing and communication tool offers a direct inducement or incentive to encourage customers to buy a product or service, with options including advertising, public relations, sales promotion, and direct marketing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of each option. Then, I should verify which option most clearly and consistently uses direct incentives like coupons, discounts, free samples, or rebates. Next, I will review real-world examples across industries to confirm the pattern. Finally, I will double-check for any exceptions or overlaps before concluding with the best answer.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Advertising is paid, non-personal communication to inform or persuade, but it does not inherently include a direct incentive. Public relations focuses on earned media and reputation management without direct inducements. Direct marketing communicates directly with individuals but may or may not include incentives. Sales promotion, by contrast, is explicitly designed to stimulate immediate purchase through short-term incentives such as coupons, discounts, samples, contests, and rebates [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the incentive claim with concrete examples. In tobacco marketing, companies routinely use price discounts, coupons, buy-one-get-one offers, and retailer incentives to reduce consumer prices and increase sales, and these are categorized as promotional allowances and price discounts rather than pure advertising. Similarly, e-cigarette brands prominently feature limited-time discounts, multi-product price reductions, and games with product prizes on their websites, which are classic sales promotion tactics. Even in public health contexts, point-of-purchase promotions and pricing strategies are used to influence behavior, underscoring that these are incentive-based approaches rather than mere awareness advertising [^2d007d56] [^b7435f95] [^b0e49766].

> Hold on, I should verify that these are not just isolated cases. The FTC expenditure data show that for cigarettes, the overwhelming majority of marketing dollars are spent on price-related promotions and promotional allowances, dwarfing direct advertising spend, which confirms that sales promotion is the dominant incentive-heavy tool in that industry. In menthol cigarette campaigns, direct mail ads frequently contained coupons or other incentives targeting price-sensitive consumers. And in the vaping sector, JUUL's early marketing included discount coupons and affiliate kickbacks, again aligning with sales promotion rather than generic advertising or PR [^2d007d56] [^77f5f7ab] [^12d48c2d].

> I need to check for potential overlaps so I don't overstate exclusivity. Direct marketing can include incentives, but it is defined by the direct communication channel rather than the presence of an inducement; by contrast, sales promotion is defined by the incentive itself. Advertising can occasionally incorporate a promotional element, but when it does, it is functioning as a sales promotion within an ad, not as advertising per se. Public relations, meanwhile, lacks direct inducements by definition, so it does not fit the question's criterion of offering a direct incentive [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the options against the question's wording. The phrase "direct inducement or incentive" maps most precisely to sales promotion, which is constructed around short-term offers designed to lower price, add value, or create urgency. While direct marketing might deliver a coupon, the coupon itself is a sales promotion mechanic; while an ad might announce a sale, the sale is a promotional tactic. Therefore, the most accurate and consistent answer is sales promotion [^notfound].

> Final answer: C. Sales promotion.

---

The correct answer is **C. Sales promotion**. Sales promotion uses direct incentives such as discounts, coupons, free samples, contests, and loyalty rewards to stimulate immediate purchases [^2d007d56] [^b7435f95]. Advertising builds awareness but does not inherently offer incentives; public relations focuses on reputation and earned media; and direct marketing is a channel that may or may not include incentives [^de5eed25] [^00ffc18d].

## Definitions and distinctions

| **Marketing tool** | **Definition** | **Key characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Advertising | Paid, non-personal communication to inform or persuade | - Builds awareness <br/> - No direct incentive |
| Public relations | Managing reputation through earned media and stakeholder relations | - Credibility <br/> - No direct incentive |
| Sales promotion | Short-term incentives to stimulate immediate purchase | - Direct incentives <br/> - Immediate action |
| Direct marketing | Personalized communication to targeted individuals | - Direct contact <br/> - May or may not include incentives |

---

## Evidence supporting sales promotion

- **Tobacco industry**: Price discounts, coupons, and promotional allowances dominate marketing spend, directly lowering consumer prices and increasing sales [^2d007d56] [^f6cdd79d].
- **E-cigarettes**: Brands use limited-time discounts, multi-buy deals, and prize games to incentivize purchases [^b7435f95].
- **Public health**: Pricing strategies and point-of-purchase promotions are recommended to influence behavior, underscoring their incentive nature [^b0e49766] [^51565358].

---

## Limitations of other options

- **Advertising**: Builds awareness but does not inherently provide incentives [^de5eed25].
- **Public relations**: Focuses on reputation, not direct purchase incentives [^88f4821c].
- **Direct marketing**: A channel that may or may not include incentives, so it is not defined by them [^00ffc18d].

---

## Conclusion

Sales promotion is the marketing tool that **offers direct inducements or incentives** to encourage customers to buy a product or service, distinguishing it from advertising, public relations, and direct marketing.

### A strategy for controlling the marketing of tobacco products: a regulated market model [^1c1fd6b9]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To outline a novel strategy for controlling the tobacco market.

Arguments

More comprehensive controls over the tobacco market are essential and long overdue. Effective controls need to encourage the development of less harmful products; control commercial communication to ensure that potential harms are highlighted relative to any benefits; and provide mechanisms to move consumers away from tobacco use, or at least towards less harmful alternatives. Achieving this by regulating the existing industry is one strategy. This paper puts the case for an alternative: to have marketing controlled by an agency (called here the Tobacco Products Agency, or TPA) which tendered to manufacturers for product and which distributed to retailers in ways that reduce incentives to bend or break the law. The TPA would be backed by legislation that made tobacco a controlled substance with possession sale and use only allowed as permitted by the regulations, which in reality would be only as provided by the TPA.

Conclusions

The overall effect of such a model, which we call a "regulated market model", would be to eliminate most of the incentives and remaining opportunities for commercial promotion of tobacco and to create incentives to encourage the development of less harmful tobacco products. Such a model preserves the competition inherent in a free market, but directs it towards the challenge of reducing the harm from tobacco use.

### An assessment of direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs [^01fa80e5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Advertising is widely seen by economists and regulators as beneficial to markets and consumers. The prescription drug market offers exceptional opportunities for direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) to provide new-product information, improve compliance, alleviate widespread underdiagnosis and undertreatment, and motivate new-product development.5 DTCA can also induce excess or even dangerous prescribing, however, partly because patients are poorly informed and usually pay far less than the full cost of drugs. Empirical research can help resolve these issues.

### How tobacco companies ensure prime placement of their advertising and products in stores: interviews with retailers about tobacco company incentive programmes [^0abc7eac]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Background

About 81% of cigarette manufacturers' marketing expenditures in the USA is spent to promote cigarette sales in stores. Relatively little is known about how these expenditures help the manufacturers achieve their marketing goals in stores. A better understanding of how tobacco companies influence the retail environment would help researchers and tobacco control activists to monitor industry presence in stores.

Objective

To describe the types of tobacco company incentive programmes offered to retailers, how these programmes impact the store environments, and possible visual indicators of retailer participation in incentive programmes.

Study Design

In-depth qualitative interviews with a convenience sample of 29 tobacco retailers were conducted in 2001.

Setting

USA.

Main Outcome Measures

The types and requirements of retailer incentive programmes provided by tobacco companies, and how participation in a programme alters their stores.

Results

The retailers provided insights into how tobacco companies convey promotional allowances and special offers to them and how these incentives shape the retail environment. Retailers noted that tobacco companies exert substantial control over their stores by requiring placement of products in the most visible locations, and of specific amounts and types of advertising in prime locations in the store. Retailers also described how tobacco companies reduce prices by offering them volume based discounts, "buy two, get one free" specials, and "buying down" the price of existing product.

Conclusions

Tobacco companies are concentrating their marketing dollars at the point-of-sale to the extent that the store is their primary communication channel with customers. As a result, all shoppers regardless of age or smoking status are exposed to pro-smoking messages. Given the financial resources spent by tobacco companies in stores, this venue warrants closer scrutiny by researchers and tobacco control advocates.

### Embracing the non-traditional: alcohol advertising on tikTok [^de5eed25]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Alcohol companies are changing the way they market their products. Cross-border promotion and 'programmatic native advertising' that is data-driven and participatory is more common. This form of advertising is particularly attractive because it reflects the way alcohol companies are organised. As a globally consolidated industry that is dominated by a few large corporations using a form of promotion that is not limited to one region or context is efficient and convenient. The alcohol market is crowded and the way consumers access and drink alcohol has been influenced by the pandemic with a rise in at-home drinking and buying alcohol online. These factors result in a market that encourages companies to develop new and innovative ways to engage consumers. Social media presents such an opportunity, to the detriment of young people. Alcohol is a 'commodity of concern to public health'. Among 15–49-year-old people, 3·8% (95% UI 3·2% to 4·3%) of female deaths and 12·2% (10·8% to 13·6%) of male deaths were attributable to alcohol use globally in 2016. Studies have consistently shown that those who start drinking alcohol early are more likely to display hazardous drinking in later life. Marketing that targets young people is a particular concern because evidence indicates that exposure to alcohol marketing during youth is associated with an earlier onset of drinking. Marketing refers to 'any form of commercial communication or message that is designed to increase — or has the effect of increasing — the recognition, appeal and/or consumption of particular products and services. It comprises anything that acts to advertise or otherwise promote a product or service'.

### Can (dynamic) social norms encourage plant-based food purchases? a quasi-experimental study in real-world Dutch supermarkets [^51565358]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications and future research

Nudging-type interventions, as conducted in the present study, are generally considered cost-efficient and relatively low-effort to implement. A previous study in the Netherlands indicated that supermarket chains prefer these type of interventions as they are considered low-risk in terms of profit margins and market position. However, the findings of the present study, together with those of previous studies, underscore that these 'soft' interventions in supermarkets seem insufficient to move the needle on sustainable behaviour change, such as increasing meat substitute sales and decreasing meat product sales. Instead, there is a growing call for more structural interventions such as price promotions or combined intervention techniques. Supermarket interventions aimed at increasing healthy purchases using economic incentives (e.g. subsidies, taxes) seem to be most promising, specifically when combined with additional promotions. While carbon-tax on meat seem to be promising in terms of reducing green-house-gas emissions in simulation studies, it could be a potential fruitful direction for future research to investigate the impact of more structural interventions such as carbon-tax implemented over a longer period (i.e. 1 year or longer) to increase plant-based product purchases and decreased meat product purchases. Moreover, although (dynamic) social norm communications did not affect meat alternative and meat sales in the present study, it remains unknown to what extent the intervention was able to affect social norm perceptions of customers. For example, although Raghoebar and colleagues did not find an effect on hypothetical food choice when increasing the prominence of plant-based foods (opposed to animal-based), they did find an increase in descriptive norm perceptions. Future research could investigate the extent to which such (dynamic) social norm interventions in real-world supermarkets affects social norm perceptions.

### The effectiveness of public health advertisements to promote health: a randomized-controlled trial on 794, 000 participants [^56acb738]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on traditional public health advertisements annually. – In theory, public health advertising can save money and lives by encouraging behaviors that prevent disease before it happens. While the objective of advertising investments (e.g. encouraging people to quit smoking) differs from those of private advertisers (encouraging people to purchase a good or service), the central idea is the same: to change behaviors.

Before online advertising, it was only possible to empirically test public health campaigns by randomizing small numbers of participants and to examine a few outcome measures. This makes it difficult to test to whom different forms of advertisement are best targeted. –

Humans vary greatly with respect to both their biology and their beliefs. Medical researchers use predictive analytics to mine databases of genetic information in order to target treatments to individuals who are more likely to respond to them. Similarly, private advertisers use predictive analytics to mine multiple sources of sociodemographic and behavioral data to better target individual consumers with the goal of changing their behavior. However, precision public health interventions have largely sat on the sidelines both due to the large sums of money required for targeted advertising and due to ethical concerns.

### Strategic marketing: an introduction for medical specialists [^85c0a56d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Marketing and branding are 2 of the most important factors for business success in the United States. They are particularly critical in service industries such as diagnostic imaging. However, in spite of their strategic importance in radiology success, a search of the peer-reviewed radiology literature reveals a paucity of published work that addresses marketing for imaging practices. In particular, there is a dearth of literature addressing the role (both direct and indirect) of radiologists in marketing efforts. In this article, the authors attempt to identify and correct some common misconceptions that physicians and other scientific and technical professionals have about marketing. Basic terms and preliminary concepts are introduced to provide a foundational understanding of the topic, allowing the interested reader to move forward and explore these critical issues in greater depth.

### Tobacco companies' use of retailer incentives after a ban on point-of-sale tobacco displays in scotland [^a29ed262]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Incentives have been used by tobacco companies for many years to encourage retailers to sell and promote their products. However, few studies have examined the use of retailer incentives in countries with a ban on the open display of tobacco products in stores.

Methods

As part of the DISPLAY(Determining the Impact of Smoking Point of Sale Legislation Among Youth) study, annual qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 small retailers in four Scottish communities. This article focuses on data collected in June to July 2015 and June to July 2016 after a ban on the open display of tobacco was fully implemented in Scotland.

Results

Retailers described being offered and benefiting from a range of financial and other incentives, typically offered via tobacco company representatives ('reps'). Most of the retailers received tobacco manufacturer support for converting their storage unit to be compliant with the new regulations, and several participated in manufacturer 'loyalty' or 'reward' schemes. Incentives were additionally offered for maintaining stock levels and availability, positioning brands in specified spaces in the public-facing storage units (even though products were covered up), increasing sales, trialling new products and participating in specific promotions, such as verbally recommending specific brands to customers.

Conclusions

Even in a market where the open display of tobacco is prohibited, tobacco companies continue to incentivise retailers to sell and promote their brands and have developed new promotional strategies. For countries that have implemented tobacco display bans, or are considering doing so, one option to combat these practices would be to ban promotional communications between manufacturers and retailers.

### Marketing claims on the websites of leading e-cigarette brands in england [^b7435f95]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Claims relating to product characteristics

All brands featured positive claims about the quality of their products, mentioning the device's build, the manufacturing process and e-liquid ingredients. Six brands referred to the fire safety of their devices. Environmental sustainability claims (n = 7) ranged from prominent (eg, a dedicated sustainability page) to brief (eg, recycling icons). Some featured claims about being carbon neutral, and one website boasted a large green banner on its homepage, advertising the recycling of disposables, calling to 'Protect the Earth', and promising they would 'treat waste in a harmless manner'. Nine websites featured claims about customisability of EC products, including advertising devices with varying wattage for lighter or stronger vapour. Customisability also referred to aesthetic elements, for example, offering 'distinctive colors to match your style'. Indeed, colour was a widespread personalisation tool, with all but one website (n = 9) offering a range of colour options; engraving services were also offered on some websites.

Financial claims

All websites featured some form of vendor promotion, such as limited-time discounts, price reductions when buying multiple products and games with EC products as prizes. Five websites claimed that the EC products they sold were cheaper than tobacco products. One brand used the chance of winning EC products as an incentive to encourage users to share testimonials about their vaping experiences.

Social claims

Seven brands claimed that the use of their EC products could confer an increased ability to socialise. One subtype of social claims concerned reduced stigma compared with smoking. For instance, one website included testimonials of users saying they did not feel stigmatised when using ECs, and another claimed that users would have more professional success once they stopped 'smelling like an ashtray'. There was significant overlap between these claims and those advertising the lack of harmful or bothersome secondhand smoke from ECs compared with combustible tobacco (n = 7). A second subtype of social claims concerned social benefits, focusing on using ECs to connect with a new community and develop a social identity as a vaper. For instance, one brand launched a social platform to 'make friends with other vapers all over the world'. Similarly, seven brands directly related product characteristics to personal identity.

### Marketing strategies for vascular practitioners [^a4a67595]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A common misconception is that marketing is synonymous with advertising. Marketing by physicians has undergone a transformation from the earlier unacceptable slick sales pitches to a more common sense, tasteful, comprehensive, and well thought out plan to reach potential patients.

Methods and Results

Marketing is a much broader concept comprising four aspects: product, price, promotion, and place. Marketing activities for a medical practice include not only external but internal tactics. Publicly available resources are available to assist physicians in developing and targeting the plan towards a narrow patient demographic. The marketing process includes: determining objectives, identifying resources, defining target population, honing a message, outlining a media plan, implementing the plan, and finally, evaluating the success or failure of the marketing campaign.

Conclusion

A basic knowledge of marketing combined with a common sense approach can yield dividends for those practices that need the service. For surgical practices that exist in heavily populated urban areas with significant competition, a well thought out marketing plan can assist the practice in reaching out to new groups of patients and maintaining the existing patient base.

### Data visualisation to support obesity policy: case studies of data tools for planning and transport policy in the UK [^7b667ad7]. International Journal of Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying the customer and/or policy application

Research and data of interest to researchers are not necessarily of use to policymakers and practitioners for developing policy or guiding planning decisions. Likewise, data visualisation tools need to include capability that allows these users to answer their own questions of interest — not those of the researchers. This might include, for example, allowing users to manipulate real-world parameters, not just apply fixed hypothetical models. As the Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department of Health and Social Care has observed: 'Models should, wherever possible, allow policymakers to vary assumptions'. A good understanding of the 'market' at which the tool is aimed is therefore necessary — and can be challenging to accurately establish without close existing links to policy customers. It does not follow that there must be a specific demand for the product itself, as the novelty of any tool is likely to be part of its appeal. But the tool should be aimed at a clear user-need that is not being met by current tools and data. Market demand can then be further pinpointed by early release and testing of a minimum viable product. This phase can also help align expectations between users and developers, and attract new potential users not previously identified.

Establishing a strategy for effective dissemination

As with market research, dissemination is likely to be more effective if the marketing of these tools is part of a wider strategy of stakeholder engagement, which will have already opened up lines of communication between researchers and key users. The PCT and Feat both benefited, to different extents, from the existing dissemination methods and customer networks of their host organisations. A range of stakeholder engagement approaches are needed across social media, news media and interpersonal opportunities (face-to-face meetings, conference and policy forum presentations etc.). Dissemination is also an opportunity to spend social capital that has been built in earlier stakeholder engagement: requests for third-party endorsements, onward promotion by partner organisations and so on.

### Pricing health behavior interventions to promote adoption: lessons from the marketing and business literature [^7be01f08]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The relatively high cost of delivering many public health interventions limits their potential for broad public impact by reducing their likelihood of adoption and maintenance over time. Practitioners identify cost as the primary factor for which interventions they select to implement, but researchers rarely disseminate cost information or consider its importance when developing new interventions. A new approach is proposed whereby intervention developers assess what individuals and agencies adopting their interventions are willing to pay and then design interventions that are responsive to this price range. The ultimate goal is to develop effective and affordable interventions, called lean interventions, which are widely adopted and have greater public health impact.

### How the industry is marketing menthol cigarettes: the audience, the message and the medium [^77f5f7ab]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite declines in overall US cigarette consumption, the menthol cigarette market share has increased in recent years. Advertising contributes to menthol initiation and use, but little has been done to characterise menthol cigarette advertising outside of the point of sale.

Methods

Two full-service advertising firms were used to develop a library of menthol cigarette advertisements (ads) over a 9-month period (June 2012-February 2013) in the USA. The volume of ads, media channel (direct mail, print, online, email), estimated spend and households reached was summarised overall and by brand in 2013. Direct mail, email and print ads were coded for content and the target audience of print publications was examined.

Results

Over the study period, 205 menthol cigarette ads were identified with estimated expenditures exceeding US$31 million, with 70% spent on direct mail ads. Over 90% of ads promoted Camel, Marlboro and Newport menthol cigarettes. A majority (87%) of direct mail ads contained coupons or other incentives known to appeal to price-sensitive customers. Only two brands' print ads appeared during this period: Newport ads focused on themes of sociability and sexuality, and were placed in magazines targeting African-Americans and younger consumers; American Spirit print ads were placed in general interest magazines and predominantly stressed the 'natural' aspects of their brand.

Discussion

The tobacco industry continues to spend millions of dollars promoting menthol cigarettes through channels that preferentially target vulnerable subgroups, such as African-Americans and younger consumers. Public health campaigns to educate and combat the influence of menthol advertising are needed.

### "Gone are the days of mass-media marketing plans and short term customer relationships": tobacco industry direct mail and database marketing strategies [^00ffc18d]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

As limitations on traditional marketing tactics and scrutiny by tobacco control have increased, the tobacco industry has benefited from direct mail marketing which transmits marketing messages directly to carefully targeted consumers utilising extensive custom consumer databases. However, research in these areas has been limited. This is the first study to examine the development, purposes and extent of direct mail and customer databases.

Methods

We examined direct mail and database marketing by RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris utilising internal tobacco industry documents from the Legacy Tobacco Document Library employing standard document research techniques.

Results

Direct mail marketing utilising industry databases began in the 1970s and grew from the need for a promotional strategy to deal with declining smoking rates, growing numbers of products and a cluttered media landscape. Both RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris started with existing commercial consumer mailing lists, but subsequently decided to build their own databases of smokers' names, addresses, brand preferences, purchase patterns, interests and activities. By the mid-1990s both RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris databases contained at least 30 million smokers' names each. These companies valued direct mail/database marketing's flexibility, efficiency and unique ability to deliver specific messages to particular groups as well as direct mail's limited visibility to tobacco control, public health and regulators.

Conclusions

Database marketing is an important and increasingly sophisticated tobacco marketing strategy. Additional research is needed on the prevalence of receipt and exposure to direct mail items and their influence on receivers' perceptions and smoking behaviours.

### Follow the money: a closer look at US tobacco industry marketing expenditures [^2d007d56]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We collected marketing expenditure data from the 2019 FTC Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Reports. The FTC compels major tobacco companies to report annual expenditures on US marketing, thus the data do not include foreign expenditures. In 2019, cigarette firms included Altria, ITG Holdings USA, Reynolds American and the Vector Group, and smokeless tobacco firms included Altria, North Atlantic Trading, Reynolds American, Swedish Match and Swisher. Other major companies (eg, Lorillard which was later acquired by Reynolds American) were included in earlier years. Marketing expenditure data are provided at the industry level from 1975 to 2019 for cigarettes and 1985–2019 for smokeless tobacco.

For both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, we categorise marketing expenditures into three groups: direct advertising, promotional allowances and price discounts. Direct advertising includes traditional forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, billboards and (retail) point of sale, as well as direct mail, company website, internet, telephone, social media endorsements and other advertising and merchandising. Price discounting payments include coupons, sampling distribution (eg, free samples) and direct price discounts to cigarette retailers or wholesalers to reduce the price to consumers, including off-invoice discounts for selling a minimum quantity of a given product over a specified time period, buydowns (the dealer receives a per-unit payment for agreeing to sell certain units at a discounted price), voluntary price reductions and trade programmes. Promotional allowances include direct promotional allowances paid to retailers and wholesalers to facilitate the sale or placement of a brand, including volume rebates, incentive payments, promotional execution and satisfaction of reporting requirements, value-added services or incentives (including quantity promotions, such as 'buy two packs, get one free') and non-tobacco specialty products which may be bundled with purchased cigarettes. Many of these payments effectively reduce product prices (eg, by providing customers with multipack discounts, providing non-tobacco items or by creating incentives for targeted retailers to obtain volume rebates by reducing the price to increase sales). More detailed definitions of each expenditure type are provided in online supplemental file 2.

### Household air pollution interventions to improve health in low-and middle-income countries: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^c398b2d6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Household energy programs will almost always require the involvement of both the public and private sectors to achieve scale and sustainability. Historically, many energy access programs have been government driven, including design of the solutions to be provided to households, heavy subsidies (up to 100%), and centralized procurements. Although this approach can sometimes reach large numbers of households, public sector agencies often face challenges in being responsive to market and consumer demand. This can lead to products that do not meet end-user needs, poor service for the products provided, and a lack of innovation in products and business models. All of this can undermine the sustainability of public sector programs that do not work through private sector partners.

The private sector is usually better positioned to serve as the delivery arm of a program, interacting directly with households. Private companies are generally more innovative, allowing them to respond to consumer needs and offer a range of products appropriate to the market. They also have an incentive to provide good service to customers, especially when payments are linked to the performance of the products provided. At the same time, the public sector is crucial to achieving the goals of household energy programs, that is, of reaching the entire underserved population. The public sector establishes policies and adopts standards that protect the quality and safety of consumers and can create a favorable environment for businesses to thrive (e.g. through import waivers or other tax incentives, clear and predictable regulations, and appropriate standards). The public sector can also employ targeted subsidies or related policy tools to incentivize companies to reach the poorest and most remote populations, which they would normally not reach through pure commercial approaches.
Consensus Statement 11: Barriers to translating research findings into decisions on policy and scale-up include the format in which academic research is communicated. Academic papers are not the optimal way to communicate with decision makers or practitioners responsible for scale-up of clean energy programs.

### Catalyzing community action within a national campaign: VERB community and national partnerships [^1b31f774]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The VERB campaign used a social marketing approach to deliver its message through the mass media, school and community promotions, and partnerships to encourage children aged 9–13 years (tweens) to be physically active every day. This paper presents the VERB campaign's community and national partnership strategy, highlights three successful partnerships, and discusses challenges associated with the efforts. The national advertising generated awareness of and affinity for the product's brand and motivated the primary audience to seek out the product. The campaign's national and community partners were engaged to facilitate a product-distribution channel. The campaign developed a three-pronged partnership strategy to integrate the promotion with the placement of the campaign's product (physical activity): (1) reframe the way physical activity is positioned and delivered; (2) connect the brand to the point-of-purchase; and (3) refer (or drive) the audience to the action outlets, opportunities, places, spaces and programs to purchase the product. The VERB campaign provided partners with marketing training and resources to assist them as they leveraged tweens' brand awareness and supported regular physical activity among tweens. The method of technical assistance and the types of marketing tools were provided in relationship to four characteristics of the partner: (1) partner's network, (2) leaders and champions in the network, (3) partner's financial resources for community campaigns; and (4) partner's understanding of the marketing mindset. Coordinated, collaborative, and strong mass-media and community-based interventions within a national social marketing campaign can sustain the immediate effects of such campaigns.

### Cigarette stick as valuable communicative real estate: a content analysis of cigarettes from 14 low-income and middle-income countries [^d1942e4b]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The current cigarette market is heavily focused on low-income and middle-income countries. Branding of tobacco products is key to establishing and maintaining a customer base. Greater restrictions on marketing and advertising of tobacco products create an incentive for companies to focus more on branding via the product itself. We consider how tobacco sticks are used for communicative purposes in 14 low-income and middle-income countries with extensive tobacco markets.

Methods

In 2013, we collected and coded 3232 cigarette and kretek packs that were purchased from vendors in diverse neighbourhoods in 44 cities across the 14 low-income and middle-income countries with the greatest number of smokers. A single stick from each pack was assessed for branding, decorative and communicative elements using a common coding framework. Stick communication variables included brand name, brand image/logo, brand descriptor, colour and design carried through from pack, 'capsule cigarette' symbol, and embellishment of filter end.

Results

Communication and branding on the stick is essentially ubiquitous (99.75%); 97% of sticks include explicit branding (brand name or logo present). Colour is commonly carried through from the pack (95%), and some sticks (13%) include decorative elements matching the pack. Decorative elements can be found anywhere on the stick, including the filter tip (8%), and 'convertible' cigarettes include a symbol to show where to push.

Conclusions

Cigarette sticks are clearly valuable 'real estate' that tobacco companies are using for communicative purposes. Across all countries and brands, the stick communicates branding via text, colour and imagery.

### Nutrient-based warning labels may help in the pursuit of healthy diets [^44f984dd]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

In this commentary we argue that the newest paradigm of front-of-package labels, represented by the characteristics found in the Chilean warning label, has the greatest potential to promote healthy diets compared with the Keyhole symbol, the multiple traffic light label, the Health Star Ratings system, and the 5-Color Nutrition label. Warning labels: (1) are consistent in the information they communicate; (2) discourage the purchase and consumption of noncore foods that characterize unhealthy diets; (3) are more likely to reinforce other regulatory measures; and (4) are more likely to encourage reformulation and are less likely to be used as a marketing tool by the food industry. Ongoing empirical evaluation of the impact of warning labels on consumer behavior and product reformulation is essential.

### Committee opinion no. 709: commercial enterprises in medical practice [^59d0e8e5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — Commercial enterprises in medical practice — issues practice recommendations that apply across sales channels for obstetrician–gynecologists. On the basis of the principles outlined in this Committee Opinion, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) provides the following recommendations, which apply regardless of whether sales or promotions are conducted in person, by telephone, online, or by written solicitation: Obstetrician–gynecologists should not sell or promote agents or devices as being therapeutic without an adequate evidence base for medical benefit. Obstetrician–gynecologists should not use their professional influence or clinical environment to sell or promote nonmedical products or services or to enroll participants into multilevel marketing schemes. The sale of prescription or nonprescription medication or devices directly to patients from obstetrician–gynecologists' offices is discouraged when reasonably convenient, alternative vendors exist. Obstetrician–gynecologists should be aware that referral of patients to medical facilities in which they or their immediate family have a direct financial stake may create a conflict of interest. Self-referral should be approached with caution and with knowledge of applicable regulations.

### The sharing economy promotes sustainable societies [^5585eff1]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Framework for sustainable model of sharing economy. The framework involves four participants, including governments, enterprises, owners and users. Governments identify the most pro-social sharing models and support service providers through both economic and noneconomic incentives. Enterprises estimate the environmental impacts of sharing activities from life-cycle perspectives and provide sustainable information and options to consumers. Owners and users of shared products make sustainability a key factor in selecting sharing service providers

Secondly, sharing enterprises must set the sustainability of sharing models as an objective rather than its use as a marketing tool. They should commit to continuous development of shared goods so that they can meet the standards set by the government regarding LCA and can obtain or maintain eligibility for incentives. The aim of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental impacts of the shared products and services, and this information is useful to improve efficiency and support policy. The tax system on sharing activities should to be improved, as tax evasion is very common in sharing economy. Governments should make it a priority to use the tax collected from sharing activities to promote sustainability, by providing incentives to sharing enterprises and sustainability advocates to consumers.

Thirdly, as well as governments and enterprises, consumers — owners and users of shared products — play a critical role in the sustainability of sharing economy, as they are the most essential participants in the sharing economy. Enterprises need to provide sustainable information and options to consumers, and governments need to encourage consumers to select more sustainable goods and services. Successful strategies for incentivising enterprises and nudging consumers will depend on cultural contexts, but can include tax breaks to firms to encourage compliance and partnerships with health, life and auto insurance companies to encourage participation in appropriate bike or ride sharing schemes by offering premium reductions for behaviour that improves health, for example, or reduces congestion (and thus risk of collision). Consumers need to enhance their environmental awareness and make sustainability a key factor in selecting sharing service providers and in voting for politicians who are prepared to demand corporate social responsibility from the sharing economy.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^348009b3]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Promotion through research — post-approval marketing via seeding trials and publications strategy is described; these publications have become known as seeding trials and their purpose is often not to advance science but to influence potential prescribers or users, termed marketing in the guise of science, with the intent to familiarize health care clinicians with company products, encourage use over a competing product or generic version, and suggest new applications not covered by current approval and that the company cannot legally advertise. Not uncommonly, companies follow a publications strategy to design and fund several trials to explore off-label uses, and these trials may aim to influence opinion leaders selected as authors, with opportunities frequently accompanied by salary support or payments and additional paid speaking and consulting opportunities.

### What works for whom in pharmacist-led smoking cessation support: realist review [^a116009e]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In turbulent times, the ability to adapt rapidly and appropriately to external policy changes is key to the survival of a pharmacy as a business. A qualitative interview study from Australia sought to identify the capacity of current pharmacy business models, and in particular the dimensions of organisational flexibility within these models, to integrate both the traditional product (medicines) focus and the new extended role (services) of pharmacists (limited evidence). The authors identified four kinds of organisational flexibility from the business and management literature:
Steady-state (limited flexibility, centred on the status quo, resistant to any change);
Operational flexibility (able to react to short-term market demands but incapable of making significant structural or strategic changes);
Structural flexibility (able to use managerial capabilities to alter a firm's structure to respond to internal and external pressures, hence can embrace medium-term change);
Strategic flexibility (able to engage proactively and strategically to accommodate change and embrace opportunities, hence can embrace long-term change).

The authors found four types of community pharmacy in their (Australian) setting: the traditional, small dispensing pharmacy that offers few additional services and representing the steady-state; larger retail pharmacies with higher throughput of goods and typically exhibiting operational flexibility to increase and vary the product range in retail sales; the 'healthcare solution pharmacy' (based on creating a professional image as healthcare providers and the provision of services, and perhaps offering niche services from specialist employees); and the networked pharmacy (two or three pharmacies connected through a shared ownership structure) – different pharmacies offer different products and services based on reaching critical mass (or economies of scale) and position themselves effectively to the local competition. Both healthcare solution pharmacies and networked pharmacies tend to exhibit either structural flexibility (i.e. they develop services in a few key areas and change structure to implement these) or strategic flexibility (i.e. they pro-actively plan and integrate new services into the brand image of the pharmacy and support these through development of internal systems, staff and practices). Strategic questions include skill mix, the structural and material environment of the pharmacy, return on investment, and marketing and communication activity. Importantly, the emergence and adoption of new business models in existing and new pharmacies in the local environment stimulates a shift in the business model of neighbouring pharmacies since competition promotes service development (moderate direct evidence).

### Tobacco promotion restriction policies on social media [^15197cf3]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Need for comprehensive tobacco marketing restrictions on social media

Prioritising tobacco marketing restrictions and enforcement of these restrictions on social media is crucial because unlike the traditional one-way media (eg, television, radio, newspaper), social media offers the tobacco industry a powerful interactive tool to appeal to younger generations of customers, including never users, and to renormalise tobacco use by associating it with youth culture. Indeed, the heavy presence of tobacco marketing on various social media platforms has been well-documented. These tobacco promotional activities represent a significant public health concern because of the popularity of social media use among youth. Further, exposure to tobacco marketing on social media is associated with subsequent use of tobacco products among youthand young adults.

Despite the variety of tobacco promotion that is occurring on social media, FDA's current restrictions on tobacco marketing (ie, requiring health warnings, prohibiting the sale and distribution of products with unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco product health claims or false or misleading claims on labelling or advertising and prohibiting the distribution of free samples) do not apply to all forms of tobacco promotion. Nevertheless, the FDA's recent directives seem to extend to influencer marketing. In 2019, the FDA and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission jointly issued warning letters to four companies who were using social media influencers to market e-liquids for failure to include nicotine warning labels in their efforts to prevent youth tobacco use, particularly e-cigarette use. In 2018, the WHO established a working group to 'develop specific guidelines to address the depiction of tobacco in the entertainment media taking account of technological advances such as the Internet and mobile communications'. This group concluded that the original provisions of the 2003 FCTC adequately cover social media promotion of tobacco products and acknowledged the need to address cross-border tobacco promotions on digital media.

### Developing a systematic approach for the implementation of medical extended reality learning modules in cardiothoracic health care: recommendations from an international expert group [^0685cb47]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Customer segments

The target group(s) should be defined. Note that in the medical setting the term customer might be a different party than the end user. A user is typically the person (of group of professionals) that is actively using the XR solution (eg, trainee) while the customer is the institution (eg, department within the hospital of faculty) that is purchasing the XR solution. This should be taken into consideration when defining the target group. The following 2 questions need to be answered: For which users are you creating this XR tool? Who are the most important customers of this XR tool? Identify customers segment(s) taking into account the following aspects:
1 The need of a customer segment can be different and might require a distinct solution
2 A dedicated segment-specific distribution channel is required to reach each separate segment
3 A diverse relationship is required for each segment
4 Profitability is different for each segment
5 Willingness-to-pay: Distinct market segments may possess divergent factors influencing their purchasing decisions

Examples of customer segments for an XR tool in health care are health care professionals (physicians, nurses, allied health care workers), patients, trainees (students, postgraduate trainees) and trainers, policymakers (managers, department heads, institutional legal department, (inter)national professional societies).

Value propositions

The specific value (deliverables) of XR tool to each user segment should be defined using the following questions:
1 Why should this customer group try this XR tool?
2 Which value do you deliver to this specific customer group?
3 Which needs and problems of this specific customer group are addressed by the XR tool?
4 What are the services and (XR) products that you deliver for this specific group?

Channels

The goal here is to identify various communication channels to engage with the users effectively. Determine the most efficient methods for achieving several key goals: raising awareness of your XR tool and services, distributing your XR tool to users, offering customer support, facilitating the purchase of your XR tool, and gathering feedback on your XR product and services. The main questions to be answered here are:
1 What are the users' preferred communication channels for engagement?
2 What are the current primary communication channels for your users? Which ones are you using now?
3 Which channels are most effective in reaching your users?
4 Which channels are cost-effective?
5 How do you integrate the different channels with each other and how do you fit those to your users' daily practice?

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^0a89e45f]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Industry payments and prescribing behavior — health care clinicians represent a target audience for industry marketing efforts, and physicians who receive payments for services rendered to the industry tend to prescribe more brand-name drugs than do their colleagues who do not receive such payments. Health care clinicians have an ethical duty to recognize the situations and marketing strategies that are designed to influence their choice of therapeutic options for their patients, and at a minimum, health care clinicians should be aware of the methods used to attempt to affect their behavior and develop strategies to address them.

### Market pathways to food systems transformation toward healthy and equitable diets through convergent innovation [^18a5b223]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Onset and development of Consumer Consideration of alternative product categories — irrespective of attractiveness of available options — requires consumer awareness, familiarity, and knowledge. Through social exposure and other influence processes, consumers form collective expectations of common product dimensions. As new products become increasingly similar and recognizable, categorical prototypes emerge (refs.; Fig. 1, "Category Exposure" flowing the "Category Consideration" stock). Social influence from peers occurs through direct observation of others' behavior, information exchange, or transmission of social norms, and is amplified through media attentionand habituation and sensitization. Thus, social influence about a product category grows with its consumption (Fig. 1, link from "Category Consumption" to "Social Pressure and Habituation"), closing a positive feedback loop (Fig. 1, loop R2a, "Consideration (Social Influence)"). Producers (and others) strengthen this process by educating consumers and shaping their understanding of or attention to new categories. As firms dedicate available resources to product advertisement, on-product label claims, product promotions, and product size assortments, depending on their assessment of returns, compared to those for R&D investments and for other product categories, this forms another positive feedback loop (Fig. 1, loop R2b, "Consideration (Marketing)").

### Personal genomics services: whose genomes? [^29f74824]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

New companies offering personal whole-genome information services over the internet are dynamic and highly visible players in the personal genomics field. For fees currently ranging from US$399 to US$2500 and a vial of saliva, individuals can now purchase online access to their individual genetic information regarding susceptibility to a range of chronic diseases and phenotypic traits based on a genome-wide SNP scan. Most of the companies offering such services are based in the United States, but their clients may come from nearly anywhere in the world. Although the scientific validity, clinical utility and potential future implications of such services are being hotly debated, several ethical and regulatory questions related to direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing strategies of genetic tests have not yet received sufficient attention. For example, how can we minimize the risk of unauthorized third parties from submitting other people's DNA for testing? Another pressing question concerns the ownership of (genotypic and phenotypic) information, as well as the unclear legal status of customers regarding their own personal information. Current legislation in the US and Europe falls short of providing clear answers to these questions. Until the regulation of personal genomics services catches up with the technology, we call upon commercial providers to self-regulate and coordinate their activities to minimize potential risks to individual privacy. We also point out some specific steps, along the trustee model, that providers of DTC personal genomics services as well as regulators and policy makers could consider for addressing some of the concerns raised below.

### User-informed marketing versus standard description to drive demand for evidence-based therapy: a randomized controlled trial [^e6622acf]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing represents a vital strategy to disseminate evidence-based therapies (EBTs). This 3-phase research program, informed by the marketing mix, developed and evaluated user-informed DTC materials for parents concerned about adolescent substance use (SU). Phases 1 and 2 consisted of qualitative interviews (n = 29 parents) and a quantitative survey (n = 411), respectively, to elicit parents' preferred terms and strategies to disseminate EBT. Building upon prior phases, the current study (Phase 3) developed a user-informed infographic (128 words, 7th-grade level) focused on SU therapy. Parents were randomly assigned to view the user-informed infographic (n = 75) or a standard EBT description (n = 77) from the American Psychological Association (529 words, 12th-grade level). Logistic regressions examined the effect of marketing condition on parent-reported behavioral intentions and actual requests for EBT information, controlling for correlates of parent preferences in Phase 2 (parent education level; adolescent internalizing, externalizing, legal, and SU problems). Counter to hypotheses, condition did not have a main effect on either outcome. However, there was a significant interaction between condition and adolescent SU problems: among parents whose adolescents had SU problems, the user-informed infographic predicted 3.7 times higher odds of requesting EBT information than the standard description. Additionally, parents whose adolescents had legal problems were more likely to request EBT information than parents whose adolescents did not. The infographic was 4 times shorter and written at 5 grade levels lower, thereby providing a highly disseminable alternative. Findings highlight the value of specificity in DTC marketing, while advancing methods to create tailored marketing materials and communicate knowledge about psychological science.

### Tobacco marketing in California and implications for the future [^f6cdd79d]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Retail environment

Retail outlets are an important environment for tobacco companies to promote their products, segment the market and target groups they might lose such as those thinking about quitting or who have recently quit. In-store marketing strategies to achieve these goals include point-of-sale advertising, payments for prime product placement and a variety of price discounting tools. Numerous studies document the influence of point-of-purchase tobacco marketing and price promotions on smoking initiation, movement along the smoking continuum to a regular smoker and undermining of quit efforts.

In 2006, point-of-sale advertising led traditional tobacco advertising expenditures among cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies at approximately $243 million for cigarette companies and $21 million for smokeless tobacco companies. However, price-related marketing strategies dominated marketing expenditures of both cigarette and tobacco companies in 2006. Price promotions are frequently linked to contractual agreements between the tobacco companies and retailers to offer volume discounts and financial incentives to secure product placement and marketing materials where they will be noticed by consumers.

The trend towards price-related marketing relative to expenditures for image-oriented cigarette advertising began in the late 1980s. Following the 1998 MSA which banned tobacco billboard advertising and placed restrictions on other forms of traditional advertising and promotions, this trend was accelerated. In 2006, cigarette companies allocated 93% ($11.5 billion) of all their advertising and promotions expenditures toward price-related strategies (promotional allowances, coupons, retail value added and price discounts) and smokeless tobacco companies spent 69% ($246 million) of all their advertising and promotion expenditures on these categories.

### Tobacco companies' creation of additional communication space: a content analysis of cigarette pack inserts and onserts [^5008ef21]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pack inserts and onserts-removable items placed inside or on the outside of packs-are a communicative strategy used by tobacco companies that provide them with additional marketing space. A content analysis of these items was conducted across several years, countries and brands to assess how these items are used to communicate with consumers.

Methods

Between 2013 and 2020, cigarette packs were systematically collected using the Tobacco Pack Surveillance System protocol. Packs with inserts or onserts (n = 178) were identified from 11 low and middle-income countries. Packs were coded for tobacco company strategies, physical pack characteristics and imagery and lexical marketing appeals.

Results

Of the 5903 packs, 3% (n = 178) had an insert or onsert. 171 of these (96%) were inserts. While most (78%) pack exteriors were entirely in English, over half (51%) of the inserts/onserts were entirely in the local (non-English) language from where the pack was collected. The most common appeals on the inserts/onserts were product dependability (64%), luxury/aspirational (55%) and machinery/technology (37%). Product images were prevalent as well as images or words mentioning filters (22%). The most used appeals involved featuring aspects of a product (66%), addressing customers directly (52%) and informing customers about new aspects of a product (31%).

Conclusions

Cigarette pack inserts/onserts are unregulated in many countries and provide additional space for tobacco companies to extend and innovate their advertising. Tobacco advertising and packaging policies such as plain and standardised packaging should expand to address inserts/onserts to protect consumers more fully from industry promotion of deadly products.

### Delivering maternal and child health interventions through the private sector in LMIC: a scoping review of strategies and effective approaches [^f644e772]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

The importance of data for understanding the private sector, its users (patients) and suppliers (providers) as well as the contextual and regulatory environment in which they operate cannot be over emphasised. Data allow policymakers to understand the private health sector, its contribution to national health goals and opportunities for better collaboration. Information exchange between the providers and regulators is, therefore, a key requirement for effective engagement. Additionally, provision of information to communities in order to empower them to make correct health choices and purchase quality health products is important. This has been done extensively through commodity social marketing (eg, for purchase of bed nets or condoms), which is the most common approach that has been used to engage private providers to sell quality products. Details of all these strategies are provided further below.

As in figure 2, engagement with private healthcare providers for effective service delivery should be undertaken at all the system levels including the macrolevel, meso and microlevels. At the macro (national) where policy development and decisions are made, these policy guidelines should be developed in collaboration with private providers and an attempt should be made to include the diverse groups of private health providers through the intermediary organisations that they subscribe to (NGOs, FBOs, Franchise organisations etc); or through their direct representatives, for example, health professional bodies. Clear mechanisms for dialogue between the providers, regulators and decision-makers are important.

At the meso (regional and district) level, it is important to again involve the private providers in the decision-making and particularly negotiation and ownership and implementation of contracts and other financial tools that are available in the system. At the individual or microlevel, various options are available for influencing the provider behaviour and service quality. These include strict enforcement of regulatory tools, for example, licensing and accreditation of providers, as well as training and support supervision.

Contracting out

Contracting out is a purchasing mechanism used to acquire specified services, of defined quality, at an agreed price, from a specific private provider and for a specific period of time. Governments may purchase clinical or non-clinical services from private providers to complement public provision. Contracting out has been shown to be effective at increasing access and use of health services, and in reducing out of pocket health expenditure in conflict or fragile states as well as in stable environments. Contracting out is no better or no worse than government health-provided services. See online supplemental table 1 for more detailed information based on the studies on contracting out.

### Future practice risks: obstacles with opportunities [^df37d7a6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

The encouragement of a consumer-directed insurance market and the involvement of corporate America have led to a transformation of the healthcare system that will redefine patient expectations and the role of the physician. The expectation of a higher level of customer service, the role of electronic media, and an earnest regard for healthcare by the patient will impact the physician. Consumer-directed healthcare will call for a reprioritization, focusing on service, convenience, competency, quality, and low cost. Indifference to patient courtesies or failure to become involved in modern technology may cause the physician to be bypassed from this new healthcare system. As the business world integrates the business model into the medical profession, healthcare organizations will restructure themselves into well-organized business enterprises employing physicians. The singular physician may no longer be competitive with such business enterprises, leading to consolidation of organizations and a significant decision for the physician. The physician will have the unusual opportunity to either remain exclusively a medical professional or to also venture into the business world as an equity investor, participating in financial growth possibilities of those medical practice organizations that are for-profit. With the emergence of these new equity models of healthcare, the primary focus will be on profit, production, and service efficiencies. It is the responsibility of the physician to maintain professionalism and the commitment to quality and appropriateness of patient care. However, at the same time, the physician has the unique opportunity to participate in the distribution, economics, and subsequent financial profit of healthcare. The medical experience of the physician, coupled with business acumen, will be an unbeatable combination.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^d78688ab]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry — decision making relies on dual systems (socioemotional and cognitive control), and effective marketing strategies that use incentives, gifts, and relationships are designed to engage the socioemotional decision-making areas of the brain. The giving of a gift and its effect on behavior is mediated at an unconscious level through the socioemotional system, and accepting a gift triggers a feeling of obligation to continue the relationship and to reciprocate, even if only with time and attention. These feelings of indebtedness may ultimately lead to changes in prescribing behavior, and the subconscious nature of this bias makes it particularly effective. Although most health care clinicians believe they cannot be bribed and would never trade a small gift for changing their prescribing behavior, the power of reciprocity is well documented and is not related to the size of the gift. Industry detailers are careful to provide gifts without making receivers feel asked for anything in return, often using minimal value items or those not initially perceived as gifts (for example, grants and consultation and speaking opportunities), and although not attached to an explicit expectation of return, the general sense of reciprocation is sufficient to accomplish a marketing goal. Gifts can take many forms, including research grants, free CME opportunities, travel opportunities, and stipends for consulting and speaking, and even drug samples represent a gift to health care clinicians.

### E-cigarettes: how can they help smokers quit without addicting a new generation? [^6001b760]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The dramatic increase in youth use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; e.g., e-cigarettes) in the United States has focused regulatory efforts to address this concern while still encouraging smokers to switch completely to lower risk products or quit all tobacco product use. Increases in the minimum age for purchase of all tobacco products and changes in enforcement policy for ENDS have been recently enacted in an effort to address the youth vaping epidemic. Since all ENDS marketed after February 15, 2007 will be required to meet the "appropriate for the protection of public health" standard for marketing authorization of new products, ENDS manufacturers will have to demonstrate, in part, that their products help lessen the adverse impact on youth use. Some, such as disallowing flavors other than tobacco or menthol or limiting nicotine delivery, may help reduce youth use but could also inhibit smokers from quitting smoking. Other approaches, including reducing the high-tech appearance and discreteness of ENDS, discontinuing use of coupons and two-for-one type price incentives for ENDS, limiting retail sales of these products to adult-only facilities, and incorporating technological innovations such as biometrics or geofencing into ENDS, may help manufacturers demonstrate that marketing of their products would help reduce youth use of ENDS and lessen the epidemic, while still assuring adult smokers have access to products that encourage discontinuing combusted product use.

Institute of Medicine regulatory principles — pre-market data, testing, approval, and communication: Manufacturers of tobacco products, whether conventional or modified, should be required to obtain quantitative analytical data on ingredients and to disclose such information to the regulatory agency; all tobacco products should be assessed for yields of nicotine and other tobacco toxicants and, when necessary to support claims, human exposure should be assessed using appropriate biomarkers, and accurate information regarding yield range and human exposure should be communicated to consumers in terms that are understandable and not misleading; manufacturers of all Potential Reduced-Exposure Products (PREPs) should be required to conduct appropriate toxicological testing in preclinical laboratory and animal models as well as appropriate clinical testing in humans and to disclose the results to the regulatory agency; exposure- or risk-reduction claims should be permitted only after prior agency approval based on scientific evidence that the product substantially reduces exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants and, if a risk reduction claim is made, that the product can reasonably be expected to reduce risk compared with the benchmark stated in labeling, with the substantial reduction large enough that measurable reduction in morbidity and/or mortality would be anticipated as judged by independent scientific experts; labeling, advertising, and promotion with such claims must be carefully regulated under a not false or misleading standard with the burden of proof on the manufacturer, and the agency should have the authority and resources to conduct its own surveys of consumer perceptions; the regulatory agency should be empowered to require post-marketing surveillance and epidemiological studies to determine short-term behavioral and long-term health consequences and to permit continuing review of claim accuracy.

### Heated tobacco products: another tobacco industry global strategy to slow progress in tobacco control [^88f4821c]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

As discussed below, these strategies echo the tobacco industry's decades-long efforts to undermine tobacco control and present itself as an 'indispensable' partner in all policy discussions.

The 2014 presentation by PMI titled 'Reduced Risk Products Briefing'released by Reuters(figure 1) described how PMI planned to invoke the tobacco industry's usual tools to influence the scientific and policy debate around tobacco control: funding of science, global media and public relations campaigns, use of consultants and support for individuals and groups that it perceives as adequate spokespeople for the company's message.

Figure 1
PMI's tools to expand access to markets for its alleged reduced risk products (Slide 22 of a 125 slide presentation titled 'Reduced Risk Products Briefing') released by Reutersas part of a series of reports on PMI activities. PMI, Philip Morris International.

PMI released a full-page advertisement in newspapers on 2 January 2018 in the UK claiming that PMI was 'trying to give up cigarettes'. In the ad, PMI explicitly expressed a desire to partner with local and national governmental authorities to support cessation services, including seeking 'governmental; approval to insert, directly into our cigarette packs, information on quitting and on switching'. The advertisement did not mention HTP directly, but did pledge to 'expand the availability of new, alternative products in the UK'.PMI also launched a website, nominally to communicate with smokers about quitting regular cigarettes called 'smoke-free future' (only available for consumers in the UK as of April 2018). PMI's communications surrounding HTP emphasised the company's nominal goal of a smoke free future, which is similar to the name of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World PMI created and funded in 2017.

Industry detailing and persuasion — Information provided by industry detailers may be biased and framed to cast a favorable light on the marketed product. Industry detailers are carefully trained to present medical information and even characterize clinician objections to support their "pitch", turning concerns into reasons the product should be preferred over others; persuasion and sales methods proven to change behavior are used, and health care clinicians are no less susceptible to these techniques than anyone else.

Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements, 2022

These Guidelines were introduced in June 2022 by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, in the exercise of powers conferred by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (35 of 2019). These guidelines are comprehensive and apply to all forms, formats, and media. According to these guidelines, an advertisement of any goods, products or services that addresses or targets children shall not give any impression that such goods, products or services are better than natural or traditional food that children may be consuming. The Guidelines also discourage any advertisement that offers promotional gifts to persuade children to buy goods, products or services without necessity or promotes illogical consumerism.

The guidelines introduce new concepts, including 'bait advertisements', 'free claims advertisements', and 'child-targeted advertisements'. The guidelines not only set out conditions that must be complied with, with respect to 'bait advertisements', but also prohibit surrogate or indirect advertisements, including brand extensions, and regulate 'free claims' advertisements. Among other restrictions, the guidelines prohibit unsubstantiated health claims in advertisements targeting children, and advertisements that condone or encourage practices detrimental to children's physical health or mental well-being. Of relevance to food marketing, the guidelines specifically preclude advertisements of 'junk foods', including chips, and carbonated beverages' during a 'program' or on a 'channel' meant for children or on a channel meant 'exclusively for children'. They also forbid celebrity endorsements for products that require health warnings to be included in such advertisements or for products that cannot be purchased by children. Restrictions on advertisements, including restrictions on 'junk food', do not consider media/locations visited/accessed by children that are often not those 'directed at' or 'targeting' or 'meant exclusively' for children, but are instead those providing access to a wide range of content (e.g. social media). Although the guidelines seek to include regulation of 'junk food' advertisements, ambiguity exists around terms like what constitutes 'junk food', 'programs' or meant 'exclusively for children', which may not, in their traditional meaning, include new media. These guidelines also do not have specific objective criteria for 'brand extension' and 'indirect advertisement'. The opportunity that existed in these guidelines is to define junk foods and broaden the regulatory scope from 'child-directed' marketing to all marketing that children are exposed to across all media and settings.

### Commercialization of quality [^f76f1d84]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Without overriding financial imperatives, the commercial marketplace for products and services enabling quality improvement, quality assurance, and quality control has been limited in health care. Companies serving this industry have had a difficult time finding business justification to bring these products to market. However, government initiatives in the past 6 years attempting to reduce health care costs are placing an emphasis on better, more appropriate, and more effective health care delivery through evidence-based medicine. Incentives, penalties, and reimbursements for providers serving Medicare and Medicaid patients are being implemented or altered to encourage this adoption. Within this new environment, quality systems become vital tools in managing optimal operations, and thus, a new commercial marketplace is rapidly evolving for vendors to develop, promote, and profitably sell quality assurance and quality control products and services. With a viable, growing, and competitive market, radiologists, technologists, and radiology administrators may look forward to having a wide choice of quality tools to help them make their departments an invaluable resource in a changing healthcare delivery system.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^d9a7455e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Facets of product promotion — marketing or promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices extends well beyond easily recognized advertisements and visits from industry representatives, and product promotion may take subtle forms, including social opportunities, educational programs, research, and consultation. Many physicians believe visits from industry representatives include an educational component, and in a 2009 survey of physicians, 76% reported their view that information from sales representatives was at least somewhat valuable, and 29% reported using information from representatives often or almost always when making decisions about whether to prescribe a new drug. The intent of these visits, however, is not only to educate but also to promote products, and pharmacies collect this information and sell it to data mining companies, which then sell the reports to pharmaceutical companies; these data allow an industry detailer not only to identify high and low prescribers, but also to increase visits and focus their message to individual health care clinicians who are low prescribers, reinforce the behavior of high prescribers, and monitor the effect of certain approaches with a specific professional.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^c1f39b98]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In sum, our results indicate that there is room to decrease the financing of misinformation using two low-cost, scalable interventions. First, improving transparency for advertisers about where their advertisements appear could by itself reduce advertising on misinformation websites, especially among companies who were previously unaware of their advertisements appearing on such outlets and were thus inadvertently financing misinformation. Second, although it is currently possible for consumers to find out about advertising companies financing misinformation through news and social media, platforms could make advertising on misinformation outlets more easily and continuously traceable to the advertising companies involved for consumers. Our results suggest that both simple information disclosures and comparative company rankings can reduce consumer demand away from companies advertising on misinformation websites.

We build on prior work analysing the ecosystem supporting misinformation websites – and programmatic advertisingby matching millions of instances of advertising companies appearing across thousands of news outlets with data on misinformation websites, thereby providing large-scale evidence of the ecosystem that sustains online misinformation over a consistent period of three years. Additionally, we present descriptive evidence about the relative roles of advertising companies and digital advertising platforms in financing misinformation. Next, our information-provision experiments examine the effects of advertising on misinformation websites for companies and platforms. Previous work has examined the conditions under which people react against companies for failing to operate up to their expectations — for example, due to service quality deterioration, not fulfilling social responsibilities, advertising next to violent content, or taking a political stance. Our research design contributes to this literature in two key ways by: (1) measuring both types of potential consumer responses — that is, 'exit' and 'voice' — that are theorized in the literature; and (2) doing so using incentive-compatible behavioural outcomes at the individual level, which enables us to capture costly decisions people make and move beyond stated preferences recorded in related experimental research. More broadly, our research suggests an alternative approach to countering misinformation online by suggesting how the monetization of misinformation could be curbed using information interventions. Our study complements and extends prior work on using disclosures, and interventions to counter misinformation, by showing that disclosures about companies advertising on misinformation outlets can shift consumption away from such companies, ultimately incentivizing companies to reduce the financing of misinformation via advertising.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^f370012b]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Professional guidance on industry influence — key points include that physicians do not believe they are influenced by industry relationships, prescribing behavior of many physicians is likely to be altered by these relationships, and those who do not acknowledge the influence of small gifts are often influenced by them; awareness and vigilance are necessary to guard against attempts to alter physician assessments and behaviors. At a minimum, all physicians must educate themselves about the subtle influence inherent in any relationship with the medical industry, a recent survey suggested that many, if not most, physicians lack an adequate understanding of conflicts of interest and influence, and an important first step is for health care clinicians to recognize that they are vulnerable to persuasive techniques and that they may be vulnerable to unconscious bias.

ACOG guidance on industry relationships — Physicians have an obligation to seek the most accurate, up-to-date, evidence-based, and balanced sources of information about new products; physicians should seek to minimize true and perceived conflicts of interest and understand that gifts, including CME credits, food, symposia, consulting arrangements, and social events, are intended to influence decision making and behavior; payments to defray costs to attend CME events should not be accepted directly from the company; and ACOG strongly discourages participation in speakers' bureaus and explicitly condemns ghostwriting as unacceptable.

### Romanian young adult perceptions on using heated tobacco products following exposure to direct marketing methods [^d4b20e88]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Place – the universe

Young adults in our study noticed HTPs advertising in gas stations, kiosks, hypermarkets, neighbourhood stores and coffee houses. This advertising presence aimed to normalise HTP use. It is also in public spaces that sales teams approach potential customers. Young adults described the approach as direct:

"in small shops, there are always tobacco representatives… 'Do you smoke?'… and if you say 'Yes', they make you different offers" (F19-HTP)

Young adults also compared online versus face-to-face marketing.

"I access the [HTP supplier] internet site… when I need to buy… I order and I get it delivered… I am unsubscribed from receiving emails, I only receive ads" (F26-HTP)

Participants noticed the unequal distribution of supplies:

"in the city… I find these products in 95% of the stores, but if I want to go on holiday… in a rural area, we cannot find these packages for respective devices" (M20-MIX)

Promotion – the start of a dialogue

Young adults engage in conversation with tobacco sales teams:

"if you stay and get to answer a questionnaire, they give you small tokens: a lighter, a package of cigarettes or discount to cigarettes… " (F19-HTP)

Young adults observed the subtle ways HTP promoters succeeded in making an impression by sampling tobacco products in restaurants, recreational venues and events (experiential marketing) or through the internet and cartoons:

"I remember that from 3 years ago when I was a minor and I went to a festival… as a minor you are bombarded with ads". (F19-HTP)

"the problem with this promotion is that it is a very, very subtle one, but has an effect. We don't see cigarette commercials on TV, because it's a matter of ethics… but still, we have the internet, lots of ways left… including cartoons" (M21-NS)

### Will the current COVID-19 pandemic impact on long-term cannabis buying practices? [^ffff37e8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the response to have resulted in an increase in sales activity levels on darknet markets during the first 3 months of 2020, mainly related to cannabis products. One key question is whether more people will become used to this form of purchasing their drugs and will they continue with it post COVID-19 lockdown. As one-to-one encrypted communication services or social media apps are increasingly being used, monitoring and interdiction will become much more challenging.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^3942ee23]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Industry promotional vehicles beyond CME — Pharmaceutical companies may influence educational content through grants to patient advocacy groups that sponsor lectures and produce materials to educate health care clinicians and the public about a condition and the company's product used to treat it; in some cases, advocacy groups have been used by the industry to influence public policy related to specific drugs. Industry involvement with and participation in social media sites designed for health care clinicians may be used to communicate without revealing the promotional purpose, and medical apps branded by the industry can nurture a favorable attitude toward the sponsor and nudge a user toward the company's products.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^d97aad6d]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

In this Article, we attempt to provide a first step in understanding how to limit the financing of online misinformation via advertising using descriptive and experimental evidence. To tackle the problem of financing online misinformation, it is important to first understand the role of different entities within this ecosystem. In particular, we need to establish whether companies directly place advertisements on misinformation outlets or do so by automating such placement through digital advertising platforms. Although several mainstream digital platforms generate the vast majority of their revenue via advertising, little is understood about the role of advertising-driven platforms in financing misinformation. To evaluate the relative roles of advertising companies and digital advertising platforms in monetizing misinformation, we construct unique large-scale datasets by combining data on websites publishing misinformation with advertising activity per website over a period of three years.

Next, the extent to which companies can be dissuaded from advertising on misinformation websites depends on how their customers respond to information about the prevalence of companies' advertising on such websites. As people find out about companies advertising on misinformation websites through news and social media reports, they may reduce their demand for such companies or voice concerns against such practices online. Therefore, it is important to measure the preferences of the people who consume a company's products or services regardless of whether these consumers visit misinformation websites themselves. To measure these effects, we conducted a survey experiment with a sample of the US population by randomly varying the pieces of factual information we provided to participants. By simultaneously measuring how people shift their consumption and the types of actors (that is, advertisers or digital advertising platforms) that they voice concerns about, we capture how peoples' reactions change as the degree to which advertisers and advertising platforms are held responsible varies. We also study how consumer responses may vary depending on the intensity of a company's advertising on misinformation websites by providing company rankings on this dimension.

### Medical marketing in the United States, 1997–2016… [^8c207d41]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Findings From 1997 through 2016, medical marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from $17. 7 to $29. 9 billion, with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs and health services accounting for the most rapid growth, and pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounting for most promotional spending. Meaning. Spending is reported in 2016 dollars. Findings From 1997 through 2016, spending on medical marketing of drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory testing increased from $17. 7 to $29. 9 billion. The most rapid increase was in direct-to-consumer advertising, which increased from $2. 1 billion of total spending in 1997 to $9. 6 billion of total spending in
2016. Marketing to health care professionals by pharmaceutical companies accounted for most promotional spending and increased from $15. 6 billion to $20. 3 billion, including $5. 6 billion for prescriber detailing, $13.

5 billion for free samples, $979 million for direct physician payments related to specific drugs, and $59 million for disease education. The marketing of medicine involves a complex interaction involving industry, organizations, and individuals involved in health care. Pharmaceutical and device manufacturers target health care professionals and health care organizations, and these companies, along with those that manufacture other clinical products and consumer-based products, target various health care organizations and audiences to generate sales directly and indirectly.

Direct-to-consumer and professional medical marketing for prescription drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory tests in the United States from 1997 through 2016 were analyzed. In 2016, companies spent $3. 8 million on mostly electronic advertising for direct access testing. DTC advertising has been associated with increased patient requests and prescriptions and higher costs through more patient visits. 28–32 In a 2005 trial, 33 standardized patients at primary care visits were randomized to make DTC-driven requests for a brand-name antidepressant or no requests.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^b0e49766]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Healthy eating promotion in schools — adopt marketing techniques to promote healthy dietary choices. Marketing techniques can be used to promote healthy foods and beverages among students, including placing nutritious products so that they are easy for students to choose, promoting healthy eating through environmental strategies such as prompts, parental outreach, and point-of-purchase promotions because point-of-purchase signage and parental newsletters highlighting parents' healthy eating behaviors influence children's food selections, and applying pricing strategies such as lowering the price of nutritious items and, if needed, raising the price of less nutritious items to encourage purchasing healthier items.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^e8df3432]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Medical pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are essential in making products that benefit patients, and collaboration between health care providers and industry is necessary in the design, testing, and manufacture of these medical products. However, health care providers must recognize that their duties and the interests of industry may, at times, diverge. Relationships with industry, even seemingly minor ones, have the potential to shape the decisions made on behalf of patients. The marketing divisions of pharmaceutical and medical device firms view health care providers as a target of their efforts, and some of the interactions that occur between industry and health care providers have the potential to alter decision making in ways that may not necessarily benefit patients. Health care providers have an ethical duty to recognize situations and marketing strategies that are designed to influence their choice of diagnostic and therapeutic options for their patients. Health care providers should be aware of the techniques used to attempt to alter their behavior and guard against them.

### Implications of large language models for quality and efficiency of neurologic care: emerging issues in neurology [^ce7c6b0c]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Business challenges in implementing LLMs — beyond model bias, business implementation is a significant challenge because "off-the-shelf" products typically do not meet proliferating regulatory requirements, especially those related to data privacy, and generally lack robust functionality such as additional training on health care–specific sources. Health care providers must decide whether to obtain functionality from an existing EHR vendor at additional cost or purchase a stand-alone product; while less mature vendors may carry greater risks such as inability to deliver on sales promises (the so called "vaporware" risk), vendors with smaller customer bases may be nimbler with greater interest in codevelopment and commercialization, and may offer pricing incentives such as no-cost pilots in exchange for marketing references. However, these opportunities often come with restrictions and expected obligations such as significant limitations in the number of users or the extent of the services offered.

### Maternal and child health services and an integrated, life-cycle approach to the prevention of non-communicable diseases [^283fad89]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of NCD risks will require private sector engagement in multiple sectors. Food and beverage production, marketing and media representation are particularly relevant to NCD risk reduction early in life. A regional study in Latin America and the Caribbean on the impact of food and beverage marketing on children provides related evidence. Financial incentives or disincentives for this industry related to unhealthy food consumption are needed. The tobacco industry provides an example: the gradual evolution of global restrictions on promotion of, taxes on and limiting the sale of tobacco products might equally be applied to calorie-rich or high sugar-containing or salt-containing processed food and drinks. Some countries have introduced related policies, for example, taxes on saturated fats or sugar-sweetened beverages to influence consumption. However, like tobacco control, these efforts faced significant opposition from key private stakeholders and required concerted effort and advocacy.

State actions to reduce NCD risk might include related legislation, regulation of various sectors (food and beverage production and marketing, built environment design, some free public places), taxation or other disincentives, public funding for community initiatives and public amenity, and efforts to increase health literacy and related action. Regional public programmes can work with local authorities in their attempts to regulate increasingly well-resourced, coordinated, reluctant and often multinational private interests. As with tobacco, the efforts industries may make to avoid such regulation should not be underestimated. Some developed country initiatives in this area have already commenced.

Advocacy should be undertaken for including NCD risk reduction among children and adolescents in relevant government policies, and with costed plans. This includes policies that reduce children's and adolescents' direct and indirect exposure to tobacco, alcohol and drugs; limiting the promotion of unhealthy food and drinks, including through the media and at points of sale; integrating life skills and healthy living in school curricula; school-based annual screening for health status/NCD risk and provision/promotion of healthy food and physical activity; specific approaches to influence out-of-school youth and displaced populations; standards for the built environment and public amenity that foster physical activity and individual safety, especially in early life; assurance of funding for universal screening and simple treatment of NCDs across the life-cycle; and initiatives to improve related health literacy of the community at large. Actions appropriate to national or local contexts can be developed at country level, bearing in mind the evidence on what is effective.

### Commercialization of quality [^ad23ba34]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

That is not to say vendors have not deployed quality systems. If a vendor foresees the integration of a quality system giving their product or service a competitive advantage, they may justify its inclusion as a means of increasing the product's sales volume. The track record of this approach is by no means assured. While it may make for a perceived advantage during the sales process, the additional quality systems may not be ultimately utilized due to the penalties (time, personnel) discussed. Also, development of a quality system in the absence of industry-wide standards or requirements often dictates a proprietary system native and limited to that vendor's products, thus limiting market potential to a percentage of their installed base and future unit sales. This limited market can be the critical factor in a business assessment. A leading computed radiography (CR) product vendor's integration of an automated image quality assessment system in their CR products may serve as an example. A considerable investment was made in research and development of a sophisticated application that could report and even correct common image quality factors in CR imaging. It was foreseen to enable significant improvement in image consistency, virtually eliminating repeat exams and potentially saving money and improving efficiency. However, as this pioneering effort would only work with this vendor's CR devices and the data communication was only possible with the vendor's PACS, a very constrained number of customers might be potential purchasers of the system. While automated, human work effort and time is also needed to translate the insights gained into superior clinical practice. Unfortunately, this service has not been offered commercially to date.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^b1cbd107]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Together, our descriptive and experimental findings offer clear, practical implications. Given the potential for a substantial decline in demand, as demonstrated by our consumer study, advertising companies may wish to account for consumer preferences in placing their advertising across various online outlets and exercise caution while incorporating automation in their business processes via digital advertising platforms. For instance, given that consumers switched to other products upon learning about a company's advertisements appearing on misinformation websites, companies could use lists of misinformation outlets provided by independent third-party organizations such as NewsGuard and the GDI to limit advertising budgets being spent on misinformation outlets through digital platforms. Moreover, since consumer backlash was particularly strong for women and politically left-leaning consumers, companies targeting such audiences may need to exercise greater caution.

On the basis of our results, we identify two interventions that could reduce the financing of online misinformation. First, digital advertising platforms that run automated auctions could enable advertisers to more easily access data on whether their advertisements appear on misinformation outlets. This would enable advertisers to make advertising placement decisions consistent with their preferences rather than inadvertently financing misinformation. Second, while it is currently possible for consumers to find out about companies financing misinformation through media reports, digital platforms could improve transparency for consumers about which companies advertise on misinformation outlets. Platforms could provide such information to consumers when they are viewing an advertisment using simple information labels (as in our 'company only' information treatment) similar to the 'sponsored by' and 'paid for by' labels that are presently common on various digital media platforms. Similarly, rank-based information provided in our company-ranking information treatment (T4) could be provided as a ranking of companies in order of intensity of appearing on misinformation websites where customers are selecting products from a menu of choices while shopping. Platforms have provided similar contextual information about companies in other settings — for example, Google Flights displays carbon emissions data alongside flight prices when people select a flight to purchase among several options. Enabling consumers to view such information at the point of purchase could provide a stronger incentive for companies to steer their advertisements away from such outlets, especially since the effect of negative information can persist for several months. Overall, these interventions could decrease the inadvertent advertising revenue going towards misinformation outlets, which could eventually lead to such sites ceasing to operate, as observed anecdotally in prior work.

### How AI should be used in radiology: assessing ambiguity and completeness of intended use statements of commercial AI products [^95f2c5ee]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings are acknowledged by the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This agency mentioned vague intended purposes as a "common issue" and has recently published a guideline to craft IUSs to mitigate this issue for the UK market. These recommendations encourage mentioning explicit items in the IUS that were outlined and used for analysis in this study. We would recommend vendors and regulatory consultants to include all defined IUS items in their public documentation to provide transparent information and to ensure the safe use of AI products in clinical practice, as required by the MDR.

In some of the analyzed statements, we found relevant contra-indications or disclaimers, which are important means to avoid unsafe use, going beyond the actual intended use of the product as a medical device. However, if there is a direct contradiction between the "perceived" intended use of a medical device, e.g. by claims made in the marketing material or suggested in the name of a medical device, disclaimers can add to the confusion about the proper use of a medical device. It is a requirement of all global medical device regulations that marketing material is consistent with regulatory-approved claims and that a device's labeling covers all externally available marketing material, including manufacturer websites, brochures, and even verbal communications with customers. A recent study already found that 13% of the products were marketed as AI or machine learning, while this was not reflected in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510 (k) clearance. Further research should focus on how well the intended use in regulatory documents aligns with marketing material and whether disagreement between those two may be a potential source of patient harm.

### A critical review of the marketing claims of infant formula products in the United States [^7cdda950]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A highly competitive infant formula market has resulted in direct-to-consumer marketing intended to promote the sale of modified formulas that claim to ameliorate common infant feeding problems. The claims associated with these marketing campaigns are not evaluated with reference to clinical evidence by the Food and Drug Administration. We aimed to describe the language of claims made on formula labels and compare it with the evidence in systematic reviews. Of the 22 product labels we identified, 13 product labels included claims about colic and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to support the claims that removing or reducing lactose, using hydrolyzed or soy protein or adding pre-/probiotics to formula benefits infants with fussiness, gas, or colic yet claims like "soy for fussiness and gas" encourage parents who perceive their infants to be fussy to purchase modified formula. Increased regulation of infant formula claims is warranted.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^b7fd1c6c]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry — this section describes psychological influence techniques used by industry representatives, including commitment/consistency tactics in which clinicians are asked to try a product on the next 5 or 10 patients, after which continued use is more likely. Social proof underlies peer advocacy among physicians, liking is leveraged by friendly and attractive interactions, appeals to authority rely on deference to experts, and scarcity encourages rapid acceptance of offered opportunities. Reciprocity is emphasized: gifts create an obligation to reciprocate and take many forms, including free product samples, pens, mugs, speaking or consulting opportunities, meals, trips, free CME, publication and authorship opportunities, and research grants. The section explains that much cognitive activity occurs without conscious awareness, that favors and gifts independent of monetary value influence behavior at a subconscious level, and that although clinicians may assume prescribing is rational, much human decision making does not use a rational assessment of pros and cons.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^f0ea3195]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Tackling experimental validity concerns

In our incentivized, online setting where we measure behavioural outcomes, we expect experimenter demand effects to be minimal as has been evidenced in the experimental literature. We take several steps to mitigate potential experimenter demand effects, including implementing best practices recommended in prior work. First, our experiment has a neutral framing throughout the survey since the recruitment of participants. While recruiting participants, we invite them to "take a survey about the news, technology and businesses" without making any specific references to misinformation or its effects. While introducing misinformation websites and how they are identified by independent non-partisan organizations, we include examples of misinformation websites across the political spectrum (including both right-wing and left-wing sites) and provide an illustrative example of misinformation by foreign actors. In drafting the survey instruments, the phrasing of the questions and choices available were as neutral as possible. For example, while introducing our online petitions, we presented participants with the option to sign real petitions that suggest both blocking and allowing advertising on misinformation sites. Indeed, we find that the vast majority of participants believe that the information provided in the survey was unbiased as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. Only about 10% of participants chose one of the 'biased' or 'very biased' options when asked to rate the political bias of the survey information provided from a seven-point scale ranging from 'very right-wing biased' to 'very left-wing biased'.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^3c117a2f]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

The power and psychology of persuasion — although health care clinicians believe that they can distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information presented by industry representatives, the data suggest otherwise, and contact with industry representatives has been shown to change physician behavior in terms of pharmaceutical choices and requests for formulary changes. For historical context, in a 1992 study, Orlowski and Wateska tracked prescriptions at their hospital for 2 drugs during the 22 months before and 17 months after an all-expenses-paid symposium held at a resort and attended by physicians on staff at the hospital. Although physicians who attended the symposia reported that their attendance did not alter their prescribing patterns, the use of both drugs increased after the symposia (whereas national usage rates remained unchanged). On the other hand, implementation of policies at academic medical centers restricting access to pharmaceutical detailing is associated with a reduction in prescribing many detailed drugs. As a general rule, individuals underestimate the degree to which they are influenced by cognitive and motivational bias and overestimate the degree to which others are influenced by the same things, reflected in one survey of 397 members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). In that survey, 80%, 88%, and 64% reported that they would absolutely not or probably not be influenced to prescribe a drug after acceptance of lunch, an anatomic model, or a paid consultancy, respectively, whereas only 57%, 64%, and 38% believed that the average physician would absolutely not or probably not be influenced to prescribe a drug after receipt of these items. Similarly, only 7% of authors of clinical practice guidelines believed that their relationships with the industry influenced the guidelines they developed, whereas 19% of authors believed that their colleagues' recommendations were influenced by industry relationships. An extensive literature on persuasion is summarized by Cialdini, who describes 6 basic categories of effective persuasive techniques.

### Retailer participation in cigarette company incentive programs is related to increased levels of cigarette advertising and cheaper cigarette prices in stores [^a653b5e4]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The retail outlet is the cigarette companies' major marketing channel to reach present and future customers. Of the $11.2 billion spent by them to market their products in 2001, approximately 85% was spent on retailer and consumer incentives to stimulate sales. This study examines the extent of retailer participation in these incentive programs, and the relationship between participation and the amount and placement of cigarette marketing materials and products, and prices in stores.

Methods

Observational assessments of cigarette marketing materials, products, and prices were conducted in 468 stores in 15 U.S. states. Telephone interviews were conducted with store owners or managers of these stores to determine the details of their participation in incentive programs.

Results

Cigarette companies engaged 65% of retailers in an incentive program. Nearly 80% of participating retailers reported cigarette company control over placement of marketing materials in their stores. Stores that reported receiving over $3,000 from incentive programs in the past 3 months averaged 19.5 cigarette marketing materials, and stores receiving no money averaged only 8.2 marketing materials. In multivariate analyses, participation in incentive programs offered by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds was positively related to the number of cigarette marketing materials for each of these companies' brands in stores and the placement of their cigarettes on the top shelf. The price of Newports was significantly lower in stores that received incentives; no price difference was found for Marlboro.

Conclusions

Stores that participate in cigarette company incentive programs feature more prominent placement of cigarettes and advertising, and may have cheaper cigarette prices.

### Web applications for patient communication [^c7b102f3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Communication between imaging professionals and patients can help achieve many goals, including improved patient understanding of imaging-related diagnostic and treatment options, better compliance with appropriate imaging screening procedures, and improved efficiency of service. The explosive growth of out-of-pocket consumer spending on health care has heightened health care shopping, thus making patient communication an important goal of any imaging practice or health care organization. Furthermore, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System introduced by CMS will publicly disclose physicians' quality ratings, which are in part dependent on patient engagement. The authors summarize the rationale for web communication with patients, the range of content that should be considered, and the technology options. The aim is to help imaging providers develop organized patient communication strategic and implementation plans.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of policies regulating drug marketing [^1ee49173]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The costs of developing new treatments and bringing them to the market are substantial. The pharmaceutical industry uses drug promotion to gain a competitive market share, and drive sale volumes and industry profitability. This involves disseminating information about new treatments to relevant targets. However, conflicts of interest can arise when profits are prioritised over patient care and its benefits. Drug promotion regulations are complex interventions that aim to prevent potential harm associated with these activities.

Objectives

To assess the effects of policies that regulate drug promotion on drug utilisation, coverage or access, healthcare utilisation, patient outcomes, adverse events and costs.

Search Methods

We searched Epistemonikos for related reviews and their included studies. To find primary studies we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, EconLit, Global Index Medicus, Virtual Health Library, INRUD Bibliography, two trial registries and two sources of grey literature. All databases and sources were searched in January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include studies that assessed policies regulating drug promotion to consumers, healthcare professionals or regulators and third-party payers, or any combination of these groups. In this review we defined policies as laws, rules, guidelines, codes of practice, and financial or administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. One of the following outcomes had to be reported: drug utilisation, coverage or access, healthcare utilisation, patient health outcomes, any adverse effects (unintended consequences), and costs. The study had to be a randomised or non-randomised trial, an interrupted time series analysis (ITS), a repeated measures (RM) study or a controlled before-after (CBA) study.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion of studies. When consensus was not reached, any disagreements were discussed with a third review author. We planned to use the criteria suggested by Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) to assess the risk of bias of included studies. For randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and CBA studies, we planned to estimate relative effects, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we planned to report the risk ratio (RR) when possible and adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measures. For ITS and RM, we planned to compute changes along two dimensions: change in level and change in slope. We planned to undertake a structured synthesis following EPOC guidance. MAIN RESULTS: The search yielded 4593 citations, and 13 studies were selected for full-text review. No study met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We sought to assess the effects of policies that regulate drug promotion on drug use, coverage or access, use of health services, patient outcomes, adverse events, and costs, however we did not find studies that met the review's inclusion criteria. As pharmaceutical policies that regulate drug promotion have untested effects, their impact, as well as their positive and negative influences, is currently only a matter of opinion, debate, informal or descriptive reporting. There is an urgent need to assess the effects of pharmaceutical policies that regulate drug promotion using well-conducted studies with high methodological rigour.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^494eb36b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The financial motivation to earn advertising revenue has been widely conjectured to be pivotal for the production of online misinformation 1–4. Research aimed at mitigating misinformation has so far focused on interventions at the user level 5–8, with little emphasis on how the supply of misinformation can itself be countered. Here we show how online misinformation is largely financed by advertising, examine how financing misinformation affects the companies involved, and outline interventions for reducing the financing of misinformation. First, we find that advertising on websites that publish misinformation is pervasive for companies across several industries and is amplified by digital advertising platforms that algorithmically distribute advertising across the web. Using an information-provision experiment 9, we find that companies that advertise on websites that publish misinformation can face substantial backlash from their consumers. To examine why misinformation continues to be monetized despite the potential backlash for the advertisers involved, we survey decision-makers at companies. We find that most decision-makers are unaware that their companies' advertising appears on misinformation websites but have a strong preference to avoid doing so. Moreover, those who are unaware and uncertain about their company's role in financing misinformation increase their demand for a platform-based solution to reduce monetizing misinformation when informed about how platforms amplify advertising placement on misinformation websites. We identify low-cost, scalable information-based interventions to reduce the financial incentive to misinform and counter the supply of misinformation online.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^bf8def3e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinician–industry financial relationships — marketing expenditures and Open Payments metrics — include marketing spending and payments directed to clinicians. In 2016, pharmaceutical companies spent $29.9 billion on marketing, of which $20.3 billion (68%) was directed toward health care clinicians in the form of prescriber detailing ($5.6 billion), free samples ($13.5 billion), direct physician payments related to specific drugs ($979 million), and disease education ($59 million). Data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Open Payments program revealed that, in 2019, 615 000 physicians received payments or investment interests worth $3.6 billion (an average of $5854 per physician recipient), and 1194 teaching hospitals accepted payments totaling $2.63 billion. Payments are highest among the medical and surgical specialties, and although 90% of physicians who accepted payments between 2014 and 2018 received less than $10 000, 3.4% of physicians who accepted payments received more than $50 000. Studies have reported that an average of approximately $61 000 was spent per physician in the United States in 2004, and that amount has decreased between 2006 and 2010.

### An evaluation of the FDA's analysis of the costs and benefits of the graphic warning label regulation [^1151d324]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

The FDA analysis, however, did not stop at this point, but instead included the potential cost to smokers of the reductions in smoking caused by the GWLs — what economists refer to as lost consumer surplus. For fully-informed, rational consumers, consumer surplus reflects the difference between their willingness to pay for a product and the actual price they pay in the marketplace; graphically, this is the area under the demand curve but above the market price, as shown in figure 1 A. Regulatory actions that reduce the demand for a product (as shown in figure 1 B) or that raise its market price (as shown in figure 1 C) will lead to reductions in consumer surplus, reflecting the lost satisfaction that results from reduced consumption. In the FDA's economic impact analysis of its GWL rule, it applied this standard tool of welfare economics to cigarette smoking and reduced the benefits resulting from reductions in smoking caused by the labels by roughly half in order to account for the lost consumer surplus.

Figure 1
(A) The area under the demand curve but above the market price. (B) Regulatory actions that reduce the demand for a product. (C) Regulatory actions that raise the market price of a product.

In one extreme model in which consumers are making fully informed, perfectly rational and forward-looking choices, consumers induced to quit by GWLs would indeed lose consumer surplus. Without knowing the exact demand function, this surplus could be much smaller or much greater than half of the health benefits. However — and this is a key point — in this model, there would be no reason for the smoker to quit in response to the GWL. This is a crucial point — the very fact that the GWL has a strong impact on quitting, as documented by the evidence cited above, contradicts the very use of this extreme model.

### Marketing occupational health: exploring the purchaser perspective [^23c4f55f]. Occupational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There may be scope for providers of occupational health (OH) services to improve their communication and marketing to those who purchase their services, but the research literature contains little information about purchasers' perceptions of OH. There is no documented overview that fully captures the purchasers' perspective.

Aims

To explore current and potential purchasers' thinking about OH.

Methods

Iterative purposive sampling was carried out to identify participants for semi-structured interviews. Respondents were obtained through progressively wider networking, starting with personal and organizational contacts and networking events. This was continued until no major new information was appearing.

Results

Health issues were not always recognized as related to OH. Some respondents had little understanding of OH or perceived it with very negative connotations. Some also sought information at first from the internet and personal contacts. The giving of expert advice on a situation was generally seen as a central feature of OH services. Most believed OH included sickness absence management. Respondents spoke of problems such as insufficient, inappropriate or partisan recommendations and also process or turnaround time problems. Clarity and building good working relationships were identified as positive factors.

Conclusions

OH providers should review their various activities to address these points, as well as reviewing the knowledge and skills that their staff can contribute.

### Committee opinion no. 709: commercial enterprises in medical practice [^3baad8f0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Medical goods and services — under most circumstances, the direct sale of products by obstetrician–gynecologists to patients in clinical settings represents an apparent financial conflict of interest, and the sale of prescription or nonprescription medication or devices directly to patients from obstetrician–gynecologists' offices is discouraged when reasonably convenient, alternative vendors exist. ACOG recognizes that in-office availability of medical goods and services may improve clinical care and that the obstetrician–gynecologist's office may sometimes be the only point of access; in these cases, or when medically indicated products are not covered by insurance, direct-to-patient sales may be permissible. When offering sales, obstetrician–gynecologists should ensure the product is clinically indicated and consistent with current medical practice, should not restrict access to equally effective alternatives or imply office products are the best or only options, should not coercively suggest that continued care is contingent on purchasing from the physician or clinic, and the selling price should not exceed fair market value; if these safeguards are not in place, the therapeutic focus of the patient–physician relationship may be significantly weakened.

### Voluntary workplace genomic testing: wellness benefit or pandora's box? [^3c10f1af]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Consumer interest in genetic and genomic testing is growing rapidly, with more than 26 million Americans having purchased direct-to-consumer genetic testing services. Capitalizing on the increasing comfort of consumers with genetic testing outside the clinical environment, commercial vendors are expanding their customer base by marketing genetic and genomic testing services, including testing for pharmacogenomic and pathogenic variants, to employers for inclusion in workplace wellness programs. We describe the appeal of voluntary workplace genomic testing (wGT) to employers and employees, how the ethical, legal, and social implications literature has approached the issue of genetic testing in the workplace in the past, and outline the relevant legal landscape. Given that we are in the early stages of development of the wGT market, now is the time to identify the critical interests and concerns of employees and employers, so that governance can develop and evolve along with the wGT market, rather than behind it, and be based on data, rather than speculative hopes and fears.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, society for nutrition education and behavior, and school nutrition association: comprehensive nutrition programs and services in schools [^32a5d21e]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

School wellness policies and nutrition standards — population associations and implementation directives are summarized as follows: A population-based study of adolescents found that each additional component included in a district's wellness policy reduced the prevalence of obesity by approximately 3%, and an examination of 24 studies from 2005 to 2013 found that having policies governing the sale of foods and beverages sold outside of school meal programs was associated with reductions in weight, body mass index, probability of overweight or obesity, and consumption and/or availability of foods and beverages in the expected direction. Districts should thus develop comprehensive and strong policies that promote health, and schools should not only address school meals or competitive food choices, but should also provide an environment fostering healthful eating. Strong policies need to be implemented so that nutrition guidelines for all foods and beverages available for sale on the school campus during the school day, offered at classroom parties, or used as incentives are consistent with federal regulations for school meal nutrition standards or Smart Snacks in School, and policies for food and beverage marketing that allow marketing and advertising of only those foods and beverages that meet the Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards promote consistent messages throughout the school.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems: executive summary of a policy position paper from the American College of Physicians [^093bfb5e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), which include electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are growing in popularity, but their safety and efficacy as a smoking cessation aid are not well understood. Some argue that they have the potential to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and could be a useful tool for reducing tobacco-related harm. Others express concern that the health effects of ENDS use are unknown, that they may appeal to young people, and that they may encourage dual use of ENDS and traditional tobacco products. Although ENDS are a new and unregulated product, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed regulations that would deem ENDS to be subject to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which regulates cigarettes and other tobacco products. In this position paper, the American College of Physicians offers policy recommendations on ENDS regulation and oversight, taxation, flavorings, promotion and marketing, indoor and public use, and research. This paper is not intended to offer clinical guidance or serve as an exhaustive literature review of existing ENDS-related evidence but to help direct the College, policymakers, and regulators on how to address these products.

### A premiere example of the illusion of harm reduction cigarettes in the 1990s [^6506422c]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To use the product launch of Player's Premiere as a case study for understanding the new cigarette product development process during the 1990s. We determine the (in)validity of industry claims that: (1) development of the physical product preceded the promotional promise of "less irritation"; (2) "less irritation" was actually realised; (3) advertising informed consumers; and (4) advertising regulations caused the product's failure in the marketplace.

Setting

Court proceedings assessing the constitutionality of Canada's Tobacco Act, which substantially restricts cigarette advertising. The 2002 Quebec Superior Court trial yielded a new collection of internal documents from Imperial Tobacco Ltd (ITL), including several about the development and marketing of Player's Premiere.

Method

Trial testimony and corporate documents were reviewed to determine the validity of the industry representations about the new cigarette product development process, focusing on the case history of Player's Premiere.

Results

In direct contradiction to industry testimony, the documentary evidence demonstrates that (1) communications for Player's Premiere, which claimed less irritation, were developed long before finding a product that could deliver on the promise; (2) ITL did not sell a "less irritating" product that matched its promotional promise; (3) the advertising and other communications for Player's Premiere were extensive, relying on the hi-tech appearances ("tangible credibility") of a "unique" filter, yet were uninformative and vague; and (4) Player's Premiere failed in the marketplace, despite extensive advertising and retail support, because it was an inferior product that did not live up to its promotional promise, not because of regulation of commercial speech.

Conclusions

New product development entails extensive consumer research to craft all communications tools in fine detail. In the case of Player's Premiere, this crafting created a false and misleading impression of technological advances producing a "less irritating" cigarette. This product was solely a massive marketing ploy with neither consumer benefits, nor public health benefits. The industry attempted to deceive both consumers and the court.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^e853556c]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Promotion in the form of education — Continuing medical education (CME) includes accredited and unaccredited activities, and when educational events are industry-sponsored and unaccredited, biased information is frequently disseminated. According to the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), 10% of ACCME-accredited CME in the United States in 2016, accounting for 20% of learner interactions, were supported by commercial entities, and in 2016, 28% of the income of CME providers accredited by the ACCME was from commercial entities. Conferences and lectures organized by medical education and communication companies (MECCs) are often designed to fit the specifications of the industry sponsor and present the company's product in a positive light while appearing neutral; programming is designed to deliver a message favorable to the company and its product, and because MECCs are often the official sponsors, the funder's name rarely appears on promotional materials. Because many professional societies will not allow funding to influence their programming directly, professional meetings are often accompanied by unofficial programming that occurs simultaneously and frequently includes a free meal while an expert lectures on a relevant topic.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^ff523ca1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Increasing access to healthy, affordable foods — community food retail strategies detail partners and store-level actions. The food retail environment has a significant impact on the health of communities, and a healthy food retail environment is one in which it is easier to make healthy choices by encouraging the purchase of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other nutritious items, rather than energy-dense foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Community partners, including public health agencies, retailers and vendors, business leaders, health care systems and providers, local farmers, food pantries and banks, community development organizations, community members, and other stakeholders, can collaborate in a variety of ways to develop and maintain a healthy retail environment. Both full-service and smaller grocery stores can market and promote healthier choices through leveraging shelf labeling systems to help consumers identify healthier choices and place these items at eye level, in-store promotions of healthy options and recipes, and healthy checkout aisles that limit foods and beverages of low nutritional value. A store can also apply to become an approved vendor for federal nutrition assistance programs funded and administered through the USDA, which provides financial incentives to participants in federal nutrition assistance programs for the purchase of healthier options. Smaller stores face unique challenges, including difficulty meeting distributors' minimum order requirements to receive reasonable prices on healthy options, and working collaboratively, smaller stores can establish group purchasing collectives to increase purchasing power to facilitate the provision of healthier food and beverage options.

### Inferring personal economic status from social network location [^874a66bc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Validation by marketing campaign

To validate our strategy, we perform a social marketing campaign whose objective is the acquisition of new credit card clients, by sending messages to affluent individuals (as identified by their CI values) and inviting the recipients to initiate a product request (Supplementary Note 8). We note that in this experiment we use an independent data set from a different time frame, and we use only the CI values extracted from the network to classify the targeted people. Specifically, we use the communications network resulting from the aggregation of calls and SMS exchanged between users over a period of 91 days. The resulting social network contains 7.19 × 10 7 people and 3.51 × 10 8 links. The campaign was conducted on a total of 656,944 people who were targeted by an SMS message offering the product according to their CI values in the social network. We also sent messages to a control group of 48,000 people, chosen randomly. To evaluate the campaign, we measured the response rate, that is, the number of recipients who requested the product divided by the number of targeted people, as a function of CI. In the control group, the response rate to the messages was 0.331%. Our results show that groups of increasing CI show an increase in their response rate, with a sound threefold gain in the rate of response of the top influencers (as identified by top CI values) when compared to the random case. When we compare the response of the high CI to the lowest CI people, the response rate increase fivefold. The results of the experiment are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4.

Advertisements and promotional efforts from broadcast media have been shown to promote youth initiation and progression of tobacco use. Companies market claims that ENDS are "healthier" and "safer" than conventional cigarettes even though these claims have not been scientifically validated, and there are unsubstantiated claims of "smoke anywhere" use and smoking cessation benefits, which are currently unapproved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Cigarette-like cigarillo introduced to bypass taxation, standardised packaging, minimum pack sizes, and menthol ban in the UK [^2c6c2a9c]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

In markets like the UK where consumer tobacco marketing is banned, the industry relies on retailers to promote its products. To encourage retailers to stock these cigarillos, they are offered a wholesale price/RRP that allow retailers a higher profit margin of 15%, compared to 5.5% for the Sterling Dual Capsule cigarettes. Since point of sale displays are banned (ie, tobacco products are hidden from shoppers), retailers are often asked 'what is your cheapest'and a packet of these cigarillos is now much cheaper than any of cigarettes (or RYO).

To address the introduction of this product, the UK should consider a variety of measures, including some that can be implemented immediately and others that would take longer to employ. Taxation offers the most immediate way forward; amending UK tobacco regulation is the ideal solution but will take significantly longer to change than the taxation and would require public consultation, such as when standardised packaging was introduced. However, tobacco duty can be changed relatively quickly and therefore offers the most immediate way to reduce the incentives behind such products until tobacco control legislation can be revised. Taxation in the UK is due to be reviewed in the annual Budget in the autumn of 2020, and duty changes usually apply from 6 pm that day.

### Altria-juul labs deal: why did it occur and what does it mean for the US nicotine delivery product market [^f3ee329f]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

The deal can also impede competition by Altria working with Juul Labs (eg, through onserts on the outside of packages with coupons for Juul and providing their customer lists for marketing purposes) to insure that those smoking Altria products (eg, Marlboro) switch to Juul rather than other e-cigarette companies' products. To the extent that brand loyalty is created for Juul products, new entrants will face greater barriers to market entry. In addition, Altria is likely to help Juul Labs fight patent infringement cases.

Besides directly increasing Altria's market share, the deal can generally lead to increased market shares and market power of cigarette companies. At least up until the FDA was given authority over vaping products (the 'deeming rule') in 2016, market concentration and entry barriers in the vaping market were low, with cigarette companies having relatively small market shares and facing strong competition from independents selling in vape shops and online. However, as the vaping market becomes more established and the major firms become more entrenched, cigarette companies may be positioned to deter the entry of new firms and products. As previously employed in the cigarette market, they may engage in predatory and discriminatory pricing, limit retail shelf space and expand their product lines to fill market niches.

Through its effects on market competition, the FDA will play a major role in how the Altria-Juul Labs deal affects the vaping market. FDA regulation can have a major impact through its enforcement of the deeming rule, especially through their impact on the survival of the independent firms. Although new or modified tobacco products will eventually need FDA permission to legally enter the US market, the FDA has not yet been enforcing the requirements that all new e-cigarette products must be approved. Substantially modified or new brands of e-cigarettes (eg, Juul copycats) have freely entered the market since the deeming rule went into effect. As suggested above, the deal may encourage stricter FDA regulation. Indeed, Altria and Juul Labs will have stronger incentives to encourage stricter regulations, since new offerings will need to secure new product approvals. Cigarette companies, with their previous regulatory experience, are well positioned to overcome regulatory hurdles. Market competition, especially from non-cigarette firms with less regulatory experience and product innovation, would then be reduced.

### Commercialization of user data by developers of medicines-related apps: a content analysis [^6c56ae8f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Developers of medicines-related apps collect a variety of technical, health-related, and identifying user information to improve and tailor services. User data may also be used for promotional purposes. Apps, for example, may be used to skirt regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising of medicines. Researchers have documented routine and extensive sharing of user data with third parties for commercial purposes, but little is known about the ways that app developers or "first" parties employ user data.

Objective

We aimed to investigate the nature of user data collection and commercialization by developers of medicines-related apps.

Approach

We conducted a content analysis of apps' store descriptions, linked websites, policies, and sponsorship prospectuses for prominent medicines-related apps found in the USA, Canada, Australia, and UK Google Play stores in late 2017. Apps were included if they pertained to the prescribing, administration, or use of medicines, and were interactive. Two independent coders extracted data from documents using a structured, open-ended instrument. We performed open, inductive coding to identify the range of promotional strategies involving user data for commercial purposes and wrote descriptive memos to refine and detail these codes.

Key Results

Ten of 24 apps primarily provided medication adherence services; 14 primarily provided medicines information. The majority (71%, 17/24) outlined at least one promotional strategy involving users' data for commercial purposes which included personalized marketing of the developer's related products and services, highly tailored advertising, third-party sponsorship of targeted content or messaging, and sale of aggregated customer insights to stakeholders.

Conclusions

App developers may employ users' data in a feedback loop to deliver highly targeted promotional messages from developers, and commercial sponsors, including the pharmaceutical industry. These practices call into question developers' claims about the trustworthiness and independence of purportedly evidenced-based medicines information and may create a risk for mis- or overtreatment.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^3939bce9]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Previously studies have shown that 'demand-side' interventions to counter online misinformation have focused on reducing the consumption and spread of misinformation among news consumers on online platforms. Although interventions such as accuracy prompts and digital literacy tips can increase the quality of news that people share, this line of work has found limited support for news credibility signals in increasing the demand for credible newsor in reducing misperceptions among users. Such constraints in changing user behaviour may also apply to credibility signals like watermarks for detecting AI misinformation. Moreover, whereas such interventions are only effective for the small subset of users who are exposed to misinformation, our complementary 'supply-side' approach targets entities and individuals who might not necessarily consume or spread misinformation themselves.

Relative to existing proposals of supply-side interventions to curb the production of misinformation, which involve social media platforms banning the advertising of false newsor changing their advertising-driven business model altogether, we outline a middle path to suggest that accounting for the preferences of advertisers and consumers could help counter the financing of online misinformation. Although platforms could coordinate to identify and deplatform misinformation websites, prior work suggests that misinformation websites nearly always resurface through alternative providers unless the incentive to produce misinformation is addressed. Moreover, the information interventions that we identify are also an improvement on the status quo, whereby advertisers and consumers can only implement their preferences by participating in boycotts of digital platforms over their inability to contain misinformation. Allowing advertisers to more easily observe and control whether their advertisements appear on misinformation websites could also limit backlash by enabling advertisers to better implement their preferences rather than participating in one-off short-term advertising boycotts. Additionally, since consistently providing negative information can create lasting associations for consumers, providing information disclosures on every advertisement for whether the advertising company involved appears on misinformation websites could have a substantial effect on consumer demand over time, providing incentives for advertising companies to reduce advertising on misinformation websites.

### Improving dissemination products and practices for community-based organisations serving LGBTQ + communities in the USA: a thematic analysis [^4c361b24]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

In the USA, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) people report higher rates of tobacco use than non-LGBTQ+ people due to diverse factors, from anti-LGBTQ stigma to targeted marketing by the tobacco industry. There is an opportunity to support behavioural changes by delivering evidence-based health communication campaigns through community-based organisations (CBOs), but an insufficient evidence base and organisational resource restrictions limit this potential. Our previous research with CBO staff and leaders serving LGBTQ+ communities identified gaps in evidence-based campaigns, such as insufficient centering of LGBTQ+ communities in campaign development and execution. This qualitative study explores opportunities to improve the products and services supporting the dissemination of evidence-based health communication campaigns for LGBTQ+ audiences.

Methods

We conducted key informant interviews between January and June 2021 with individuals who direct or run health promotion programmes in CBOs serving LGBTQ+ populations in the USA (n = 26 individuals from 22 organisations). Using critical and constructivist perspectives, we leveraged the analysis team and advisory committee's diverse research, lived and practice expertise related to LGBTQ+ health. We employed a team-based, reflexive thematic analysis approach.

Results

We identified two key opportunities. Theme 1 — show us your work: participants requested (a) details about the evidence-based campaigns, including underlying values and extent of community engagement, and (b) information about campaign mechanisms and impact. Theme 2 — support us in our work: participants suggested that evidence-based campaigns should (a) be designed for flexibility and adaptation, (b) offer tools and guidance for adaptation and (c) share granular data and relevant resources. Participants nominated dissemination products and processes to address gaps, including supports to integrate campaigns into multi-level action, data collection tools for adaptation and engagement with campaign developers.

Conclusions

The findings highlight the potential for CBOs to be integral partners in the development and dissemination of evidence-based health communication campaigns that address tobacco-related inequities among LGBTQ+ communities.
