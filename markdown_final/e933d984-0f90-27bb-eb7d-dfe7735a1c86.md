## Question

20 yo M with Gram negative rod bacteremia, large liver abscess, headache and neck pain. Returning traveler from Philippines. Most likely pathogen?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathogen is most likely in a 20-year-old man with Gram-negative rod bacteremia, a large liver abscess, headache, and neck pain, who is a returning traveler from the Philippines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and which organisms classically produce it. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and whether the travel history aligns with known risks. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and weigh competing pathogens. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline immediate management implications, including diagnostics and empiric therapy, while double-checking for pitfalls in identification and treatment delays [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

> Let me first confirm the syndrome: Gram-negative rod bacteremia with a large liver abscess, plus headache and neck pain suggesting possible CNS involvement, in a young adult returning from Southeast Asia. This triad of liver abscess, bacteremia, and metastatic complications is classic for the invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess syndrome, particularly the hypervirulent phenotype that is well described in Asia and increasingly reported globally, including in travelers and migrants from endemic regions [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic fit. The Philippines is within the endemic region for hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp), where colonization rates are higher and invasive syndromes are more common; hvKp is now recognized as a significant cause of pyogenic liver abscess in the United States and Europe as well, reflecting global spread, and travel from Asia is a key risk context for this presentation [^980076ea] [^5538925c].

> I need to check the differential and not jump to conclusions. Amebic liver abscess is a competitor, but it is typically non-bacteremic and caused by Entamoeba histolytica; the presence of Gram-negative rod bacteremia makes amebiasis less likely as the primary pathogen here, though coinfection is possible in endemic settings, so I should keep it in mind if the clinical course deviates from expectations or if serology and imaging suggest amebic disease despite bacteremia [^c07739c2] [^324043b3]. Melioidosis due to Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause abscesses and bacteremia in Southeast Asia, but the classic risk is environmental exposure to soil or water; without that exposure history, and given the strong predilection of hvKp for liver abscess with metastatic spread, melioidosis is less likely in this scenario, though I should remain vigilant if the course is atypical or if cultures are misidentified [^74b48d08] [^3338296a]. Typhoid/paratyphoid can cause fever, headache, and hepatomegaly, but liver abscess is not a typical manifestation and the bacteremia is usually Salmonella rather than the Gram-negative rod profile described, which further lowers its likelihood here [^192cc3ae] [^012fdd3d].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology that explains the CNS symptoms. Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains, especially K1 and K2 serotypes, have enhanced mucoviscosity and virulence factors that facilitate hematogenous spread from the gut to the liver and then to distant sites, including the brain and eyes, producing meningitis, endophthalmitis, and brain abscesses; this mechanistic plausibility strengthens the case for hvKp as the unifying cause of liver abscess, bacteremia, and CNS involvement in this patient [^5538925c] [^980076ea] [^5468385d].

> Next, I should review immediate management implications. I need to ensure early source control with percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess, because antibiotics alone are insufficient for large pyogenic collections, and I should obtain blood and abscess cultures before starting antibiotics if feasible to guide targeted therapy; empiric coverage should prioritize activity against K. pneumoniae, typically a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone, with consideration of adding an aminoglycoside initially for synergy in severe sepsis, while monitoring for ESBL production and adjusting based on susceptibilities [^9603fafe] [^5538925c]. But wait, what if the organism is ESBL-producing? In that case, I should escalate to a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam based on local resistance patterns and culture results, and I must not forget to evaluate for metastatic complications, including urgent ophthalmology assessment for endophthalmitis and neuroimaging if neurologic signs progress, given the high risk of ocular and CNS seeding with hvKp [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

> I should double-check diagnostic pitfalls. Automated identification systems can misidentify unusual Gram-negative rods; if the clinical picture is discordant with the lab report, I need to request further identification methods and consider hvKp-specific markers or send isolates for reference testing, especially if the phenotype is hypermucoviscous or the clinical course suggests metastatic spread, to avoid delays in appropriate therapy and source control [^3338296a] [^5538925c].

> Putting this together, the most likely pathogen is hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae causing invasive liver abscess syndrome with bacteremia and CNS involvement in a returning traveler from the Philippines. This diagnosis best fits the microbiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, and mandates prompt abscess drainage, empiric coverage active against K. pneumoniae, and surveillance for metastatic complications to prevent vision loss or neurologic sequelae [^5538925c] [^980076ea] [^9603fafe].

---

The most likely pathogen is **Klebsiella pneumoniae** (hypervirulent strain), given the triad of Gram-negative rod bacteremia, large liver abscess, and CNS symptoms in a returning traveler from the Philippines. This hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) syndrome is well-described in Southeast Asia [^5538925c], with **high rates of bacteremia and metastatic complications** (meningitis, endophthalmitis) [^980076ea] [^5538925c]. Immediate empiric therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) [^4ab40a41] is recommended, with early percutaneous drainage of the abscess and close monitoring for metastatic infection [^9603fafe] [^5538925c].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is endemic in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, and is increasingly reported globally [^5538925c] [^980076ea]. Risk factors include **diabetes mellitus**, male sex, and recent travel to endemic regions; however, **immunocompetent patients can also be affected** [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

---

## Clinical presentation

The classic presentation includes:

- **Primary liver abscess**: Often large, multiloculated, and in the right hepatic lobe [^notfound].

- **Bacteremia**: Present in ~50% of cases, facilitating metastatic spread [^cb201b92].

- **Metastatic infections**: Commonly meningitis, endophthalmitis, and brain abscesses [^5538925c] [^307b97e7].

- **CNS involvement**: Headache and neck stiffness indicate meningitis or meningoencephalitis, which are frequent complications [^5538925c] [^1b6be8cb].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae possesses **distinct virulence factors**, including the **magA/rmpA** genes and **hypermucoviscosity**, enabling mucosal invasion, portal venous spread to the liver, and hematogenous dissemination to distant sites [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Blood cultures**: Positive for Gram-negative rods, often K. pneumoniae [^5538925c].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT reveals a large liver abscess, typically multiloculated [^notfound].

- **CSF analysis**: If CNS symptoms are present, lumbar puncture may show Gram-negative rods, elevated protein, and low glucose [^notfound].

- **Molecular testing**: PCR can identify hypervirulent strains and virulence genes (magA, rmpA) [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Entamoeba histolytica | - Liver abscess <br/> - Travel to endemic areas | - No bacteremia <br/> - Serology positive [^notfound] |
| Burkholderia pseudomallei | - Abscesses <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Sepsis | - Exposure to soil/water <br/> - Different microbiology [^c2f2da9d] |
| Salmonella typhi | - Enteric fever <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly | - Different clinical course <br/> - Less common liver abscess [^notfound] |
| Staphylococcus aureus | - Skin/soft tissue infection <br/> - Bacteremia | - Gram-positive cocci <br/> - Different risk factors [^notfound] |

---

## Management

- **Empiric antibiotics**: Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) are first-line [^notfound].

- **Source control**: Early percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess is essential [^9603fafe].

- **Duration**: Antibiotics for 2–4 weeks, with longer courses if CNS involvement is present [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Close surveillance for metastatic complications, particularly CNS and ocular involvement [^5538925c].

---

## Prognosis

Mortality ranges from 5–14%, with higher rates in the setting of delayed diagnosis, CNS involvement, or inadequate source control [^5538925c] [^8462edea]. Early recognition and aggressive management significantly improve outcomes [^5538925c].

---

The most likely pathogen is **hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae**, given the clinical triad and travel history. Prompt empiric therapy, source control, and monitoring for metastatic complications are critical to management [^5538925c] [^980076ea].

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease. Lymphoma would be the most likely malignancy given her age and constitutional symptoms.

Meningococcal disease — clinical presentation and course generally occurs 1–10 days after exposure, with meningitis in approximately 50% of cases in the United States, approximately 30% presenting with meningococcemia, and an additional 15% in the United States, primarily among adults > 65 years of age, presenting as bacteremic pneumonia; among infants and children aged < 2 years, symptoms can be nonspecific and neck stiffness might be absent. Meningococcemia can include abrupt onset of fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, and a petechial or purpuric rash which can progress to purpura fulminans, and often involves hypotension, acute adrenal hemorrhage, and multiorgan failure. The disease progresses rapidly with a case-fatality rate of 10%–15% even with antimicrobial drug treatment, and up to 20% of survivors can have long-term health effects such as deafness or amputations due to necrosis of the extremities.

### Invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, California, USA [^7fe810c0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We found 4 additional patients infected with K. pneumoniae in 2009 who did not have invasive infections. Briefly, a 21-year-old pregnant recent emigrant from Yemen and a 35-year-old Hispanic pregnant woman each had a urinary tract infection; a 78-year-old Vietnamese man had nosocomial aspiration pneumonia in which K. pneumoniae was considered a pathogen; and a 34-year-old African American woman who was receiving mechanical ventilation had sputum transiently colonized with K. pneumoniae.

This case series confirms that the clinical syndrome of K. pneumoniae bacteremia and primary liver abscess has emerged in Alameda County. Other sites of infection included kidney, brain, lung, pleural space, neck, and mediastinum, as reported in Asia. Although K. pneumoniae infections are predominantly a community-associated phenomenon, nosocomial infections as we observed have been reported. Death reflected underlying disease rather than K. pneumoniae infection in this study. We present evidence that hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae also can behave as a colonizer or low-virulence pathogen, as manifested in our patients with urinary tract infection, sputum colonization, and aspiration pneumonia.

Our K. pneumoniae isolates appear similar to those from Asia with respect to in vitro susceptibility, capsule serotypes, and magA and rmpA genes. Most of our patients were Asian but of widely dispersed origin and without recent travel to Asia. The number of thrombotic complications in this series is striking. Such complications appear not to have been noted in the literature, and this finding requires further investigation. Our data show the emergence of hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae in northern California and suggest that it might be unrecognized elsewhere in North America.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: an emerging problem in north America [^b030508e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Before the 1980s, Escherichia coli was the most common cause of pyogenic liver abscess, but more recently, Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as the most common organism in the United States and Taiwan.

Objective

Our goal is to present a case of K. pneumoniae liver abscess (KLA) and review the risk factors, presenting symptoms, complications, and treatment of this disease that is emerging in North America.

Case Report

We present a patient who was found to have KLA complicated by bacteremia and sepsis.

Conclusions

Initially described in the Asian literature, KLA is an emerging problem in North America. We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of the diagnosis, risk factors, potential complications-including bacteremia and disseminated infection-and treatment.

### Evaluation and management of illness in a child after international travel [^e93317ad]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

International travel by children is becoming increasingly common over the last few decades. As a result, clinicians may be asked to assist in the evaluation and treatment of an ill child after international travel. Along with recording the typical thorough history of present illness and medical history, the physician who cares for a child in this situation will have to take a thorough travel history and consider not only local conditions, but also possible pathogens that the child may have encountered during the journey. A detailed travel history should be routinely performed to investigate specific exposures. Reference materials are available that can guide the clinician in determining which infectious agents are endemic to various areas of the world. With the exception of obtaining a basic laboratory screen, further evaluation of the young patient should be dictated by the most likely cause of the illness. Repeated testing and examinations and close follow-up may be necessary to arrive at the proper diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

Pyogenic abscess

Aetiopathogenesis

Frequent organisms of pyogenic abscesses are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus. Hyper-virulent strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae have been responsible for severe emerging diseases for the past two decades, particularly in Southeast Asia. Some of them are responsible for bacteremia combined with multiple abscesses (monomicrobial liver abscesses, endophthalmitis, brain abscesses).

The differential diagnosis of pyogenic abscess is the amoebaean abscess.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Pyogenic liver abscess with a focus on Klebsiella pneumoniae as a primary pathogen: an emerging disease with unique clinical characteristics [^cb201b92]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pyogenic liver abscess is a common intraabdominal infection. Historically, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been the predominant causative agent. Klebsiella liver abscess (KLA) was first reported in Taiwan and has surpassed E. coli as the number one isolate from patients with hepatic abscesses in that country and reports from other countries, including the United States, have increased. We examined the microbiologic trends of pyogenic liver abscess at our institution to determine if a similar shift in etiologic agents was occurring.

Methods

We examined all cases of liver abscess at our institution from 1999 to 2003 via a retrospective chart review of inpatient records and reviewed the English literature via a MEDLINE search for all U.S. cases of KLA.

Results

Since 1966, only 12 cases of KLA have been reported in the United States. We report six cases of KLA at our institution alone; 2 patients were not Asian, and 4 were not diabetic. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) was the most common cause of pyogenic hepatic abscess at our institution over the last 5-yr period. When comparing Klebsiella versus other causes of pyogenic liver abscess, there were no significant differences in demographics or laboratory findings; however, most of our Klebsiella cases occurred among Filipinos. Review of the 18 cases of K. pneumoniae liver abscess in the United States showed that Klebsiella cases occurred predominantly among middle-aged men; 83% had concurrent bacteremia and 28% had metastatic complications. An increasing number of cases were reported from the United States since the mid-1990s.

Conclusions

These data suggest that KLA may represent an emerging disease in Western countries, such as the United States. The diagnosis of K. pneumoniae should be considered in all cases of liver abscess, and appropriate antibiotic therapy and a diagnostic work-up for metastatic complications should be employed.

### A 47-year-old returning traveler with shock [^6796e1c6]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old man with no significant past medical history, originally from Indonesia, was brought to the ED of an urban US medical center after being found collapsed on the sidewalk in respiratory distress and with an altered sensorium. Upon arrival to the ED, he was tachypneic, with increased work of breathing and an oxygen saturation of 88% on 100% nonrebreather mask, so he was immediately intubated. Following intubation, he became profoundly hypotensive, requiring aggressive crystalloid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were administered, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir. Further history elicited subsequently from family members revealed that the patient had returned from a 2-week vacation in Indonesia 6 days prior to presentation. According to relatives, he appeared to be in his usual state of health upon his return and was not seen by anyone thereafter, but in the interim he reportedly had an episode of epistaxis, and text messages received from him became progressively more bizarre.

### Liver abscess and bacteremia caused by lactobacillus: role of probiotics? Case report and review of the literature [^a14b826d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactobacilli are non-spore forming, lactic acid producing, gram-positive rods. They are a part of the normal gastrointestinal and genitourinary microbiota and have rarely been reported to be the cause of infections. Lactobacilli species are considered non-pathogenic organisms and have been used as probiotics to prevent antibiotic associated diarrhea. There are sporadic reported cases of infections related to lactobacilli containing probiotics.

Case Presentation

In this paper we discuss a case of an 82 year old female with liver abscess and bacteremia from lactobacillus after using probiotics containing lactobacilli in the course of her treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis. The Lactobacillus strain identification was not performed and therefore, both commensal microbiota and the probiotic product should be considered as possible sources of the strain.

Conclusion

Lactobacilli can lead to bacteremia and liver abscesses in some susceptible persons and greater awareness of this potential side effect is warranted with the increasing use of probiotics containing lactobacilli.

### Melioidosis in a returning traveller [^74b48d08]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 66-year-old man returned to the UK from Thailand with a 2-week history of new confusion, hallucinations, fever with rigours and productive cough. He had not responded to (unspecified) antibiotic treatment in Thailand. On examination he was afebrile, with an abbreviated mental test score of 8/10 and no other findings on systemic examination. He was treated with ceftriaxone in response to discovery of a Gram-negative organism in blood. This was converted to meropenem on the clinical suspicion of our microbiologist, on the basis of a history of contact with surface water in the Far East. A blood culture subsequently confirmed Burkholderia pseudomallei. His condition remained stable for approximately 4 days, but then deteriorated over the course of the next 2 weeks with pneumonia and subsequent formation of disseminated abscesses. Treatment was withdrawn as his condition deteriorated to the point at which survival was deemed impossible and he subsequently died.

### Pyogenic liver abscess: Klebsiella as an emerging pathogen [^4ed2ac7f]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with pyogenic liver abscesses often present to the emergency department with fever of unknown origin. After the appropriate clinical evaluation, cross-sectional imaging may be performed in the emergent setting to aid in localization of fever source. On computed tomography imaging, pyogenic liver abscesses may present as inflammatory masses in the liver, with Escherichia coli as the most common pathogen. We report an emerging hepatic pathogen as the cause, Klebsiella pneumoniae.

### Invasive infection with hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae: multiple cases presenting to a single emergency department in the United States [^516023fb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A distinctive form of community-acquired invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae infection has been well described in Southeast Asia for more than 2 decades. The clinical syndrome includes liver abscess, bacteremia, and metastatic infection. It has recently been linked to a virulent hypermucoviscous K pneumoniae phenotype and to a specific genotype. As of 2008, there were only 2 published cases of invasive infection caused by this strain of K pneumoniae in the United States. We report 4 recent cases presenting to a single public hospital emergency department in northern California, which may signal the emergence of this clinical syndrome in North America.

### Streptococcus suis meningitis, United States [^61083363]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Streptococcus suis, commensal and opportunistic pathogens of swine, and prevalent zoonotic agents worldwide, are α-hemolytic gram-positive cocci with 35 different serotypes. In humans, S. suis infection has been associated with bacterial meningitis, septic shock, arthritis, pneumonia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Most at risk are those who handle or eat undercooked pork, e.g. farm workers, butchers, and slaughterhouse workers. Most cases have been reported in Europe or Southeast Asia. Meningitis, first recognized in 1968 in Denmark, is the most common clinical manifestation of human infection with S. suis. A case of S. suis meningitis in a pig farmer was reported in the United States. Here, we describe another case in a 60-year-old man from San Francisco who had consumed raw pork while traveling in the Philippines.

In June 2003, this man became ill with fever, diaphoresis, headache, nausea, and anorexia. He had just returned from a 7-month vacation in the Philippines. Three days after symptoms onset, his physician prescribed doxycycline. Symptoms continued and he was admitted to a local hospital 5 days later with a fever of 38.9°C, nuchal rigidity, headache, and general malaise.

The patient described no recent contact with sick persons; past medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, he was somnolent but fully oriented, with no focal findings on neurologic examination and only slight nuchal rigidity. He had a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm³, including 16,400/mm³ neutrophils. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed leukocyte count of 487/μL with 80% polymorphonuclear cells and 18% lymphocytes, and glucose and protein levels < 20 mg/dL and < 167 mg/dL, respectively. Gram stain of CSF showed gram-positive cocci in pairs (Figure). Empiric therapy (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin) for bacterial meningitis was begun. Computed tomographic scan of the head showed only sinusitis; findings of chest radiograph and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative.

Laboratory studies revealed a leukocytosis of 18.6 k/mm³ (normal range: 4–10 k/mm³), microcytic hypochromic anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dl (12–16 g/dl), elevated alkaline phosphatase of 435 IU/L (44–147 IU/L), mild elevation of AST and ALT (97 and 85 IU/L respectively; normal ranges: 5–40 IU/L) and normal bilirubin. Plain chest X-ray (CXR) showed an elevated right hemidiaphragm with a right lower lobe infiltration and pleural effusion (Fig. 1a). A CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a 6.6 × 4.7 cm hypodense, multiloculated mass in posterior aspect of right hepatic lobe (Fig. 1c, d). Empiric antibiotics with imipenem and vancomycin were begun. The following day with the use of ultrasound guidance, 20 mL of purulent fluid specimen was aspirated from the liver lesion and a percutaneous pigtail catheter was placed for drainage (Fig. 1b). Gram stain from the aspirated materials showed rare Gram positive cocci, Gram negative rods but predominantly Gram positive rods. The blood cultures grew Gram positive rods. Bacteriologic studies confirmed that they were lactobacilli species from both the liver abscess and blood, however the exact strain identification was not performed. Her hospitalization was complicated with cardiac arrest which she survived. She was hospitalized for 3 weeks with near complete resolution of the hepatic abscess which was demonstrated on repeat imaging (Fig. 2a, b).

### The clinical importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis and management of bloodstream infections [^616bf133]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Accurate identification of blood isolates to the species level and identification of the source of infection and/or the portal of entry are crucial for optimal management of these infections. These investigations-in addition to clinical findings and laboratory and imaging studies-are central to informing and directing efficient and effective diagnostic examinations and to choosing the optimal antimicrobial regimen. Four case studies that demonstrate the importance of identifying the causative agents and the source of infection are discussed to illustrate the central importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis of bacteremia and bloodstream infections associated with infections at other sites.

The Study

On August 20, 2008, a 35-year-old man from Switzerland was admitted to the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen, Switzerland. He had extradural cranial abscess of the right parietal area and a defect in adjacent bone. In May and June 2008, he traveled to Singapore and Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and the Perhentian Islands), then to southwestern (Ko Samui, Ko Tau) and northern (Chiang Mai) Thailand where he went trekking and river rafting.

The patient did not remember receiving a head injury during his trip. Seventeen days after returning to Switzerland, he had a swelling in the right parietal area of the head. The parietal bulge increased, but puncture by his general practitioner showed no aspirate. During the next 7 weeks, the bulge became painful and secretion of pus was noted at the time of admission.

At admission, his general condition was good and he had no signs of systemic inflammation. He did not have any neurologic deficits or other abnormal findings. Test results for complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein and creatinine levels, and liver functions were normal. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed the abscess and a small defect of bone (Figure). The abscess and part of the cranial bone were then surgically removed.

Figure

Culture material from the abscess and biopsy specimens of the abscess capsule and the cranial bone grew gram-negative, oxidase-positive rods, and smooth creamy colonies on sheep blood agar after incubation for 48 hours at 35°C. For identification, a suspension of the isolate was prepared and tested in a UNMIC/ID-62 panel of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland) per the manufacturer's instructions. This system identified the isolate as B. cepacia (99% confidence). When a species is identified with > 90% confidence, the Phoenix System gives an identification result as a measure of likelihood that the identification is the only correct one.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess and endophthalmitis [^3791694f]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 36-year-old man was referred to the general medical team with endophthalmitis. He was noted to have raised inflammatory markers and deranged liver function tests on admission. Subsequent abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a liver abscess requiring percutaneous drainage. A common human pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, was cultured from multiple sites. K pneumoniae has virulent serotypes (K1 and K2) that can cause primary liver abscess with metastatic infections. Cases have previously been predominantly reported in Southeast Asia but are increasing in prevalence in Europe and North America. The main known risk factor for the disease is diabetes mellitus. Swift antibiotic therapy, ophthalmology review and percutaneous drainage of any liver abscess are essential. Early recognition of the syndrome, despite potentially few initial symptoms, can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. The authors report the first recorded case of K pneumoniae liver abscess with endophthalmitis in the UK.

Most post-travel infections become apparent soon after returning from abroad, but incubation periods vary, and some syndromes can present months to years after initial infection or after travel. Common syndromes observed in returned travelers include acute undifferentiated fevers, respiratory illnesses, acute or chronic gastrointestinal illnesses (including diarrhea and hepatitis), illnesses involving the central nervous system (e.g., meningitis or encephalitis), dermatologic complaints, and eosinophilia. A syndromic approach can help direct the differential diagnosis and diagnostic workup, and healthcare professionals who manage ill returned travelers are encouraged to stay informed of current outbreaks in destination countries, with a wealth of resources available.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^980076ea]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile encapsulated bacteria, and strains are separated into two pathotypes: classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp). CKp strains are frequently multidrug resistant and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in immunocompromised individuals. HvKp can also cause these types of infections but are distinct in their ability to cause severe community-acquired tissue-invasive infections in immunocompetent individuals. While hvKp infections are most prevalent in populations in Asian countries, their incidence is rising globally, and hvKp is now recognized as a significant cause of pyogenic (pus-filled) liver abscesses in the United States and Europe.

K. pneumoniae is a common colonizer of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, detected in 4%–35% of stool samples in Western countries and in 18%–88% of individuals in endemic regions. In Asian populations, approximately 10% of individuals colonized with K. pneumoniae harbor strains that are likely hvKp. However, the prevalence of hvKp GI carriage in Western countries remains poorly defined, as most studies do not distinguish between cKp and hvKp strains.

KLAs can occur when hvKp migrates from the gut to the liver via the portal vein, typically following bowel leakage. However, KLAs can also arise from other primary sites, such as lung or wound infections. Gut colonization by hvKp is also thought to facilitate community transmission through the fecal-oral route.

Once established, hvKp liver abscesses are difficult to treat with antibiotics and are prone to metastatic spread, leading to conditions such as endophthalmitis or meningitis that can result in vision loss or death, respectively. Reported mortality rates for KLAs range from 5% to 40%. Despite the significant clinical impact of KLAs, the mechanisms underlying the poor outcomes are not well understood. In this review, we explore the pathogenesis of KLAs, and the challenges associated with management and treatment of these infections.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^e5880e97]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is among the most common gram-negative bacteria encountered by physicians worldwide. It is a common hospital-acquired pathogen, causing urinary tract infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and intraabdominal infections. K. pneumoniae is also a potential community-acquired pathogen. In this international collaborative study, we evaluated geographic differences and trends in three prominent presentations of community-acquired Klebsiella infection.

First, K. pneumoniae has been a recognized pulmonary pathogen since its discovery > 100 years ago. The classic clinical presentation is dramatic: toxic presentation with sudden onset, high fever, and hemoptysis (currant jelly sputum). Chest radiographic abnormalities such as bulging interlobar fissure and cavitary abscesses are prominent. However, the incidence of community-acquired Klebsiella pneumonia has apparently declined in the United States. In studies from the 1920s to the 1960s, K. pneumoniae was considered an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia; however, in the last decade K. pneumoniae accounted for < 1% of cases of pneumonia requiring hospitalization in North America.

Second, a striking clinical finding concerning a new manifestation of community-acquired K. pneumoniae infections has been documented. An unusual invasive presentation of K. pneumoniae infection, primary bacteremic liver abscess, has been described by numerous investigators in Asia; > 900 patients with Klebsiella liver abscess have been reported from Taiwan in the last 10 years. In addition, case reports and small series from Korea, Singapore, Japan, India, and Thailand have been published. The Taiwanese patients with K. pneumoniae liver abscess have no history of hepatobiliary disease. Seventy percent of such patients have diabetes mellitus; 11% to 12% of the reported patients with Klebsiella liver abscess have other septic metastatic lesions, including pulmonary emboli or abscess, brain abscess, pyogenic meningitis, endophthalmitis, prostatic abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or psoas abscess.

### Typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a call to action [^012fdd3d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

THE DISEASE AND PATHOGENESIS

Typhoid fever is caused by infection with S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus. Paratyphoid fever results from infection with the related organism S. enterica subspecies enterica serovar paratyphi (S. Paratyphi), which is divided into three subtypes – S. Paratyphi A, B, and C. S. Typhi and Paratyphi are collectively referred to as typhoidal Salmonella serovars and infection with either can result in the clinical syndrome of enteric fever. Unlike other S. enterica serovars, S. Typhi, and Paratyphi are human-restricted pathogens that cause a systemic illness progressing to an asymptomatic chronic carrier state in some individuals.

Transmission of S. Typhi and Paratyphi occurs through consumption of contaminated food or water via short-cycle or long-cycle transmission. Short-cycle transmission is defined as the contamination of food and water in the immediate environment through inadequate hygiene and sanitation measures, either by shedding from acute or chronic carriers. Long-cycle transmission is defined as contamination of the broader environment, such as pollution of water supplies by sewage, or inadequate treatment of piped water. The relative contribution of each transmission mode may vary depending on the epidemiological context and may differ between S. Typhi and Paratyphi.

The clinical presentation of typhoid fever is highly variable, ranging from a mild-illness characterized by low-grade fever and malaise, through to a severe life-threatening systemic illness with multiple complications, including intestinal perforation, intestinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. Ingestion of bacteria and systemic invasion is followed by a short-lived period of asymptomatic primary bacteraemia. The incubation period, typically lasts 7–14 days, but can range from 3 to 60 days dependent, in part, on the size of the inoculum. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and include fever, malaise, anorexia, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and dry cough. Sporadic, asymptomatic, shedding of the bacteria in the stool can occur prior to the development of symptomatic disease. Clinical signs may include high fever, relative bradycardia, abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or rose-spots. S. Paratyphi may cause a milder disease than S. Typhi, although field data from the largest case series to-date, comprising 609 enteric fever patients in Nepal suggest that both serovars cause an indistinguishable clinical syndrome.

###: a rare causative agent of pyogenic liver abscess [^fb4eb751]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 26-year-old man who was previously well presented to the emergency in septic shock. He had a preceding history of fever, right upper abdominal pain and jaundice. On examination, there was tenderness over the right hypochondrium and epigastrium, without features of generalised peritonitis. His blood tests were suggestive of sepsis with deranged liver function tests. CT scan of the abdomen showed multiples abscesses in various segments of the liver and a thrombus in the inferior venacava, without any other intraabdominal focus of infection. The abscess was aspirated under sonographic guidance, and the cultures grew Streptococcus constellatus species of S. milleri group (SMG). He received crystalline penicillin, based on culture sensitivity and underwent drainage of the abscess. There was a clinical improvement and he was subsequently discharged in a stable condition. On 3months follow-up, there was a complete resolution of the liver abscess and normalisation of the liver function tests.

### More than meets the eye: Klebsiella pneumoniae invasive liver abscess syndrome presenting with endophthalmitis [^8dda4fca]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Endophthalmitis is a feared complication of pyogenic liver abscesses caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. First described in East Asia in the 1980s, this invasive syndrome is only recently emerging in Europe and America.

Case Report

We describe an 84-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with fever, orbital cellulitis, and bilateral visual loss. Although the patient had no overt abdominal symptoms, computed tomography scan revealed a pyogenic liver abscess. Blood cultures were positive for K. pneumoniae. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous ceftriaxone and intravitreal ceftazidime. A unilateral vitrectomy was performed. The patient survived with severe visual sequelae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? K. pneumoniae pyogenic liver abscess with metastatic endophthalmitis is a relatively new syndrome that should be considered in patients presenting with acute vision loss who appear septic, with or without abdominal complaints. Early recognition prohibits delays in lifesaving treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — clinical manifestations in advanced immunosuppression often present as disseminated, multi-organ infection in people not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with early symptoms that may be minimal, can precede detectable mycobacteremia by several weeks, and may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities associated with disseminated disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels; hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be found on examination or imaging, and localized disease can produce other focal findings. In people receiving and responding to ART with an increase in CD4 cell counts, localized manifestations have been reported more often, including cervical, intraabdominal or mediastinal lymphadenitis, pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, or central nervous system infection. Localized syndromes may also reflect immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome clinically indistinguishable from active MAC infection with bacteremia generally absent; MAC-associated IRIS can occur as "unmasking" IRIS in subclinical MAC or "paradoxical" IRIS in those with previously established MAC disease.

Her past medical history included a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas with metastases to her spleen, for which she had surgical resection of the body and tail of the pancreas and a total splenectomy 3 months before admission. She had not been receiving any postsplenectomy antibiotic prophylaxis or additional vaccinations. She recovered well without complications and surgical scars were healing well.

The patient was vaccinated as per the national childhood vaccination program in Vietnam. She had no sexual or social history which put her at risk of HIV transmission. There was no recent tuberculosis exposure nor recent travel outside of Vietnam or direct contact with farm or domestic animals.

Full blood count showed hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL, white blood cell count 26.12 × 10⁹/L (91.2% neutrophils, 3.8% lymphocytes, 3.9% monocytes, 0.9% eosinophils and 0.2% basophils), platelets 271 × 10⁹/L, CRP 154.2 mg/L and blood glucose 7.1 mmol/L. Lumbar puncture was performed, which showed 2363 leukocytes/µL with 94% polymorphonuclear cells and 6% mononuclear cells, 1000 red blood cells/µL, protein 1.97 g/L, glucose 1.8 mmol/L and lactate 10.1 mmol/L in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Empirical intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 4 g daily and vancomycin 3.6 g daily were commenced. Raised intracranial pressure characterized by lethargy and hypertension was managed with mannitol. After 1 hour of growth, CSF grew Gram-positive cocci. Due to persistent fevers, a repeat lumbar puncture was performed on day 12 of admission. CSF results showed white blood cells 24 cells/µL (100% mononuclear cells), nil red blood cells, protein 0.18 g/L, glucose 4.1 mmol/L and lactate 2.0 mmol/L. A computed tomography scan of the brain, without contrast, was normal without evidence of hydrocephalus, identifiable intracranial abscesses or hemorrhage. A chest radiograph and subsequent ultrasound scan of the lungs showed small bilateral pleural effusions, which were more prominent on the right.

The patient improved clinically and became more alert and eventually defervesced. She continued to have a headache, although it had improved markedly.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^c72144fb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We initiated a worldwide collaborative study, including 455 episodes of bacteremia, to elucidate the clinical patterns of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Historically, community-acquired pneumonia has been consistently associated with K. pneumoniae. Only four cases of community-acquired bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were seen in the 2-year study period in the United States, Argentina, Europe, or Australia; none were in alcoholics. In contrast, 53 cases of bacteremic K. pneumoniae pneumonia were observed in South Africa and Taiwan, where an association with alcoholism persisted (p = 0.007). Twenty-five cases of a distinctive syndrome consisting of K. pneumoniae bacteremia in conjunction with community-acquired liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis were observed. A distinctive form of K. pneumoniae infection, often causing liver abscess, was identified, almost exclusively in Taiwan.

### First documentation of human crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Kenya [^82683e14]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

To the Editor: On October 21, 2000, a previously healthy 25-year-old male farmer was admitted to a mission hospital in western Kenya with an acute hemorrhagic illness. Four days before admission, the patient had rapid onset of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle pains, and diarrhea, which became bloody. On admission his temperature was 36.4°C, pulse was 60/minute, respiratory rate was 20/minute, and blood pressure was 90/40 mm Hg. In addition to the signs and symptoms listed above, the only other abnormal finding on admission was neck stiffness. The differential diagnoses included bacterial dysentery and meningitis. Results of a blood smear for malaria parasites and Widal test for typhoid were negative, and cerebrospinal fluid and urine examinations were normal.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^0f81775d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The third striking clinical observation is the preponderance of K. pneumoniae as a cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults in Taiwan, even in the absence of liver abscess or other sites of infection. The proportion of cases of culture-proven bacterial meningitis due to K. pneumoniae in one Taiwanese hospital increased from 8% during 1981 and 1986 to 18% during 1987 to 1995. In contrast, in a recent large review only 3 (1.2%) of 253 cases of community-acquired bacterial meningitis from the Massachusetts General Hospital were due to K. pneumoniae.

Given these empiric observations, we established an international collaboration of researchers from each of the world's populated continents. These investigators worked in large tertiary-care hospitals or hospitals serving veterans. One of our aims was to delineate in a single time period, with a consistent set of definitions, global differences in the clinical manifestations of serious K. pneumoniae infections. We also examined the influence of prior antibiotic use on these differences in K. pneumoniae infections.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a new invasive syndrome [^5538925c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known human nosocomial pathogen. Most community-acquired K pneumoniae infections cause pneumonia or urinary tract infections. During the past two decades, however, a distinct invasive syndrome that causes liver abscesses has been increasingly reported in Asia, and this syndrome is emerging as a global disease. In this Review, we summarise the clinical presentation and management as well the microbiological aspects of this invasive disease. Diabetes mellitus and two specific capsular types in the bacterium predispose a patient to the development of liver abscesses and the following metastatic complications: bacteraemia, meningitis, endophthalmitis, and necrotising fasciitis. For patients with this invasive syndrome, appropriate antimicrobial treatment combined with percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses increases their chances of survival. Rapid detection of the hypervirulent strain that causes this syndrome allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus minimising the occurrence of sequelae and improving clinical outcomes.

### Klebsiella invasive syndrome: a challenging diagnosis [^8462edea]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Klebsiella invasive syndrome is a rare condition that typically presents as a liver abscess with metastatic infection, with mortality rates as high as 14% potentially due to diagnostic delay by clinicians. Here, we present a case of a woman in her 60s, who presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meningitis, imaging findings suggestive of possible leptomeningeal carcinomatosis a long with areas of lung consolidation and abdominal nodules and lymphadenopathy, presumably metastatic malignancy. We diagnosed Klebsiella invasive syndrome and treated it conservatively with medical management, including a long course of intravenous antibiotic therapy and supportive care. This is an infrequently encountered clinical entity with potentially fatal consequences, and we hope to add to the existing literature on the subject and drive home the point that it should be considered in the differential diagnoses in the appropriate clinical scenario.

Leptospirosis — clinical presentation outlines incubation, disease spectrum, phases, and severity metrics. The incubation period for leptospirosis is 2–30 days, but illness usually occurs 5–14 days after exposure. Most infections are thought to be asymptomatic, but clinical illness can present as a self-limiting acute febrile illness, estimated to occur in approximately 90% of clinical infections, or as a severe, potentially fatal illness with multiorgan dysfunction in 5%–10% of patients. In patients who progress to severe disease, the illness can be biphasic, with a temporary decrease in fever between phases. The acute, septicemic phase lasts approximately 7 days and presents as an acute febrile illness, while the second or immune phase is characterized by antibody production and the presence of leptospires in the urine. In severe disease, clinical findings can include cardiac arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, hemorrhage, jaundice, liver failure, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary insufficiency, and renal failure, and the classically described syndrome, Weil's Syndrome, consists of renal and liver failure. Among patients with severe disease, the case-fatality ratio is 5%–15%.

### Marked elevation of cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count: an unusual case of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, differential diagnosis, and a brief review of current epidemiology and treatment recommendations [^2df9e50e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is rarely a difficult diagnostic dilemma when a patient presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Unfortunately for the practicing clinician, patients are rarely that straightforward. Patients who are elderly, very young, or immuno-compromised often present with subtle findings, making the correct diagnosis a challenge. In addition, patients being treated with antibiotics may be misleading in their clinical presentation, leading to a missed diagnosis of meningitis. Only when one considers the diagnosis or obtains a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is the correct diagnosis made. Although the clinical scenario may suggest meningitis, it is the cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count that establishes the definitive diagnosis. Despite the advent of systemic antibiotics over 50 years ago, bacterial meningitis continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The following case report details a woman diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis with an extremely high cerebrospinal white blood cell count. Although this is typically thought to be caused by abscesses or malignancy, meningitis alone may cause such an elevation. In addition, a brief review of the current epidemiology and treatment regimens for meningitis is discussed.

B) CT scan of the chest at the level of the aortic arch showing mediastinum abscesses surrounding the trachea. C) Brain magnetic resonance imaging (T1 weighted, spin echo, with contrast) showing multiple intracerebral abscesses (smooth ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema). D) CT scan of the abdomen of patient from panel C, showing a left perinephric abscess and thrombus.

Two patients had neck abscesses, 1 complicated by extensive descending mediastinitis (Figure). One patient had kidney abscesses complicated by septic and bland pulmonary emboli and numerous brain abscesses detected by magnetic resonance imaging (Figure).

Healthcare-associated bacteremia occurred in 3 patients. One patient had sustained bacteremia without a clear source on hospital day 115. Two patients with uncontrolled cancer also had healthcare-associated bacteremia.

Venous thrombotic complications occurred in 6 patients, most diagnosed at admission. Two patients had bland pulmonary emboli, and 1 patient with uncontrolled cancer had thrombosis of an upper extremity vein and both femoral veins. Two other patients had septic pulmonary emboli suggested by computed tomographic scan. One patient with α-thalassemia had kidney abscesses and renal vein thrombosis, followed by femoral deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus. A patient with a neck abscess had a thrombosed neck vein at surgery.

Four patients died, and 1 was lost to follow-up, for a death rate of at least 31%. None died directly of sepsis.

All isolates were resistant in vitro to ampicillin but susceptible to all other antimicrobial drugs tested. Genotyping was performed on isolates from 4 patients. One isolate contained the rmpA gene; 3 contained rmpA and magA genes. Three of these isolates also underwent capsule serotyping; 2 were type K1 and 1 was K2.

### Scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy caused by Rickettsia massiliae [^70f2170d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

On May, 10, 2012, a 13-year-old boy was examined for headache, high fever, and right painful neck and occipital swelling. Six days earlier, a tick had been removed from the top of his scalp, after which signs and symptoms arose and gradually worsened.

Physical examination revealed temperature 39.5°C, pulse rate 70 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. The boy appeared to be in good condition. An ≈1-cm black eschar was noted at the site of the tick bite. Palpation of the neck revealed painful bilateral adenopathies. Other lymph nodes in the occipital region were enlarged. No exanthema was noted, the liver was palpable 1 cm under the costal margins, and the spleen was not enlarged. Laboratory evaluation indicated blood cell counts and liver and kidney function within reference limits, mild elevation of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 1.2 mg/dL [reference < 0.5 mg/dL]), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43 mm/h). Ultrasonography of the neck confirmed the presence of numerous, enlarged, oval lymph nodes (maximum 17 mm) with hilar vascularity within normal limits. A scalp eschar biopsy sample and acute- and convalescent-phase (day 30) serum samples were sent to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia.

### Development of amoebic liver abscess in early pregnancy years after initial amoebic exposure: a case report [^871efd37]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Entamoeba histolytica is a pathogen which is isolated comparatively rarely from travelers returning from tropical/subtropical countries, nevertheless, one not to miss. Concise taking of medical and travel history is key in identifying E. histolytica as the potential culprit. Clinical manifestation of intestinal or extraintestinal amoebiasis several years after exposure is rather uncommon, with most patients reporting typical GI-symptoms like bloody diarrhea and pan-abdominal pain 8–20 weeks after returning from endemic countries. However, overt manifestation of invasive amoebiasis years or even decades after traveling to endemic regions has been reported.

Most features of our case can be regarded as typical for ALA: Localization of a solitary lesion in the right liver lobe, typical clinical, imaging and serology findings in a patient with relevant travel history to endemic countries. The complexity regarding its diagnosis and clinical management arises mainly from the low prevalence of this condition in our developed non-endemic country, the long latency period and above all, the concurrent pregnancy.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^1b6be8cb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In our study, 18% of patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia were alcoholics (p = 0.007) (Table 3). Alcoholics in Africa and Asia may have limited access to health care (perhaps including reduced access to antibiotics) compared with those in the Americas, Europe, and Australia, and may have respiratory symptoms later. A weakness of our study is that we were not able to ascertain the duration of symptoms before each patient was hospitalized. However, a recent study of aborigines from rural northern Australia (35% of whom were alcoholics and most of whom had suboptimal access to health-care facilities) showed that none of 90 admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia had K. pneumoniae infection. The hypothesis that Klebsiella pneumonia is related to poor primary health care for alcoholics may therefore be less plausible.

Bacteremic K. pneumoniae liver abscess occurred almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan (Table 2), consistent with a growing number of reports from Asia describing this distinctive type of infection. K. pneumoniae was the most common cause of liver abscesses in Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea in reports from 1990 to 1999; similarly, numerous reports of liver abscess have recently been published from Hong Kong, Thailand, and Japan (,–). In total, > 900 patients with K. pneumoniae liver abscess have been reported from Asian countries in the last 10 years; in contrast, reports of only 23 patients with this condition have been published from regions outside Asia in this same period.

K. pneumoniae meningitis in adults has also been infrequently reported from North America, Europe, and Australia, in contrast to Taiwan. In our study, five cases of bacteremic K. pneumoniae meningitis were in Taiwanese patients and two in African patients (Table 2). Four (57%) of 7 patients with meningitis had prior diabetes mellitus. Meningitis caused by K. pneumoniae in the United States, Australia, and Europe is most often hospital acquired and associated with prior neurosurgical procedures or instrumentation. However, of 115 cases of K. pneumoniae meningitis reported from Taiwan, 84% were community acquired, and 64% of cases had concurrent Klebsiella bacteremia. Unlike pyogenic liver abscess, the clinical course was fulminant, with a death rate of 57%. The death rate from bacteremic K. pneumoniae meningitis in our series was 71%.

Water-Associated Infections — Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) can occur after exposure to fresh, brackish, or salt water, particularly if the skin's surface is compromised, including from abrasions or lacerations during swimming or wading, bites or stings from marine or aquatic creatures, and punctures from fishhooks. The most virulent SSTI associated with marine and estuarine exposures are due to Vibrio vulnificus and related non-cholera Vibrio spp., whereas for freshwater exposures Aeromonas hydrophila is the most dangerous pathogen. Manifestations can include abscess formation, cellulitis, ecthyma gangrenosum, and necrotizing fasciitis. Pending identification of a specific organism, treat acute infections related to aquatic injury with an antibiotic that provides both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage (e.g., fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin).

Clinical pearls regarding fever in returning travelers — priority pathogens and management cues. Travelers could be infected or colonized with drug-resistant pathogens, especially travelers who were hospitalized abroad or who took antimicrobial agents to treat travelers' diarrhea. Dengue is the most common cause of febrile illness among people who seek medical care after travel to Latin America or Asia, and other arboviral infections, including chikungunya and Zika, are emerging as causes of fever in travelers. Do not overlook common infections (e.g., diarrheal illnesses, pneumonia, pyelonephritis) in the search for exotic diagnoses. Viral hemorrhagic fevers other than dengue are important to identify but rare in travelers; because of the need to institute prompt, specific treatment, always consider the possibility of bacterial infections (e.g., leptospirosis, meningococcemia, rickettsial infections) that can also cause fever and hemorrhage. Keep in mind infection control, public health implications, and requirements for reportable diseases. Malaria is the most common cause of acute undifferentiated fever after travel to Sub-Saharan Africa and other endemic areas; travelers visiting friends and relatives are at greater risk for malaria, and malaria (especially Plasmodium falciparum) can progress rapidly, so evaluate promptly and initiate treatment immediately, if diagnosed. A history of taking malaria chemoprophylaxis does not exclude malaria; patients with malaria can be afebrile at the time of evaluation but typically give a history of fever or chills, can have prominent respiratory, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system findings, and empiric treatment is usually not indicated except in rare circumstances. Sexually transmitted infections, including acute HIV, can cause acute febrile infections.

### Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia: global differences in clinical patterns [^a79d10e7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Methods

A prospective study of consecutive patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae bacteremia was performed in 12 hospitals. 1 The study period was January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Records of patients > 16 years of age with positive blood cultures for K. pneumoniae were reviewed, and a 188-item study form was completed. All items on the form were objective criteria, allowing standardization among medical centers. The study was observational in that administration of antimicrobial agents and other therapeutic management were controlled by the patient's physician, not the investigators.

Community-acquired bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture taken on or within 48 hours of admission. Severity of acute illness at the time of positive blood cultures was assessed by a previously validated scoring system, based on mental status, vital signs, need for mechanical ventilation, and recent cardiac arrest (Pitt bacteremia score). Type of infection was defined as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, incisional wound infection, other soft tissue infection, intraabdominal infection, and primary bloodstream infection, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. In addition, distinctive sites of K. pneumoniae bacteremia were further defined as liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis. Liver abscesses were defined by the coexistence of blood cultures positive for K. pneumoniae and evidence of an intrahepatic abscess cavity by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Meningitis was defined as culture of K. pneumoniae from cerebrospinal fluid, and endophthalmitis was defined as decreased visual acuity, pain, hypyon, or severe anterior uveitis in a patient concurrently bacteremic with K. pneumoniae. Death was defined as including deaths from all causes within 14 days of the date the first positive blood culture for K. pneumoniae was obtained.

Methods

Study Design

A prospective, observational study of consecutive, sequentially encountered patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia was conducted in 12 hospitals in the United States, Taiwan, Australia, South Africa, Turkey, Belgium, and Argentina. No patients were excluded from analysis. The study period was January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Patients > 16 years of age with positive blood cultures for K. pneumoniae were enrolled and completed a 188-item study form. Patients were followed up for 1 month after the onset of bacteremia to assess clinical outcome, including deaths and infectious complications. The study was observational in that administration of antimicrobial agents and other therapeutic management were controlled by the patient's physician, not the investigators. The study was approved by institutional review boards as required by local hospital policy.

Definitions

Terms were defined a priori (that is, before data analysis). Community-acquired bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture taken on admission or within 48 hours of admission. Site of infection accompanying the bacteremia was determined as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis, incisional wound infection, other soft tissue infection, intraabdominal infection, and primary bloodstream infection by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. "Invasive" infections accompanying K. pneumoniae bacteremia were further defined as liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis. Liver abscess was defined by the coexistence of blood cultures positive for K. pneumoniae and evidence of an intrahepatic abscess cavity by ultrasonography or computed tomography. Meningitis was defined as culture of K. pneumoniae from the cerebrospinal fluid. Endophthalmitis was defined as decreased visual acuity, pain, hypopyon, or severe anterior uveitis concurrent with K. pneumoniae bacteremia in a patient.

### Actinomyces naeslundii and eikenella corrodens as rare causes of liver abscesses [^294f78ee]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history was admitted with vague conditions of fever, chills, myalgias and malaise. Physical examination was remarkable for only scleral icterus. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Imaging demonstrated two masses in the right lobe of his liver, which were ultimately drained and cultures demonstrated Actinomyces and Eikenella. He continued to have fever on broad-spectrum antibiotics until catheter drainage of the abscesses was performed. He was eventually discharged in improved condition on amoxicillin-clavulanate. His aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin continued to improve and he remained afebrile and asymptomatic. A repeat CT 2 months after discharge demonstrated resolution of the abscesses. Actinomyces and Eikenella are rare causes of liver abscesses and treatment requires drainage and an extended course of antibiotics. The polymicrobial character typical of liver abscesses makes antibiotic therapy challenging when cultures reveal rare organisms such as Actinomyces and Eikenella.

### Multidrug resistant citrobacter: an unusual cause of liver abscess [^4a0be17c]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Liver abscesses are infectious, space occupying lesions in the liver, the two most common abscesses being pyogenic and amoebic. A pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a rare condition with a reported incidence of 20 per 100 000 hospital admissions in the western population. The right lobe of the liver is the most common site in both types of liver abscess. Clinical presentation is elusive with complaints of fever, right upper quadrant pain in the abdomen and hepatomegaly with or without jaundice. The aetiology of PLA has changed in the past few decades and may be of biliary, portal, arterial or traumatic origin, but many cases are still cryptogenic. The most common organisms causing PLA are Gram-negative aerobes, especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Studies have shown a high degree of antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated organism resulting in an overall lower mortality in PLA. Here, we present a case of PLA caused by multidrug-resistant Citrobacter freundii, which is an unusual organism to be isolated.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and capsular serotypes, Taiwan [^5468385d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria cause a variety of infections. Geographic differences in this organism have been recognized, and a high prevalence of liver abscesses has been observed for > 20 years in persons in Taiwan infected with K. pneumoniae. K1 and K2 are the major capsular serotypes that cause liver abscesses and have increased virulence. In contrast, only limited information is available about serotypes causing K. pneumoniae bacteremia.

Yu et al. grouped K1 and K2 serotypes and compared clinical characteristics for patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia with those for patients infected with non–K1/K2 serotypes. Recent evidence suggests that K1 is a major cause of primary liver abscesses and has greater potential for causing metastasis, and that K2 is a major cause of secondary liver abscesses. We examined the distribution and clinical characteristics of serotypes that cause K. pneumoniae bacteremia from 225 patients and performed PCR-based genotyping to identify capsular serotypes.

### A rare presentation of systemic emphysematous infections secondary to Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in a diabetic patient [^2e8b5b22]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic patients are at an increased risk of developing Klebsiella pneumoniae pyogenic liver abscess (KLA) and its extrahepatic complications. This is the first case report depicting the concurrence of pyogenic liver abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and necrotizing fasciitis in 1 patient.

Case Report

A 29-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes presented to the emergency department with lower back pain and right lower leg pain for 1 week. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography revealed pyogenic liver abscess, bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis, and right lower-extremity necrotizing fasciitis. The patient then received emergent fasciectomy and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy. K. pneumoniae was isolated from the blood culture, right nephrostomy tube, and right lower-extremity wound, indicating that it was the cause of these infections. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In diabetic patients diagnosed with KLA, an emergency physician must perform thorough examinations to exclude potential systemic extrahepatic infections. KLA seeding infections are usually hematogenous in origin, as bacteremia is significantly more common in KLA than other pyogenic liver abscess. Documented sites of KLA seeding include eyes, lungs, kidneys, brain, meninges, soft tissues, and bone.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and capsular serotypes, Taiwan [^eb616976]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

No differences were found in clinical characteristics for patients with K2 bacteremia and those with non–K1/K2 bacteremia except for a higher frequency of liver abscesses in patients with K2 bacteremia (13.5% vs. 4.1%; OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.06–12.8). For patients infected with K54 and K57 serotypes, 1 K57 serotype caused liver abscesses; no abscesses were found in patients infected with a K54 serotype. The in-hospital mortality rate was 50% (4/8) for patients with K54 bacteremia and 53.3% (8/15) for patients with K57 bacteremia.

Patients infected with a K1 serotype had lower mean ± SD Pittsburgh bacteremia scores (2.7 ± 3.1 vs. 5.0 ± 5.3; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–0.98, p = 0.002) and lower 14-day and in-hospital mortality rates (9.8% vs. 27.0%; OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08–1.03, p = 0.06; and 14.6% vs. 43.2%; OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08–0.67, p = 0.007) than patients infected with K2 serotypes. A higher percentage of patients with K1 bacteremia had liver abscesses at the site of infection (46.3% vs. 13.5%; OR 5.53, 95% CI 1.80–17.02, p = 0.003).

However, the literature remains more unclear in regard to S. suis infection, specifically S. suis meningitis, as few patients included in published reports had undergone a splenectomy. However, splenectomy leading to immunocompromise was likely the main contributor to the patient's delayed clearance of S. suis. The patient was not discharged with regular antibiotic prophylaxis nor received any immunizations, as this is not common practice in Vietnam owing to social and financial challenges. This is in contrast to guidance followed by most Western countries, where daily prophylaxis with penicillin-based antibiotics is recommended for a minimum of 2 years postsplenectomy, and vaccination against encapsulated bacteria is recommended peri-splenectomy.

This patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone and vancomycin, to which S. suis was susceptible. Ceftriaxone with the optional addition of vancomycin has been recommended previously as empirical treatment, in accordance with local guidelines for bacterial meningitis, which should ideally be based on local epidemiologic data of the causative pathogens. Although not present in this case, multidrug resistance in S. suis is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue. In the south of Vietnam, serotyping has proven that resistance has increased over the period of more than a decade studied. The majority (83.2%) of S. suis samples isolated in a Vietnamese study were resistant to tetracycline, and a significant minority (20.2%) were also resistant to erythromycin. However, all samples in this study were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and vancomycin. This underlines the importance of antimicrobial stewardship, and empirical antibiotic choice should be replaced promptly with more focused narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as penicillin, once antimicrobial susceptibilities have been confirmed.

Patients

Patient 1, a 73-year-old man, returned from Reunion on February 17, 2006. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus and oral treatment with imatinib for an intestinal stromal tumor with liver metastasis that was surgically removed in 2004. He was admitted for a 3-day history of fever (temperature 38.5°C) and arthralgia. Clinical signs included asthenia, anorexia, nausea, myalgia, headache, bilateral conjunctivitis, and arthralgia that was particularly intense in shoulders and elbows, left ankle, and left wrists, which suggested tenosynovitis. Purpuric lesions of the legs and intense pain in response to pressure on the left wrist were noticed. Laboratory findings showed severe pancytopenia, including reduced platelet count (17×10⁹ cells/L), reduced leukocyte count (0.7×10⁹ cells/L), and nonregenerative anemia (hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, 10×10⁹ reticulocytes/L) (Figure 1). Blood chemistry values included raised enzymes: 1,858 IU/L lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 283 IU/L aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 210 IU/L alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 672 IU/L creatine phosphokinase, and 84 IU/L γ-glutamyl transaminase. Bone marrow smear was cell-rich; granulocytic cells were predominant and hemophagocytosis was limited. Escherichia coli septicemia occurred during the neutropenic period and was successfully treated with ceftriaxone. The patient recovered slowly after a 5-day regimen of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, but intensive joint pain persisted. On March 2, bone scintigraphy showed diffuse inflammation of all joints, specifically at the left shoulder, wrist, and hand (Figure 2 A).

CLINICAL TEACHING POINTS

Human brucellosis is a very common illness worldwide. Four brucella species — melitensis, suis, abortus and canis — cause the majority of human illness, with B. melitensis being the most common.
Brucellosis is generally transmitted by direct contact with infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats or pigs) or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The incubation period is days to months.
Though brucellosis can involve any organ system, it usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, including undulating fevers, night sweats, malaise, weight loss and arthralgias. It can also present with focal brucellosis syndromes, including meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis or epididymoorchitis.
Granulomatous hepatitis is caused by infections (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, Q fever, brucellosis, syphilis, cryptococcosis, leprosy), drugs, malignancy (e.g. lymphomas, renal cell carcinoma) or autoimmune diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, primary biliary cirrhosis). Up to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic.
The social history is often a key discriminating feature in febrile illnesses, particularly for patients who travel outside of industrialized areas. They are often exposed to infections that are not routinely considered.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^4ea7e4b4]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response. Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Decolonization may be considered if a patient develops a recurrent infection despite good personal hygiene and wound care, or if other household members develop infections.

Strategies for decolonization include nasal decolonization with mupirocin twice per day for five to 10 days, or nasal decolonization with mupirocin twice per day for five to 10 days plus topical body decolonization with a skin antiseptic solution for five to 14 days or dilute bleach baths. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. A clinical assessment to identify the source and extent of the infection with elimination and/or debridement of other sites of infection is recommended.

Additional blood cultures two to four days after initial positive cultures and as needed thereafter are recommended to document clearance of bacteremia. Echocardiography is recommended for all adults with bacteremia. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures. If the patient has not responded to vancomycin therapy despite adequate debridement and removal of other foci of infection, an alternative agent is recommended. For isolates with a vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 2 mcg per mL, an alternative agent should be prescribed.

Post-travel respiratory infections — clinical presentation and differential: Most respiratory infections, especially those of the upper respiratory tract, are mild, and upper respiratory tract infections often cause pharyngitis or rhinorrhea, while lower respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, can be more severe. Lower respiratory tract infections are more likely than upper respiratory tract infections to cause chest pain, dyspnea, or fever, and cough is often present in either upper or lower respiratory tract infections; rash may be present, especially in measles, rubella, and varicella. People with influenza commonly have acute onset of cough, fever, headache, and myalgias, and people with COVID-19 might have a similar clinical presentation, but mild disease and asymptomatic infection also are common; similar symptoms can be seen in bacterial infections, including legionellosis. Consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of travelers who present with cough, dyspnea, tachycardia, or fever and pleurisy, especially those who have recently been on long car or plane trips.
