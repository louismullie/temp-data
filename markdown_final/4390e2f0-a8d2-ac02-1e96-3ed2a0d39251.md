## Question

Cheif complain of osteoarthritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the chief complaint of osteoarthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a chief complaint in clinical documentation. Then, I should verify the cardinal symptoms of osteoarthritis across authoritative sources. Next, I will synthesize a concise, clinically accurate chief complaint statement. Finally, I should consider joint-specific nuances and ensure the phrasing aligns with guideline and epidemiologic language.

> Let me first confirm the definition of a chief complaint so I don't misframe it. The chief complaint is the primary reason for the visit, typically expressed in the patient's own words or a succinct clinician summary of the dominant symptom and its functional impact, which in osteoarthritis is overwhelmingly pain-driven and activity-related, prompting healthcare encounters and disability burden discussions [^9f51cc02] [^9a000b16].

> Now, I need to verify the cardinal symptoms of osteoarthritis. Across high-quality sources, osteoarthritis consistently presents with joint pain that worsens with movement and improves with rest, stiffness — especially after inactivity — swelling or effusion, reduced range of motion, and functional impairment such as difficulty with activities of daily living; these features are repeatedly emphasized in clinical guidelines and population summaries, and pain is the hallmark that most often drives presentation and care-seeking [^9f51cc02] [^33783c3e] [^84eb5bbb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any single symptom eclipses the others in frequency and salience. Multiple guidelines and epidemiologic summaries converge on pain as the predominant complaint, with stiffness, swelling, and functional limitation as co-travelers; this pattern holds across knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis, reinforcing that pain is the primary driver of the chief complaint while the others contextualize severity and impact [^9f51cc02] [^9a000b16] [^84eb5bbb].

> I will now synthesize the chief complaint, but I need to ensure it remains clinically precise and reference-aligned. A standard, clinically acceptable phrasing would be: "Joint pain with stiffness and functional limitation", with optional elaboration such as "worse with activity, better with rest" and "swelling after use" to reflect the typical phenotype; this aligns with the symptom clusters described in the Lancet seminar, CDC summaries, and ACR guideline narratives, and it captures the essence patients report when seeking care [^9f51cc02] [^33783c3e] [^84eb5bbb].

> But wait, what if the joint involved changes the emphasis slightly? Let me consider joint-specific nuances. For the knee, patients often emphasize pain with weight-bearing, stiffness after sitting, and instability or buckling; for the hip, pain with weight-bearing and gait limitation are prominent; for the hand, pain with pinch/grip and stiffness are key. Still, across sites, pain remains the unifying chief complaint, with the other symptoms modifying its expression and severity, which is consistent with guideline descriptions and patient-reported data [^9f51cc02] [^84eb5bbb] [^9a000b16].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include "deformity" as a core symptom, but I should correct that. Deformity reflects chronic structural change and is not typically part of the initial chief complaint; it may emerge over time, especially in hand OA, but it is not a defining presenting symptom like pain and stiffness, so I should not elevate it to the chief-complaint level in a general formulation [^84eb5bbb] [^9f51cc02].

> Final check and phrasing: the chief complaint of osteoarthritis is best summarized as "Joint pain with stiffness and functional limitation", optionally expanded to "Joint pain worse with activity and better with rest, with morning or inactivity-related stiffness and swelling after use, causing difficulty with daily tasks". This captures the syndrome's hallmark features and aligns with contemporary guideline and epidemiologic descriptions of OA presentations [^9f51cc02] [^33783c3e] [^84eb5bbb].

The chief complaint of osteoarthritis is **joint pain** [^9f51cc02] that worsens with activity and improves with rest, often accompanied by stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion [^33783c3e]. Pain is typically **localized to the affected joint** (commonly knee, hip, or hand) [^84eb5bbb] and may limit daily activities, prompting medical evaluation [^9a000b16]. This symptom pattern is a hallmark of osteoarthritis and guides diagnosis and management [^9f51cc02].

---

## Primary symptom: joint pain

- **Nature of pain**: Deep, aching, and localized to the affected joint [^notfound].
- **Activity-related pain**: Pain typically worsens with movement or weight-bearing and improves with rest [^notfound].
- **Progression**: Pain intensity may increase over time as the disease progresses, leading to chronic pain syndromes [^notfound].

---

## Secondary symptoms

- **Stiffness**: Particularly noticeable after periods of inactivity or upon waking in the morning, typically lasting less than 30 minutes [^notfound].
- **Swelling**: Often due to synovial inflammation or effusion, especially after prolonged activity [^notfound].
- **Reduced range of motion**: Limitation in joint movement due to pain, stiffness, and structural changes within the joint [^notfound].
- **Functional impairment**: Difficulty performing daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, or gripping objects [^notfound].

---

## Variability by joint involvement

| **Joint involved** | **Typical chief complaint characteristics** |
|-|-|
| Knee | - Pain worsens with weight-bearing <br/> - Stiffness after sitting <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Instability or buckling [^notfound] |
| Hip | - Groin or buttock pain <br/> - Radiating to thigh or knee <br/> - Stiffness <br/> - Reduced range of motion [^notfound] |
| Hand | - Pain and stiffness in fingers <br/> - Difficulty with grip <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Bony enlargements (Heberden's nodes) [^notfound] |

---

## Impact on daily life

Osteoarthritis-related pain and stiffness can significantly impair **daily activities**, including walking, climbing stairs, dressing, and household tasks [^9f51cc02]. Functional limitations often lead to reduced independence and quality of life, prompting patients to seek medical attention [^9a000b16].

---

## Summary of chief complaint

The chief complaint of osteoarthritis is **joint pain** that worsens with activity and improves with rest, often accompanied by stiffness, swelling, and reduced range of motion [^9f51cc02]. These symptoms vary by joint involvement but consistently impact daily functioning and quality of life [^9a000b16].

Hip OA treatment benefits, harms, and decision-making — patients with OA of the hip present with increased pain, decreased mobility, decreased function, and decreased quality of life. The aim of treatment of OA of the hip is to reduce pain, improve function, and secondarily improve quality of life. All treatments are associated with risks for adverse outcomes, especially operative intervention, and must be considered for each patient; contraindications and risks vary widely by treatment. When possible, modifiable risk factors should be addressed as reducing risks improve treatment efficacy, and treatment decisions for OA of the hip should be made through a shared decision-making process with the physician and patient.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management? [^9d9a7b8d]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While OA is predominantly diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, imaging may aid with differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. While plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality, MRI and US also have a valuable role in assessing multiple pathologic features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages. Although modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, effusion) OA-related structural damage, this extra information has not yet favourably influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether it relates to disease severity or an additional diagnosis. On developing specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities to aid in OA diagnosis, disease progression and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### Clinical algorithms to aid osteoarthritis guideline dissemination [^9c500977]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous scientific organisations have developed evidence-based recommendations aiming to optimise the management of osteoarthritis (OA). Uptake, however, has been suboptimal. The purpose of this exercise was to harmonize the recent recommendations and develop a user-friendly treatment algorithm to facilitate translation of evidence into practice.

Methods

We updated a previous systematic review on clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for OA management. The guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation for quality and the standards for developing trustworthy CPGs as established by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM). Four case scenarios and algorithms were developed by consensus of a multidisciplinary panel.

Results

Sixteen guidelines were included in the systematic review. Most recommendations were directed toward physicians and allied health professionals, and most had multi-disciplinary input. Analysis for trustworthiness suggests that many guidelines still present a lack of transparency. A treatment algorithm was developed for each case scenario advised by recommendations from guidelines and based on panel consensus.

Conclusion

Strategies to facilitate the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice are necessary. The algorithms proposed are examples of how to apply recommendations in the clinical context, helping the clinician to visualise the patient flow and timing of different treatment modalities.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^17cbb659]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Key areas for future research

Algorithms and models of care are available as examples for rheumatologists and clinics to standardize OA management and the healthcare team can play key leadership roles in musculoskeletal education and championing excellent OA management. However, there are significant evidence-to-practice gaps in OA care. The following are research areas and methodological considerations that would significantly improve the evidence base underlying optimal OA management: research participants should represent the range of patients seen for OA, including those with multi-joint disease, those with multiple comorbidities and the oldest old. This will enhance the generalizability of findings so that they can inform real-world clinical practices; studies should systematically examine heterogeneity of treatment effects to identify patient characteristics that predict response to therapies. This will help to inform tailoring of treatment regimens in clinical settings; although studies of individual treatments or interventions are still needed in some areas, there is a great need to study more novel, complex and integrated approaches to OA management that mirror clinical scenarios, consider the whole person and engage with caregivers and other support systems; there is a need for a greater focus on implementation research in OA, identifying models of care that can be successfully delivered, as well as considerations for cost effectiveness.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary of surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee [^16d2472c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guideline — surgical management of knee osteoarthritis — is based on a systematic review of published studies in skeletally mature patients and provides recommendations to help practitioners integrate current evidence into clinical practice. It is intended to be used by orthopaedic surgeons and other healthcare providers managing knee osteoarthritis (knee OA), serves as an information resource, and is presented as an educational tool to guide treatment decisions, with the final decision on any specific procedure made after assessing patient concerns and locality-specific resources. The guideline is for skeletally mature patients diagnosed by a trained healthcare provider with knee osteoarthritis and covers surgical interventions for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, including operative procedures less invasive than knee replacement (arthroplasty), while not providing recommendations for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis of other joints, or other inflammatory arthropathies. Methods include a systematic review conducted between September 2020 and January 2022 and the use of the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework, adopted by AAOS in April 2019, to incorporate additional factors into the strength of each recommendation.

### Chronic disease management: a review of current performance across quality of care domains and opportunities for improving osteoarthritis care [^b0ad78f5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent chronic joint disease worldwide. The incidence and prevalence are increasing as the population ages and lifestyle risk factors such as obesity increase. There are several evidence-based clinical practice guidelines available to guide clinician decision making, but there is evidence that care provided is suboptimal across all domains of quality: effectiveness, safety, timeliness and appropriateness, patient-centered care, and efficiency. System, clinician, and patient barriers to optimizing care need to be addressed. Innovative models designed to meet patient needs and those that harness social networks must be developed, especially to support those with mild to moderate disease.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^13052c8f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis comprehensive management — patient-centered and multimodal care is emphasized, with plans that "may include educational, behavioral, psychosocial, and physical interventions, as well as topical, oral, and intraarticular medications", and "for some patients at some time points, a single physical, psychosocial, mind-body, or pharmacologic intervention may be adequate to control symptoms; for others, multiple interventions may be used in sequence or in combination". Choice and sequencing "will vary among patients", and "no specific hierarchy of one option over another is implied other than on the basis of strength of the recommendation". "Treatment decisions should take the personal beliefs and preferences of the patient, as well as the patient's medical status, into consideration", and the guideline "applies to patients with OA with no specific contraindications to the recommended therapies". Each patient "should be assessed for the presence of medical conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding risk, chronic kidney disease, or other comorbidities", as well as "injuries, disease severity, surgical history, and access to and availability of services (transportation, distance), potential ability to take time off work, cost, insurance coverage) that might have an impact on the choice of physical, psychological, and mind-body approaches". Conditional recommendations are explained as those "for which the majority of informed patients would choose to follow the recommended course of action, but some would not", and they "are particularly value- and preference-sensitive and always warrant a full shared decision-making approach".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^dfb37888]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Highlighted features of this Clinical Practice Guideline — the 2020 edition of the VA/DoD OA CPG is the first update to the original CPG published in 2014 and provides practice recommendations for the care of patients with OA and guidance for treatment. A strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the broad spectrum of providers engaged in the management of OA. The framework for recommendations included factors beyond the strength of the evidence, including balancing desired outcomes with potential harms of the intervention, the potential for variation in patient values and preferences, and other considerations (e.g., resource use, subgroup considerations) as appropriate, and applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also considered. An algorithm accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care and to assist with training providers, and the algorithm may be used to help facilitate the translation of guideline recommendations into practice.

### Management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis [^c4fd976f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis clinical practice guideline — scope and intended use are described as follows: It is based on a systematic review of published studies and aims to provide practice recommendations based on the best available evidence, highlight the limitations in the current literature, and suggest areas for future research. It was developed for all qualified and appropriately trained health care professionals involved in the management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis and is intended as an information resource to guide decision making and assist developers of future practice guidelines and treatment recommendations. The goal is to summarize areas where there is good and poor evidence and identify gaps, and AAOS staff and the physician and physical therapy work group predetermined specific questions of interest for this patient population, systematically reviewed the currently available literature, and developed the current recommendations based on the strength or weaknesses of the results of this review. The guideline is a tool to assist physicians, surgeons and other health care professionals in developing an understanding of levels of evidence for common diagnostic and treatment practices, is by no means a replacement for appropriate clinical judgement, and each patient should be managed based on their needs and resources available to the individual healthcare provider. Intended users include healthcare professionals other than orthopaedic surgeons in various practice settings who routinely see this patient population. The document addresses management of patients with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis and is not intended for use as a benefits determination document.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^da1bf6d1]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

A number of controversies and challenges exist for the management of OA in health care. This paper describes the challenges and gaps in OA care, particularly in relation to population health management, complex interventions and outcomes. It sets this in the context of competing health priorities and multimorbidity, access to high quality conservative care, non-pharmacological therapies, resource limitations and models of care. The overuse of some therapies and neglect of others are discussed, as well as the potential for self-management. The roles of patient and public involvement and the healthcare team are highlighted in enhancing best care for OA and providing solutions for closing the evidence-to-practice gap. Implementation of models of care offer one solution to the challenges and progress of such implementation is described. Areas for further research are highlighted.

Potential benefits, harm, and contraindications — individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee often report joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement; the aim of treatment is to provide pain relief and improve the patient's functioning. Most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative, contraindications vary widely by procedure, and reducing risks is accomplished through collaboration between patient and physician; current research does not differentiate between the sexes, and future work may clarify how a patient's sex alters treatment benefits and harms.

### Guidelines for management of osteoarthritis published by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism: why are they so different? [^c9bb29fc]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Because of different methodology the ACR and EULAR guidelines differ significantly in their recommendations despite an identical evidence base. Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light.

### Targeting care: tailoring nonsurgical management according to clinical presentation [^5dbae892]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

International evidence-based guidelines recommend a multitude of nonsurgical treatment options for the management of osteoarthritis. This article summarizes the evidence available for patient characteristics that have been analyzed as potential predictors of response to nonsurgical interventions for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis. The specific variables targeted for this review include body mass index, psychological factors, muscle strength, tibiofemoral alignment, radiographic changes, and signs of inflammation. Several studies provide moderate to good evidence of potential predictors of response to nonsurgical treatments, and areas for future research are illuminated.

### Patients' perceptions of the treatment and management of hand osteoarthritis: a focus group enquiry [^58c3bed3]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest reason for a musculoskeletal consultation in primary care in older adults. There is evidence that appropriate advice and management is sub-optimal. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions and experiences of the treatment and management of hand OA in older adults.

Methods

Four focus groups were conducted with primary (n = 15) and secondary (n = 14) care participants aged 50–84 years (mean age 64.9 years; 3 males, 14 females) with a clinical diagnosis of hand OA. Data were tape-recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis and constant comparison method.

Results

Participants described a lack of help and information with regards to management of their hand OA and also a perceived lack of understanding of the impact of hand OA on the individual. Some received contradictory advice about its management. Beliefs about treatment efficacy were balanced against perceived and actual side-effects and tolerance, and such perceptions appeared to influence the use of alternative therapies.

Conclusions

The study identified a perceived unmet need in people with hand OA presenting in primary and secondary care. This may be due to the clinical uncertainty of treatment, lack of high-quality randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic options, and the limited written information available incorporating the patient experience. The study emphasised the need to understand patient illness and treatment beliefs. A better understanding of illness and treatment beliefs will facilitate the use of evidence-based approaches in the management of hand OA.

### Osteoarthritis [^9f51cc02]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability and source of societal cost in older adults. With an ageing and increasingly obese population, this syndrome is becoming even more prevalent than in previous decades. In recent years, we have gained important insights into the cause and pathogenesis of pain in osteoarthritis. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is clinically based despite the widespread overuse of imaging methods. Management should be tailored to the presenting individual and focus on core treatments, including self-management and education, exercise, and weight loss as relevant. Surgery should be reserved for those that have not responded appropriately to less invasive methods. Prevention and disease modification are areas being targeted by various research endeavours, which have indicated great potential thus far. This narrative Seminar provides an update on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, and future research on osteoarthritis for a clinical audience.

Challenges and gaps in care

Controversies in care

Data from a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies exploring barriers and facilitators to offering best OA care, for example guideline recommendations for OA, identified only barriers and no enablers. The findings addressed system-related barriers, disease-related barriers and patient-related barriers from which four distinct themes emerged from eight studies: OA is not that serious, clinicians perceive they are under-prepared, to personal beliefs (e.g. negativity about OA), and dissonance in patient expectations. Such findings begin to explain some of the challenges in offering the range of treatment options recommended and described in the following sections.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee — acceptability, feasibility, and research needs indicate that the recommendation comes with varying acceptability, and some surgeons may feel some loss of autonomy with clinical decision making when deciding who is indicated for surgery. Feasibility notes that there have been a number of high-quality studies showing comparable postoperative functional outcomes between non-obese and obese patients, so it may be more feasible for surgeons to consider the overall health of the patient; if the patient has several risk factors that may contribute to a poor outcome, then it may be more reasonable to better optimize this patient before surgery, whereas if the patient has only one risk factor such as obesity, delaying surgery may cause further functional issues and poor quality of life. Future research should include more studies on functional outcomes in obese patients.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^fcb03e6d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis etiology, patient impact, and treatment considerations — osteoarthritis results from an imbalance between breakdown and repair of the tissues in the synovial joint organ and occurs as a result of multiple risk factors including trauma, overuse, and genetic predisposition; patients often complain of joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement; older adults with self-reported osteoarthritis visit their physicians more frequently and experience greater functional limitations than others in the same age group; the aim of treatment is to provide pain relief and improve the patient's functioning, yet most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative, contraindications vary widely by procedure, and reducing risks improves treatment efficacy and is accomplished through collaboration between patient and physician.

### Cost-effectiveness of a model consultation to support self-management in patients with osteoarthritis [^5ba22f57]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

OA is most prevalent in older people and is known to adversely affect quality of life. Estimates from the United States of America (USA) suggest that 12.4 million adults over the age of 65 years are living with this condition and around 2.9 million people have a disabling form of OA. A report by the Royal College of General Practitioners indicates that about 1 million adults consult with symptoms of OA in a year and it is one of the main reasons why people seek medical care. The total healthcare cost of OA has been estimated at £1 billion in the UK. Therefore OA places a considerable burden on scarce healthcare resources. The proportion of older people in the population has been increasing over time, and with this ageing population, it is expected that the prevalence of conditions such as OA will rise. A number of published guidelines have been developed to aid the treatment and management of OA. In the UK, for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that patients with OA should be offered core treatments when they first present in primary care. These include education and access to information, advice on local muscle strengthening exercise and general aerobic fitness, and if appropriate, advice on losing weight. However, there is a gap between the care that is recommended and that which patients actually receive, and the core aspects of assessment and management of OA currently delivered in primary care do not meet the recommendations of these guidelines. Therefore, measures need to be put in place to ensure that resources are used optimally. Consequently, there was a need to develop a practical approach that could potentially support self-management of OA and also aid the implementation of the core NICE guidelines for OA. This led to the development of a model OA consultation for older patients presenting with peripheral joint pain, and training for health care professionals to support its delivery. The model OA consultation integrated core recommendations from NICE and consisted of an OA guidebook written by patients and health professionals for patients, an enhanced initial consultation with a general practitioner (GP), and subsequent follow-up with a practice nurse (up to four consultations) in a dedicated nurse-led OA clinic. In addition a practice e-template was developed to record quality measures of care derived from a systematic review of quality indicators for OA. The Management of OsteoArthritis in Consultations (MOSAICS) trial compared the model OA consultation with usual care over a 12-month period. This paper reports the economic evaluation alongside the MOSAICS trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of the model OA consultation compared with usual care in patients who consult with OA.

### Core recommendations for osteoarthritis care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^6c46d1b8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for interventions in management of osteoarthritis (OA) and to provide a synthesis of high-quality CPG recommendations.

Methods

Five databases (OvidSP Medline, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Embase, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database [PEDro]) and 4 online guideline repositories were searched. CPGs for the management of OA were included if they were 1) written in English and published from January 2015 to February 2022, focused on adults age ≥ 18years, and met the criteria of a CPG as defined by the Institute of Medicine; and 2) were rated as high quality on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. CPGs for OA were excluded if they were available via institutional access only, only addressed recommendations for the system/organization of care and did not include interventional management recommendations, and/or included other arthritic conditions.

Results

Of 20 eligible CPGs, 11 were appraised as high quality and included in the synthesis. Of interest were the hip, knee, hand, and glenohumeral joints and/or polyarticular OA. Consistent recommendations were that care should be patient centered and include exercise, education, and weight loss (where appropriate). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and surgical interventions were recommended for disabling OA that had not improved with nonsurgical care. Hand orthoses should be recommended for patients with hand OA.

Conclusion

This synthesis of high-quality CPGs for OA management offers health care providers with clear, simple guidance of recommended OA care to improve patient outcomes.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Non-surgical Management of Hip & Knee Osteoarthritis — introduction and background — states that the guideline provides healthcare providers with a framework to "evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of adult patients with osteoarthritis (OA)", and outlines expected implementation outcomes to assess the patient's condition in collaboration with the patient, optimize health outcomes and improve quality of life, minimize preventable complications and morbidity, and emphasize patient-centered care. The document notes a prior "CPG for the Non-surgical Management of Hip & Knee Osteoarthritis" published in 2014 based on evidence "through December 2012", and that "a recommendation to update… was initiated in 2019". Epidemiology from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates OA "affects more than 30 million Americans" with prevalence estimates of "13.9% of adults age 25 years and older" and "33.6% of adults age 65 years and older".

### Arthritis management: patient-reported health care provider screening, counseling, and recommendations for physical activity… [^f21c9b01]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding when their HCP recommended PA to manage arthritis or joint symptoms, 16. 8% of adults with arthritis reported it was within the last 6 months,
9. 6% reported it was between 6 months and 1 year ago, and 27. 7% reported it was more than 1 year ago. After controlling for all other variables in the multivariable analysis, obesity and chronic pain were the only characteristics significantly correlated with ever receiving HCP counseling about PA. Specifically, compared with adults with arthritis reporting a BMI < 25, those who reported obesity had higher prevalence of receiving HCP counseling about PA. Additionally, compared with adults with arthritis not reporting chronic pain, those who reported chronic pain had higher prevalence of receiving HCP counseling about PA. Among adults with arthritis reporting their HCP ever suggested PA to manage arthritis or joint symptoms, 74. 7% were asked about their PA level,
50.

9% were told about the types of PA they should be doing, and 44. 4% were told about the amounts of PA they should be doing. Few received handouts, less than 1 in 4 talked with their HCP about PA barriers or talked with their HCP about overcoming barriers. Only 6. 1% reported receiving a PA prescription. After controlling for other factors, obesity and chronic pain status were associated with receiving HCP counseling about PA to manage arthritis. This is consistent with 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data showing that adults with obesity reported higher prevalence of HCP counseling about PA to manage arthritis compared with adults with BMI in the overweight or underweight/healthy weight ranges.

Given the unique barriers to PA expressed by adults with arthritis, the importance of HCP PA counseling for adults with arthritis, and the many multilevel barriers to assessment, counseling, and recommendation, there are opportunities for increasing HCP awareness about existing, but underutilized, evidence-based tools and programs that can be leveraged to improve PA behaviors among adults with arthritis.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^c59f29f8]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Making and giving a diagnosis of OA

In primary care adults 45 years and over consulting with joint pain and limitations in everyday activity are more likely to receive NICE recommendations if a diagnosis of OA has been recorded in the medical electronic record. Delay in diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and suboptimal care. Overuse of imaging has prompted NICE to highlight the recommendation for diagnosing OA on clinical grounds and set a quality standard to audit this approach.

Diagnosis and subsequent treatment are often focused on a single, most painful joint rather than multisite joint problems. Yet multisite joint pain is the most common presentation in consultations in primary care, and having more joint sites affected leads to more health care consultations irrespective of specialty or site. As summarized in a recent systematic review, there is a paucity of evidence to guide the practitioner regarding treatment of multisite joint pain, with few studies describing interventions for considering OA in all affected joints. Comorbidities also often go under-recognized in primary care and the community, which further hampers the holistic assessment recommended by NICE.

Reports have highlighted the impact of language when giving the diagnosis of OA. Health Care Professionals' views can be perceived to be negative, for example, 'nothing can be done' and 'it's your age'. Unhelpful descriptions and terminology can easily transfer from the X-ray report into the consultation, with people with OA concerned for their 'degenerative meniscal tear'. Use of language to talk about OA that offers more positive and supportive messages, such as 'wear' and 'remodelling', can enhance understanding of prognosis when verbal messages are backed up by written patient information. Explaining that OA is part of a process of repair rather than degeneration can introduce a sense of optimism and reassurance because it offers a more positive outlook to life with OA, and can change patients' and carers' perceptions that OA inevitably leads to persistent pain, disability and joint replacement.

### Referral recommendations for osteoarthritis of the knee incorporating patients' preferences [^3cd8ff64]. Family Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

The guideline development group included 12 representatives of relevant people in the management of osteoarthritis [three patient representatives (two were recruited from organizations representing the interest of patients based in the London area; none of the patient representatives had undergone treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee themselves), three GPs, three orthopaedic surgeons, one nurse specialist, one physiotherapist and one public health consultant].

In the preparatory phase, two clinicians (a GP and an orthopaedic surgeon) supported the research team to identify areas of uncertainty that required reviews of the literature. The team also carried out a review of existing clinical guidelines for the management of osteoarthritis of the knee.

At its first meeting, the guideline development group defined key concepts: osteoarthritis of the knee, the referral decision and the concept of an appropriate referral (see Table 1). The research team presented the results of evidence reviews on three topics: predictors of outcome after knee replacement that can readily be evaluated in primary care, existing guidelines on non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (the NICE osteoarthritis guideline had not been published at that time) and mortality and its risk factors after knee replacement surgery. Four additional topics were identified: role of an X-ray of the knee, patient satisfaction after knee replacement, revision rates after primary knee replacement and age and sex-specific mortality according to the National Joint Registry. Subsequent rapid reviews were carried out on these topics.

T1
Definition of key concepts of the referral process for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee

After the first meeting, we drafted 12 recommendations for good primary care practice based on the group's informal views. We also designed case scenarios based on five patient characteristics presented: age, symptom severity, body mass, co-morbidity and patients' preference for referral (see Table 2 and Box 1). The number of possible combinations amounted to 108.

T2
Characteristics of patients included in the case scenarios a

Box 1
Example of a case scenario

A questionnaire was mailed to the members of the guideline development group asking them to rate their agreement with the 12 recommendations for primary care as well as with the appropriateness of referral of patients described in the 108 case scenarios (seein the supplementary material online). Agreement was scored on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree).

Published guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA), yet studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the treatment approach of both primary care physicians and rheumatologists. During the past decade, quality indicators have been developed by several groups in order to provide a minimally acceptable standard of care. This article summarizes the results of a qualitative systematic review of the English-language literature on quality indicators for osteoarthritis and highlights relevant indicators published by the Arthritis Foundation and American College of Rheumatology.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^4aa90b16]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline — osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee in VA and DoD settings is addressed by stating that, regardless of the setting, any patient in the VA and DoD healthcare systems should have access to the interventions recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient's specific circumstances. Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient-centered, and thus treatment and care should consider a patient's needs and preferences with effective, open communication supported by evidence-based information tailored to the patient's needs. The information that patients are given about treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and available to people with limited literacy skills, treatment information should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities, and family and caregiver involvement should be considered, if appropriate. This CPG is designed to assist providers in managing or co-managing adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of OA of the hip and/or knee, and the patient population of interest includes those with OA who are eligible for care in the VA and DoD healthcare systems and those in the community who receive care from community-based providers, including Veterans as well as deployed and non-deployed active duty Service, Guard, and Reserve Members and their dependents.

VA/DoD osteoarthritis guideline — Appendix D 2014 recommendations for non-surgical management state the following: Clinicians should conduct a history and physical examination for all patients, with an emphasis on the musculoskeletal examination. Clinicians may use plain radiography to confirm the clinical diagnosis of hip and knee osteoarthritis. Clinicians should not use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an evaluative tool to diagnose, confirm, or manage the treatment of osteoarthritis. Clinicians should avoid routine use of laboratory examinations or synovial fluid analysis to diagnose osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee. The decision to prescribe any intervention should be based on consideration of assessment findings, risk vs. benefit analysis, pain severity, functional status, patient preference, and resource utilization. For patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee, clinicians should attempt the core non-surgical therapies prior to referral to surgery. For patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee, clinicians should refer for physical therapist services early on, as part of a comprehensive management plan. Clinicians should refer overweight or obese patients (defined by a BMI > 25 kg/m²) with osteoarthritis of the knee to a weight management program to lose a minimum of five percent body weight and maintain this new level of weight.

### Early-stage symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee-time for action [^e29d652e]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) remains the most challenging arthritic disorder, with a high burden of disease and no available disease-modifying treatments. Symptomatic early-stage OA of the knee (the focus of this Review) urgently needs to be identified and defined, as efficient early-stage case finding and diagnosis in primary care would enable health-care providers to proactively and substantially reduce the burden of disease through proper management including structured education, exercise and weight management (when needed) and addressing lifestyle-related risk factors for disease progression. Efforts to define patient populations with symptomatic early-stage knee OA on the basis of validated classification criteria are ongoing. Such criteria, as well as the identification of molecular and imaging biomarkers of disease risk and/or progression, would enable well-designed clinical studies, facilitate interventional trials, and aid the discovery and validation of cellular and molecular targets for novel therapies. Treatment strategies, relevant outcomes and ethical issues also need to be considered in the context of the cost-effective management of symptomatic early-stage knee OA. To move forwards, a multidisciplinary and sustained international effort involving all major stakeholders is required.

### Lower extremity osteoarthritis management needs a paradigm shift [^41e10f42]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The current pre-eminent focus in osteoarthritis research and clinical practice is on persons with established radiographic disease. This is the very end-stage of disease genesis and modern therapies are thus largely palliative. A major shift in the focus of osteoarthritis research and clinical practice is critically needed if an impact is to be made for the millions living with the chronic pain and disability of osteoarthritis. The disease management paradigm needs to be revolutionised to focus on persons at high risk of developing or with early disease in which structural changes may be preventable or reversible. Similarly, current palliation should shift towards coordinated conservative management with reorganisation of the delivery of health services.

### Osteoarthritis… [^33783c3e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.
- It causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling — usually in the hands, hips, back, or knees.
- There is no cure for OA, but you can effectively manage it. Overview Osteoarthritis is a disease that breaks down one or more joints in the body.
- It most commonly affects the hands, hips, back, and knees.
- It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in affected joint.
- Over time, it can lead to changes in bone, cartilage, and other joint tissues — resulting in disability or making it hard for someone to do work or daily tasks. OA is common among adults 45 and older. But it is not a regular part of aging.
- There are things you can do to prevent or delay it.
- There are also things you can do to manage it, if you develop it. Signs and symptoms People with OA may experience a wide range of symptoms. These can include:

- Joint pain, especially when moving the joint.
- Stiffness after resting a joint.
- Swelling in and around the joint, especially after using it a lot.
- Feeling like the joint is loose or unstable.
- Less ability to move the joint. Things that increase the risk for OA Certain things can increase your chances of developing OA. These include:

- Repetitive joint stress or injury — Injuring or over-using a joint can damage it and increase your risk of OA.
- Obesity — Extra weight can affect a person's metabolism and increase the risk of OA, especially in weight-bearing joints like the hips or knees.
- Family history — People who have a family member with OA may be at higher risk of developing it. Treatment What you can do While there is no cure, there are proven ways to manage OA symptoms and reduce pain. For example, ways you can manage your arthritis include:

- Being physically active.
- Keeping a healthy weight.
- Protecting your joints.
- Talking to a health care provider about symptoms and care plans.
- Learning skills to self-manage OA and improve quality of life. CDC recognizes over 20 physical activity and self-management education programs that can help reduce OA symptoms like pain and disability.

Osteoarthritis guideline — introduction describes that osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 302 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability among older adults, with the knees, hips, and hands the most commonly affected appendicular joints. OA is characterized by whole-joint pathology including cartilage degradation, bone remodeling, osteophyte formation, and synovial inflammation, leading to pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of normal joint function. Patients with OA are likely to be treated with a number of different pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions, often in combination, and while some principles apply to all patients, some recommendations are specific to particular joints such as the hip, knee, patellofemoral joint, and first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), or to particular patient populations such as those with erosive OA.

Despite the high prevalence and burden of osteoarthritis (OA) worldwide, management of OA continues to primarily focus on symptom management due to the lack of approved pharmacologic agents that halt disease progression. Recent recommendations from 6 professional societies support the importance of education, self-management approaches, weight loss, and physical modalities in managing OA. These recent guidelines also highlight the paucity of effective and safe treatment options, with recommendations against ineffective therapies outnumbering those for effective ones. NSAIDs, oral and topical, remain the primary recommended pharmacologic management option for OA.

Because the recommendation "does not interfere with other interventions or clinical practice" it "is deemed very feasible in a subset of overweight and obese patients". For evidence gaps, "Future research should focus on large randomized clinical trials and should focus more on function and quality of life measures since it appears obvious that pain improved through weight loss".

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^b3bfb9aa]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Bone and Joint Decade (2000–10) initiated the first international drive to prioritize OA and joint pain in older adults and its impact on the Western world. The diagnostic label of OA is ranked 11th in terms of its impact on years lived with disability. However, joint pain in those of 45 years and over is ranked as the number one cause of years with disability worldwide. According to health leaders and epidemiologists, the population trends are clear for the next 30 years, and with the ageing population and increased obesity and physical inactivity, joint pain and OA are set to rise.

Joint pain and OA are predominantly managed in primary care, and while there are national and international guidelines for the care and management of OA in adults [such as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), EULAR, Osteoarthritis Research Society International, ACR), there is a gap between what we know and what we do [e.g.]. This paper describes the challenges and gaps in OA care, particularly in relation to population health management, interventions and outcomes. It is set in the context of competing health priorities and multimorbidity, access to high quality care, resource limitations and models of care. The overuse of some therapies and neglect of others will be discussed, as well as the potential for self-management. Many of the challenges are predominantly taken from experiences in the National Health Service (NHS), UK. The role of the healthcare team will be highlighted in enhancing best care for OA and providing solutions for closing the evidence practice gap.

### Osteoarthritis | CDC… [^aa01ee8f]. archive.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Some people call it degenerative joint disease or "wear and tear" arthritis. It occurs most frequently in the hands, hips, and knees. With OA, the cartilage within a joint begins to break down and the underlying bone begins to change. These changes usually develop slowly and get worse over time. OA can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling. In some cases it also causes reduced function and disability; some people are no longer able to do daily tasks or work. What are the risk factors for OA.
- Joint injury or overuse — Injury or overuse, such as knee bending and repetitive stress on a joint, can damage a joint and increase the risk of OA in that joint.
- Age — The risk of developing OA increases with age.
- Sex — Women are more likely to develop OA than men, especially after age 50.
- Obesity — Extra weight puts more stress on joints, particularly weight-bearing joints like the hips and knees.

This stress increases the risk of OA in that joint. Also, obesity may also have metabolic effects that increase the risk of OA.
- Genetics — People who have family members with OA are more likely to develop OA.
- **Osteoarthritis in another body location**: People who have hand OA are more likely to develop knee OA.
- Race — Some Asian populations have lower risk for OA. How is OA diagnosed. A doctor diagnoses OA through a review of symptoms, physical examination, X-rays, and lab tests. A rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in arthritis and other related conditions, can help if there are any questions about the diagnosis. How is OA treated.

There is no cure for OA, so doctors usually treat OA symptoms with various therapies, which may include:

- Increasing physical activity
- Physical therapy with muscle strengthening exercises
- Weight loss
- Medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers and prescription drugs
- Supportive devices such as crutches or canes
- Surgery. In addition to these treatments, people can gain confidence in managing their OA with self-management strategies. These strategies help reduce pain and disability so people with osteoarthritis can pursue the activities that are important to them. These five simple and effective arthritis management strategies can help.
- Pain or aching
- Stiffness
- Decreased range of motion
- Swelling.

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part II: OARSI evidence-based, expert consensus guidelines [^5df6c2f1]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop concise, patient-focussed, up to date, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), which are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied health care professionals in general and specialist practise throughout the world.

Methods

Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care, rheumatology, orthopaedics and evidence-based medicine), two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument. A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by European League Against Rheumatism and evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio and cost per quality-adjusted life years gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale.

Results

Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature search, including six opinion-based, five evidence-based and 12 based on both expert opinion and research evidence. Twenty out of 51 treatment modalities addressed by these guidelines were universally recommended. ES for pain relief varied from treatment to treatment. Overall there was no statistically significant difference between non-pharmacological therapies [0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.34] and pharmacological therapies (ES = 0.39, 95% CI 0.31, 0.47). Following feedback from Osteoarthritis Research International members on the draft guidelines and six Delphi rounds consensus was reached on 25 carefully worded recommendations. Optimal management of patients with OA hip or knee requires a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities of therapy. Recommendations cover the use of 12 non-pharmacological modalities: education and self-management, regular telephone contact, referral to a physical therapist, aerobic, muscle strengthening and water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking aids, knee braces, footwear and insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture. Eight recommendations cover pharmacological modalities of treatment including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) non-selective and selective oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronates, glucosamine and/or chondroitin sulphate for symptom relief; glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and diacerein for possible structure-modifying effects and the use of opioid analgesics for the treatment of refractory pain. There are recommendations covering five surgical modalities: total joint replacements, unicompartmental knee replacement, osteotomy and joint preserving surgical procedures; joint lavage and arthroscopic debridement in knee OA, and joint fusion as a salvage procedure when joint replacement had failed. Strengths of recommendation and 95% CIs are provided.

Conclusion

Twenty-five carefully worded recommendations have been generated based on a critical appraisal of existing guidelines, a systematic review of research evidence and the consensus opinions of an international, multidisciplinary group of experts. The recommendations may be adapted for use in different countries or regions according to the availability of treatment modalities and SOR for each modality of therapy. These recommendations will be revised regularly following systematic review of new research evidence as this becomes available.

Nonetheless, given the significant costs associated with OA and the increased risks of anxiety and depression in this group of patients, future research should explore the costs and benefits of appropriate management strategies for anxiety and/or depression once detected in patients presenting with clinical OA in primary care. Assessing ways of identifying those anxiety or depressive symptoms that are likely to make future management services both less cost‐effective and more costly would also be helpful.

OA care models and pathways to enhance coordination

Many of the specific gaps in OA care can be at least partly attributed to a lack of care coordination and a purposeful management approach. Without a model for how, when and by whom specific OA-related therapies are provided, there is a high risk that some components of care will be neglected. This can be particularly challenging since OA treatments are delivered by different types of providers, yet a point person is not always apparent. Another challenge is that although OA treatment guidelines provide information about therapies that should be delivered, they are largely silent regarding when specific treatments are appropriate and how various therapies may best fit together in a comprehensive treatment approach. Unfortunately, research to date has provided little evidence regarding the optimal timing, integration or criteria for different OA therapies. However, a number of efforts have applied practical, clinical experience to OA treatment guidelines, developing treatment algorithms and care models that can serve as guides and examples for rheumatologists and other clinicians.

Development of OA treatment algorithms

Two recent international efforts developed clinical algorithms for OA treatment. Meneses et al. performed a systematic review of OA treatment guidelines and then used an iterative expert panel process to derive clinical algorithms for the treatment of hand, hip and knee OA. These algorithms consider key issues such as comorbid health conditions and offer a step-wise approach for delivery of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. The algorithms also provide general decision rules for when more intensive or different therapies should be considered. An example algorithm for a patient with knee OA and several comorbidities is shown in Fig. 2; four different algorithms are available and can provide a practical approach for rheumatologists and clinics to operationalize treatment of OA. Bruyére and colleagues also developed algorithms that focus on pharmacotherapy for knee OA.

### Non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis: where are we now and where do we need to go? [^3562f8b0]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Given this background, proper guidance on the management of OA is needed. This issue has been addressed over recent months in updated guidelines or recommendations from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO). In addition, the OA Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee OA were updated and published recently. While previous OARSI guidelines addressed the management of hip and knee OA, the updated guidelines focused specifically on the knee, evaluating the safety and efficacy profiles of currently available treatment options. Given the relative paucity of novel data, the authors took an innovative approach to enhance the specificity of treatment recommendations: they defined OA clinical subphenotypes (knee-only OA with and without comorbidities; multijoint OA with and without comorbidities).

Commonly, we distinguish three treatment modalities: non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical. Figure 1 summarises treatments OARSI recommends are 'Appropriate' in at least one of the four subphenotypes. They suggest not using treatments rated 'Inappropriate' (eg, risedronate, electrotherapy), but others are rated 'Uncertain' (eg, acupuncture, chrondroitin, glucosamin or opioids). For the latter, the authors recommend physician–patient interaction to determine whether this treatment may have merit for an individual patient. Referral for consideration of orthopaedic surgical intervention is indicated after more conservative treatment options have been exhausted. Although both patients and doctors consider postponing surgery a success, for many patients joint replacement is eventually the final treatment option. This implies that, despite the variety of appropriate non-surgical treatment options, there are still considerable limitations in either success rate or tolerability when treating established knee OA.

Management recommendations

General considerations (evaluating a patient with pain)

The recommendations are based on graded evidence as explained previously. The grades are mentioned in parenthesis next to each recommendation.

History

A thorough evaluation of the patient profile, patient history and presence of comorbid conditions is necessary as a first step toward pain diagnosis (C).
Diagnosis should involve measurement of pain intensity, physical examination, sensory examination, motor examination and evaluation of cognitive and functional well-being (B).

Assessment and monitoring

Identify and use appropriate pain assessment tools (A) For the purpose of designing treatment strategies for managing pain, it is essential to assess the severity of the pain. Use of pain assessment scales may help in the diagnosis of the disease, design of treatment strategies, monitoring and evaluation of outcome of therapy or for predicting the impact of pain on functional outcomes of a patient (Table 3). Factors that should be taken into consideration while selecting the appropriate pain assessment method include sensitivity and specificity, usefulness or value of the assessment tool, objective of the assessment, age of the patient and extent of symptoms presented by the patient.
Sensory examination Components of a sensory examination include light touch, pinprick, temperature (hot or cold) and vibration. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) might help distinguish between various types of neuropathic pain. In patients with neuropathy, the threshold for pinprick and thermal sensations are increased, while increased sensitivity to light touch may indicate presence of allodynia or hyperalgesia, which may point toward painful inflammation or fibromyalgia with a central neuropathic origin.–The QST has also been used in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, although not as a sole measure.
Motor examination Evaluation of motor function is an important method of diagnosing musculoskeletal pain, especially back pain and neck pain. Exercises such as neck rotation and neck flexion or extension tests may help determine the localization and intensity of pain (D).
Diagnostic tests Examination by X-rays is the most common method used to confirm the localization of pain, particularly in LBP, neck pain, joint pain or pain associated with internal organs. Use of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in cases in which diagnosis by physical examination or X-ray may be insufficient or if any underlying damage to the CNS is suspected to be involved. Further details are presented in the Supplementary material section.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^4fb9215d]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The role of rheumatologist in OA management

OA is most often managed in primary care, with referral to secondary care typically only in more advanced stages or complex presentations. However, rheumatologists have a key role and opportunity for leadership in OA management. First, rheumatologists have content expertise in the management of OA and can therefore be leaders in health systems, driving appropriate models of care and quality improvement. Leadership in this area is greatly needed, considering the gaps in quality of OA care and often a lack of a champion for treatment of this health condition. Second, OA commonly co-occurs with other rheumatic conditions, particularly among older adults. Therefore, rheumatologists can set an example of delivering the highest quality of OA care, incorporating both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. The following are specific practical recommendations for ways rheumatologist can lead the way in optimizing OA care:

Provide education and support in OA management to primary care colleagues

Because primary care providers are responsible for managing a wide range of health conditions, it is not realistic to expect they will typically be experts in musculoskeletal medicine. Rheumatologists can bridge this gap by providing periodic educational sessions on OA care for primary care providers, covering evidence-based therapies and specific challenging clinical situations. In some health care settings, individual rheumatologists or groups of rheumatology clinicians may be able to provide virtual or electronic consults to provide input on specific patients or scenarios. This may be particularly useful for rural primary care providers who do not have ready in-person access to musculoskeletal expertise.

Provide leadership in developing an OA patient pathway or model of care within the healthcare system

The example algorithms and models of care described above can be an excellent starting place for developing a context-appropriate OA pathway. Because of content area expertise, rheumatologists are equipped to lead multidisciplinary efforts (involving primary care, orthopaedics and rehabilitation) to develop and implement pathways that facilitate evidence-based and comprehensive OA care.

Connect with community organizations and resources

Behavioural treatments such as exercise and weight loss are key components of managing OA. Resources to support patients in these behaviours are often not available within the healthcare system. However, many services are available within the community. Rheumatologists can have a significant impact on patients' OA management by connecting them with evidence-based, reputable community resources to support healthy behaviours.

### Multimodal treatment patterns for osteoarthritis and their relationship to patient-reported pain severity: a cross-sectional survey in the United States [^9a000b16]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States (US), and its prevalence is increasing. Pain is the hallmark symptom of OA, often driving individuals to seek medical attention and contributing to functional limitations, reducing quality of life, and increasing the overall healthcare burden. Joint pain in OA is complex and incompletely understood, particularly as pain does not consistently correlate with observed structural joint damage. It can be a product of multiple factors, including peripheral/central sensitization and individual patient characteristics. These factors can further complicate the treatment of OA.

As OA can involve multiple joints and is progressive in nature, treatment is often dynamic and long term. Clinical guidelines for the management of OA are joint-specific and increasingly personalized, taking into account each patient's comorbidity profile, concerns, goals, and personal situation. Treatment for OA is generally focused on alleviating pain and reducing functional impairment through nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions.

The data in the presented treatment analysis were collected in 2017 as part of the Adelphi Disease Specific Programme (DSP). At the time, both the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR)guidelines for the nonsurgical management of hip and knee OA strongly recommended aerobic/resistance land-based exercise, water-based exercise, and weight loss (for overweight patients only) as appropriate nonpharmacologic therapies. This was to be conducted alongside the receipt of medications, if required, including acetaminophen (for those without comorbidities), oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [for those without comorbidities]; preferably topical for the knee), and intra-articular corticosteroids. A number of other nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are recommended in each of these guidelines.

Oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and they remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy, and oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While the guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others, and safe use includes appropriate patient selection with regular monitoring for potential adverse gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects and potential drug interactions; doses should be as low as possible, and NSAID treatment should be continued for as short a time as possible.

### Core recommendations for osteoarthritis care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^5f87a20e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Many of these recommendations are routinely utilized in clinical care. Further high‐quality trials are needed to determine their efficacy and/or their suitability for certain subgroups of individuals with OA in order to guide clinicians' practice. CPG recommendations vary, potentially due to differences in evidence included based on the year of CPG publication, assessment of evidence quality, and involvement of expert panels or societies members. For example, 1 CPG recommended against heat therapy, while another CPG recommended that it can be considered as an adjunctive management option for people with hip and/or knee OA. Both CPGs acknowledged limited evidence supporting this intervention; however, interpretation of evidence by the respective guideline development groups led to conflicting recommendations.

While exercise, weight management, and education were supported across the CPGs and have been recommended as first‐line interventions for almost 2 decades, translation into practice remains an issue. In Western health care settings including Australia, Europe, the UK, and the US, a majority of patients do not receive care consistent with CPGs. Conservative management interventions are often overlooked in favor of pharmacologic and surgical care despite being associated with higher financial costs and risks (e.g. medication side effects or surgical complications). Globally, utilization of exercise and education is low, while pharmacologic therapy and surgical referrals are common. In Australia, joint replacement surgeries are a substantial cost to the health care system, estimated at between $19,000 and $30,000 (Australian; between $13,000 and $20,600 US dollars) per patient for total knee or hip replacement, resulting in an expenditure of $1.2 billion (Australian) annually on both public and private hospital services; similar findings have been documented in the UK and the US. Surgery is a successful and cost‐effective intervention for people with end‐stage hip and knee OA, although overuse of surgery in patients who could benefit from conservative care remains a challenge.

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Overall pain and function improved with weight loss achieved through a combination of diet and exercise, and given the current evidence, it is at the discretion of the surgeon as to which approach is utilized to address weight loss, however a combination of diet and exercises appears to be the preferred alternative. The Weight Loss Intervention recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence. There are no known or anticipated harms associated with implementing this recommendation. Management of obesity and overweight through weight loss may have high impact on symptoms and overall health. Weight loss presents a potentially high level of cost effectiveness compared to other surgical and nonsurgical approaches; however, the cost-effectiveness of different weight loss approaches is still to be determined.

### Defining an international standard set of outcome measures for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis: consensus of the international consortium for health outcomes measurement hip and knee osteoarthritis working group [^894ac48f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Total expenditures on health care as a percentage of the gross domestic product continue to rise worldwide 1. Yet the World Health Organization estimates that 20–40% of health care costs are unnecessary 2. Uncertainty about health outcomes combined with increasing costs has driven interest in value‐based health care (i.e. the idea of competition on value rather than volume in health care), where value is defined as the ratio between patient outcomes and the costs necessary to achieve those outcomes. By focusing on the measurement and reporting of outcomes that matter to patients over the full cycle of care, value‐based health care empowers patients to make informed choices about their care and enables providers to improve outcomes, increase efficiency, streamline care processes, and decrease the costly and inefficient fragmentation of care delivery 3. Currently, a major challenge in measuring value in health care is the lack of universal metrics for defining value. Therefore, in an effort to facilitate the transition to value‐based health care, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convenes international working groups to develop standardized and concise outcome measure sets for specific medical conditions, with a focus on the outcomes that matter most to patients.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) are among the leading causes of global disability, with an aging and increasingly obese population worldwide likely to increase its prevalence 4. The total annual cost of OA per patient has been estimated to be as much as $5,700 in the US 5. Pain and impaired joint function are the main limiting symptoms affecting patients with OA, which typically develops over the course of many years, with varying symptom intensity over time 6. The modern management of symptomatic hip or knee OA involves holistic assessment and selection of therapies from a wide range of options, ranging from lifestyle interventions and education to oral medication and joint replacement surgery 7. All patients should be offered basic treatment options such as lifestyle interventions and education 8. Many patients will require options such as physiotherapy, walking aids, oral medication, or intraarticular injections. If nonsurgical treatment alternatives are insufficient to control symptoms, a smaller group of patients may be candidates for joint replacement or other surgical interventions.

Case‐mix factors

A number of patient characteristics and risk factors are known to influence the outcomes shown in Table 1. To ensure fair comparisons across providers with diverse patient populations, the working group identified and defined key adjustment measures to include in the Standard Set. We sought internationally valid measures that minimized the burden of data collection on both patients and health care providers. As described above for the selection of outcome measures, the working group first agreed on the risk factor domains to be included and then selected definitions for measuring these domains. Selected domains were patient demographics, body habitus, lifestyle factors, joint related factors, and comorbidities. Table 2 shows a complete list of the risk adjustment measures with the percentage of working group members who agreed on their inclusion.

Table 2
Case‐mix variable domains and definitions included in the Standard Set

Demographics, body habitus, and lifestyle factors

The key demographic factors considered important to include in the Standard Set were patient age, sex, and socioeconomic status 35, 36, 37. Although many different indicators of socioeconomic status have been published in the literature, only education level as defined by the International Standard Classification of Education can be considered consistent across countries and cultures for international use 36, 38. The working group also identified body mass index, smoking status, and living condition as having a potentially important influence on outcomes and relevant for inclusion in the Standard Set 39.

Although physical activity was considered an important factor affecting treatment outcomes, an appropriate and feasible measure could not be identified. Therefore, the working group adapted a question from the Better Management of Patients with Osteoarthritis Registry in Sweden to create the question shown in Table 2. The working group recommends but does not require the use of this newly developed question. The validity of this question will be tested and its formal inclusion in the Standard Set determined in time.

Joint history

The diversity of symptoms and clinical presentations of OA as well as its multifactorial etiology suggest that OA is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a common structural end point 40. Unfortunately, despite a large body of research, there is no commonly accepted system for classifying OA phenotypes 41. As specific disease history and etiology may influence disease progression and outcome of treatment, in the absence of an existing, robust classification system, the working group developed a simple physician‐reported measure of joint history that broadly categorizes OA etiologies (Table 2). A similar physician‐reported measure of joint‐specific previous surgical history was also included in the set. Physicians are asked to report these measures for all 4 joints, as multiple joint involvement affects outcomes 42.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis — for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^bad19461]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Goals for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) emphasize pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and improvement in functioning. Among pharmacological pain management interventions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently recommended as the most effective treatment option for OA. However, the use of traditional oral NSAIDs is associated with risk of serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Topical NSAIDs are an alternative with well-established tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand. While the management of OA pain is evolving toward the more widespread use of topical NSAIDs, some OA management guidelines have yet to incorporate these agents in their recommendations. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, their current placement in OA management guidelines, and their potential role in enabling pain specialists to provide individualized care for their patients with OA.

Pharmacological management: acetaminophen — In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that when not contraindicated, oral acetaminophen may be considered to improve pain and function in the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip. Quality of Evidence: Consensus and Strength of Option: Consensus. The systematic literature review yielded no studies that met inclusion criteria for this option, and the use of non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids. Although oral acetaminophen is widely utilized to treat osteoarthritis of the hip, there are contraindications to its use. Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with preexisting liver disease. Acetaminophen is widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip, this option should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice, and oral acetaminophen is widely available such that this option should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^0df9c706]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical approaches

Surgical treatments are offered for progressive pain and disability. The benefits of arthroscopic surgery on quality of life over the long term are minimal, and those with knee disease experience very small improvements in pain and function when compared with others who receive conservative management. As the evidence fails to support a persistence of benefit over the long term, there is a trade-off between the marginal short-term benefits against the burden of the surgical procedure. Many international guidelines do not recommend arthroscopy unless there is true mechanical locking of the knee [e.g.]. The use of arthroscopy for knee OA has decreased; however, it is still prevalent. Pressure from patients to do something, the perception that other options are limited, that surgeons want to meet patients' expectations, and time pressures in clinic, all appear to influence the choice to undertake arthroscopic procedures. Winter et al. evaluated the risk of total knee replacement (TKA) in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. They found that those undergoing arthroscopy might anticipate an annual rate of TKA in the order of 2%, with higher rates among older patients and those with more advanced OA. Clinicians and patients considering knee arthroscopy should discuss the likelihood of subsequent TKA as they weigh risks and benefits of surgery.

Knee OA can be managed well non-surgically, but many patients and providers still consider total joint arthroplasty (TJA) the only option, especially at later stages of disease. Many patients have good results with TJA, but there is still a subset who have sub-optimal results, and all the factors that predict good outcome are unknown. Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative on patients who had undergone TKA were used to determine the prevalence rates of TKA surgery classified as appropriate, inconclusive and inappropriate. Approximately one-third of TKA surgeries were judged to be inappropriate.

Surgeons have recognized the need for support tools for making the decision for TJA. Canadian stakeholders have identified several potential criteria for TJA: evidence of arthritis on joint examination; patient-reported symptoms negatively impacting quality of life; an adequate trial of appropriate non-surgical treatment; realistic patient expectations of surgery; mental and physical readiness of the individual for surgery; and patient-surgeon agreement that potential benefits exceed risks. However, there remains a need for validated tools to adequately assess and communicate appropriateness criteria for TJA.

Guideline scope and methodology — this updated clinical practice guideline replaces the second edition completed in 2015 and considered the literature previously examined as well as empirical evidence published since the 2015 guideline. In April 2019, the AAOS adopted the use of the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework for guideline development, which enables work group members to incorporate additional factors into the strength of each recommendation and move away from the rigidity of previous AAOS recommendation language stems; inclusion criteria are detailed in the section "Study Selection Criteria" (eAppendix 1).

### Systematic review of guidelines for the physical management of osteoarthritis [^e1a3549b]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To undertake a systematic critical appraisal of guidelines to provide a summary of recommendations for the physical management of osteoarthritis (OA).

Data Sources

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus with Full Text, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and Google Scholar databases were searched (2000–2013) to identify all guidelines, protocols, and recommendations for the management or treatment of OA. In addition, Internet searches of all relevant arthritis organizations were undertaken. All searches were performed between July 2012 and end of April 2013. Guidelines that included only pharmacological, injection therapy, or surgical interventions were excluded. Guidelines published only in English were retrieved.

Study Selection

OA guidelines developed from evidence-based research, consensus, and/or expert opinion were retrieved. There were no restrictions on severity or site of OA, sex, or age. Nineteen guidelines were identified for evaluation.

Data Extraction

The quality of all guidelines was critically appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation II instrument. Each guideline was independently reviewed. All relevant recommendations for the physical management of OA were synthesized, graded, and ranked according to available evidence.

Data Synthesis

Seventeen guidelines with recommendations on the physical management of OA met the inclusion criteria and underwent a full critical appraisal. There were variations in the interventions, levels of evidence, and strength of recommendations across the guidelines. Forty different interventions were identified. Recommendations were graded from "strongly recommended" to "unsupported". Exercise and education were found to be strongly recommended by most guidelines.

Conclusions

Exercise and education were key recommendations supporting the importance of rehabilitation in the physical management of OA. This critical appraisal can assist health care providers who are involved in the management of people with OA.

### Insights into the complexity of presentation and management of patients: the sport and exercise physician's perspective [^4d4875cc]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Patient characteristics highlight the complexity of the conditions seen by Sport and Exercise Physicians in clinical practice. Over 60% of patients had had symptoms for more than 6 months and 42% did not have a diagnosis at presentation, reflecting the long and complex histories in this patient population. Adding to the complexity, the results showed the involvement of other healthcare providers in the management. Over 80% of patients had seen more than one allied health practitioner including physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, podiatrists and exercise physiologists and the majority had also seen other specialist medical practitioners including orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, neurologists, endocrinologists and other specialists. Overall, this shows how complex and challenging these patients can be at the time they present to Sport and Exercise Physicians. This may also delay patients presenting to Sport and Exercise Physicians. Therefore, it is important that all medical and allied healthcare providers have a better understanding of the role and scope of Sport and Exercise Physicians, so appropriate and timely referrals can be made.

Musculoskeletal-related conditions are the most common reason for accessing healthcare services in Australia, costing around $A4 billion that contribute to 7.5% of total health expenditure. The present study provides an overview of the cost involved for patients, before presenting to Sport and Exercise Physicians. We observed a large number of previous allied health and medical consultations, radiological investigations and treatments that resulted in considerable financial burden on patients. An early referral to Sport and Exercise Physicians may help to minimise unnecessary radiological investigations and potential delays in treatment, which can be both time and cost-effective for patients. Seventy-five per cent of patients in this study had undergone a radiological investigation prior to referral including a high proportion of MRI scans (40.1%) and CT scans (11.2%). More recent literature suggest, MRI and CT scans are not required in majority of patients with low back pain, and MRI should not be used in a clinical setting for diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Further, appropriateness and rationale of requesting MRI have been evaluated in previous studies and suggested that specialist-ordered MRIs influence clinical management significantly more often than primary care physicians. The importance of collaborative effort among clinicians and policymakers has been highlighted in the Australian context, to prioritise clinical research and funding to minimise the burden associated with musculoskeletal conditions.

### EULAR recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management in inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis [^4c9abaf3]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ankle osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to assess for the following as part of the initial evaluation of patients with OA:

- patient's needs, preferences, and priorities regarding pain management and important activities, values, and goals in daily life

- patient's pain characteristics, including severity, type, spread, and quality

- previous and ongoing pain treatments and the perceived efficacy

- current inflammation and joint damage as sources of pain, and whether these are adequately treated

- pain-related factors that might need attention, including the nature and extent of pain-related disability, beliefs and emotions about pain and pain-related disability, social influences related to pain and its consequences, sleep problems, and obesity.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^8f5bdd15]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (nonarthroplasty) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies for the nonarthroplasty treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults (ages 17 years and older). The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to evaluate current best evidence associated with treatment. The scope of this guideline contains nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, including surgical procedures less invasive than knee arthroplasty. It does not provide recommendations for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis of other joints, or other imflammatory athropathies. This guideline contains 29 recommendations to assist all qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals involved in the nonarthroplasty management of osteoarthritis of the knee and provide information for patients. In addition, the work group highlighted the need for better research into intra-articular corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma detailing osteoarthritis characterization, including subgroup analyses and osteoarthrosis severity stratification, and clinically relevant outcomes with control subjects for bias and cost-effectiveness analysis. Studies comparing outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and an MRI confirmed meniscal tear who have undergone partial meniscectomy after failing to improve with a course of conservative treatment (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injection, and physical therapy) versus those who have undergone partial meniscectomy without a dedicated course of conservative treatment. Prospective randomized trials or prospective cohort studies are still needed to establish efficacy of individual oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within specific subgroups and populations to tailor systemic medications to help increase efficacy and decrease the risk of adverse effects.

Emotional and physical impact — patients with osteoarthritis have approximately 20% higher mortality than age matched controls, and anxiety and depression are prevalent in approximately 19% of patients. Older adults with self-reported osteoarthritis visit their physicians more frequently and experience greater functional limitations than others in the same age group, and demographic trends suggest the social and physical impact of knee osteoarthritis will continue to be widespread.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^4b18a5d4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis — acetaminophen — is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Effect sizes in clinical trials are very small and meta-analysis has suggested monotherapy may be ineffective, and longer-term treatment is no better than placebo for most individuals. For those with limited pharmacologic options due to intolerance of or contraindications to NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be appropriate for short-term and episodic use, and regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity is required for patients who receive acetaminophen on a regular basis, particularly at the recommended maximum dosage of 3 g daily in divided doses.

### Nonsurgical management of osteoarthritis knee pain in the older adult: an update [^5f914f37]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a common complaint of many elderly patients in primary care offices. For those unable or unwilling to undergo knee replacement, the primary practitioners' understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the available treatment modalities for pain relief is critical to successful in-office counseling and expectation management. Treatment requires a multimodal approach of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies to achieve a maximal clinical benefit. The focus of this review is on the nonsurgical options for treatment of knee osteoarthritis in patients aged 65 and older.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^c7f9a8cd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

ACR/Arthritis Foundation osteoarthritis guideline — evidence review scope and limitations note a focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with systematic reviews of observational studies included when they added critical information such as adverse effects not seen in shorter-duration RCTs; important RCT limitations considered included possible publication bias, inadequate blinding, and inadequate provision of active comparators and appropriate sham alternatives, and short-duration RCTs cannot provide adequate prognostic information in OA where processes are slowly progressive over decades; the review focused on management options available in the US and on pharmacologic agents available in pharmaceutical-grade formulations, eliminating most nutraceuticals, was limited to the English-language literature, and examined www.clinicaltrials.gov for phase 2 and 3 trials that might become US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved by publication; a hierarchy of outcome measures assessing pain and function in OA was developed based on the published literature.

### EULAR recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management in inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis [^9067e2e3]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to management of pain (nonpharmacological measures), EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering orthotics (such as splints, braces, sleeves, insoles, and shoes), daily living aids, assistive devices (such as a cane or rollator), or ergonomic adaptation at home and workplace in patients having pain during activities of daily living impeding functioning. Consider referring patients desiring assistive support to an occupational therapist.
