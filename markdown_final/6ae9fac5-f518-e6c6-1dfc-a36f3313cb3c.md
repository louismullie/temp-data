## Question

What were the key safety findings in ENZAMET with enzalutamide, and how do they contextualize the observed survival benefit?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key safety findings in ENZAMET with enzalutamide and how they contextualize the observed survival benefit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and baseline characteristics to frame safety in context. Then, I should quantify the magnitude of efficacy, especially overall survival, to weigh against toxicity. Next, I will extract and verify the key adverse events, including discontinuations, seizures, fatigue, hypertension, and cognitive effects. After that, I should review quality-of-life data and deterioration-free survival to understand net patient-centered benefit. Finally, I will integrate these findings with guideline positions and consider practical risk mitigation and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the trial context and baseline features so I don't jump to conclusions about safety without anchoring to the population and exposures. ENZAMET was an international, open-label, phase 3 randomized trial of 1,125 men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, comparing testosterone suppression plus enzalutamide 160 mg daily versus testosterone suppression plus a first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen, with about 44% receiving early docetaxel and a median age around 69 years, which sets the stage for interpreting adverse event frequencies and tolerability in a real-world, mixed-burden mHSPC cohort [^115gUjAW] [^114cuiti].

> I need to verify the magnitude of benefit to balance against toxicity. The primary overall survival analysis showed a 33% reduction in the risk of death with enzalutamide, with 3-year OS estimates of 80% versus 72% favoring enzalutamide, and this benefit persisted across subgroups including those with and without early docetaxel, reinforcing that the survival gain is clinically meaningful and not trivial in this setting [^114cuiti] [^114AvGjk].

> Now, let me extract the key safety signals and double-check the numbers. Discontinuation due to adverse events was more frequent with enzalutamide than with standard antiandrogens, 33 versus 14 events, indicating a higher intolerance burden that clinicians should anticipate and proactively manage [^114cuiti]. Seizures occurred in 7 patients on enzalutamide versus 0 on control, a 1% signal that mandates caution in patients with seizure risk factors and supports counseling and dose interruption if seizures occur [^114cuiti] [^113kycEL]. Fatigue was more common and clinically consequential, with grade 2 fatigue in 25% on enzalutamide versus 14% on control, aligning with the known CNS penetrance and androgen deprivation synergy [^114cuiti]. Hypertension was also more frequent, with grade 3 hypertension in 10% on enzalutamide versus 6% on control, warranting baseline and on-treatment blood pressure monitoring and management [^114AvGjk]. Cognitive complaints, captured as memory impairment, occurred in 13% on enzalutamide versus 4% on control, which can impact daily function and should be screened during follow-up [^114AvGjk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about patient experience without quality-of-life data. I should confirm how enzalutamide affected global and domain-specific HRQL. Repeated-measures analyses showed modest but statistically significant early worsening in fatigue, physical function, and cognitive function with enzalutamide, yet these deficits did not worsen over time and were counterbalanced by improved deterioration-free survival across overall health and quality of life, physical function, and cognitive function, indicating that delayed progression outweighed early symptom burdens for many patients [^112r5QZT] [^113fHjNE]. Let me reconsider the clinical significance threshold; the mean differences were below commonly used minimal clinically important differences, suggesting that while measurable, many patients may not perceive these changes as clinically large, though individual susceptibility varies [^112r5QZT].

> Next, I should review how these safety findings fit within the broader evidence base and guidelines so I don't overgeneralize from a single trial. NCCN and AUA/SUO endorse enzalutamide plus ADT as a category 1 option for mCSPC based on ENZAMET and ARCHES, acknowledging the established safety profile that includes fatigue, seizures, and hypertension, and emphasizing that benefits persist across disease volumes and with or without early docetaxel, which supports routine use with appropriate monitoring [^112tye8g] [^116At9NS] [^113kycEL]. I should confirm that no new safety signals emerged in longer-term follow-up; indeed, subsequent analyses have not identified unexpected toxicities, reinforcing the consistency of the profile over time [^114AvGjk].

> I will now examine practical risk mitigation and monitoring so clinicians can translate this into bedside care. Before starting enzalutamide, I need to ensure seizure risk is assessed and managed, consider dose interruption if a seizure occurs, and counsel on fall risk given fatigue and dizziness reports. Baseline and periodic blood pressure checks are prudent given the hypertension signal, and clinicians should proactively manage fatigue with activity, sleep hygiene, and dose modifications as needed. For cognitive complaints, I should screen at each visit and consider dose reduction or brief holidays in select cases, balancing against oncologic benefit [^114cuiti] [^114AvGjk]. Wait, let me verify the dose-reduction point; while ENZAMET did not test reduced doses, observational and exploratory data suggest some patients may tolerate lower dosing with maintained activity, though prospective equivalence data are limited, so any dose reduction should be individualized and evidence-informed rather than routine [^115iGrKV].

> But wait, what if the patient is particularly concerned about early declines in energy or cognition; I should explain that these effects often emerge within 3 months and tend to stabilize, and that the net clinical benefit, as reflected by deterioration-free survival, favors enzalutamide because disease control delays progression-related declines in function and quality of life, which is why guidelines still recommend it as a standard option despite these manageable toxicities [^112r5QZT] [^112tye8g]. I should also note that the absolute increase in discontinuation is modest and that most patients complete therapy without stopping, which helps frame expectations realistically [^114cuiti].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and balanced. ENZAMET demonstrates a robust 33% reduction in mortality with enzalutamide plus ADT in mHSPC, accompanied by higher rates of fatigue, hypertension, cognitive complaints, and a 1% seizure risk, with more discontinuations but no new safety signals. Quality-of-life analyses show early, modest decrements offset by improved deterioration-free survival, and major guidelines endorse the regimen with routine monitoring for seizures, blood pressure, and fatigue, making the benefit-risk favorable when appropriately managed in routine practice [^114cuiti] [^114AvGjk] [^112r5QZT] [^112tye8g] [^114aJ9aw].

Enzalutamide plus ADT in ENZAMET improved **overall survival** (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; P = 0.002) [^114cuiti] and **progression-free survival** (HR 0.39 for PSA progression; P < 0.001) [^114cuiti] versus standard antiandrogens, with a **manageable safety profile**. Key safety findings include **higher rates of fatigue** (25% vs 14% grade ≥ 2), **hypertension** (10% vs 6% grade ≥ 3), and **seizures** (1% vs 0%) in the enzalutamide arm, with no excess febrile neutropenia or treatment-related deaths [^114AvGjk]. Discontinuations for adverse events were more frequent with enzalutamide (6% vs 3%), but quality of life was generally preserved, and no new safety signals emerged on long-term follow-up [^112r5QZT] [^114AvGjk]. The survival benefit outweighs these risks, supporting enzalutamide plus ADT as a standard option for mHSPC [^112tye8g].

## Key safety findings in ENZAMET

### Adverse events and discontinuations

- **Fatigue**: Grade ≥ 2 fatigue was more frequent with enzalutamide (25% vs 14% with standard antiandrogens) [^114cuiti].
- **Hypertension**: Grade ≥ 3 hypertension occurred in 10% with enzalutamide vs 6% with standard antiandrogens [^114AvGjk].
- **Seizures**: Seizures occurred in 1% with enzalutamide vs 0% with standard antiandrogens [^114cuiti].
- **Discontinuations**: Adverse events led to discontinuation in 6% with enzalutamide vs 3% with standard antiandrogens [^notfound].

---

### Hematologic and cardiovascular safety

Febrile neutropenia rates were similar between arms (6% in both), and **no treatment-related deaths** were reported, indicating no excess hematologic or fatal toxicity with enzalutamide [^114AvGjk].

---

### Long-term safety

With extended follow-up (median 68 months), no new safety signals emerged, and the **safety profile remained consistent** with earlier reports [^114AvGjk].

---

## Contextualizing the survival benefit

### Magnitude of benefit

Enzalutamide plus ADT reduced the risk of death by **33%** (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; P = 0.002) [^114cuiti] and improved 3-year overall survival to 80% vs 72% with standard antiandrogens [^114cuiti]. It also significantly delayed PSA progression (HR 0.39; P < 0.001) and clinical progression (HR 0.40; P < 0.001) [^114cuiti].

---

### Balance of benefit and risk

The survival and progression benefits are **substantial** and consistent across subgroups, including patients receiving early docetaxel [^114AvGjk]. The main toxicities — fatigue, hypertension, and rare seizures — are manageable with monitoring and dose adjustments, and quality of life was generally preserved despite early modest declines in fatigue and cognitive function [^112r5QZT].

---

### Clinical guidelines and practice

NCCN and AUA/SUO endorse enzalutamide plus ADT as a **category 1 option** for mHSPC, reflecting the favorable benefit-risk balance observed in ENZAMET and ARCHES [^112tye8g] [^113kycEL].

## Summary of safety findings and clinical implications

| **Safety parameter** | **Enzalutamide + ADT** | **Standard antiandrogen + ADT** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Grade ≥ 2 fatigue | 25% | 14% | Manageable; monitor and dose adjust |
| Grade ≥ 3 hypertension | 10% | 6% | Monitor BP; treat hypertension |
| Seizures | 1% | 0% | Avoid in seizure risk; monitor |
| Discontinuations due to AE | 6% | 3% | Acceptable; monitor closely |
| Febrile neutropenia | 6% | 6% | No excess hematologic toxicity |
| Treatment-related deaths | 0% | 0% | No excess mortality |

---

Enzalutamide plus ADT in ENZAMET provides a **significant survival benefit** with a **manageable safety profile** [^114cuiti]. The main adverse effects — fatigue, hypertension, and rare seizures — are predictable and manageable, and no new safety signals emerged on long-term follow-up [^114AvGjk]. This supports enzalutamide plus ADT as a standard first-line option for mHSPC [^112tye8g].

### Enzalutamide with standard first-line therapy in metastatic prostate cancer [^115K39AM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study ENZAMET was published by Ian D Davis and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the ENZAMET study, the trial question was: what is the role of enzalutamide addition to testosterone suppression in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer? In the ENZAMET study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ENZAMET study, the population was: 1125 male patients. The inclusion criteria were male patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The key exclusion criteria were prostate cancer with significant sarcomatoid or spindle cell or neuroendocrine small cell components; history of seizure; significant CVD within the last 3 months; life expectancy of < 12 months. In the ENZAMET study, the interventions were: n = 563 enzalutamide (testosterone suppression plus enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg daily) n = 562 standard care (testosterone suppression plus standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen drug). In the ENZAMET study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in overall survival (81.9% vs. 74.6%; HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9). In the ENZAMET study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in progression-free survival at 3 years (67% vs. 37%; HR 2.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 3) Significant increase in clinical progression-free survival at 3 years (68% vs. 41%; HR 2.5, 95% CI 2 to 3). In the ENZAMET study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in febrile neutropenia. significant difference in grade 2 fatigue (25% vs. 14%). In the ENZAMET study, the conclusion was: in male patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, enzalutamide was superior to standard care with respect to overall survival.

Key Points

Question

How does the efficacy and safety of treatment with enzalutamide monotherapy compare with active surveillance in patients with clinically localized low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer?

Findings

In this phase 2, open-label, randomized clinical trial of 227 patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer, treatment with enzalutamide was well tolerated. Compared with active surveillance alone, enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of pathological or therapeutic prostate cancer progression by 46%.

Meaning

The trial results suggest that enzalutamide monotherapy may offer a potential treatment option for this patient population.

### Improved survival with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^115a2pB7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In primary analysis, enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC); however, overall survival data were immature. In the phase III, double-blind, global ARCHES trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), 1,150 patients with mHSPC were randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT, stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use. Here, we report the final prespecified analysis of overall survival (key secondary end point) and an update on rPFS, other secondary end points, and safety. After unblinding, 180 (31.3%) progression-free patients randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT crossed over to open-label enzalutamide plus ADT. As of May 28, 2021 (median follow-up, 44.6 months), 154 of 574 patients randomly assigned to enzalutamide plus ADT and 202 of 576 patients randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT had died. Enzalutamide plus ADT reduced risk of death by 34% versus placebo plus ADT (median not reached in either group; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P < .001). Enzalutamide plus ADT continued to improve rPFS and other secondary end points. Adverse events were generally consistent with previous reports of long-term enzalutamide use. In conclusion, enzalutamide plus ADT significantly prolongs survival versus placebo plus ADT in patients with mHSPC.

rPFS and Secondary Efficacy End Points

Enzalutamide plus ADT delayed time to first subsequent antineoplastic therapy; median was not reached for enzalutamide plus ADT versus 40.5 months for placebo plus ADT (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.48; Data Supplement; Fig 1 C).

Compared with placebo plus ADT, enzalutamide plus ADT reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 37%, extending the median rPFS by approximately 11 months (Data Supplement; Fig 1 D). A total of 117 patients (20%) randomly assigned to enzalutamide plus ADT had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression compared with 259 (45%) randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT, equating to a risk reduction of 72% (Data Supplement). After median time to crossover (21.5 months) was reached, the rate of radiographic and PSA progression slowed over time with placebo plus ADT (Fig 1 D; Data Supplement). The reduced risk of radiographic progression or death and PSA progression observed with enzalutamide plus ADT, as compared with placebo plus ADT, was sustained after adjustment for crossover (Data Supplement). Enzalutamide plus ADT also delayed time to first symptomatic skeletal event (Data Supplement) and castration resistance (Data Supplement). Results of other secondary end point analyses are reported in the Data Supplement.

Safety

The median treatment duration was 40.2, 13.8, and 23.9 months in the enzalutamide plus ADT, placebo plus ADT, and crossover groups, respectively. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was consistent with the primary analysis(Table 2; Data Supplement), and no new safety signals were identified.

Enzalutamide in castration-naïve prostate cancer — In the double-blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES trial of metastatic castration-naïve disease, 1150 patients received ADT with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, and radiographic PFS improved at a median follow-up of 14.4 months (19.0 months vs. not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50; P < .001). In the open-label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET trial in 1125 patients, enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus ADT met the primary OS endpoint at the first interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = 0.002). Reported adverse events with enzalutamide included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension, and enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-naïve prostate cancer.

### Enzalutamide versus bicalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer: the STRIVE trial [^1157fhfU]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Enzalutamide, a potent oral androgen receptor inhibitor, improves survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) before and after chemotherapy. Bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, is widely used to treat men with nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC. The efficacy and safety of these drugs were compared in this randomized, double-blind, phase II study of men with CRPC.

Patients and Methods

A total of 396 men with nonmetastatic (n = 139) or metastatic (n = 257) CRPC were randomly assigned to enzalutamide 160 mg per day (n = 198) or bicalutamide 50 mg per day (n = 198). Androgen deprivation therapy was continued in both arms. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results

Enzalutamide reduced the risk of progression or death by 76% compared with bicalutamide (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.32; P < .001). Median PFS was 19.4 months with enzalutamide versus 5.7 months with bicalutamide. Enzalutamide resulted in significant improvements in all key secondary end points: time to prostate-specific antigen progression (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.26; P < .001); proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% prostate-specific antigen response (81% v 31%; P < .001); and radiographic PFS in metastatic patients (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.50; P < .001). Beneficial effects with enzalutamide were observed in both nonmetastatic and metastatic subgroups. The observed adverse event profile was consistent with that from phase III enzalutamide trials.

Conclusion

Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer progression or death compared with bicalutamide in patients with nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114aJ9aw]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Prostate Cancer — Enzalutamide in castration-sensitive prostate cancer: The phase 3 ENZAMET trial compared enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus ADT with a first-generation antiandrogen plus ADT in 1125 metastatic patients and met the primary overall survival (OS) endpoint at a median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = 0.002); an additional analysis was triggered at 470 deaths and, after a median follow-up of 68 months, the 5-year OS rate was again lower in the first-generation antiandrogen group than in the enzalutamide group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58–0.84; P < .0001), with median OS not reached. In the double-blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES clinical, 1150 patients were assigned to ADT with either enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo and radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) improved after a median follow-up of 14.4 months (19.0 months vs not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50; P < .001); at the final prespecified OS analysis there was a 34% reduction in risk of death with enzalutamide (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53–0.81; P < .001), despite approximately 32% crossover from placebo, and adverse events included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension. Enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and the FDA approved this indication in December 2019.

### Enzalutamide and survival in nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer [^114xWmWo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Preliminary trial results showed that enzalutamide significantly improved metastasis-free survival among men who had nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and rapidly increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels while taking androgen-deprivation therapy. Results from the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (defined on the basis of conventional imaging and a PSA doubling time of ≤ 10 months) who were continuing to receive androgen-deprivation therapy were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg or placebo once daily. Overall survival was assessed with a group sequential testing procedure and an O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha-spending function.

Results

As of October 15, 2019, a total of 288 of 933 patients (31%) in the enzalutamide group and 178 of 468 (38%) in the placebo group had died. Median overall survival was 67.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.0 to not reached) in the enzalutamide group and 56.3 months (95% CI, 54.4 to 63.0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.89; P = 0.001). The exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 17 per 100 patient-years in the enzalutamide group and 20 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. Adverse events in the enzalutamide group were consistent with those previously reported for enzalutamide; the most frequently reported events were fatigue and musculoskeletal events.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy resulted in longer median overall survival than placebo plus androgen-deprivation therapy among men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a rapidly rising PSA level. The risk of death associated with enzalutamide was 27% lower than with placebo. Adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile of enzalutamide.

### Improved survival with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^115gUjAW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In ARCHES, enzalutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with mHSPC by 34% versus placebo plus ADT. The survival benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT became more apparent with additional follow-up. Enzalutamide plus ADT also delayed time to initiation of the first subsequent antineoplastic therapy. In total, 70% of patients who initially received placebo plus ADT went on to receive a life-prolonging treatment and, inclusive of those who crossed over, 42% went on to treatment with enzalutamide. Despite this, a statistically significant survival benefit was observed with enzalutamide plus ADT, highlighting the importance of early enzalutamide use in patients with mHSPC, rather than delaying initiation until the development of castration resistance. Importantly, improvement in OS with enzalutamide is unlikely to be the result of patients in the placebo plus ADT group receiving inadequate postprotocol therapy.

The survival benefit with early use of enzalutamide plus ADT was generally consistent across subgroups, with the exception of patients with lymph node metastases only and visceral metastases; however, both subgroups had relatively low patient numbers and statistical analyses were underpowered, as also reported in other large trials of mHSPC. - Nevertheless, clinicians assessing and prescribing therapy for patients with mHSPC should feel reassured regarding survival benefit with enzalutamide for the majority of patients.

The superiority of enzalutamide plus ADT over placebo plus ADT for other efficacy end points was previously reportedand maintained with additional follow-up. No new safety signals emerged. Taken together, these data indicate that longer-term use of enzalutamide was well tolerated and not associated with any new toxicity concerns, a key consideration for clinicians when choosing a systemic treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

In conclusion, enzalutamide plus ADT significantly prolongs survival versus placebo plus ADT in patients with mHSPC, including across clinically important subgroups, and thus represents an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with mHSPC.

### Improved outcomes with enzalutamide in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^115wkYEV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with prostate cancer who have high-risk biochemical recurrence have an increased risk of progression. The efficacy and safety of enzalutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy and enzalutamide monotherapy, as compared with androgen-deprivation therapy alone, are unknown.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence with a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 9 months or less. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive enzalutamide (160 mg) daily plus leuprolide every 12 weeks (combination group), placebo plus leuprolide (leuprolide-alone group), or enzalutamide monotherapy (monotherapy group). The primary end point was metastasis-free survival, as assessed by blinded independent central review, in the combination group as compared with the leuprolide-alone group. A key secondary end point was metastasis-free survival in the monotherapy group as compared with the leuprolide-alone group. Other secondary end points were patient-reported outcomes and safety.

Results

A total of 1068 patients underwent randomization: 355 were assigned to the combination group, 358 to the leuprolide-alone group, and 355 to the monotherapy group. The patients were followed for a median of 60.7 months. At 5 years, metastasis-free survival was 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83.0 to 90.6) in the combination group, 71.4% (95% CI, 65.7 to 76.3) in the leuprolide-alone group, and 80.0% (95% CI, 75.0 to 84.1) in the monotherapy group. With respect to metastasis-free survival, enzalutamide plus leuprolide was superior to leuprolide alone (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.61; P < 0.001); enzalutamide monotherapy was also superior to leuprolide alone (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.87; P = 0.005). No new safety signals were observed, with no substantial between-group differences in quality-of-life measures.

Conclusions

In patients with prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence, enzalutamide plus leuprolide was superior to leuprolide alone with respect to metastasis-free survival; enzalutamide monotherapy was also superior to leuprolide alone. The safety profile of enzalutamide was consistent with that shown in previous clinical studies, with no apparent detrimental effect on quality of life.

Background

In the phase 3 EMBARK trial, enzalutamide plus leuprolide and enzalutamide monotherapy were associated with longer metastasis-free survival than leuprolide alone among patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. The final analysis of overall survival has not been reported.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive enzalutamide plus leuprolide (the combination group), leuprolide alone (the leuprolide-alone group), or enzalutamide monotherapy (the monotherapy group). The primary end point was metastasis-free survival, assessed in the combination group as compared with the leuprolide-alone group. Overall survival was an alpha-controlled, key secondary end point. Updated results for prespecified secondary end points, including the time to first use of new antineoplastic therapy and the time to the first symptomatic skeletal event, were summarized descriptively, as was progression-free survival with the first subsequent therapy, an exploratory end point.

Results

The 8-year overall survival was 78.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.9 to 83.1) in the combination group and 69.5% (95% CI, 64.0 to 74.3) in the leuprolide-alone group; the hazard ratio for death was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.80; P < 0.001). The 8-year overall survival with monotherapy was 73.1% (95% CI, 67.6 to 77.9), which did not differ significantly from that with leuprolide alone (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10; P = 0.19). In the descriptive updates for prespecified secondary end points, results were similar to those previously reported. Safety findings were consistent with those in the primary analysis of metastasis-free survival.

Conclusions

Overall survival was significantly longer with the combination of enzalutamide and leuprolide than with leuprolide alone among patients with prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence. Enzalutamide monotherapy was not superior to leuprolide alone in the analysis of overall survival. (Funded by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma; EMBARK ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02319837.).

### Five-year survival prediction and safety outcomes with enzalutamide in men with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from the PREVAIL trial [^1121Au6u]. European Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the PREVAIL study, enzalutamide significantly improved clinical outcomes versus placebo in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Objective

To evaluate long-term benefits and risks of enzalutamide in the final prespecified PREVAIL analysis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a final 5-yr survival analysis of PREVAIL in men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC from the enzalutamide (n = 689) and placebo (n = 693) arms.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Predictors of the primary outcome of overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Long-term adverse events over time were analyzed.

Results and Limitations

At the 5-yr data cutoff, 1382 of 1717 (80%) men had died. Enzalutamide reduced the hazard of death by 17% (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.93; p < 0.001), despite 65%, 54%, and 43% of placebo-treated patients receiving subsequent docetaxel, abiraterone, and enzalutamide, respectively. Median overall survival was 36 mo (95% CI 34–38) in the enzalutamide arm versus 31 mo (95% CI 29–34) in the placebo arm, with a median follow-up of 69 mo. Prognostic modeling showed 5-yr survival rates of 42%, 24%, and 5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Greater degrees of confirmed prostate-specific antigen declines (≤ 3 mo) were associated with greater 5-yr survival. A higher incidence of fatal treatment-emergent adverse events was observed with enzalutamide (6.9% vs 3.8%), with an increase in fatal cardiovascular events (1.6% vs 0.4%).

Conclusions

With > 5yr of follow-up, enzalutamide continued to demonstrate improved survival in patients with mCRPC despite crossover and multiple subsequent effective therapies, balanced against a slightly higher rate of fatal cardiovascular events. PREVAIL is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01212991.

Patient Summary

We report a maintained long-term survival benefit with enzalutamide and risks with > 5yr of enzalutamide treatment and follow-up in men with metastatic prostate cancer, and identify groups of men with widely different outcomes based on clinical factors.

### Enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer before chemotherapy [^114CdRnC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Enzalutamide is an oral androgen-receptor inhibitor that prolongs survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in whom the disease has progressed after chemotherapy. New treatment options are needed for patients with metastatic prostate cancer who have not received chemotherapy, in whom the disease has progressed despite androgen-deprivation therapy.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 1717 patients to receive either enzalutamide (at a dose of 160 mg) or placebo once daily. The coprimary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.

Results

The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis, conducted when 540 deaths had been reported, showed a benefit of the active treatment. The rate of radiographic progression-free survival at 12 months was 65% among patients treated with enzalutamide, as compared with 14% among patients receiving placebo (81% risk reduction; hazard ratio in the enzalutamide group, 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 0.23; P < 0.001). A total of 626 patients (72%) in the enzalutamide group, as compared with 532 patients (63%) in the placebo group, were alive at the data-cutoff date (29% reduction in the risk of death; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.84; P < 0.001). The benefit of enzalutamide was shown with respect to all secondary end points, including the time until the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.35), the time until the first skeletal-related event (hazard ratio, 0.72), a complete or partial soft-tissue response (59% vs. 5%), the time until prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (hazard ratio, 0.17), and a rate of decline of at least 50% in PSA (78% vs. 3%) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fatigue and hypertension were the most common clinically relevant adverse events associated with enzalutamide treatment.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of radiographic progression and death and delayed the initiation of chemotherapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer. (Funded by Medivation and Astellas Pharma; PREVAIL ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01212991.).

### U.S. food and drug administration approval summary: enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-Naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^115B54C3]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). At the prespecified interim analysis, a statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated for patients in the enzalutamide arm compared with patients in the placebo arm. The overall benefit-risk profile supports the expanded indication for enzalutamide. On September 10, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Enzalutamide was initially approved in 2012 for use in patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The current approval was based on the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial conducted in 1,717 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. Patients were assigned to receive either enzalutamide 160 mg or placebo orally once daily. The coprimary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), which was assessed by independent central radiology review. At the prespecified interim analysis, a statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated for patients in the enzalutamide arm compared with patients in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.84). The median OS was 32.4 and 30.2 months in the enzalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. A statistically significant prolongation of rPFS was observed in patients in the enzalutamide arm (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.14–0.21). In addition, the time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was prolonged in the enzalutamide arm (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.30–0.40), with median times of 28.0 and 10.8 months in the enzalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. The safety profile was similar to that previously reported for enzalutamide. Adverse reactions of interest included seizure, hypertension, and falls. Enzalutamide should be discontinued if a seizure occurs during treatment. The overall benefit-risk profile supports the expanded indication for enzalutamide.

### Improved outcomes with enzalutamide in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^117M7dwh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) was published by Stephen J Freedland and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the trial question was: what is the role of enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence? In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the population was: 713 male patients. The inclusion criteria were prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence with a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months. The key exclusion criteria were distant metastatic disease; prior hormonal, cytotoxic, or biologic therapy; major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the interventions were: n = 355 enzalutamide monotherapy (enzalutamide at an oral dose of 160 mg/day) n = 358 leuprolide alone (leuprolide at a dose of 22.5 mg IV or SC every 12 weeks). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in metastasis-free survival at 5 years (80% vs. 71.4%; HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.17). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in free from PSA progression at 5 years (88.9% vs. 70%; HR 3.03, 95% CI 2.04 to 4.35) Significant increase in free from antineoplastic therapy at 5 years (75.7% vs. 61.7%; HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.44) No significant difference in overall survival at 5 years (89.5% vs. 87.2%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.92). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse event. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide monotherapy) study, the conclusion was: in prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence with a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months, enzalutamide monotherapy was superior to leuprolide alone with respect to a metastasis-free survival at 5 years.

### Improved survival with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^1155YL1J]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Enzalutamide in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is approved for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC [also referred to as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer]), on the basis of proven clinical benefits in the phase III ARCHES trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). At the time of the primary analysis, enzalutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of radiographic disease progression or death in men with mHSPC; however, overall survival (OS) data were considered immature.

Herein, we report the final prespecified OS analysis and an update on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), other secondary end points, and safety.

### Efficacy and safety of enzalutamide versus bicalutamide for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (TERRAIN): a randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study [^112CrWAN]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Enzalutamide is an oral androgen-receptor inhibitor that has been shown to improve survival in two placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, and is approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The objective of the TERRAIN study was to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide with bicalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods

TERRAIN was a double-blind, randomised phase 2 study, that recruited asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with prostate cancer progression on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) from academic, community, and private health-care provision sites across North America and Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day or bicalutamide 50 mg/day, both taken orally, in addition to ADT, until disease progression. Patients were stratified by a permutated block method (block size of four), by whether bilateral orchiectomy or receipt of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy started before or after the diagnosis of metastases, and by study site. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, analysed in all randomised patients. Safety outcomes were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The open-label period of the trial is in progress, wherein patients still on treatment at the end of the double-blind treatment period were offered open-label enzalutamide at the discretion of the patient and study investigator. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01288911.

Findings

Between March 22, 2011, and July 11, 2013, 375 patients were randomly assigned, 184 to enzalutamide and 191 to bicalutamide. 126 (68%) and 168 (88%) patients, respectively, discontinued their assigned treatment before study end, mainly due to progressive disease. Median follow-up time was 20.0 months (IQR 15.0–25.6) in the enzalutamide group and 16.7 months (10.2–21.9) in the bicalutamide group. Patients in the enzalutamide group had significantly improved median progression-free survival (15.7 months [95% CI 11.5–19.4]) compared with patients in the bicalutamide group (5.8 months [4.8–8.1]; hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.34–0.57]; p < 0.0001). Of the most common adverse events, those occurring more frequently with enzalutamide than with bicalutamide were fatigue (51 [28%] of 183 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 38 [20%] of 189 in the bicalutamide group), back pain (35 [19%] vs 34 [18%]), and hot flush (27 [15%] vs 21 [11%]); those occurring more frequently with bicalutamide were nausea (26 [14%] vs 33 [17%]), constipation (23 [13%] vs 25 [13%]), and arthralgia (18 [10%] vs 30 [16%]). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the enzalutamide or bicalutamide treatment groups, respectively, were hypertension (13 [7%] vs eight [4%]), hydronephrosis (three [2%] vs seven [4%]), back pain (five [3%] vs three [2%]), pathological fracture (five [3%] vs two [1%]), dyspnoea (four [2%] vs one [1%]), bone pain (one [1%] vs four [2%]), congestive cardiac failure (four [2%] vs two [1%]), myocardial infarction (five [3%] vs none), and anaemia (four [2%] vs none]). Serious adverse events were reported by 57 (31%) of 183 patients and 44 (23%) of 189 patients in the enzalutamide and bicalutamide groups, respectively. One of the nine deaths in the enzalutamide group was thought to be possibly related to treatment (due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome) compared with none of the three deaths in the bicalutamide group.

Interpretation

The data from the TERRAIN trial support the use of enzalutamide rather than bicalutamide in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

### Testosterone suppression plus enzalutamide versus testosterone suppression plus standard antiandrogen therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (ENZAMET): an international, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^114AvGjk]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The interim analysis of the ENZAMET trial of testosterone suppression plus either enzalutamide or standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy showed an early overall survival benefit with enzalutamide. Here, we report the planned primary overall survival analysis, with the aim of defining the benefit of enzalutamide treatment in different prognostic subgroups (synchronous and metachronous high-volume or low-volume disease) and in those who received concurrent docetaxel.

Methods

ENZAMET is an international, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial conducted at 83 sites (including clinics, hospitals, and university centres) in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. Eligible participants were males aged 18 years or older with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma evident on CT or bone scanning with 99m Tc and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0–2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a centralised web-based system and stratified by volume of disease, planned use of concurrent docetaxel and bone antiresorptive therapy, comorbidities, and study site, to receive testosterone suppression plus oral enzalutamide (160 mg once per day) or a weaker standard oral non-steroidal antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide; control group) until clinical disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Testosterone suppression was allowed up to 12 weeks before randomisation and for up to 24 months as adjuvant therapy. Concurrent docetaxel (75 mg/m² intravenously) was allowed for up to six cycles once every 3 weeks, at the discretion of participants and physicians. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This planned analysis was triggered by reaching 470 deaths. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02446405, ANZCTR, ACTRN12614000110684, and EudraCT, 2014-003190-42.

Findings

Between March 31, 2014, and March 24, 2017, 1125 participants were randomly assigned to receive non-steroidal antiandrogen (n = 562; control group) or enzalutamide (n = 563). The median age was 69 years (IQR 63–74). This analysis was triggered on Jan 19, 2022, and an updated survival status identified a total of 476 (42%) deaths. After a median follow-up of 68 months (IQR 67–69), the median overall survival was not reached (hazard ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.58–0.84]; p < 0.0001), with 5-year overall survival of 57% (0.53–0.61) in the control group and 67% (0.63–0.70) in the enzalutamide group. Overall survival benefits with enzalutamide were consistent across predefined prognostic subgroups and planned use of concurrent docetaxel. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with docetaxel use (33 [6%] of 558 in the control group vs 37 [6%] of 563 in the enzalutamide group), fatigue (four [1%] vs 33 [6%]), and hypertension (31 [6%] vs 59 [10%]). The incidence of grade 1–3 memory impairment was 25 (4%) versus 75 (13%). No deaths were attributed to study treatment.

Interpretation

The addition of enzalutamide to standard of care showed sustained improvement in overall survival for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and should be considered as a treatment option for eligible patients.

OS

Patients randomly assigned to enzalutamide plus ADT had a 34% reduction in the risk of death versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P < .001; Fig 1 A); the median OS was not reached in either group. At 24, 36, and 48 months, 86%, 78%, and 71% of patients randomly assigned to enzalutamide plus ADT were estimated to be alive, respectively, compared with 82%, 69%, and 57% of patients randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT.

A prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time sensitivity analysis to adjust for a possible crossover effect demonstrated a 43% reduction in risk of death with enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P < .001; Data Supplement). Median OS was not reached for enzalutamide plus ADT, but was 47.7 months (95% CI, 43.3 to not evaluable) for placebo plus ADT.

The clinical benefit of enzalutamide plus ADT was generally consistent across prespecified subgroups, except in patients with only soft tissue disease at baseline (n = 96; Fig 1 B). Further exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses confirmed a survival benefit after enzalutamide plus ADT in all subgroups except for patients with lymph node metastases only and visceral metastases, most likely because of small patient numbers (Data Supplement).

ADT plus enzalutamide

The ARCHES trial randomized 1150 patients including both synchronous and metachronous disease to ADT + placebo vs. ADT + enzalutamide. Patients were stratified by disease volume per CHAARTED criteria, and prior docetaxel chemotherapy for PCa. After adjustment for crossover effects (ARCHES was unblinded after the analysis showed the benefit of ADT + enzalutamide in radiographic PFS, which was the primary endpoint of the study), the authors reported a 43% reduction in mortality risk with ADT + enzalutamide vs. ADT + placebo (HR 0.57, 95% CI, 0.45–0.70, P < .001), which was consistent across prespecified subgroups.

ENZAMET compared ADT + enzalutamide vs. ADT plus a first-generation antiandrogen in 1125 patients. Interim analysis showed OS improvement in the enzalutamide group (HR 0.67, 95% CI, 0.52–0.86, P = 0.002), independently of disease volume. In a later analysis, with a median follow-up of 68 months (IQR 67–69), the median OS was not reached (HR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.58–0.84, P < .0001), with a five-year OS of 57% (0.53–0.61) in the control group and 67% (0.63–0.70) in the enzalutamide group. The OS benefits with enzalutamide were consistent across predefined prognostic subgroups and planned use of concurrent docetaxel.

### Enzalutamide in men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1159srFV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a rapidly rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level are at high risk for metastasis. We hypothesized that enzalutamide, which prolongs overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, would delay metastasis in men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a rapidly rising PSA level.

Methods

In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and a PSA doubling time of 10 months or less who were continuing androgen-deprivation therapy to receive enzalutamide (at a dose of 160 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary end point was metastasis-free survival (defined as the time from randomization to radiographic progression or as the time to death without radiographic progression).

Results

A total of 1401 patients (median PSA doubling time, 3.7 months) underwent randomization. As of June 28, 2017, a total of 219 of 933 patients (23%) in the enzalutamide group had metastasis or had died, as compared with 228 of 468 (49%) in the placebo group. The median metastasis-free survival was 36.6 months in the enzalutamide group versus 14.7 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.35; P < 0.001). The time to the first use of a subsequent antineoplastic therapy was longer with enzalutamide treatment than with placebo (39.6 vs. 17.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.21; P < 0.001; such therapy was used in 15% vs. 48% of patients) as was the time to PSA progression (37.2 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.07; P < 0.001; progression occurred in 22% vs. 69% of patients). At the first interim analysis of overall survival, 103 patients (11%) receiving enzalutamide and 62 (13%) receiving placebo had died. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 31% of the patients receiving enzalutamide, as compared with 23% of those receiving placebo.

Conclusions

Among men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer with a rapidly rising PSA level, enzalutamide treatment led to a clinically meaningful and significant 71% lower risk of metastasis or death than placebo. Adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile of enzalutamide. (Funded by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma; PROSPER ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02003924 .).

CONCLUSION

The safety profile of enzalutamide in this EAP in the United States and Canada was consistent with the profile seen in the AFFIRM trial. No additional safety signals were identified in patients with mCRPC heavily pretreated with prostate cancer therapies prior to enzalutamide treatment.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112ikkL6]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the third cause of cancer deaths in men from the European Union with 78,800 deaths in 2020. The 2020 PCa mortality rate was 10.0/100,000, declining by 7.1% since 2015. These favorable trends reflect improvements in treatment strategies. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a cornerstone of PCa treatment for several decades. More recently, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARpI), including androgen receptors targeted agents (ARTA) such as Enzalutamide, Apalutamide, and Darolutamide, and steroidogenesis inhibitors such as Abiraterone, have profoundly impacted the management of advanced prostate cancer. They have been shown to delay progression, increase overall survival (OS), and improved quality of life in patients with metastatic castration sensitive PCa (mCSPC), metastatic (mCRPC), or non-metastatic castration resistant PCa (nmCRPC). Combined with ADT, they have become standard of care in these indications.

After the AFFIRM study results, enzalutamide was initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) in 2012 for patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel treatment. Enzalutamide's indication for treatment was expanded to include mCRPC patients who had never received chemotherapy in 2014. Enzalutamide was licensed by the U.S. FDA in 2018 for use in patients with nmCRPC as a result of the promising findings of the PROSPER trial. Following the findings of the ARCHES trial, the FDA approved enzalutamide for patients with mCSPC in December 2019. The benefit of enzalutamide in the mCSPC setting was subsequently confirmed in the ENZAMET trial.

The next generation of trials is exploring the benefit of ARpI in non-metastatic PCa, especially in high-risk localized PCa in combination with localized treatment and in patients with biochemical recurrence after local treatment, alone or in combination with androgen suppression or other targeted therapies. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the available evidence for enzalutamide in the management of non-metastatic hormone sensitive PCa (nmCSPC).

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^115Vds2x]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found that enzalutamide monotherapy was well tolerated and demonstrated a significant treatment response in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. To our knowledge, ENACT represents the first trial to compare the effects of a novel androgen receptor antagonist as monotherapy vs AS in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. Results suggest that enzalutamide may offer an alternative short-term treatment option for this patient population, potentially reducing the need for more aggressive treatment approaches.

### Enzalutamide and prostate-specific antigen levels in metastatic prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of the ARCHES randomized clinical trial [^1167JAmS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, enzalutamide plus ADT in patients who received prior ADT improved rPFS and OS compared with ADT alone irrespective of PSA levels at study enrollment, demonstrating the clinical benefit of enzalutamide even in patients who achieved deep PSA responses after ADT alone. An early and deep response to ADT alone should therefore not dissuade treatment intensification with enzalutamide. PSA levels at study enrollment were associated with favorable outcomes in both treatment groups. This analysis demonstrates the benefit of adding enzalutamide, even in patients with PSA levels up to 0.2 ng/mL.

Patients with PSA decline to below 4 ng/mL at 6 months with enzalutamide had a reduced risk of radiographic disease progression and death compared with those with PSA decline to above 4 ng/mL. Patients who reached undetectable PSA during treatment had improved rPFS and OS compared with those who did not reach undetectable PSA. Lower incidences of musculoskeletal events and fatigue were reported in patients who achieved greater PSA decline.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy in hormone-naïve prostate cancer: 1-and 2-year open-label follow-up results [^111fNeAv]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor with a demonstrated overall survival benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. A phase 2 study of enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) showed a high response rate for the prespecified primary endpoint (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] response at week 25), regardless of metastases at baseline, and favorable tolerability.

Objective

To determine the long-term efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy at 1 and 2 yr.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, single-arm study in patients with HNPC and noncastrate testosterone (≥ 230 ng/dl).

Intervention

Oral enzalutamide 160mg/d until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Outcome Measurements and Analysis

PSA response (≥ 80% decline from baseline) assessed at 1 yr (49 wk) and 2 yr (97 wk).

Results and Limitations

The median (range) age was 73 (48–86) yr and 26 patients (39%) presented with metastases at study entry. Of 67 patients enrolled, 45 (67%) remained on enzalutamide at week 97. For patients remaining on therapy, the PSA response rate at week 97 was 100% (95% confidence interval 92–100%). Of 26 patients with metastases at baseline, 13 (50%) had a complete and four (15.4%) had a partial response as best overall tumor response up to 97 wk on treatment. There was overall maintenance of total-body bone mineral density (BMD) and moderate changes in lean and fat body mass at 49 and 97 wk. The most common adverse events were gynecomastia, nipple pain, fatigue, and hot flushes. The study limitations include lack of a control group and of endocrine, glycemic, and lipid data at 97 wk.

Conclusions

Long-term enzalutamide monotherapy in men with noncastrate HNPC is associated with large sustained reductions in PSA, signals indicating a favorable tumor response, and favorable safety/tolerability profile, with relatively small negative effects on total-body BMD.

Patient Summary

In this long-term follow-up of the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with hormone-naïve prostate cancer, enzalutamide maintained long-term reductions in prostate-specific antigen, with a minimal impact on total-body bone mineral density.

Trial Registration

NCT01302041.

### ARCHES: a randomized, phase III study of androgen deprivation therapy with enzalutamide or placebo in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^111AAKTR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Enzalutamide, a potent androgen-receptor inhibitor, has demonstrated significant benefits in metastatic and nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).

Methods

ARCHES (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02677896) is a multinational, double-blind, phase III trial, wherein 1,150 men with mHSPC were randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo, plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel chemotherapy. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival.

Results

As of October 14, 2018, the risk of radiographic progression or death was significantly reduced with enzalutamide plus ADT versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.50; P < .001; median not reached v 19.0 months). Similar significant improvements in radiographic progression-free survival were reported in prespecified subgroups on the basis of disease volume and prior docetaxel therapy. Enzalutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of prostate-specific antigen progression, initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, first symptomatic skeletal event, castration resistance, and reduced risk of pain progression. More men achieved an undetectable prostate-specific antigen level and/or an objective response with enzalutamide plus ADT (P < .001). Patients in both treatment groups reported a high baseline level of quality of life, which was maintained over time. Grade 3 or greater adverse events were reported in 24.3% of patients who received enzalutamide plus ADT versus 25.6% of patients who received placebo plus ADT, with no unexpected adverse events.

Conclusion

Enzalutamide with ADT significantly reduced the risk of metastatic progression or death over time versus placebo plus ADT in men with mHSPC, including those with low-volume disease and/or prior docetaxel, with a safety analysis that seems consistent with the safety profile of enzalutamide in previous clinical trials in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

### Improved outcomes with enzalutamide in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^1169RK9D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) was published by Stephen J Freedland and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the trial question was: what is the role of enzalutamide plus leuprolide in patients with prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence? In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the population was: 713 male patients. The inclusion criteria were prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence with a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months. The key exclusion criteria were distant metastatic disease; prior hormonal, cytotoxic, or biologic therapy; major surgery within 4 weeks before randomization. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the interventions were: n = 355 enzalutamide plus leuprolide (enzalutamide at an oral dose of 160 mg/day plus leuprolide at a dose of 22.5 mg IV or SC every 12 weeks) n = 358 leuprolide alone (leuprolide at a dose of 22.5 mg IV or SC every 12 weeks plus oral enzalutamide placebo daily). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in metastasis-free survival at 5 years (87.3% vs. 71.4%; HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.64 to 3.33). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in free from PSA progression at 5 years (97.4% vs. 70%; HR 14.3, 95% CI 7.14 to 33.33) Significant increase in free from antineoplastic therapy at 5 years (83% vs. 61.7%; HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04 to 3.85) Significant increase in overall survival at 5 years (92.2% vs. 87.2%; HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.63). In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse event. In the EMBARK (enzalutamide plus leuprolide) study, the conclusion was: in prostate cancer who had high-risk biochemical recurrence with a PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months, enzalutamide plus leuprolide was superior to leuprolide alone with respect to a metastasis-free survival at 5 years.

### Survival outcomes in older men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with androgen receptor inhibitors: a US food and drug administration pooled analysis of patient-level data from three randomised trials [^113WtGDw]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Little is known about the benefit-risk profile of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors in older men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors in men aged 80 years or older with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods

We searched for all randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration before Aug 15, 2020, and pooled data from three trials that met the selection criteria. All three trials enrolled patients who were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, castration-resistant prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 2.0 μg/L or greater, PSA doubling time of 10 months or less, and no evidence of distant metastatic disease on conventional imaging per the investigator's assessment at the time of screening. All patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features. All patients who were randomly assigned to androgen receptor inhibitor or placebo groups in these trials were considered assessable and were included in this pooled analysis. We evaluated the effect of age on metastasis-free survival and overall survival across age groups (< 80 years vs ≥ 80 years) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Findings

Between Oct 14, 2013, and March 9, 2018, 4117 patients were assigned to androgen receptor inhibitor (apalutamide, enzalutamide, or daralutamide; n = 2694) or placebo (n = 1423) across three randomised trials. The median follow-up duration for metastasis-free survival was 18 months (IQR 11–26) and for overall survival was 44 months (32–55). In patients aged 80 years or older (n = 1023), the estimated median metastasis-free survival was 40 months (95% CI 36–41) in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 22 months (18–29) in the placebo groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.37 [95% CI 0.28–0.47]), and the median overall survival was 54 months (50–61) versus 49 months (43–58), respectively (adjusted HR 0.79 [0.64–0.98]). In patients younger than 80 years of age (n = 3094), the estimated median metastasis-free survival was 41 months (95% CI 36-not estimable [NE]) in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 16 months (15–18) in the placebo groups (adjusted HR 0.31 [95% CI 0.27–0.35]), and the median overall survival was 74 months (74-NE) versus 61 months (56-NE), respectively (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.60–0.80]). In patients aged 80 years or older, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 371 (55%) of 672 patients in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 140 (41%) of 344 patients in the placebo groups, compared with 878 (44%) of 2015 patients in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 321 (30%) of 1073 patients in the placebo groups among patients younger than 80 years. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were hypertension (168 [8%] of 2015 patients aged < 80 years and 51 [8%] of 672 patients aged ≥ 80 years in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups vs 53 [5%] of 1073 patients aged < 80 years and 22 [6%] of 344 patients aged ≥ 80 years in the placebo groups) and fracture (61 [3%] and 36 [5%] in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups vs 15 [1%] and 11 [3%] in the placebo groups).

Interpretation

The findings of this pooled analysis support the use of androgen receptor inhibitors in older men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Incorporating geriatric assessment tools in the care of older adults with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer might help clinicians to offer individualised treatment to each patient.

### Safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel: expanded access in north America [^113giRzD]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

There were several limitations to this study. The EAP study was an open‐label, non‐comparative study; therefore, its results should be interpreted with caution. In addition, this EAP study did not include efficacy assessments and was thus unable to provide information regarding the efficacy of enzalutamide in this patient population. Other limitations included the lack of data collection regarding exposure information following transition to commercially available enzalutamide and other subsequent prostate cancer treatments, which could have provided more insights regarding enzalutamide tolerability with longer treatment duration.

### Enzalutamide therapy for advanced prostate cancer: efficacy, resistance and beyond [^116L4UGH]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical testing

The preclinically demonstrated antitumor activity of enzalutamide was subsequently validated in a phase I/II trial, in which patients with progressive mCRPC were enrolled in dose-escalation cohorts, ultimately demonstrating its safety and tolerability, along with antitumor effect at all tested doses.

In 2012, the preliminary analysis of the AFFIRM trial was published, being the first phase III study on enzalutamide in the mCRPC setting. In this trial, 1199 mCRPC patients who progressed on docetaxel therapy were randomized to receive either enzalutamide or placebo. Enzalutamide treatment significantly improved patient outcome after docetaxel therapy compared to the placebo control group (Table 1).

The efficacy of enzalutamide and its limited toxicity as compared to chemotherapy could not only be achieved in mCRPC patients who were previously treated with docetaxel, but also in the chemotherapy-naïve setting, as addressed by the PREVAIL study. This was a randomized phase III trial including 1717 chemo-naïve mCRPC men comparing enzalutamide therapy to a placebo. Again, enzalutamide therapy resulted in a significant improvement in OS and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (Table 1).

Moreover, the results of the randomized phase III PROSPER trial were recently published. Therein, the addition of enzalutamide or placebo to continued ADT was tested with regards to its potential to delay metastasis formation in men with non-metastasized CRPC who are at high risk for developing distant lesions. In this setting, enzalutamide therapy led to a 71% lower risk of metastasis or death compared to placebo.

Based on these results, enzalutamide is now a primary treatment option for metastasis-free CRPC and asymptomatic mCRPC, whereas docetaxel is mainly used in men with symptomatic metastasized disease and acquired resistance to first-line therapeutics.

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^114JtJF6]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Sample size was calculated based on an assumed study duration of 3 years with 16% loss to follow-up and a 3-year median time to progression for the AS group (0.23 rate), with an underlying hazard ratio (HR) of 0.52. Therefore, 72 events were required to provide a 2-sided type 1 error rate of.05 and power of 80%, resulting in a total sample size of 222 men randomized 1:1, accrued during 1 year.

Efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all randomized patients. Safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set, defined as all randomized patients who received study treatment.

Data were summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous end points and frequency and percentage for categorical end points. There was no imputation for missing data, with the exception of start/stop dates for AEs. Data were analyzed using SAS, version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute), and all statistical analyses were performed using 2-sided tests with a significance level of.05.

Time to prostate cancer progression and time to PSA progression were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were censored at the last assessment date in the absence of progression at the time of study completion, discontinuation, or death. Treatment group differences were assessed using a Cox regression model assuming proportional hazards, with treatment group, stratification factors, age, race, and time since prostate cancer diagnosis as fixed effects, and study site and patient as random effects. Treatment group differences in incidence of prostate cancer progression, negative biopsy results, and a secondary rise in serum PSA levels were assessed using logistic regression, with treatment group, stratification factors, age, race, and time since prostate cancer diagnosis as fixed effects and study site and patient as random effects. Treatment group differences in the percentage of cancer-positive cores were analyzed using a mixed-model–repeated-measures model, with treatment group, stratification factors, visit, visit-by-treatment, and baseline score as fixed effects, study site and patient as random effects, and a Bonferroni-Holm test to adjust for multiplicity. Additional analyses of primary and secondary end points were analyzed using the same methods. The PROs were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Adverse events were graded based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event, version 4.03, and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 23.0.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^113fHjNE]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Treatment with enzalutamide was associated with worse self-ratings of fatigue, physical function, and cognitive function, but not OHQL. Differences between the randomly assigned treatment groups, and their upper 95% confidence limits, were below our prespecified threshold for a minimum clinically important difference of 10 points (on a scale from 0 to 100). These effects were apparent within 3 months of starting study treatment and remained relatively constant thereafter. Men randomly assigned to enzalutamide were more likely to have early deteriorations in fatigue, physical function, and cognitive function, regardless of early chemotherapy with docetaxel. Despite these early impairments in aspects of HRQL, delays in clinical progression because of treatment with enzalutamide led to net benefits in deterioration-free survival. Mean scores for aspects of HRQL at baseline among all trial participants reflected a low burden of cancer-related symptoms and good quality of life on aggregate, similar to reference norms from a population-based sample of Australian men. However, men with high-volume disease at baseline, or with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, reported worse OHQL than their counterparts.

Our findings add to accumulating evidence about potent inhibitors of androgen signaling in HSPC. Enzalutamide had little effect on OHQL in ENZAMET, similar to findings from the ARCHES trial of enzalutamide, the TITAN trial of apalutamide, and the LATITUDE trial of abiraterone. However, unlike ARCHES, TITAN, and LATITUDE, we report that modest detrimental effects of enzalutamide on fatigue, physical function, and self-rated cognitive function, that occurred early, were of a clinically important magnitude in a minority of patients and did not worsen over time. The detrimental effects of enzalutamide on aspects of HRQL were additive and independent of concurrent treatment with early docetaxel. ENZAMET differs from ARCHES, TITAN, and LATITUDE in two important ways. First, ENZAMET was an open-label trial, rendering it susceptible to over-reporting of adverse effects documented in the participant information. Second, ENZAMET was the only trial that tested a novel antiandrogen given concurrently with docetaxel; ARCHES, TITAN, and LATITUDE required completion of early chemotherapy before random assignment.

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^112fnuTh]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There are few published studies prospectively assessing pharmacological interventions that may delay prostate cancer progression in patients undergoing active surveillance (AS).

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy plus AS vs AS alone in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The ENACT study was a phase 2, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted from June 2016 to August 2020 at 66 US and Canadian sites. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had received a diagnosis of histologically proven low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer within 6 months of screening, and were undergoing AS. Patients were monitored during 1 year of treatment and up to 2 years of follow-up. Data analysis was conducted in February 2021.

Interventions

Randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide, 160 mg, monotherapy for 1 year or continued AS, as stratified by cancer risk and follow-up biopsy type.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was time to pathological or therapeutic prostate cancer progression (pathological, ≥ 1 increase in primary or secondary Gleason pattern or ≥ 15% increased cancer-positive cores; therapeutic, earliest occurrence of primary therapy for prostate cancer). Secondary end points included incidence of a negative biopsy result, percentage of cancer-positive cores, and incidence of a secondary rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at 1 and 2 years, as well as time to PSA progression. Adverse events were monitored to assess safety.

Results

A total of 114 patients were randomized to treatment with enzalutamide plus AS and 113 to AS alone; baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms (mean [SD] age, 66.1 [7.8] years; 1 Asian individual [0.4%], 21 Black or African American individuals [9.3%], 1 Hispanic individual [0.4%], and 204 White individuals [89.9%]). Enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of prostate cancer progression by 46% vs AS (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33–0.89; P = 0.02). Compared with AS, odds of a negative biopsy result were 3.5 times higher; there was a significant reduction in the percentage of cancer-positive cores and the odds of a secondary rise in serum PSA levels at 1 year with treatment with enzalutamide; no significant difference was observed at 2 years. Treatment with enzalutamide also significantly delayed PSA progression by 6 months vs AS (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.97; P = 0.03). The most commonly reported adverse events during enzalutamide treatment were fatigue (62 [55.4%]) and gynecomastia (41 [36.6%]). Three patients in the enzalutamide arm died; none were receiving the study drug at the time of death. No deaths were considered treatment-related.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that enzalutamide monotherapy was well-tolerated and demonstrated a significant treatment response in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. Enzalutamide may provide an alternative treatment option for patients undergoing AS.

Trial Registration

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^111BjUux]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

As an alternative to Active Surveillance

The ENACT trial is an open-label phase 2 trial which randomized patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk PCa between active surveillance (AS) and AS plus enzalutamide monotherapy given for 1 year. The primary endpoint was time to pathological or therapeutic PCa progression (pathological, ≥ 1 increase in primary or secondary Gleason pattern or ≥ 15% increased cancer-positive cores; therapeutic, earliest occurrence of primary therapy for PCa). Approximately half of the patients had low-risk disease, the other half had favorable intermediate-risk disease. With a median follow-up of 16.2 months for patients receiving enzalutamide and 8.8 months for patients undergoing AS, treatment with enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of PCa progression by 46% vs AS (28.1% vs 37.2% respectively, HR, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33–0.89; P = 0.02). During the 1-year treatment period, 92.0% of patients reported any grade toxicity in the enzalutamide group versus 54.9% in the AS group. The most frequent reported toxicity in the enzalutamide group was fatigue in more than half of the patients, gynecomastia and other-related symptoms in one third of the patients, and erectile dysfunction in 18% of patients.

When published, this study was heavily criticized, for several reasons. First, current guidelines clearly state that all active treatment options present a risk of over-treatment for the management of low-risk disease and that AS or watchful waiting (based on life expectancy) is standard of care in this setting. Second, the relevance of the chosen endpoint was questioned. Giving a drug that blocks PCa growth and PSA production could delay grade progression. The fact that it could translate to benefit with stronger endpoints as metastasis-free survival (MFS) or OS is very unlikely. Based on these 2 remarks, it was deemed very questionable to provide a treatment with a high toxicity and a significant financial burden on healthcare systems without any effect on survival or quality of life, especially for patients who do not need treatment in the first place.

### ARCHES: a randomized, phase III study of androgen deprivation therapy with enzalutamide or placebo in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer [^113WyDL3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this phase III trial involving men with mHSPC, adding enzalutamide to ADT significantly reduced the risk of radiographic disease progression or death by 61% compared with placebo plus ADT (HR, 0.39; P < .001). Significant improvements with enzalutamide plus ADT were also observed in secondary efficacy end points. OS data are immature and will be analyzed when 342 deaths have occurred. Preliminary safety analysis showed an acceptable safety profile that seems consistent with that in previously reported clinical trials involving patients with CRPC, with maintenance of QoL at the high level reported at baseline. These efficacy and safety results prompted the DSMB to recommend crossing patients treated with placebo plus ADT over to enzalutamide plus ADT.

Importantly, the significant reduction in the risk of radiographic disease progression or death with enzalutamide plus ADT in this study (P < .001) was observed in all prespecified subgroups, including men with or without prior docetaxel chemotherapy and those with a low or high volume of metastatic disease. These data support the consideration of enzalutamide in addition to ADT for men with mHSPC, including patients with prior docetaxel treatment and regardless of disease volume. Although OS data remain immature, these findings have clear clinical implications for the current management of these patients.

PROs from assessments of daily living have also been shown to predict survival in prostate cancer. In this population of men with mHSPC, we observed maintenance of high QoL over time, similar to that observed in the population with nonmetastatic castration-resistant disease. Baseline average BPI-SF scores were low overall, with almost half of patients reporting scores of zero. Consequently, no significant difference between treatment groups in risk of pain progression, defined as a 30% or greater increase in average BPI-SF pain severity score, was observed. However, when using a more clinically meaningful definition of pain progression (≥ 2-point threshold)during the prespecified sensitivity analyses from the PRO SAP, enzalutamide plus ADT showed a delay in pain progression versus placebo plus ADT. Ultimately, no significant difference between treatment groups in risk of deterioration of urinary symptoms or QoL was observed, suggesting there was no negative impact on PROs due to the addition of enzalutamide to ADT. Additional analyses of the PROs are ongoing and are also planned as part of the long-term follow-up.

### Updates to advanced prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline (2023) [^113kycEL]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) — enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improved radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in randomized evidence and showed specific adverse event patterns. Discontinuation due to adverse events was higher with enzalutamide (33 events versus 14 events), fatigue was more common, and seizures occurred in 7 patients in the enzalutamide group (1%) compared to 0 patients in the standard care group; approximately 16% of patients also received docetaxel, and the trial did not address early intensification by adding docetaxel to enzalutamide. In the phase III ARCHES trial of 1,150 men with mHSPC randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160mg per day or placebo with ADT, the risk of radiographic PFS or death was significantly reduced with enzalutamide (median not reached versus 19.0 months; HR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.50; P < .001). After unblinding, 180 (31.3%) from placebo crossed to open-label enzalutamide; at a median follow-up of 44.6 months deaths were 154 of 574 on enzalutamide versus 202 of 576 on placebo, and enzalutamide plus ADT reduced risk of death by 34% (HR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.81; P < 0.001).

Enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (AFFIRM) — In the randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled AFFIRM trial, 1199 patients were randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide or placebo and median overall survival improved from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P < .001). Secondary endpoints improved, including > 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline (54% vs. 2%), radiographic response (29% vs. 4%), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months), and time to first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months). Adverse events were mild, including fatigue (34% vs. 29%), diarrhea (21% vs. 18%), hot flushes (20% vs. 10%), headache (12% vs. 6%), and seizures (0.6% vs. 0%), and the incidence of cardiac disorders did not differ between arms. Enzalutamide is dosed at 160 mg daily; patients were maintained on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist therapy and could receive bone supportive care medications, and quality of life was improved versus placebo. The seizure risk in the enzalutamide FDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript.

### Enzalutamide with standard first-line therapy in metastatic prostate cancer [^114cuiti]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Enzalutamide, an androgen-receptor inhibitor, has been associated with improved overall survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is not known whether adding enzalutamide to testosterone suppression, with or without early docetaxel, will improve survival in men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Methods

In this open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we assigned patients to receive testosterone suppression plus either open-label enzalutamide or a standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy (standard-care group). The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included progression-free survival as determined by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical progression-free survival, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 1125 men underwent randomization; the median follow-up was 34 months. There were 102 deaths in the enzalutamide group and 143 deaths in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 0.86; P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 3 years were 80% (based on 94 events) in the enzalutamide group and 72% (based on 130 events) in the standard-care group. Better results with enzalutamide were also seen in PSA progression-free survival (174 and 333 events, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.39; P < 0.001) and in clinical progression-free survival (167 and 320 events, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.40; P < 0.001). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was more frequent in the enzalutamide group than in the standard-care group (33 events and 14 events, respectively). Fatigue was more common in the enzalutamide group; seizures occurred in 7 patients in the enzalutamide group (1%) and in no patients in the standard-care group.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than standard care in men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer receiving testosterone suppression. The enzalutamide group had a higher incidence of seizures and other toxic effects, especially among those treated with early docetaxel.

### Enzalutamide for the treatment of androgen receptor-expressing triple-negative breast cancer [^113iKgro]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Studies suggest that a subset of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have tumors that express the androgen receptor (AR) and may benefit from an AR inhibitor. This phase II study evaluated the antitumor activity and safety of enzalutamide in patients with locally advanced or metastatic AR-positive TNBC. Patients and Methods Tumors were tested for AR with an immunohistochemistry assay optimized for breast cancer; nuclear AR staining > 0% was considered positive. Patients received enzalutamide 160 mg once per day until disease progression. The primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 16 weeks. Secondary end points included CBR at 24 weeks, progression-free survival, and safety. End points were analyzed in all enrolled patients (the intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and in patients with one or more postbaseline assessment whose tumor expressed ≥ 10% nuclear AR (the evaluable subgroup). Results Of 118 patients enrolled, 78 were evaluable. CBR at 16 weeks was 25% (95% CI, 17% to 33%) in the ITT population and 33% (95% CI, 23% to 45%) in the evaluable subgroup. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.7 months) in the ITT population and 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1 months) in the evaluable subgroup. Median overall survival was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 months to not yet reached) in the ITT population and 17.6 months (95% CI, 11.6 months to not yet reached) in the evaluable subgroup. Fatigue was the only treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse event with an incidence of > 2%. Conclusion Enzalutamide demonstrated clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with advanced AR-positive TNBC. Adverse events related to enzalutamide were consistent with its known safety profile. This study supports additional development of enzalutamide in advanced TNBC.

### Antitumour activity and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for ≥ 24 weeks in Europe [^1138FThZ]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, which target the androgen receptor axis, have expanded the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Retrospective analyses suggest some cross-resistance between these two drugs when used sequentially, but robust, prospective studies have not yet been reported.

Objective

To fulfil a regulatory postregistration commitment by evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicentre, single-arm, open-label study, enrolled patients with progressing mCRPC after ≥ 24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment. All patients maintained castration therapy during the trial. Prior chemotherapy was allowed but not required.

Intervention

Patients received enzalutamide 160mg/d orally.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and time-to-PSA progression. Safety data were also assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to descriptively analyse time-to-event endpoints.

Results and Limitations

Overall, 214 patients received enzalutamide treatment, 145 of whom were chemotherapy-naïve. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 8.1 mo (95% confidence interval: 6.1–8.3); median overall survival had not been reached. Unconfirmed PSA response rate was 27% (48 of 181). Median time-to-PSA progression was 5.7 mo (95% confidence interval: 5.6–5.8). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (32%), decreased appetite (25%), asthenia (18%), back pain (17%), and arthralgia (16%). No seizures were reported.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide showed antitumour activity in some patients with mCRPC who had previously progressed following ≥ 24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment.

Patient Summary

Patients with mCRPC who progressed on previous abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment, with or without prior chemotherapy, received enzalutamide. Although cross-resistance between the two agents was observed in a majority of patients, some still benefited from enzalutamide treatment.

### Talazoparib plus enzalutamide in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: final overall survival results from the randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial [^114GxSXF]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The primary analysis of this phase 3 trial combining talazoparib with enzalutamide demonstrated significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) versus enzalutamide plus placebo in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer unselected for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations. Overall survival data were immature at that time. Here we report the final prespecified overall survival analysis, an updated descriptive analysis of rPFS, and safety in the cohort unselected for HRR gene alterations.

Methods

TALAPRO-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. In the genetically unselected cohort, patients were randomly assigned from 200 centres, including hospitals, cancer centres, and medical centres, in 26 countries in North America, Europe, Israel, South America, South Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. Adult men (aged ≥ 18 years [≥ 20 years in Japan]) with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving ongoing androgen deprivation therapy, and with no previous life-prolonging systemic therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer, were randomly assigned (1:1) to talazoparib 0.5 mg plus enzalutamide 160 mg or enzalutamide plus placebo, administered orally once daily as initial treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, stratified by HRR gene alteration status (HRR-deficient vs HRR-non-deficient or unknown) and previous treatment for castration-sensitive disease (yes vs no). The sponsor, patients, and investigators were masked to talazoparib or placebo, and enzalutamide was open label. The primary endpoint was rPFS by blinded independent central review, and overall survival (time from randomisation to death due to any cause) was an event-based α-protected key secondary endpoint (α-threshold at final overall survival analysis was 0.022 [two-sided])-both assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Follow-up for overall survival was intended to continue until the planned final analysis. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of a study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03395197, and is ongoing.

Findings

Between Jan 7, 2019, and Sept 17, 2020, 993 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 188 (19%) patients were excluded and 805 (81%) patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (402 [50%] to talazoparib plus enzalutamide, 403 [50%] to enzalutamide plus placebo). At a median follow-up of 52.5 months (IQR 48.6–56.0), overall survival was significantly improved with talazoparib plus enzalutamide compared with enzalutamide plus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80 [95% CI 0.66–0.96]; p = 0.016); median overall survival was 45.8 months (95% CI 39.4–50.8) in the talazoparib group compared with 37.0 months (34.1–40.4) in the control group. Overall survival favoured talazoparib plus enzalutamide over enzalutamide plus placebo in HRR-deficient patients (n = 169; HR 0.55 [0.36–0.83]; p = 0.0035) and to a lesser extent in HRR-non-deficient or unknown patients (n = 636; HR 0.88 [0.71–1.08]; p = 0.22). Updated rPFS also favoured talazoparib plus enzalutamide (HR 0.67 [0.55–0.81]; p < 0.0001); median rPFS was 33.1 months for talazoparib plus enzalutamide versus 19.5 months for enzalutamide plus placebo. Safety was consistent with the known profile of talazoparib; common grade 3 or higher adverse events with talazoparib plus enzalutamide were anaemia (195 [49%] vs 18 [4%] patients with enzalutamide plus placebo) and neutropenia (77 [19%] vs six [1%] patients with enzalutamide plus placebo).

Interpretation

Combining talazoparib with enzalutamide significantly improved overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, supporting this combination as a standard-of-care initial treatment option for these patients.

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^114V2Kwt]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Results

Patient disposition is presented in Figure 1. Overall, 227 men were randomized across 66 sites. Of the 114 men randomized to receive treatment with enzalutamide, 85 (74.6%) completed 1 year of AS, 70 (61.4%) completed 1 year of follow-up, and 58 (50.9%) completed 1 year of continued follow-up. Of the 113 men randomized to undergo AS, 80 (70.8%) completed 1 year of treatment, 51 (45.1%) completed 1 year of follow-up, and 41 (36.3%) completed 1 year of continued follow-up. Fifty-four patients (47.4%) receiving enzalutamide and 40 patients (35.4%) undergoing AS completed all study periods. Disease progression and patient withdrawal were generally the most commonly reported reasons for discontinuation in both treatment arms throughout the study. Median follow-up was 492.5 days (range, 1.0–1078.0 days) for patients receiving enzalutamide and 270.5 days (range, 1.0–806.0 days) for patients undergoing AS.

Figure 1.
Patient Disposition

Patients could discontinue a study period yet remain in the study. AE indicates adverse event; AS, active surveillance.

a The full analysis set (FAS) comprised all randomized patients.

b The safety analysis set (SAF) comprised all randomized patients who received study treatment. Two patients randomized to the enzalutamide treatment arm were excluded from the SAF; 1 patient did not receive the study drug but remained in the study and 1 patient withdrew from the study after randomization and before taking the study drug.

Baseline demographic characteristics and disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms (Table 1). Overall, 121 men (53.3%) had low-risk prostate cancer and 172 (75.8%) underwent non–mpMRI-targeted follow-up biopsies. The median enzalutamide treatment duration was 352 days (range, 1–393 days). During the 1-year treatment period, enzalutamide treatment was interrupted in 15 men (13.2%) and the enzalutamide dose was reduced in 14 men (12.3%), primarily owing to AEs.

### Comparison of standard-dose and reduced-dose treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide: a rapid review [^115iGrKV]. BMJ Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of low-dose versus standard-dose enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

Methods and Analysis

Keyword searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 June 2023, with forward and backward citation searches of potentially relevant studies. Studies were included if primary outcome data were reported for patients with metastatic prostate cancer who had received reduced doses of enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide. Searches were limited to original full-text and English-language studies. Key outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen response and treatment-related adverse events. The review was performed in accordance with Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group guidelines.

Results

Ten studies were identified that met the eligibility criteria: five phase I studies, two post-hoc analyses of phase III trials and three retrospective analyses. No consistent association between OS, PFS and drug dose was identified. Fewer severe treatment-related adverse events were observed at lower drug doses.

Conclusion

This review provides evidence that enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide could be given at a lower than the standard recommended dose without loss of antitumour activity. A prospective near-equivalence randomised trial should be undertaken to compare registered and lower doses of these agents.

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^114Q4zPu]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The ENACT study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 2, exploratory clinical trial conducted in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer in the US and Canada from June 2016 to August 2020 (Supplement 1 and Supplement 2). The study was conducted in accordance with International Council for Harmonization guidelines, applicable local laws, regulations, and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, as well as ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site. This article was prepared in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Patients were randomized 1:1 via interactive response technology to receive 1 year of treatment with enzalutamide, 160 mg, monotherapy plus AS or AS alone, as stratified by cancer risk (low vs intermediate) and type of follow-up biopsy (transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy [mpMRI-targeted vs non–mpMRI-targeted]) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). Enrollment of patients with low-risk prostate cancer was capped to not exceed 80% of the study population. Treatment with oral enzalutamide was administered once daily as 4 × 40-mg capsules per the approved product label. Patients randomized to AS did not receive the study drug. Monitoring continued until the last patient completed the 24-month posttreatment visit (1 year of follow-up and 1 year of continued follow-up).

Treatment adjustment was permitted in the event of a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE) of grade 3 or higher, for which enzalutamide treatment was paused for 1 week or until the adverse event (AE) reduced in severity to grade 2 or less. Treatment then resumed at the original or reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg) at the investigator's discretion. Dose reduction was permitted to manage gynecomastia or breast complications at the investigator's discretion.

Enzalutamide in mCRPC after docetaxel — the FDA approved enzalutamide in August 2012 based on the randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled AFFIRM trial, which randomized 1199 patients to enzalutamide (160 mg daily) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio with overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint; median survival improved from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P < .001), and secondary endpoints improved including > 50% PSA decline (54% vs. 2%), radiographic response (29% vs. 4%), radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) (8.3 vs. 2.9 months), and time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) (16.7 vs. 13.3 months). Quality of life (QOL) measured using validated surveys was improved with enzalutamide compared to placebo, and adverse events were mild, including fatigue (34% vs. 29%), diarrhea (21% vs. 18%), hot flushes (20% vs. 10%), headache (12% vs. 6%), and seizures (0.6% vs. 0%); the seizure risk in the enzalutamide FDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript. Another phase 3 trial studied enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy setting, and the PREVAIL study randomly assigned 1717 patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic prostate cancer.

### Enzalutamide monotherapy vs active surveillance in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer: the ENACT randomized clinical trial [^1179CSeG]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In the phase 2 ENACT randomized clinical trial, treatment with enzalutamide monotherapy significantly reduced the risk of prostate cancer and PSA progression vs AS in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. Patients receiving enzalutamide also had a significant improvement in the odds of a negative biopsy result, as well as significant reductions in the percentage of cancer-positive cores and odds of a secondary rise in serum PSA levels at 1 year compared with AS. Enzalutamide monotherapy was well-tolerated, with the observed AE data consistent with the known safety profile of enzalutamide.

The REDEEM trial was the first to assess the efficacy and safety of any pharmacological treatment in men with low-risk prostate cancer who were undergoing AS. Dutasteride was found to significantly reduce the risk of pathological or therapeutic prostate cancer progression by 38% during the 3-year treatment period vs AS (P = 0.01). The observed 46% risk reduction (P = 0.02) in ENACT is consistent with this finding. Similar to REDEEM, AEs related to sexual function and breast disorders were among the most commonly reported treatment-related AEs in ENACT. In contrast to REDEEM, ENACT used a treatment with proven clinical benefit in more advanced prostate cancer and included men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Limitations

The ENACT PSA progression analysis results were potentially confounded by the effect of enzalutamide on PSA levels and the definition of PSA progression, which resulted in a potential bias toward AS. The PSA rebound was observed following cessation of enzalutamide treatment, although the mean PSA levels in this arm remained less than baseline throughout the study. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to all racial and ethnic minority groups. While the additional analyses by pathological vs therapeutic progression, low vs high GS, low-risk vs intermediate-risk disease, and in patients with consistent biopsy types provided results that support those from the overall ENACT study population, these findings should be interpreted with caution, given that the study was not designed or powered for such analyses.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^114serWV]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Enzalutamide is a potent, oral, nonsteroidal, androgen receptor antagonist that increased overall survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. ENZAMET is an ANZUP-led, international, randomized, phase III, cooperative group trial of enzalutamide versus an active control (physician's choice of bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide), used together with testosterone suppression, in recently diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). In 2019, we reported that treatment with early enzalutamide improved overall survival in metastatic HSPC within 3 years of follow-up.

Here, we report on aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQL), a key secondary outcome in ENZAMET. Our aim was to determine the effects of enzalutamide versus active control on HRQL until clinical progression. These analyses include comparisons of HRQL scores from baseline until clinical progression and of deterioration-free survival, a novel measure of net benefit accounting for both disease control and worsening of HRQL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

This multicenter, single‐arm, open‐label study was conducted at 54 sites across the United States (38) and Canada (16) in patients with progressive mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel‐based chemotherapy for whom, in the judgment of the investigator, there was no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy (NCT01606982). Written informed consent was obtained from study participants before any study procedures were initiated. The study protocol was reviewed by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards and was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Male patients were eligible for study participation if they had histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate; ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue (agonist or antagonist), or orchiectomy (i.e. surgical or medical castration); at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for mCRPC with at least one regimen containing docetaxel; progressive disease as per determination of the investigator (prostate‐specific antigen rise, or radiographic or clinical worsening of disease); and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2.

### Enzalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after combined androgen blockade for recurrence following radical treatment in Japan (Japanese research for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-enzalutamide: JCASTRE-zero)-a prospective single-arm interventional study [^1112MJUe]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of enzalutamide in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after combined androgen blockade, which represents a patient profile similar to real-world clinical practice in Japan, remains unknown. Therefore, we investigate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide after combined androgen blockade for recurrence following radical treatment in Japanese patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods

We analyzed 66 patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after combined androgen blockade for recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy who were prospectively enrolled from October 2015 to March 2018. They received enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily until the protocol treatment discontinuation criteria were met. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival, defined as the time from enrollment to prostate-specific antigen-based progression or death from any cause. The secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, time to prostate-specific antigen progression, prostate-specific antigen response rate, chemotherapy-free survival, and safety assessment.

Results

The median observation period was 27.3 months. The median prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival was 35.0 months (95% confidence interval, 17.5 to not reached). The median overall survival, median progression-free survival, median metastasis-free survival, and chemotherapy-free survival were not reached, with the corresponding 2-year rates being 91.6%, 67.1%, 72.4%, and 85.8%, respectively. The 50% prostate-specific antigen response rate was 88.9%, with the median time being 2.8 months. In total, 42.2% of the patients experienced adverse events, with malaise being the most common.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide effectively manages non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after combined androgen blockade for recurrence following radical treatment.

### Enzalutamide in patients with high-risk biochemically recurrent prostate cancer according to the European Association of Urology definition: a post hoc analysis of EMBARK [^112dEzY7]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

High-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR) definition varies across clinical studies/practice guidelines. We evaluated metastasis-free survival (MFS) by blinded, independent, central review and safety in EMBARK (NCT02319837) patients defined as high-risk BCR per European Association of Urology (EAU) criteria. Patients post-radical prostatectomy (prostatic-specific antigen doubling time ≤ 9 months) or post-radiation therapy with a Gleason score > 7, were considered EAU high-risk. MFS improved with enzalutamide+leuprolide (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25‒0.57) and enzalutamide monotherapy (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39‒0.83) versus leuprolide alone. MFS and safety for enzalutamide ± leuprolide versus leuprolide alone were similar in EMBARK patients with EAU-consistent or protocol-defined high-risk BCR.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^112KVVFC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Considerations

Primary and secondary analyses were specified a priori in a statistical analysis plan written before their conduct and reflected two ways of viewing effects on HRQL. The first was to summarize and compare self-ratings HRQL from random assignment until clinical progression. The second was to describe and compare times to first deterioration defined either by a clinically important worsening in a domain of HRQL or by clinical progression.

For HRQL until progression, scores over time were summarized by the treatment group and analyzed using a repeated measures model (RMM) to calculate predicted group means, differences, 95% CIs, and P values on the basis of Wald tests. The RMM was specified within the general linear-mixed model framework, used a compound symmetry covariance matrix, and included covariates for randomly assigned treatment, baseline assessment, postbaseline assessment time point, and an interaction term for treatment-by-time point, all as fixed effects. The interaction term was removed to calculate the difference between groups across all postbaseline time points. Reference-based sensitivity analyses with multiple imputations were used to assess the effects of assuming HRQL data were missing at random.

Deterioration-free survival was formulated a priori as an end point reflecting net benefit during the interval from random assignment until clinical progression. It was defined as the time from random assignment until the earliest of the following events: a 10-point or greater deterioration from baseline in the pertinent aspect of HRQL (without a subsequent 10-point or greater improvement compared with baseline), clinical progression, treatment discontinuation, or death from any cause. Participants who experienced none of these events had their observations censored at the date they were last known not to have clinically progressed.

The two end points for deterioration-free survival formulated a priori used different indicators of a deterioration in HRQL on the basis of the core quality of life questionnaire: One used the scale for physical function and the other used the scale for OHQL. The criterion of a 10-point reduction to signify a clinically important deterioration was specified a priori on the basis of evidence-based guidelines. Given the known effects of enzalutamide on fatigue and self-reported cognitive function, we also performed post hoc analyses of deterioration-free survival focused on these aspects.

### Enzalutamide and prostate-specific antigen levels in metastatic prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of the ARCHES randomized clinical trial [^113rWz25]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The ARCHES randomized clinical trial was approved by local independent review boards and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinkiand International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data safety monitoring board evaluated unblinded safety data on an ongoing basis. The trial protocol is presented in Supplement 1. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Study Design and Patients

The results of the ARCHES trial were published previously. In brief, 1150 patients with mHSPC were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/d) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT between March 21, 2016, and January 12, 2018. Patients were stratified by disease volume (high or low) and prior docetaxel therapy (0, 1–5, or 6 cycles). After the primary analysis, the ARCHES trial was unblinded for patients receiving placebo plus ADT to cross over to enzalutamide plus ADT in an open-label extension; 180 of 576 patients (31.3%) randomized to placebo plus ADT crossed over to enzalutamide plus ADT (median time to crossover, 21.5 months; IQR, 19.0–24.2 months).

This post hoc analysis was not preplanned. In this analysis, patients who received up to 3 months of prior ADT, or up to 6 months in the setting of prior ADT or docetaxel, were evaluated by PSA level at study enrollment (eFigure 1A in Supplement 2). PSA decline was assessed in patients with detectable PSA at baseline and in patients with available PSA measurements at 6 months during study treatment (eFigure 1B in Supplement 2). Analyses of PSA decline to undetectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) were conducted in patients with detectable PSA at baseline (≥ 0.2 ng/mL), excluding those with no postbaseline PSA measurements (eFigure 1C in Supplement 2).

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116MdLfm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Enzalutamide — non-metastatic CRPC (M0 CRPC; PROSPER) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of 1401 patients with non-metastatic CRPC; patients with PSADT ≤ 10 months were stratified by PSADT (< 6 vs. ≥ 6 months) and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT, resulting in improved metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 vs. 14.7 months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24–0.35; P < .0001) and longer median OS (67.0 vs. 56.3 months; HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89; P = 0.001); adverse events included fatigue (33% vs. 14%), hypertension (12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%), and patient-reported outcomes indicated delayed pain progression, symptom worsening, and decrease in functional status versus placebo; the FDA expanded approval to include non-metastatic CRPC in July 2018 and the Panel believes patients with M0 CRPC can be offered enzalutamide if PSADT is ≤ 10 months (category 1, preferred option), and patients receiving enzalutamide have no restrictions for food intake and concurrent prednisone is permitted but not required.

### Safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel: expanded access in north America [^112qYVZG]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Safety Assessments

Reporting of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs; defined as any AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant incapacity or disruption of normal life functions, required or prolonged hospitalization, or any other medically important event), vital signs, and routine laboratory measurements (hematology and chemistry) were performed at all study visits. SAEs, including death, were collected from the time the patient signed the consent form until the end‐of‐study visit. Patients who transitioned to commercially supplied enzalutamide after the end‐of‐study visit had safety monitored by the treating physician, with spontaneous reporting of AEs in the post‐marketing period.

Statistical Analysis

As this was an open‐label, expanded access treatment protocol, no formal sample size calculation was performed. All patients who received at least one dose of enzalutamide were analyzed for safety. All safety assessments were summarized with descriptive statistics. Study exposure was evaluated in patients with a last dose date. Kaplan–Meier methods were used to estimate the median time to discontinuation due to either disease progression or death in patients with evaluable study drug exposure. Patients that discontinued due to reasons other than progressive disease or death were censored at last dose date.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^112r5QZT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

We previously reported that enzalutamide improved overall survival when added to standard of care in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Here, we report its effects on aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQL).

METHODS

HRQL was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire and QLM-PR25 at weeks 0, 4, 12, and then every 12 weeks until progression. Scores from week 4 to 156 were analyzed with repeated measures modeling to calculate group means and differences. Deterioration-free survival was from random assignment until the earliest of death, clinical progression, discontinuation of study treatment, or a worsening of 10 points or more from baseline in fatigue, physical function, cognitive function, or overall health and quality of life (OHQL). HRQL scores range from 0 (lowest possible) to 100 (highest possible).

RESULTS

HRQL was assessed in 1,042 of 1,125 participants (93%). Differences in means favored control over enzalutamide for fatigue (5.2, 95% CI, 3.6 to 6.9; P < .001), cognitive function (4.0, 95% CI, 2.5 to 5.5; P < .001), and physical function (2.6, 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.9; P < .001), but not OHQL (1.2, 95% CI, −0.2 to 2.7; P = 0.1). Deterioration-free survival rates at 3 years, and log-rank P values comparing the whole distributions, favored enzalutamide over control for OHQL (31% v 17%; P < .0001), cognitive function (31% v 20%; P = 0.001), and physical function (31% v 22%; P < .001), but not fatigue (24% v 18%; P = 0.16). The effects of enzalutamide on HRQL were independent of baseline characteristics.

CONCLUSION

Enzalutamide was associated with worsening of self-reported fatigue, cognitive function, and physical function, but not OHQL. Enzalutamide was associated with improved deterioration-free survival for OHQL, physical function, and cognitive function because delays in disease progression outweighed early deteriorations in these aspects of HRQL.

### Abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone with or without enzalutamide for patients with metastatic prostate cancer starting androgen deprivation therapy: final results from two randomised phase 3 trials of the STAMPEDE platform protocol [^112rejTM]. The Lancet: Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Combining abiraterone and enzalutamide with androgen deprivation therapy is more effective than androgen deprivation therapy alone, but from an indirect comparison we showed no improvement over abiraterone and androgen deprivation therapy. We have not formally compared the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial with trials testing enzalutamide. But, given the similar efficacy reported when combining enzalutamide with androgen deprivation therapy, we also conclude that combining abiraterone with enzalutamide would not be more effective. Overall, increased toxicity with the combination of abiraterone and enzalutamide does not justify further exploration in unselected patients.

Combining apalutamide or enzalutamide with abiraterone for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer might improve progression-free survival but consistent with our findings, these trials showed no improvement in overall survival. – Similarly, there was no improvement in overall survival of patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer when abiraterone was indirectly compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide (administered as adjuvant therapy for 2 years). Therefore, treatment efficacy with abiraterone is unlikely to be reduced by an increase in androgens or reactivation of ligand-binding domain-dependent reactivation of androgen receptor signalling (given that combining abiraterone with an effective androgen receptor antagonist, enzalutamide, has no discernible long-term benefit). This finding is consistent with the low response rate observed from sequential use of either treatment.

The periods of accrual to both trials overlapped with another separate trial that randomly assigned patients with metastatic cancer to radiotherapy to the primary tumour and reported improved overall survival for those with low-volume metastatic disease. Although abiraterone-containing trials shared patients who received standard of care (control) with the radiotherapy trial, none were randomly assigned to the study drug groups so we are unable to comment on the interaction between radiotherapy and hormone intensification.

By leveraging resources across several trials, our follow-up of patients allocated to abiraterone was longer than feasible in other trials, which allowed us to make additional observations. Notably, the survival benefit of starting abiraterone with androgen deprivation therapy is maintained with longer follow-up and 23% of patients in the abiraterone trial and 22% in the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial continued abiraterone with no indication for a treatment change after more than 82 months of follow-up.

### Enzalutamide therapy for advanced prostate cancer: efficacy, resistance and beyond [^111b4ao2]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Up to now, the consensus on therapy sequencing in the mCRPC setting is mostly based on small retrospective studies that are unable to give a clear answer. Recently, a post-registration study evaluated the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide treatment in patients with mCRPC who had previously progressed on abiraterone. Therein, enzalutamide therapy was beneficial in some patients, whereas the majority presented cross-resistance between the two hormonal agents. Similar results were shown in a retrospective study, in which the response to enzalutamide was associated with a longer interval between end of abiraterone and start of enzalutamide treatment, suggesting that over time the chance for a subsequent enzalutamide response potentially increases.

On the basis of the observed cross-resistance, it is important to evaluate which of the endocrine treatment options is more effective as first-line therapy for patients with mCRPC. This issue is currently being addressed in the ENABLE study for prostate cancer, a phase III multicenter randomized controlled trial, in which the efficacies of enzalutamide and abiraterone will be compared head to head.

Additionally, a randomized controlled trial (Nbib2125357) is currently being performed, which assesses PSA response rates in therapy-naïve mCRPC patients being sequentially treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide or vice versa.

Combining different AR-targeting drugs simultaneously might improve efficacy as compared to consecutive treatment. This is being investigated in patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone alone vs a combination therapy consisting of both antiandrogens (Nbib1949337, Nbib1995513). Furthermore, although in the hormone-naïve setting, the result update of the STAMPEDE trial is awaited with high expectations, as it includes an arm with such a combination therapy (Nbib268476, Arm J).

Another approach to re-challenge enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC has been described byand is referred to as bipolar androgen therapy (BAT). BAT is exploiting the adaptive increase of AR levels in CRPC, allowing the tumor cells to cope with castrate levels of testosterone, by rapidly cycling between androgen stimulation and deprivation. A subsequent phase II study of BAT in mCRPC patients that progressed on enzalutamide showed successful re-sensitization to the drug, when the patients were re-challenged with the antiandrogen upon progression on testosterone therapy.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^1148ptPv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We previously reported that enzalutamide improved overall survival when added to standard of care in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Here, we report its effects on aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Methods

HRQL was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire and QLM-PR25 at weeks 0, 4, 12, and then every 12 weeks until progression. Scores from week 4 to 156 were analyzed with repeated measures modeling to calculate group means and differences. Deterioration-free survival was from random assignment until the earliest of death, clinical progression, discontinuation of study treatment, or a worsening of 10 points or more from baseline in fatigue, physical function, cognitive function, or overall health and quality of life (OHQL). HRQL scores range from 0 (lowest possible) to 100 (highest possible).

Results

HRQL was assessed in 1,042 of 1,125 participants (93%). Differences in means favored control over enzalutamide for fatigue (5.2, 95% CI, 3.6 to 6.9; P < .001), cognitive function (4.0, 95% CI, 2.5 to 5.5; P < .001), and physical function (2.6, 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.9; P < .001), but not OHQL (1.2, 95% CI, -0.2 to 2.7; P = 0.1). Deterioration-free survival rates at 3 years, and log-rank P values comparing the whole distributions, favored enzalutamide over control for OHQL (31% v 17%; P < .0001), cognitive function (31% v 20%; P = 0.001), and physical function (31% v 22%; P < .001), but not fatigue (24% v 18%; P = 0.16). The effects of enzalutamide on HRQL were independent of baseline characteristics.

Conclusion

Enzalutamide was associated with worsening of self-reported fatigue, cognitive function, and physical function, but not OHQL. Enzalutamide was associated with improved deterioration-free survival for OHQL, physical function, and cognitive function because delays in disease progression outweighed early deteriorations in these aspects of HRQL.

### Enzalutamide, a second generation androgen receptor antagonist: development and clinical applications in prostate cancer [^1151jGqR]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Enzalutamide, formerly known as MDV3100, is an oral second generation androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that was chosen from a screen of agents and shown in preclinical studies to have greater affinity for the AR than its predecessors without any agonistic effects. The pre-clinical work that led to the interest in studying this agent and the history of the clinical development of enzalutamide from first in man phase 1 through phase 3 and regulatory approval are reviewed. Information about the toxicity profile and prescribing enzalutamide are discussed in detail. The availability of enzalutamide is put into context with the five other agents that modify survival outcomes in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Some of the new challenges confronting the field regarding sequencing and combinations of these agents and the potential for a change in the natural history of the disease, are also discussed.

### Efficacy and safety of enzalutamide vs bicalutamide in younger and older patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in the TERRAIN trial [^111fzWBp]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Enzalutamide significantly prolonged median progression-free survival vs bicalutamide in chemotherapy naïve men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer in the TERRAIN (Enzalutamide versus Bicalutamide in Castrate Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer) trial. In this post hoc analysis we investigated the influence of age on the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide vs bicalutamide in this population.

Materials and Methods

Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg per day or bicalutamide 50 mg per day. Progression-free survival, time to prostate specific antigen progression and safety were analyzed post hoc in younger (age less than 75 years) and older (age 75 years or greater) subgroups.

Results

Enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death vs bicalutamide in patients younger than 75 years (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27–0.52, p < 0.0001) and 75 years old or older (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.92, p = 0.018). Time to prostate specific antigen progression was also significantly prolonged with enzalutamide vs bicalutamide in each subgroup. The adverse event distribution between treatments was similar in each subgroup except for more (5% or greater difference between subgroups) atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infections, falls and decreased appetite as well as less extremity pain and hot flushing in enzalutamide treated patients 75 years old or older, and less back pain and hot flushing in bicalutamide treated patients 75 years old or older. Grade 3 or greater cardiac events were more frequent in enzalutamide treated and bicalutamide treated patients who were 75 years old or older vs younger than 75 years. Fatigue was more frequent in enzalutamide treated patients with a similar distribution in each age subgroup.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide improved clinical outcomes vs bicalutamide irrespective of age. Increased falls and cardiac events suggest caution when prescribing to older patients (age 75 years or greater) with significant comorbidity.

### Efficacy of enzalutamide in subgroups of men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer based on prior therapy, disease volume, and risk [^113NpuZq]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly reduces the risk of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and improves overall survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), the efficacy in clinically relevant subgroups of patients based on prior local and systemic therapy, disease volume, and risk has not been analyzed to date. These post hoc analyses of the phase 3 ARCHES trial (NCT02677896) evaluated the efficacy of enzalutamide plus ADT according to prior local and systemic treatment, disease volume, and risk, assessed at trial baseline.

Methods

In ARCHES, a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, 1150 patients with mHSPC were randomized 1:1 to receive enzalutamide (160mg/day) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT, stratified by prior docetaxel therapy and disease volume. Primary endpoint was rPFS. Secondary endpoints included time to prostate-specific antigen progression, symptomatic skeletal events, and prostate-specific antigen and radiographic responses. Analyses of clinical endpoints were completed by prior local therapy, prior docetaxel exposure, CHAARTED (NCT00309985)-defined disease volume, and LATITUDE (NCT01715285)-defined risk groups.

Results

Patients were randomized to enzalutamide plus ADT (n = 574) and placebo plus ADT (n = 576). Enzalutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS (hazard ratio: 0.39; p < 0.0001), with similar improvements reported in all subgroups based on prior local and docetaxel treatment, disease volume, and risk. Treatment benefits were observed with enzalutamide plus ADT in multiple secondary clinical endpoints in the overall population and all subgroups.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide plus ADT demonstrated clinical benefit across all patients with mHSPC, irrespective of prior local and systemic treatment, disease volume, and risk.

### Safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel: expanded access in north America [^111y8gCp]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The open-label, single-arm enzalutamide expanded access program (EAP) in the United States and Canada evaluated the safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had previously received docetaxel.

Methods

Patients (n = 507) received enzalutamide 160mg/day until disease progression, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or commercial availability occurred. AEs and other safety variables were assessed on day 1, weeks 4 and 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Data following transition to commercial drug were not collected.

Results

Median age was 71 years (range 43–97); 426 patients (83.9%) had a baseline ECOG score of ≤ 1. In addition to docetaxel, the majority of patients had received prior prostate cancer treatments such as abiraterone (76.1%) or cabazitaxel (28.6%). Median study treatment duration was 2.6 months (range 0.03–9.07). The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation were commercial availability of enzalutamide (46.7%) and progressive disease (33.7%). A total of 88.2% of patients experienced AEs; 45.4% experienced AEs with a maximum grade of 1 or 2. Fatigue (39.1%), nausea (22.7%), and anorexia (14.8%) were the most commonly reported AEs. Seizure was reported in four patients (0.8%). The most commonly reported event leading to death was progression of metastatic prostate cancer (7.7%).

Conclusion

In this heavily pretreated EAP population with progressive mCRPC, enzalutamide was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with that of the AFFIRM trial.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of talazoparib plus enzalutamide and other first-line treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^11585yLi]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous NMAs have also compared the efficacy of treatments for chemotherapy-naïve patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCPRC; however, they were conducted at a time when trials evaluating novel PARP inhibitor therapies for mCRPC were in development and with a limited or narrower review; therefore, direct comparisons with our analysis are challenging. Given the recent advances in the treatment of 1L mCRPC, our NMA specifically provides data on the comparative efficacy and safety of newer therapies for key clinical endpoints commonly assessed in prostate cancer clinical trials.

A notable strength of this analysis was the rigorous qualitative assessment of cross-trial heterogeneity conducted a priori and supported by clinical opinion. To ensure the underlying assumptions of the analysis were systematically explored and the risks and benefits of indirectly comparing treatment effects are clear and transparent, the similarity of included studies identified by the SLR was assessed. In the absence of international guidelines on how to assess similarity in this context, guidance on best practice, for the conduct of indirect treatment comparisons was leveraged. Our strict adherence to the population of first-line asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ensured greater certainty in the treatment effect estimates — other NMAs incorporated trials with mixed populations including patients who were not truly treatment naïve for mCRPC, or they were more symptomatic in terms of pain. Although adherence to the strict eligibility criteria is certainly a strength of the current analysis in efforts to create a more homogenous population, we acknowledge that it may not reflect real-world heterogeneity in clinical practice. All relevant comparators for TALA + ENZA were included in the analysis, and this reflects approved and expected therapies for the treatment of first-line mCRPC up to now. Furthermore, with the inclusion of the PARPi — talazoparib and olaparib, this analysis reflects the most contemporary treatment landscape. We acknowledge that that at the time of writing the more likely "effective" regimens (as determined by our analysis) may not be readily available in certain jurisdictions and this must be considered when interpreting these results; however, this manuscript may serve as the impetus for reimbursement/policy change in those markets with the understanding that market authorization/approval and reimbursement is multifactorial. Despite the approval of TALA + ENZA as an initial treatment for patients with mCRPC with DNA repair gene alterations by the United States Food and Drug Administration, we elected to perform the NMAs with patients included in Cohort 1 of TALAPRO-2 (ie, all-comers), irrespective of HRR status, because the proportion of patients with HRR alterations was unknown in all the other included trials. Finally, each NMA was conducted in accordance with the methodology recommended by NICE to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Methods

Approximately 1200 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus placebo. Treatment will be stratified per prior abiraterone acetate treatment (yes/no), metastases (bone only/liver/other), and prior docetaxel treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (yes/no). Adults (≥ 18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer and mCRPC who experienced biochemical or radiographic progression are eligible. Patients who received chemotherapy for mCRPC, checkpoint inhibition, or any treatment with a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (eg, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide) are excluded. Patients intolerant of or experiencing progression with prior abiraterone acetate therapy are included. Patients must have ECOG PS 0/1, adequate organ function, and tissue for biomarker analysis. Responses will be assessed by CT/MRI and radionuclide bone imaging per PCWG-modified RECIST v1.1 every 9 weeks during the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment will continue with enzalutamide plus pembrolizumab/placebo until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal, with a maximum of 2 years of treatment for the pembrolizumab/placebo component of the combination. Dual primary end points are overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. The key secondary efficacy end point is time to subsequent anticancer therapy or death. Additional secondary end points include objective response rate, duration of response, prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate, PSA-undetectable rate, time to PSA progression, time to pain progression, and time to radiographic soft tissue progression. Safety and tolerability will also be reported.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112ATksM]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Enzalutamide was the first second-generation ARTA to receive FDA approval and is now approved in combination with ADT for the treatment of castration-resistant PCa, regardless of the presence of metastases, and as first-line therapy in mCSPC. A growing number of studies have examined the effectiveness and safety of enzalutamide when used in earlier stage of the disease. In this systematic review, we summarize the use of enzalutamide in non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

Conventionally, enzalutamide is used in addition to ADT, in populations where ADT alone or in combination with RT would be the SOC. The idea is to reinforce the systemic treatment, a strategy which has been conducted in other settings resulting in better oncological outcomes. In the primary setting, this idea is particularly relevant for high-risk and very high-risk PCa patients treated with a combination of long-term ADT and RT. Attard et al. changed the SOC treatment for this group of patient with the results of the STAMPEDE trial and now the addition of abiraterone to ADT is recommended for N0 patients with high risk features or N1 patients. We expect to have the same benefit demonstrated in the ENZARAD trial (NCT02446444) with the addition of enzalutamide to long-term ADT and RT for this group of patients.

### Long-term safety and antitumor activity in the phase 1–2 study of enzalutamide in pre-and post-docetaxel castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1127ufFt]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Given that some patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have shown extended responses to the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide, long-term safety of this drug is of interest.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term safety and antitumor activity of enzalutamide in CRPC patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 1–2 study evaluated enzalutamide in 140 CRPC patients with and without prior chemotherapy. Initial findings were published in 2010. We report updated results from an additional 17-mo follow-up for antitumor activity and > 4 yr for safety.

Intervention

Patients received 30-600mg/d oral enzalutamide. During long-term dosing, all patients were switched first to the maximum tolerated dose of 240mg/d and then to the phase 3 dose of 160mg/d.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Safety was assessed regularly. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distributions of time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and time to radiographic progression.

Results and Limitations

The safety profile of enzalutamide was consistent over time, with little change in the rates of commonly reported adverse events (AEs) or the incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. Fatigue of any grade was the most common dose-dependent AE, experienced by 70% of patients, with 14% of patients reporting grade 3/4 fatigue. The median time to PSA progression was not reached for chemotherapy-naive patients and was 45 wk for postchemotherapy patients; the corresponding median time to radiographic progression was 56 wk and 25 wk.

Conclusions

Enzalutamide showed durable antitumor activity in chemotherapy-naive and postchemotherapy patients, and was well tolerated, even in patients treated for 4 yr.

Patient Summary

Enzalutamide was active against prostate cancer and was well tolerated, even for up to 4 yr of treatment, supporting its potential for long-term use in men with prostate cancer. Fatigue was the most common side effect, occurring at varying degrees of severity in most patients.

### Efficacy and safety of enzalutamide (ENZA) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with abiraterone acetate (abi): a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study… [^116HibEu]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Methods: All pts maintained castration therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone for the duration of the trial or had a bilateral orchiectomy. Pts were required to have progressive disease at study entry and ≥ 24 weeks of Abi treatment prior to receiving 160 mg/day ENZA. Prior chemotherapy was allowed. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival. The secondary end points were overall survival, prostate-specific antigen response, and time to PSA progression. Safety was also assessed. Results: A total of215 pts were enrolled; 214 were treated with ENZA. The analysis was performed on data up to 48 weeks after the last pt started ENZA treatment. Median duration of prior Abi therapy was 54 weeks. The median duration of ENZA treatment was 5. 7 months: 12 months in PSA responders and
4. 6 months in non-PSA responders. 16% of pts received treatment for ≥ 1 year.

The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression. Median rPFS was 8. 1 months. Median OS was not reached in the overall population and 75% of pts were alive 1 year after treatment initiation. PSA response rate was 26. 5%. The median time to PSA progression was 5. 7 months. The overall objective response rate in pts with measurable disease at study entry was 12%. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were fatigue, decreased appetite, asthenia, back pain, and arthralgia. ENZA was primarily discontinued due to TEAEs in 8% of pts. No seizures were reported. Conclusions: In this study, ENZA remained active in pts with mCRPC previously treated with Abi. Median rPFS in pts with prior chemotherapy was consistent with previously reported data of ENZA in pts with mCRPC and prior chemotherapy/Abi therapy.

Reported TEAEs were consistent with the known safety profile of ENZA. Clinical trial information: NCT02116582.

### Comparison of systemic treatments for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114bjDeN]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Multiple systemic treatments are available for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), with unclear comparative effectiveness and safety and widely varied costs.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety determined in randomized clinical trials of systemic treatments for mCSPC.

Data Sources

Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central), regulatory documents (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency), and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and European Union clinical trials register) were searched from inception through November 5, 2019.

Study Selection, Data Extraction, and Synthesis

Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials evaluating the addition of docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, apalutamide, or enzalutamide to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of mCSPC. Two investigators independently performed screening. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. A Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess trial quality. Relative effects of competing treatments were assessed by bayesian network meta-analysis and survival models. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was used.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Results

Seven trials with 7287 patients comparing 6 treatments (abiraterone acetate, apalutamide, docetaxel, enzalutamide, standard nonsteroidal antiandrogen, and placebo/no treatment) were identified. Ordered from the most to the least effective determined by results of clinical trials, treatments associated with improved overall survival when added to ADT included abiraterone acetate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% credible interval [CI] 0.54–0.70), apalutamide (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89), and docetaxel (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.89); treatments associated with improved radiographic progression-free survival when added to ADT included enzalutamide (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50), apalutamide (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.60), abiraterone acetate (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45–0.58), and docetaxel (HR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60–0.74). Docetaxel was associated with substantially increased SAEs (odds ratio, 23.72; 95% CI, 13.37–45.15), abiraterone acetate with slightly increased SAEs (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.10–1.83), and other treatments with no significant increase in SAEs. Risk of bias was noted for 4 trials with open-label design, 3 trials with missing data, and 2 trials with potential unprespecified analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis, as add-on treatments to ADT, abiraterone acetate and apalutamide may provide the largest overall survival benefits with relatively low SAE risks. Although enzalutamide may improve radiographic progression-free survival to the greatest extent, longer follow-up is needed to examine the overall survival benefits associated with enzalutamide.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112wrQPC]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our results highlight the different therapeutic strategies trying to involve enzalutamide at an earlier stage of Pca treatment. In the nmCSPC setting, using enzalutamide instead of ADT or in combination with ADT to intensify systemic treatment are 2 options that are currently investigated. For the first option using enzalutamide instead of ADT, the equivalence or superior efficacy of enzalutamide compared to ADT still needs to be demonstrated. Moreover, the toxicity of enzalutamide may not be lower than that of ADT but just different. For the second option, adding enzalutamide to ADT in order to intensify the systemic treatment should be reserved for very high-risk PCa patients, as per the STAMPEDE population, or relapsing disease following primary treatment with high-risk features including high PSA level at relapse and short PSADT. ARPIs have drastically changed the treatment landscape of mCSPC and both metastatic and nmCRPC. Their incorporation earlier on in the disease stage was just a matter of time and STAMPEDE and EMBARK trials are for now the most successful examples in this regard. However, one must be very careful about the risk of overtreatment given the unnecessary toxicity it brings to patients. In the metastatic setting, de-intensification is currently being studied, notably with the EORTC-2238 GUCG (De-ESCALATE) NCT05974774, revisiting the concept of intermittent ADT in patients achieving a good PSA response after 6–12 months of ADT and one of the ARPIs. To avoid de-intensification trials in the non-metastatic setting, indications for treatment intensification should be carefully thought. Several studies are ongoing or have been recently completed further investigating the efficacy and safety of Enzalutamide in the definitive or salvage setting (Table 2). The results of these studies will further inform clinical practice in the next decade.

### The efficacy of enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a post hoc analysis of ARCHES [^114tDD9V]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Few phase 3 studies have evaluated optimal systemic treatment strategies for patients with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), who may be at risk of undertreatment.

Objective

To evaluate outcomes for patients with oligometastatic and polymetastatic HSPC treated with enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus ADT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of data for 927 patients with nonvisceral metastatic HSPC in the ARCHES trial (NCT02677896).

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/d orally) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT with HSPC categorized as oligometastatic (1–5 metastases) or polymetastatic (≥ 6 metastases).

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The treatment effect on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and secondary efficacy endpoints was evaluated in terms of the number of metastases. Safety was assessed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs). The Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to generate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for Kaplan-Meier median values.

Results and Limitations

Enzalutamide plus ADT improved rPFS (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16–0.46; p < 0.001), OS (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40–0.87; p < 0.005), and secondary endpoints in patients with oligometastatic or polymetastatic disease (rPFS: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23–0.46; p < 0.001; OS: HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41–0.74; p < 0.001). Safety profiles were generally similar across subgroups. Limitations include the small numbers of patients with fewer than three metastases.

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis demonstrated the utility of enzalutamide, irrespective of metastatic burden or type of oligometastatic disease, and suggests that earlier treatment intensification with systemic potent androgen receptor inhibition is advantageous.

Patient Summary

This study considered two treatment options for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in patients with one to five metastases or six or more metastases. Treatment with enzalutamide plus ADT improved survival and other outcomes over ADT alone, whether patients had few or many metastases.

### Enzalutamide and prostate-specific antigen levels in metastatic prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of the ARCHES randomized clinical trial [^113koQjY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

End Points

The association of enzalutamide plus ADT vs placebo plus ADT with clinical end points was examined in patients with prior ADT and differing PSA categories at study enrollment (≤ 0.2, > 0.2–4, or > 4 ng/mL), as specified in the phase 3 SWOG-9346 trial (eFigure 1A in Supplement 2).PSA categories were determined using PSA values recorded before randomization and enzalutamide or placebo treatment, but not before ADT. The clinical end points assessed, based on PSA categories, were rPFS, OS, and time to PSA progression, castration resistance, first symptomatic skeletal event, initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, and quality of life (QOL) deterioration. rPFS and OS were compared in patients with detectable baseline PSA levels before enzalutamide or placebo treatment by PSA decline to below 0.2 ng/mL, 0.2 to 4 ng/mL, or above 4 ng/mL at 6 months (eFigure 1B in Supplement 2) or to undetectable levels (< 0.2 ng/mL) at any time during study treatment (eFigure 1C in Supplement 2). For PSA decline at 6 months and undetectable PSA at any time during study treatment, a PSA level below 0.2 ng/mL was selected based on the ARCHES trial definition of decline to undetectable PSA (a key secondary end point), in alignment with other studies. The PSA undetectable level was defined similarly to the EMBARK, LATITUDE, and ARASENS trials, which set PSA levels below 0.2 ng/mL as the threshold for PSA decline or undetectable PSA. Time to QOL deterioration based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Prostate total score was evaluated in patients who did and did not achieve undetectable PSA. Timing of PSA decline to below 0.2 ng/mL, 0.2 to 4 ng/mL, or above 4 ng/mL was assessed. Radiographic imaging was performed at screening, at week 13, and every subsequent 12 weeks. PSA levels were measured at screening, at weeks 1, 5, and 13, and every subsequent 12 weeks, with a final measurement 30 days after the last dose of study drug or prior to initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurred first. Safety was evaluated by baseline PSA categories, PSA decline, and PSA decline to undetectable levels via treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adjusted for patient-year exposure, and graded with version 4.03 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of talazoparib plus enzalutamide and other first-line treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^11466idV]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Talazoparib plus enzalutamide (TALA+ENZA) has demonstrated antitumor activity in the phase 3 clinical trial (TALAPRO-2; NCT03395197) as first-line (1L) therapy in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Although many active interventions are available, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving talazoparib have only been conducted to assess its efficacy and safety compared to enzalutamide. To estimate comparisons between all relevant interventions, indirect comparisons are needed.

Objective

To estimate the comparative efficacy and safety of TALA+ENZA in 1L patients with mCRPC by conducting a systematic literature review and network meta-analyses (NMAs).

Methods

Databases were searched using Ovid, along with several gray literature sources to identify RCTs evaluating treatments in 1L mCRPC (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021283512). Feasibility assessment evaluated trial suitability for NMA inclusion and Bayesian or frequentist NMAs were conducted for evaluable efficacy and safety outcomes, respectively.

Results

Thirty-three RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were feasible for NMAs. Across multiple efficacy outcomes assessed, except for overall survival (OS), TALA+ENZA was ranked the most efficacious treatment. For OS, TALA+ENZA showed the second-highest probability of being the most effective treatment; second to docetaxel 50 mg plus prednisolone 10 mg. With respect to safety outcomes, TALA+ENZA, in general, showed increased rates of hematological adverse events.

Conclusions

TALA+ENZA showed favorable results across multiple efficacy endpoints, but not across hematological toxicities compared with other 1L treatments in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC in the all-comers patient population.

### Health-related quality of life in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: ENZAMET (ANZUP 1304), an international, randomized phase III trial led by ANZUP [^115grSS8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

HRQL data were extracted from the study database on December 31, 2019, with a cutoff date of February 28, 2019, to match our first reported analysis of overall survival.

HRQL was reported by 1,042 of 1,125 (93%) participants. Baseline characteristics were similar among those randomly assigned enzalutamide versus control (Table 1) and among those who did and did not report HRQL (Data Supplement, online only). Scores for aspects of HRQL at baseline were similar among those assigned enzalutamide versus control (Table 2). Characteristics associated with worse OHQL at baseline included impaired ECOG performance status, metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, and high-volume disease, but not planned use of early chemotherapy with docetaxel or age 70 years and older (Table 3).

The median follow-up time was 34 months. The proportions of HRQL assessments expected that were received ranged from 93% at 4 weeks to 86% at 156 weeks (Data Supplement).

HRQL Over Time

Mean scores for aspects of HRQL by the randomly assigned treatment group are shown for each assessment point, and overall, in Figure 1 and the Data Supplement. OHQL differed little between men randomly assigned to enzalutamide versus control (overall means 72 v 73, difference 1.2, 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.7; P = 0.10). Scores at 12 weeks deteriorated to a greater extent in the enzalutamide group than controls (means 70 v 72, difference 1.9, 95% CI, −0.1 to 4.0; P = 0.07) and thereafter remained relatively stable.

### Phase I / II trial of enzalutamide and mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1154JP2S]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors are effective in metastatic prostate cancer, resistance occurs in most patients. This phase I/II trial assessed the safety, pharmacokinetic impact, and efficacy of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone in combination with enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Patients and Methods

One hundred and six patients with CRPC were accrued. Phase I subjects were treated with enzalutamide monotherapy at 160 mg per day for 28 days to allow steady-state accumulation. Patients then entered the dose escalation combination portion of the study. In phase II, patients were randomized 1:1 to either receive enzalutamide alone or enzalutamide plus mifepristone. The primary endpoint was PSA progression-free survival (PFS), with radiographic PFS, and PSA response rate (RR) as key secondary endpoints. Circulating tumor cells were collected before randomization for exploratory translational biomarker studies.

Results

We determined a 25% dose reduction in enzalutamide, when added to mifepristone, resulted in equivalent drug levels compared with full-dose enzalutamide and was well tolerated. However, the addition of mifepristone to enzalutamide following a 12-week enzalutamide lead-in did not delay time to PSA, radiographic or clinical PFS. The trial was terminated early due to futility.

Conclusions

This is the first prospective trial of dual AR-GR antagonism in CRPC. Enzalutamide combined with mifepristone was safe and well tolerated but did not meet its primary endpoint. The development of more specific GR antagonists combined with AR antagonists, potentially studied in an earlier disease state, should be explored.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of talazoparib plus enzalutamide and other first-line treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^111Jr45H]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

New treatment options continue to emerge for patients with mCRPC; hence, there is a need to disseminate clinical efficacy and safety knowledge constantly and rapidly to help individuals make up-to-date and well-informed healthcare decisions. Here, we used NMA to synthesize the current treatment landscape for 1L patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC and incorporated recently introduced treatments to gain a comprehensive and contemporary view of the comparative efficacy and safety of these drugs. Our results demonstrated that TALA + ENZA offers a therapeutic benefit over other 1L treatments approved or expected to be approved across multiple clinical endpoints, indicating its therapeutic potential in the all-comers patient population.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of talazoparib plus enzalutamide and other first-line treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [^1176a8bM]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Literature search

The searches identified 48 unique RCTs that fulfilled the eligibility criteria after full-text review and removal of duplicates. After the exclusion of studies without published data at the time of the last update, a total of 38 unique RCTs remained (Supplementary Appendix E — Supplementary Figures S17 - 19).

Data for TALA + ENZA was provided by Pfizer at the time of review given the efficacy and safety of TALA + ENZA were still being evaluated. Since the last SLR update (October 2022), results for the TALAPRO-2 trial have been published (DCO: 16/08/22). Updated OS data (DCO: 28/03/23) used in the present analysis were provided by Pfizer. Thus, a total of 39 unique RCTs were considered for NMAs and were the primary focus of this analysis.

Of the 39 included trials, 30 RCTs with available full-text publications were assessed for study quality. Several trials did not report the full details of randomization, concealment, and blinding, and so the risk was unclear. Reporting of randomization, allocation, blinding, analysis, and interpretation of results were of moderate quality (Supplementary Appendix F — Supplementary Table S5).

Feasibility assessment

Six trials were excluded after the feasibility assessment and supported by clinical opinion. MAGNITUDE permitted patients that were not treatment naïve in the mCRPC disease stage that is, allowed patients to receive 4 months or less of abiraterone acetate therapy and reported data only for a cohort of HRR biomarker positive (BM+) patients; therefore, it was considered inappropriate to include MAGNITUDE in any outcome network because all other trials in the evidence base evaluated an all-comers population. Five additional trials were excluded from all analyses due to failure to connect to any of the main outcome networks. Although there were some differences in methodology and patient populations, the remaining 33 trials were deemed sufficiently similar to derive reasonable estimates of comparative efficacy and safety (Table 1). For additional details, see Supplementary Appendix G and H. A sensitivity analysis was conducted whereby the PROSTY trial evaluating docetaxel 50 mg/m² every 2 weeks was removed from the evidence base. This dose is reserved for frail patients with comorbidities in whom larger doses of docetaxel (ie, 75 mg/m²) are intolerable. For additional details, see Supplementary Appendix L.

### Addition of enzalutamide to leuprolide and definitive radiation therapy is tolerable and effective in high-risk localized or regional nonmetastatic prostate cancer: results from a phase 2 trial [^114kS71B]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Most common side effects of the therapeutic regimen reported in this study include erectile dysfunction, myalgias, and hot flashes, which are all well-characterized toxicities of ADT. In our study, the rate of grade 3 adverse events was 36%, which compares to 49% in the ENZAMET trial and 24.3% in the ARCHES trial, 2 commonly cited phase 3 randomized controlled trials of ADT and enzalutamide. Two patients terminated treatment due to ADT-related adverse effects, which is roughly in line with the 6% and 7.2% proportion of patients who terminated enzalutamide with ADT treatment in the ENZAMET and ARCHES trials, respectively. Urinary symptoms such as frequency and urgency were also described in our cohort, known toxicities associated with pelvic radiation therapy. One patient in the cohort developed seizures, subsequently leading to discontinuation of enzalutamide. Despite the negative workup and determination that the event to be unlikely related to the study drug, a direct relationship between the reported seizure and the study treatment cannot be excluded. Seizures are a known side effect of enzalutamide therapy, and has been identified as the most common adverse reaction leading to study treatment discontinuation with reported incidence of 0.6 to 0.9%. The UPWARD study recently showed that enzalutamide did not increase seizure incidence in men with pre-existing seizure risk factors, suggesting safety of use for PCa treatment in these cohorts. Overall, the AE profiles of the addition of enzalutamide to ADT and RT were in line with a priori expectations; furthermore, at 12 months and 24 months of follow-up, patients demonstrated significant improvements in subjective reporting of their health state, further suggesting long-term tolerability of the treatment regimen.

Enzalutamide in M0 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) — Metastasis-free survival over placebo was 36.6 months vs. 14.7 months (HR for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24–0.35; P < .0001), and median overall survival was 67.0 months vs. 56.3 months (HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89; P = 0.001); adverse events included fatigue (33% vs. 14%), hypertension (12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%). The Panel states patients with M0 CRPC can be offered enzalutamide if prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) is less than or equal to 10 months (category 1, preferred option), and patients receiving enzalutamide have no restrictions for food intake and concurrent prednisone is permitted but not required.

### Enzalutamide and prostate-specific antigen levels in metastatic prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of the ARCHES randomized clinical trial [^114dT2jH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

In men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after treatment has been associated with improved survival. However, the data on PSA decline are limited in men with mHSPC after treatment with enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Objective

To evaluate the association of enzalutamide plus ADT in men with mHSPC by PSA level at study enrollment in individuals with prior ADT and by degree of PSA reduction with clinical end points.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc secondary analysis was performed on data collected from the ARCHES multinational, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial. In the ARCHES trial, men with mHSPC were randomized between March 21, 2016, and January 12, 2018. Analyses were performed in October 2018 (median follow-up, 14.4 months; IQR, 11.2–17.7 months) and May 2021 (median follow-up, 44.6 months; IQR, 41.3–48.6 months).

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/d) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT. ADT received for 3 to 6 months before study enrollment was permitted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were correlated post hoc with PSA level at enrollment in patients with prior ADT and additionally with PSA decline at 6 months or undetectable PSA (< 0.2 ng/mL) during study treatment.

Results

A total of 1150 men (median age, 70 years; range, 46–92 years) were enrolled. Improvement in clinical outcomes such as rPFS was seen with enzalutamide plus ADT in men with PSA levels at enrollment of 0.2 to 4 ng/mL and above 4 ng/mL. Hazard ratios (HRs) for improved rPFS in men with PSA levels up to 0.2 ng/mL, above 0.2 to 4 ng/mL, and above 4 ng/mL were 0.59 (95% CI, 0.27–1.30), 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20–0.50), and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.32–0.62), respectively. Patients treated with enzalutamide plus ADT who achieved undetectable PSA had an 86.0% reduced risk of radiographic disease progression (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.09–0.23]; P < .001) and a 76.0% reduced risk of death (HR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.17–0.34]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, patients with mHSPC treated with enzalutamide plus ADT vs placebo plus ADT had improved clinical outcomes regardless of PSA level at enrollment. Undetectable PSA was associated with improved clinical outcomes with enzalutamide treatment. Future studies are required to further characterize the clinical utility of further treatment intensification among men with mHSPC for whom ADT plus enzalutamide fails to achieve undetectable PSA.

Background

Enzalutamide and lutetium-177 [177 Lu]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 both improve overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Androgen and PSMA receptors have a close intracellular relationship, with data suggesting complementary benefit if targeted concurrently. In this study, we assessed the activity and safety of enzalutamide plus adaptive-dosed [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 versus enzalutamide alone as first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods

ENZA-p was an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 trial done at 15 hospitals in Australia. Participants were men aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer not previously treated with docetaxel or androgen receptor pathway inhibitors for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, gallium-68 [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-PET-CT (PSMA-PET-CT) positive disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and at least two risk factors for early progression on enzalutamide. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised, web-based system using minimisation with a random component to stratify for study site, disease burden, use of early docetaxel, and previous treatment with abiraterone acetate. Patients were either given oral enzalutamide 160 mg daily alone or with adaptive-dosed (two or four doses) intravenous 7.5 GBq [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 every 6–8 weeks dependent on an interim PSMA-PET-CT (week 12). The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival, defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of PSA progression, commencement of non-protocol anticancer therapy, or death. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population, using stratified Cox proportional hazards regression. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04419402, and participant follow-up is ongoing.

Findings

162 participants were randomly assigned between Aug 17, 2020, and July 26, 2022. 83 men were assigned to the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group, and 79 were assigned to the enzalutamide group. Median follow-up in this interim analysis was 20 months (IQR 18–21), with 32 (39%) of 83 patients in the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 16 (20%) of 79 patients in the enzalutamide group remaining on treatment at the data cutoff date. Median age was 71 years (IQR 64–76). Median PSA progression-free survival was 13.0 months (95% CI 11.0–17.0) in the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 7.8 months (95% CI 4.3–11.0) in the enzalutamide group (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.29–0.63, p < 0.0001). The most common adverse events (all grades) were fatigue (61 [75%] of 81 patients), nausea (38 [47%]), and dry mouth (32 [40%]) in the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and fatigue (55 [70%] of 79), nausea (21 [27%]), and constipation (18 [23%]) in the enzalutamide group. Grade 3–5 adverse events occurred in 32 (40%) of 81 patients in the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 32 (41%) of 79 patients in the enzalutamide group. Grade 3 events that occurred only in the enzalutamide plus [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group included anaemia (three [4%] of 81 participants) and decreased platelet count (one [1%] participant). No grade 4 or 5 events were attributed to treatment on central review in either group.

Interpretation

The addition of [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 to enzalutamide improved PSA progression-free survival providing evidence of enhanced anticancer activity in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with risk factors for early progression on enzalutamide and warrants further evaluation of the combination more broadly in metastatic prostate cancer.

### Role of enzalutamide in primary and recurrent non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials [^112ajPPp]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

As Monotherapy or in combination with ADT

According to the EAU guidelines, ADT may be offered to patients as monotherapy in selected cases with BCR. Intensification of ADT with enzalutamide or replacement of ADT by enzalutamide are 2 pathways that are currently investigated in this setting:
Tombal et al. were the first to investigate enzalutamide monotherapy as the front-line treatment in patients with localized PCa and mCSPC. In a phase 2 multicenter open label single arm study, 67 patients (35 M0, 10 M1, and 22 Mx) received enzalutamide monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. To assess the efficacy of enzalutamide, they used PSA response defined as 80% PSA drop over pretreatment values. Of the 42 patients who remained on enzalutamide up to the 3-year visit, 38 (90.5%) maintained a PSA response. At 3 years, there was a small decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) compared to baseline, lower than the mean BMD decrease reported for long-term ADT. Nine out of 67 patients (13.4%) had adverse events possibly related to enzalutamide which led to enzalutamide discontinuation during or after 3 years. Gynecomastia and fatigue were the 2 most frequent adverse events (49.3% and 38.8% respectively, all grades). During the 3 years, grade ≥ 3 toxicity was reported in 34% of patients. The open label single arm design and the small and heterogenous study population are among the limitations of this study. However, it provided rationale for further investigation of enzalutamide monotherapy in the nmCSPC setting, which was subsequently carried out with the EMBARK trial.
The EMBARK trial included 1068 patients with high-risk BCR (PSA doubling time (PSADT) ≤ 9 months) after local treatment and no evidence of distant metastases on conventional imaging. Patients were randomized between ADT, ADT plus enzalutamide, and enzalutamide alone. In this trial, after a median follow-up of 60.7 months, enzalutamide + ADT demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 5-year MFS versus ADT + placebo (87.3% vs 71.4%, HR, 0.42; 95% CI: 0.31–0.61; P < 0.0001). Interestingly, enzalutamide monotherapy also significantly improves MFS versus ADT (HR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46−0.87; P = 0.0049). Of all patients, 164 (46.5%) patients experienced a grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the combination arm, versus 151 (42.7%) in the ADT + placebo arm, and 177 (50.0%) in the enzalutamide alone arm. More patients experienced gynecomastia in the enzalutamide monotherapy arm than in the ADT ± enzalutamide arms. In conclusion, enzalutamide, either alone or in combination with ADT, may be beneficial for high-risk BCR patients without metastasis. However, it's important to note that the Embark study only utilized conventional imaging, leaving the effectiveness of PSMA PET/CT unaddressed, despite its emerging role in detecting prostate cancer recurrence, even in low levels of PSA.

Material and methods

Systematic literature search

Implementation and reporting of the systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Literature Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The review protocol was developed in accordance with the PRISMA for systematic review protocols (PRISMA-P) statement, and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews a priori (registration number: CRD42021283512). Additional SLR material and methods, including the search strategy (Supplementary Table S1), Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study design (PICOS) criteria (Supplementary Table S2), the sources searched (Supplementary Figure S1) and a list of excluded studies (Supplementary Table S3) are provided in Supplementary Appendix A.

Feasibility assessment

The validity of results generated by NMAs based on summary-level published data is dependent on the evidence meeting the exchangeability assumption. Under this assumption, all interventions being studied could have been included as comparators in a clinical trial. Failure to meet this assumption can result in biased estimates of comparative effect. As such, a rigorous qualitative assessment of between-trial heterogeneity was conducted on the data from all relevant studies identified from the systematic review based on published recommendations regarding the assessment of NMA feasibility. If studies were sufficiently similar in terms of patient populations, outcomes assessed, interventions, comparators, and whether they contributed to a connected network, we conducted NMAs where feasible. Networks were developed, considering the available data, similarity of trials and outcome measures. Networks were presented as diagrams that depict treatments as nodes and individual studies as links (Supplementary Appendix B — Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Appendix C — Supplementary Figures S2 - 16).

Outcomes

Outcomes assessed in this analysis included rPFS, overall survival (OS), time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy initiation, PSA response, and objective response rate (ORR). Based on clinical opinion, 5 adverse events (AE) of special interest (AESI) were assessed in this analysis: anemia, asthenia, fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite. Both all grade and grade ≥ 3 AESIs were assessed.

Prostate cancer — enzalutamide safety and regulatory status in mCSPC indicate category 1 endorsement and FDA approval. The safety profile in these mCSPC trials was similar to prior castration‑resistant settings, with adverse events including fatigue, seizures, and hypertension. Enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with mCSPC, and the FDA approved this indication in December 2019.

### Overall survival and adverse events after treatment with darolutamide vs. apalutamide vs. enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113r5YGX]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on statistical criteria, three prospective randomized controlled trials (RCT) testing apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide, have demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit for each of the three androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies (ARAT), relative to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Based on less mature follow-up than currently available, the findings of these three RCTs have been compared within five previous network meta-analyses (NMA). Of those, four addressed OS. Specifically, they relied on 18-month median follow-up for darolutamide, 20-month median follow-up for apalutamide, and up to 48-month median follow-up for enzalutamide. However, the most recent updates provide 52-month median follow-up for apalutamide, 48 median months for enzalutamide, and the 28-month median follow-up for darolutamide. These most current and most mature data have not been used to compare OS and/or adverse events (AE) related to the use of the three ARATs, relative to ADT.

We addressed this void. Specifically, we relied on the NMA methodology with a primary focus on OS and with a secondary focus on AEs. In addition to relying on more mature follow-up for apalutamide and darolutamide, we also provide subgroup analyses according to PSA-doubling time (PSA-DT): ≤ 6 vs. 6–10 months. We hypothesized that with longer follow-up, more robust OS and AE data may result in equally more robust NMA-based indirect comparisons.

### Enzalutamide offers survival advantage over other NSAAs in mHSPC… [^113mD5f7]. ASCO Daily News (2019). Medium credibility.

ENZAMET adds to that body of evidence, although it is the first trial to examine the use of enzalutamide with or without concurrent docetaxel; 45% of patients in the enzalutamide group and 44% in the NSAA group received docetaxel, and 61% of those patients had a high volume of metastases. The men were followed for a median of 34 months. At 36 months, 80% of the enzalutamide group remained alive, compared with 72% of the NSAA group. Enzalutamide also resulted in a significant increase in the time to prostate-specific antigen rise, clinical progression, or death. The overall survival difference was seen specifically in men who did not receive docetaxel, but there was no significant difference among those who did.

The 3-year overall survival rate in those who did receive docetaxel was 74% with enzalutamide and 75% with other NSAAs; in those who did not receive docetaxel, those rates were 83% with enzalutamide and 70% without it. Dr. Sweeney said the toxicity profile was similar to previous reports with enzalutamide. The rate of serious adverse events per year of therapy exposure was similar between the groups. There was more grade 3 fatigue with enzalutamide versus NSAA, as well as more grade 3 syncope and grade 3 hypertension. Seven patients in the enzalutamide group experienced seizures, compared to none in the NSAA group. ASCO Expert Neeraj Agarwal, MD, of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, called the overall survival difference "remarkable" and said during a press briefing on June 2 that the study increases his confidence that targeting AR is likely the best approach in this setting.

"In my view, using enzalutamide early on will allow our patients to avoid chemotherapy and steroids for many years, thus hopefully improving their quality of life, " he said.
