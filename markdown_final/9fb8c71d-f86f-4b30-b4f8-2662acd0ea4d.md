## Question

Standard of care for massive PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the standard of care for massive pulmonary embolism, with key decision points and supporting sources [^114JRg3J] [^114prENX].

> Definition and initial risk stratification hinge on identifying high-risk (massive) PE by hemodynamic instability, including cardiac arrest, obstructive shock, or persistent hypotension not explained by other causes, which distinguishes it from intermediate-risk disease that lacks hypotension but shows right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial injury [^114JRg3J] [^114uWAeu].

> Rapid diagnostic confirmation proceeds in parallel with resuscitation; obtain bedside echocardiography to assess right ventricular dysfunction when unstable and proceed to emergent CT pulmonary angiography if feasible and safe, using local logistics and patient stability to decide sequencing [^111m2sux] [^112kKbjQ].

> Activate a multidisciplinary Pulmonary Embolism Response Team early to coordinate anticoagulation, reperfusion options, and potential mechanical circulatory support, integrating interventional radiology and cardiothoracic surgery, and engaging ECMO teams when shock or arrest is present [^112y1Syc] [^116Ektde] [^111VuH9i].

> Immediate stabilization centers on prompt anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin unless contraindicated, vasopressors for persistent hypotension, conservative fluid strategy to avoid worsening right ventricular failure, and cautious ventilatory support to minimize adverse effects on venous return and right ventricular preload [^114prENX] [^117Kpbs7] [^111JDxM9].

> First-line reperfusion for massive PE is systemic thrombolysis when bleeding risk is acceptable, typically with alteplase 100 mg over 2 hours or weight-based dosing if under 65 kg, administered peripherally; tenecteplase is an alternative with similar 30-day mortality in observational data, though high-quality comparative PE RCTs remain limited [^113vYhaW] [^1148shYt] [^116EvZCT] [^112sYndE].

> Assess for absolute and relative contraindications to lysis and balance them against imminent mortality from massive PE; major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage risks are real, and specific predictors of hemorrhage have been described, yet case-based decisions may sometimes favor lysis despite strong relative or even formal absolute contraindications in extremis [^116EvZCT] [^1128ZbiK] [^112yoPay].

> If thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails to reverse instability, pursue urgent catheter-directed therapy or surgical pulmonary embolectomy based on local expertise and clot anatomy; surgical embolectomy is guideline-endorsed after failed or contraindicated lysis, while catheter-based approaches can debulk with lower systemic bleeding exposure, acknowledging that randomized comparative evidence remains limited [^114JRg3J] [^111CWynp] [^114szqgX].

> In refractory shock or during cardiac arrest, initiate venoarterial ECMO early as a bridge to definitive reperfusion or, in select cases, as temporizing or standalone therapy with anticoagulation to unload the right ventricle and restore oxygen delivery, with institutional protocols guiding initiation and weaning strategies [^117Pf3uV] [^112y1Syc] [^114vTqt6].

> An algorithmic approach typically emphasizes immediate anticoagulation and hemodynamic support, prompt consideration of systemic thrombolysis for massive PE, rapid escalation to catheter-based or surgical embolectomy when lysis is contraindicated or ineffective, and selective ECMO deployment in arrest or refractory shock, coordinated under PERT oversight to avoid delays [^114BcDd9] [^117Pf3uV] [^114JRg3J].

> After reperfusion or stabilization, continue therapeutic anticoagulation with transition to LMWH or DOACs when appropriate, evaluate right ventricular recovery, search for provoking factors including malignancy and thrombophilia, and reserve inferior vena cava filter placement for situations of acute VTE with absolute contraindication to anticoagulation rather than routine use [^114prENX] [^1129iTsj].

> The critical principles are early recognition of high-risk physiology, rapid and coordinated reperfusion within hours when instability is present, and disciplined multidisciplinary escalation across systemic thrombolysis, catheter-based therapy, surgery, and ECMO to match bleeding risk, response, and resource availability, as codified by major guidelines and contemporary expert frameworks [^114JRg3J] [^117Pf3uV] [^111CWynp].

---

The standard of care for massive PE is **immediate systemic thrombolysis** unless contraindicated, with initiation of **UFH** and escalation to catheter-directed therapy or surgical embolectomy if thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails [^114JRg3J] [^1148shYt]. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (**VA-ECMO**) is considered for refractory shock or cardiac arrest as a bridge to definitive therapy [^112y1Syc] [^117Pf3uV]. Early **PERT activation** and rapid **imaging** (CTPA or bedside echocardiography) are essential to guide timely intervention [^111VuH9i] [^111m2sux].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Rapid **diagnosis and risk stratification** are critical in massive PE [^111m2sux] [^112kKbjQ]. The following diagnostic steps are recommended:

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for signs of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest [^111m2sux].

- **Imaging**: Obtain bedside echocardiography or emergency computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to confirm the diagnosis and assess right ventricular (RV) dysfunction [^111m2sux] [^112kKbjQ].

- **Laboratory tests**: Measure cardiac biomarkers (troponin, BNP) to assess RV strain and myocardial injury [^111m2sux].

---

## Initial supportive management

Immediate **supportive measures** are essential to stabilize the patient. Interventions include supplemental oxygen to ensure adequate oxygenation, vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine) to maintain systemic perfusion, and consideration of intubation and mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure.

---

## Anticoagulation therapy

Initiate **anticoagulation** immediately upon suspicion or confirmation of massive PE [^1148shYt] [^114prENX]. Unfractionated heparin (**UFH**) is preferred because of its rapid onset and reversibility; administer an initial bolus of 80 U/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 18 U/kg/hour, adjusting to maintain a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Low molecular weight heparin (**LMWH**) is an alternative if UFH is contraindicated or unavailable.

---

## Systemic thrombolysis

The first-line reperfusion therapy for massive PE is **systemic thrombolysis** [^114JRg3J] [^114prENX]:

- **Indications**: Hemodynamic instability, shock, or cardiac arrest without contraindications to thrombolysis [^113vYhaW].

- **Agents and dosing**: Alteplase (rt-PA) 100 mg IV over 2 hours is the standard regimen [^116EvZCT].

- **Contraindications**: Recent major surgery, active bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or severe uncontrolled hypertension.

- **Outcomes**: Rapid clot dissolution, improved hemodynamics, and reduced mortality, but with increased risk of major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage [^111dAsX9].

---

## Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (**CDT**) is indicated when systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed [^114JRg3J] [^111CWynp]:

- **Techniques**: Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (USAT), mechanical thrombectomy, or aspiration thrombectomy [^114szqgX] [^117Bvcff].

- **Advantages**: Lower bleeding risk compared to systemic thrombolysis, rapid hemodynamic improvement, and effective clot removal [^111CWynp].

- **Limitations**: Requires specialized equipment and expertise, potential procedural complications [^116wA52s].

---

## Surgical embolectomy

Surgical **embolectomy** is reserved for patients with contraindications to or failure of thrombolysis, particularly with persistent hemodynamic instability. Key **indications** include massive PE with contraindications to thrombolysis, failed thrombolysis, or ongoing instability, and **Outcomes** include high success rates and rapid hemodynamic improvement; however, the procedure carries surgical risks and potential complications [^114JRg3J] [^116GEYyC].

---

## Mechanical circulatory support (VA-ECMO)

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (**VA-ECMO**) is considered for refractory shock, cardiac arrest, or severe RV failure despite maximal medical therapy. It provides hemodynamic support, oxygenation, and RV unloading and serves as a bridge to definitive therapy (thrombolysis, CDT, or surgery); however, it is invasive, resource-intensive, and associated with complications such as bleeding and infection [^117Pf3uV] [^112y1Syc].

---

## Multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT)

Pulmonary embolism response teams (**PERTs**) are essential for rapid decision-making and coordination of care, with a **Role** in rapid risk stratification, individualized treatment planning, and coordination of advanced therapies; associated **Outcomes** include improved time to diagnosis, reduced mortality, and optimized resource utilization [^111VuH9i] [^116Ektde].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

After the acute phase, patients require **long-term anticoagulation** and follow-up. Continue **anticoagulation** (warfarin, DOACs) for at least 3–6 months, individualized based on risk factors and recurrence risk. **Follow-up** involves regular clinical assessment, imaging, and monitoring for complications such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

## Summary of standard care for massive PE

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Anticoagulation (UFH) | All patients | Prevent clot propagation |
| 2 | Systemic thrombolysis | Hemodynamic instability, shock, cardiac arrest | Rapid clot dissolution, improved hemodynamics [^114prENX] [^113vYhaW] |
| 3 | CDT | Contraindications to thrombolysis or failed thrombolysis | Lower bleeding risk, effective clot removal [^111CWynp] |
| 4 | Surgical embolectomy | Contraindications to thrombolysis or failed thrombolysis | High success, rapid hemodynamic improvement [^114JRg3J] |
| 5 | VA-ECMO | Refractory shock or cardiac arrest | Hemodynamic support, bridge to definitive therapy [^117Pf3uV] |
| 6 | PERT | All cases | Rapid decision-making, improved outcomes [^111VuH9i] |

---

The **standard of care for massive PE** includes rapid diagnosis, immediate anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, and escalation to CDT or surgical embolectomy if needed. For refractory cases, use **VA-ECMO**, and **PERTs** coordinate care. Long-term anticoagulation and follow-up are essential to prevent recurrence and complications [^114JRg3J].

### Mechanical circulatory support for massive pulmonary embolism [^112y1Syc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

A multidisciplinary approach is often necessary to maneuver the intricate process of choosing treatment options for complex clinical problems such as PE. Hence, the creation of the PE response team (PERT) is essential. This specialized team, similar to rapid response teams designed for myocardial infarction or shock, involves multiple specialists in vascular medicine, cardiology, critical care, interventional radiology, and cardiothoracic or vascular surgery. It is activated in cases of massive PE to rapidly create an individualized treatment plan, ideally based on evidence-based protocols.

Although the PERT and ECMO teams focus on different aspects of critical care, they intersect during the treatment of patients with massive PE as the experience with VA-ECMO in this clinical setting expands. For example, in centers systematically using ECPR, patients with suspected massive PE in cardiopulmonary collapse or arrest should be referred to ECMO teams immediately during resuscitation. Upon stabilization or in patients not yet in circulatory collapse but with severe respiratory or cardiac failure, the PERT should consider collaborating with the ECMO team to determine if the patient would require ECMO support.

In patients suitable for ECMO support, the ECMO team assumes primary responsibility for the patient's care once the patient is placed on ECMO, especially if no other definitive treatment is being planned. The PERT remains involved in ensuring appropriate anticoagulation and managing any residual issues related to the PE.

### Pulmonary embolism response teams: Changing the paradigm in the care for acute pulmonary embolism [^116Ektde]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as a multidisciplinary, multispecialty team of experts in the care of highly complex symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE). With a centralized unique activation process, they provide rapid multimodality assessment and risk stratification, formulate the best individualized diagnostic and therapeutic approach, and streamline care in challenging clinical case scenarios (e.g. intermediate-high risk and high-risk PE). They facilitate the on-time implementation of recommended therapeutic strategies.

PERTs are currently changing how complex acute PE cases are approached. The structure, organization, and function of a given PERT may vary from hospital to hospital, depending on local expertise, specific resources, and infrastructure for a given academic hospital center. Emerging data demonstrate the value of PERTs in improving time to PE diagnosis, shorter time to initiation of anticoagulation, reducing hospital length of stay, and increasing the use of advanced therapies without an increase in bleeding. In some reports, they are also decreasing mortality. Importantly, PERTs are positively impacting outcomes by changing the paradigm of care for acute PE through global adoption by the healthcare community.

### Techniques and devices for catheter-directed therapy in pulmonary embolism [^114szqgX]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) can be classified into three categories: low-risk, submassive (presence of right heart strain), and massive (hemodynamic compromise). Massive PE is associated with high morbidity or mortality and is typically treated with systemic intravenous thrombolysis. Over the last two decades, however, catheter-directed techniques have become an increasingly popular treatment modality for patients with a contraindication to systemic thrombolysis or without clinical improvement after systemic thrombolysis. Furthermore, endovascular treatment for patients with submassive PE has garnered significant interest due to the substantially increased mortality associated with right heart strain. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that catheter-directed thrombolysis can decrease right heart strain more effectively than systemic anticoagulation alone. This article describes available devices and endovascular techniques used to treat patients with massive and submassive acute PE.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary embolism, specifically in terms of diagnostic imaging, the ESC 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining bedside echocardiography or emergency CTPA (depending on availability and clinical circumstances) for diagnosing patients with suspected high-risk PE.

### Mechanical circulatory support for massive pulmonary embolism [^115CwNHt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Up to 50% of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) experience hemodynamic instability, and approximately 70% of patients who die of PE experience an accelerated cascade of symptoms within the first hours of onset, necessitating rapid evaluation and intervention. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and other ventricular assist devices, depending on the hemodynamic derangements present, may be used to stabilize patients with massive PE refractory to initial therapies or with contraindications to other interventions. Given the abnormalities in both pulmonary circulation and gas exchange caused by massive PE, VA-ECMO may be considered the preferred form of mechanical circulatory support for most patients. VA-ECMO unloads the right ventricle and improves oxygenation, which may not only help buy time until definitive treatment but may also reduce myocardial ischemia and dysfunction. This review summarizes the available clinical data on the use of mechanical circulatory support, especially VA-ECMO, in the treatment of patients with massive PE. Furthermore, it provides practical guidance on the implementation of this strategy in clinical practice.

### Mortality outcomes with tenecteplase versus alteplase in the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism [^112sYndE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) leads to many emergency department visits annually. Thrombolytic agents, such as alteplase, are currently recommended for massive PE, but genetically modified tenecteplase (TNK) presents advantages. Limited comparative studies exist between TNK and alteplase in PE treatment.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and mortality of TNK compared with alteplase in patients with PE using real-world evidence obtained from a large multicenter registry. Primary outcomes included mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX Global Health Research Network. Patients aged 18 years or older with a PE diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification code I26) were included. The following two cohorts were defined: TNK-treated (29 organizations, 266 cases) and alteplase-treated (22,864 cases). Propensity matching controlled for demographic characteristics, anticoagulant use, pre-existing conditions, and vital sign abnormalities associated with PE severity. Patients received TNK or alteplase within 7 days of diagnosis, and outcomes were measured at 30 days post-thrombolysis.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty-three patients in each cohort were comparable in demographic characteristics and pre-existing conditions. Mortality rates at 30 days post-thrombolysis were similar between TNK and alteplase cohorts (19.4% vs. 19.8%; risk ratio 0.982; 95% CI 0.704–1.371). Rates of intracerebral hemorrhages and transfusion were too infrequent.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. Part 2: treatment [^112ryiwy]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) varies widely, ranging from limited symptoms to severe cardiogenic shock. Treatment of PE comprises initial therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin, and long-term treatment, most commonly with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs).

- **Risk stratification**: Methods to determine whether a patient will benefit from thrombolysis are currently under investigation. However, insufficient evidence exists that hemodynamically stable patients with echocardiographic right ventricular strain (submassive PE) benefit from thrombolysis. By contrast, thrombolysis is a widely accepted treatment strategy for patients with hemodynamic shock (massive PE).

The duration of VKA treatment is commonly 3–12 months and depends on the type of PE and the balance between the risks of recurrent PE, major bleeding, and the patient's preference. In patients with malignancy, treatment with LMWH during the first 6 months after diagnosis of PE is recommended. Several new oral anticoagulants, such as factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors, are now being investigated.

- **Prevention of rePE**: For situations where anticoagulation is contraindicated, a temporary inferior vena cava filter might be useful.

Some patients with PE can be safely treated at home, but few outcome studies in this setting have been published.

### Successful catheter-directed thrombolysis of a massive pulmonary embolism in a patient after recent pneumonectomy [^1143rfaE]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following major thoracic surgery is a rare but life-threatening event that presents significant management challenges. Currently, treatment for acute PE involves either anticoagulation, with or without systemic thrombolytic therapy. We report a case of a 65-year-old female with a recent left pneumonectomy who developed a massive PE. The patient was successfully and safely treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first patient treated in this manner.

### Clinical outcomes of acute pulmonary embolectomy as the first-line treatment for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism: a single-centre study in China [^113H4Q7m]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is regarded as one of the most critical cardiovascular diseases, stratified into high-risk (massive), intermediate-risk (submassive), and low-risk PE. PE treatment depends on the stratification and ranges from drug therapy, surgical treatment, interventional therapy, to ECMO mechanical support. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy (SPE) has traditionally been used as a final or rescue treatment for acute massive PE when thrombolysis treatment fails, leading to a high SPE mortality rate. However, with rapid advancements in diagnosis, improved surgical techniques, and increased surgeon experience, more favorable SPE outcomes for acute PE have been reported.

Increasingly excellent SPE reports for acute massive PE have extended the indication of SPE beyond a mere rescue tool to a contemporary elective treatment algorithm for PE. Although controversy remains regarding SPE mortality rates, which vary from 2.3% to 27.2%, further research is needed to evaluate SPE's role in algorithmic PE treatment. Most studies have been reported by authors from the United States, European countries, and a few developing countries. This study aims to assess the clinical outcomes of SPE for acute PE patients at a single cardiac center in China.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uWAeu]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease, occurring in 60–112 per 100,000 people per year. According to prospective cohort studies, the case fatality rate in the acute phase ranges from 7% to 11%. Nevertheless, acute PE represents a wide spectrum of clinical presentations with varying clinical outcomes. To guide the management of acute PE, the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have proposed a three-level risk stratification scheme based on hemodynamic status and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) or myocardial injury.

- **Risk stratification**:
	- High-risk (or massive) PE is defined as an acute PE with sustained systemic arterial hypotension.
	- Intermediate-risk (or submassive) PE is characterized by the presence of RVD or injury in the absence of arterial hypotension.
	- Low-risk PE is defined by the absence of hypotension and markers of RVD or injury.

In 1970, the first randomized trial comparing urokinase with heparin for patients with PE was published. Seven years later, streptokinase was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high-risk PE. Since then, thrombolytic therapy has been shown to induce faster clot dissolution and hemodynamic improvement compared with heparin alone. However, more than three decades later, the role of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with non-high-risk PE remains controversial. Previous meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate a positive impact of thrombolytic treatment on total mortality and suggested an increase in major hemorrhage.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^116EvZCT]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

What is the optimal type and dose of thrombolytic agent, and what should I do if a patient is already on low molecular weight heparin?

Thrombolytic agents for pulmonary embolism (PE) should be administered peripherally. Several thrombolytic agents have been studied: urokinase, streptokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (alteplase, reteplase, desmoteplase, and tenecteplase). Alteplase is the most widely used thrombolytic agent for PE; the recommended dosing in patients weighing ≥ 65 kg is a loading bolus of 10 mg over 1–2 minutes, followed by 90 mg infused over 2 hours. In patients weighing < 65 kg, the total dose administered is 1.5 mg/kg. For example, a patient weighing 60 kg should receive a 10 mg loading bolus followed by 80 mg over 2 hours.

When patients are already receiving intravenous heparin, we stop the infusion prior to the administration of alteplase. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) should be checked 2 hours following completion of administration, and heparin can be restarted when the APTT ratio is < 2 times the upper limit of normal. If there is a good clinical response to thrombolysis, we typically convert to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 24 hours following thrombolysis. If therapeutic LMWH had been administered prior to thrombolysis, we usually start heparin infusion as described above but delay commencement to 18 hours following the last dose of LMWH if once-daily dosing was used, and 8–10 hours if twice-daily dosing had been employed.

Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the efficacy and side effects of half-dose alteplase in predominantly submassive PE. Superior efficacy with no increase in bleeding risk was observed when compared with anticoagulation alone, and equal efficacy was demonstrated.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1148shYt]. Chest (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to systemic thrombolytic therapy, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend considering systemic thrombolytic therapy administered via a peripheral vein over catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with acute PE who are treated with a thrombolytic agent.

### Management of acute pulmonary embolism with a pulmonary embolism response team [^111VuH9i]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Despite recent advances in the assessment, risk stratification, and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), it remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States each year. Patient presentation and prognosis are heterogeneous, and a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments have arisen to assist in providing patients with the appropriate level of care and aggressiveness of approach. Fortunately, a growing number of institutions now have pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) that urgently assist with risk assessment and management of patients with massive and sub-massive PE.

In service of providers at the point of contact with acute PE, this review aims to summarize the data pertinent to rapid risk assessment and the interpretation of diagnostics used to that end. The role of PERT and the indications for systemic fibrinolysis and invasive therapies are also discussed.

### Endovascular therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^115CFD8s]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cause of death among hospitalized patients. Treatment escalation beyond anticoagulation therapy is necessary in patients with massive PE, defined by hemodynamic shock, as well as in many patients with submassive PE, defined by right ventricular strain.

The best evidence suggests that modern catheter-directed therapy to achieve rapid central clot debulking should be considered as an early or first-line treatment option for patients with acute massive PE; and emerging evidence suggests a catheter-directed thrombolytic infusion should be considered as adjunctive therapy for many patients with acute submassive PE.

This article reviews the approach to endovascular therapy for acute PE in the context of appropriate diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of acute massive and acute submassive PE.

### Clinical outcomes of acute pulmonary embolectomy as the first-line treatment for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism: a single-centre study in China [^116NNK5W]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been recommended as the standard of management in pulmonary embolism (PE) treatment centres. Acute massive PE with pre-operative significant hemodynamic instability, with or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), requires ECMO as advanced life support. Postoperative severe hypoxemia and severe right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) may also require ECMO support. In this study, two patients required ECMO postoperatively. One patient with postoperative severe RVD survived after three days of ECMO support. Unfortunately, the other patient suffered severe hypoxemia and died of multiple organ failure even after one week of ECMO support. Despite its utility, the use of ECMO is associated with high complication rates, and its place in the PE treatment algorithm requires further investigation.

Surgical techniques have advanced over the past decades. Surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass employing the "beating heart" technique is recommended as a standard protocol in new guidelines. Aortic cross-clamping can cause ischemia-reperfusion myocardial injury and worsen RVD. In this study, 31 submassive pulmonary embolism (SPE) surgeries were performed without aortic cross-clamping, potentially benefiting right ventricular function and contributing to the low postoperative need for ECMO support.

Massive lung hemorrhage was an SPE-related complication encountered in the study. There were three cases of massive lung hemorrhage postoperatively. One patient tragically died during the operation due to an uncontrolled large amount of bleeding in the lung, while the other two patients survived. Massive lung hemorrhage often results from injury to the pulmonary arterial vasculature. During surgery, in the event of pulmonary massive hemorrhage, it is necessary to open the pleura and address the bleeding directly.

### Pulmonary embolism management in the critical care setting [^1145mDaE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) categorizes pulmonary embolism (PE) into three main categories based on the presence or absence of hemodynamic changes and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. The AHA characterizes massive PE as occurring in the setting of persistent hypotension, profound bradycardia, or pulselessness; submassive PE as occurring with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis in the absence of hemodynamic changes; and low-risk PE as occurring in the absence of markers of massive and submassive PE.

This chapter provides an overview of how to identify and manage patients with submassive and massive pulmonary embolism. Delivery planning considerations are discussed. We also address the management of critically ill obstetric patients with respect to VTE risk.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: A systematic reviews [^114xXZox]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review highlights several limitations. First, the heterogeneity of studies, including variations in diagnostic criteria, treatment protocols, and reporting standards, introduced significant variability, which prevented a quantitative synthesis of the data. Second, most studies relied on retrospective designs, which are prone to biases such as incomplete documentation of patient characteristics and outcomes. Third, the small sample sizes in many studies reduce the generalizability of the findings and underscore the rarity of pediatric PE. To address these limitations, future research should focus on standardized, prospective studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up periods.

### Pulmonary embolism: Care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. The clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include a detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination, and laboratory tests that support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate treatment are dictated by the PE risk category.

- **Low and high-risk PE**: Treatment is relatively straightforward.

- **Moderate risk PE**: Treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not without potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, provide guidance as to treatment choice, and offer insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### International clinical practice guideline recommendations for acute pulmonary embolism: Harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) continues to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent healthcare disparities contribute to a growing burden of PE. Navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneous recommendations, and areas of uncertainty or omission may leave readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. This review of international PE guidelines highlights key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations, with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^1128ZbiK]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility.

- **Identification of significant risk factors**: The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included having undergone major surgery within the past three weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01–79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54–113.52), and weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01–1.37). Other identified characteristics associated with increased risk (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78–18.55) were internal bleeding in the previous four weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous three months, aortic dissection, and acute pancreatitis.

### Triage for suspected acute pulmonary embolism: Think before opening Pandora's box [^115xUb72]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

This is a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging modalities available for the diagnosis of suspected non-massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Without careful consideration for the clinical presentation and the timely application of clinical decision support (CDS) methodology, the overutilization of imaging resources for this disease will continue. For a patient with a low clinical risk profile and a negative D-dimer, there is no reason to consider further workup with imaging, as the negative predictive value in this scenario is the same as imaging. While the efficacy and effectiveness data support the continued use of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as the imaging golden standard for the diagnosis of PE, this test does have the unintended consequences of radiation exposure, possible overdiagnosis, and overuse. There is a persistent lack of appreciation on the part of ordering physicians for the effectiveness of the alternatives to CTA (ventilation-perfusion imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography) in these patients. Careful use of standardized protocols for patient triage and the application of CDS will allow for a better use of imaging resources.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: A systematic review [^1171mSvM]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Accurate and early diagnosis remains the cornerstone of improving outcomes in pediatric PE. CTPA is the most reliable imaging modality, though its use is often limited by concerns over radiation exposure, particularly in younger children. Echocardiography plays a complementary role, particularly in assessing right ventricular strain and pulmonary hypertension, both of which are critical indicators in sub-massive and massive PE. The findings highlight gaps in the utility of D-dimer in pediatrics. While sensitive in adults, its high false-positive rates in children — owing to inflammatory or infectious conditions — limit its diagnostic specificity. Future studies should explore advanced diagnostic tools, including biomarkers and low-radiation imaging modalities, tailored to pediatric needs.

Management strategies must be tailored according to the severity of PE. In cases of massive PE, early use of ECMO and systemic thrombolysis is essential for hemodynamic stabilization, though these interventions carry risks of major bleeding. Surgical thrombectomy, while infrequently used, remains a viable option in refractory cases. For sub-massive PE, CDT demonstrated high rates of thrombus resolution with minimal complications. Timely intervention, especially in cases with right ventricular strain, is critical to preventing progression to massive PE. In non-massive PE cases, anticoagulation alone is generally effective; however, it must be complemented by addressing underlying risk factors.

### Systemic thrombolysis in a patient with massive pulmonary embolism and recent glioblastoma multiforme resection [^112yoPay]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

While trials of systemic thrombolysis for submassive and massive pulmonary embolism (PE) report intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) rates of 2%-3%, the risk of ICH in patients with recent brain surgery or intracranial neoplasm is unknown since these patients were excluded from these trials. We report a case of massive PE treated with systemic thrombolysis in a patient with recent neurosurgery for an intracranial neoplasm. We discuss the risks and benefits of systemic thrombolysis for massive PE in the context of previous case reports, prior cohort studies and trials, and guidelines. There may be times when the immediate risk of death from massive PE outweighs the risk of ICH from systemic thrombolysis, even when guideline-listed major contraindications exist. This case provides an example of how the haemodynamic benefit of systemic thrombolysis outweighed the impact of ICH in a patient who had undergone recent neurosurgical resection of a glioblastoma multiforme tumour.

### Current approach to the diagnosis of acute nonmassive pulmonary embolism [^1172XN7R]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially lethal disease. Given the variable presentation and associated morbidity of this condition, an accurate and efficient diagnostic algorithm is required. Clinical pretest probability serves as the root of any diagnostic approach. Thus, several clinical decision rules that may help standardize this determination are reviewed. Using a review of the literature, the accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for several diagnostic tests are described. The combination of these tests, based on the pretest probability of disease, can be used in a Bayesian fashion to make accurate treatment decisions. A completely noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with suspected acute pulmonary embolism is proposed.

### Pulmonary embolism [^113gaDHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available only at specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each diagnostic modality assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications of the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^111qSbwW]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence, guidelines, and our clinical experience. For many of these dilemmas, the evidence base is not substantial and is potentially hampered by reporting bias. Management for an individual patient will require clinical assessment of risks and benefits and will also depend on the local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Mechanical circulatory support for massive pulmonary embolism [^116MjffR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) affects approximately 60 to 70 people per 100,000 individuals every year. A World Health Organization analysis covering 2.6 billion people reported that 0.46% of total deaths globally were directly due to PE, meaning 257,600 deaths worldwide in 2023 would have been directly due to this catastrophic condition.

High-risk or "massive" PE has been defined historically as obstruction of more than 50% of the pulmonary arterial tree cross-sectional area. The 2019 guidelines of the European Respiratory Society and the European Society of Cardiology now define high-risk PE as PE with hemodynamic instability (i.e. cardiac arrest, obstructive shock, or persistent hypotension not explained by an alternative condition). Depending on the series reviewed, up to 50% of patients with PE experience hemodynamic instability. Furthermore, massive PE is a common cause of cardiac arrest with a reported mortality rate between 20% and 50%. Approximately 70% of patients who die of PE experience an accelerated cascade of symptoms within the first hours of onset, thus necessitating rapid evaluation and intervention.

### Revisiting ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: Insights from new data [^1166QwZH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

High-risk patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) demonstrated a fourfold increase in periprocedural death compared with intermediate-high-risk patients, highlighting the challenges of treating massive PE. Even with rapid reperfusion, the hemodynamic collapse and right ventricular (RV) failure often seen in these patients may require a combination of therapies, such as ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (USAT) paired with mechanical thrombectomy, to improve outcomes.

The ERASE PE study lacks long-term follow-up data on outcomes such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, recurrent PE, and postdischarge death, which limits the ability to assess the durability of USAT's benefits beyond the acute phase. Furthermore, without a direct comparator group, it remains unclear how USAT fares against other treatments like anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, or mechanical thrombectomy.

Ongoing trials such as HI-PEITHO (A Randomized Trial of Ultrasound-Facilitated, Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis Versus Anticoagulation for Acute Intermediate-High Risk Pulmonary Embolism) and PEERLESS will help define USAT's place within the PE treatment landscape. HI-PEITHO compares USAT to anticoagulation, while PEERLESS evaluates the FlowTriever system (mechanical thrombectomy) against USAT. These trials will be crucial in determining whether mechanical embolectomy, which eliminates thrombolytic-associated bleeding risks, should be prioritized over USAT.

Moreover, findings from the SUNSET-sPE (Standard Versus Ultrasound-Assisted Catheter Thrombolysis for Submassive Pulmonary Embolism) trial raise questions about the added benefit of ultrasound in USAT compared with other techniques.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dAsX9]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence from currently available randomized trials suggests that thrombolytic treatment reduces overall mortality of patients with acute PE. Although the estimated treatment effect corresponded to a 41% relative risk reduction of overall mortality, the benefit of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute PE could not be definitely established. This observation deserves several comments:

- **Robustness of primary result**: The robustness of our primary result was limited since statistical significance was lost after exclusion of the study by Jerjes-Sanchez et al. This small-size, open-label trial included only patients with high-risk PE and was limited by gross imbalance between groups. The four patients allocated to heparin treatment had been admitted for an acute episode of unstable PE despite previous therapeutic anticoagulation. Nevertheless, even after exclusion of this trial, a trend towards decreased all-cause mortality was observed (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39–1.08).

- **Early mortality in acute PE**: Early mortality is relatively uncommon among patients with acute PE, particularly those with non-high-risk PE. Therefore, considering a mortality of 3.9% in the control group, a 41% relative risk reduction would lead to an absolute mortality risk reduction of only 1.6% in our overall population.

- **Subgroup analyses**: Our subgroup analyses suggest a possible correlation between PE severity and treatment effect. The pooled ORs were similar in studies including (not exclusively) high-risk PE and studies restricted to intermediate-risk PE, with an estimated mortality risk reduction of approximately 55%. The OR was suggestive of an absence of benefit in some cases.

This analysis highlights the complexity and varying impact of thrombolytic therapy, depending on the risk profile of patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

### Research progress on the association between lung cancer and pulmonary embolism [^116MM9Kb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

European guidelines recommend thrombolysis for clinically unstable individuals presenting with sub-massive or massive pulmonary embolism (PE) at admission, provided no contraindications exist. For individuals without sub-massive or massive PE, anticoagulant therapy is the standard treatment. This usually begins with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a transition to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Compared with the general population, individuals with cancer have an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE) and bleeding complications related to anticoagulant therapy.

Research suggests that while the prophylactic use of anticoagulants in individuals with lung cancer does not improve overall prognosis, it increases the likelihood of hemorrhagic events. Therefore, anticoagulant therapy in this population requires a personalized approach, taking into account individual risk profiles and clinical conditions.

- **Additional considerations**: In addition to standard risk factors, other considerations such as adenocarcinoma subtype, genetic mutations, cancer stage, and the patient's medical history in the six months prior to chemotherapy initiation may offer further insights. These factors could guide clinical decisions regarding the potential benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation in select patient populations.

Studies have shown that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) model of lung cancer care not only improves the quality of life of patients but also increases survival rates. Despite limitations in the primary studies, the MDT model remains a critical component in the management of lung cancer.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: A systematic reviews [^117S4isb]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatric pulmonary embolism (PE) presents a rare but significant clinical challenge due to its potential for high morbidity and mortality. Unlike adults, children with PE often exhibit atypical symptoms and delayed diagnoses, complicating timely interventions. Risk stratification based on severity is essential for guiding appropriate management strategies.

In this study, we categorized PE into three severity levels: massive, submassive, and non-massive. Massive PE is defined by hemodynamic instability, requiring immediate intervention due to its high mortality risk. Submassive PE, while lacking hemodynamic instability, is characterized by evidence of right ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension, necessitating close monitoring and tailored management. Non-massive PE cases lack these features but still require prompt diagnosis to avoid progression.

- **Clinical outcomes**: Categorizing PE severity is crucial as studies suggest that outcomes differ significantly based on severity levels. Massive PE has been associated with higher mortality and complication rates, while submassive PE outcomes hinge on early recognition and intervention. In the pediatric population, however, evidence on the prognostic impact of PE severity remains limited.

This study hypothesizes that PE severity significantly influences outcomes and highlights the need for tailored management approaches. Recent literature underscores disparities in pediatric PE outcomes based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and comorbid conditions. For instance, adolescents with PE exhibit a higher incidence of mortality.

### Triage and optimization: A new paradigm in the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism [^113bnwvh]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a highly fatal condition. Although venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and surgical pulmonary embolectomy in the management of massive PE have been reported previously, the outcomes remain less than ideal. We hypothesized that the institution of a protocolized approach of triage and optimization using VA-ECMO would result in improved outcomes compared with historical surgical management.

- **Methods**: All patients with a massive PE referred to the cardiac surgery service between 2010 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified by treatment strategy: historical control versus the protocolized approach. In the historical control group, the primary intervention was surgical pulmonary embolectomy. In the protocol approach group, patients were treated based on an algorithmic approach using VA-ECMO. The primary outcome was 1-year survival.

- **Results**: A total of 56 patients (control, n = 27; protocol, n = 29) were identified. All 27 patients in the historical control group underwent surgical pulmonary embolectomy, whereas 2 of 29 patients in the protocol approach group were deemed appropriate for direct surgical pulmonary embolectomy. The remaining 27 patients were placed on VA-ECMO. In the protocol approach group, 15 of 29 patients were treated with anticoagulation alone and 14 patients ultimately required surgical pulmonary embolectomy. One-year survival was significantly lower in the historical control group compared with the protocol approach group (73% vs 96%; p = 0.02), with no deaths reported in the latter group.

### Mechanical circulatory support for massive pulmonary embolism [^117Pf3uV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

A multidisciplinary approach is often necessary to maneuver the intricate process of choosing treatment options for a complex clinical problem such as PE; hence, the creation of a PERT that can involve the ECMO team as needed. Multiple observational studies indicate that the use of VA‐ECMO, which addresses several hemodynamic derangements in massive PE, may be used to either resuscitate patients post-arrest or stabilize patients in refractory cardiogenic shock as a standalone therapy in combination with heparinization, or as a bridge to definitive therapy.

Adjunct MCS such as RVADs, Impella RP, and IABP may also be considered in carefully selected patients. High-quality data to guide appropriate patient selection and choice of MCS strategy in patients with massive PE are currently lacking. Until future randomized controlled trials afford us better insight in this area, tertiary centers with MCS capability should develop standardized protocols based on the best evidence.

### Repeated and adaptive multidisciplinary assessment of a patient with acute pulmonary embolism and recurrent cardiac arrests [^115HHvoY]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

High-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that must be recognized and treated rapidly. The importance of correct risk stratification to guide therapeutic decisions has prompted the introduction of multidisciplinary PE response teams (PERTs). The recommended first-line treatment for high-risk PE is intravenous thrombolysis.

- **Alternatives**: Consider if thrombolysis has insufficient effect or may cause significant hemorrhagic complications include catheter-directed intervention (CDI) and surgical thrombectomy.

- **For patients in deep shock or cardiac arrest**: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can be instituted for cardiopulmonary rescue and support during CDI, thrombectomy, or pharmacological treatment.

We present a complex case of high-risk PE that illustrates the importance of an early PERT conference and repeated decision-making when the initial therapy fails. After a trial of thrombolysis with insufficient effect, VA-ECMO was used to reverse circulatory and respiratory collapse in a patient with PE and episodes of cardiac arrest.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: A systematic review [^113pPZQR]. BMC Pediatrics (2025).

Management strategies

Management strategies varied significantly by PE severity and institutional practices. The primary modalities included:

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Used in nearly all patients, anticoagulation therapy involved low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and warfarin as first-line treatments. Patients were transitioned to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in some cases for long-term management.

- **Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)**: CDT was performed in submassive and massive PE cases, showing high thrombus resolution rates (85–92%) with minimal bleeding complications. For instance, in Belsky et al, CDT was initiated within a median of 6.8 hours from diagnosis and resulted in complete or partial thrombus resolution in 83% of patients.

- **Surgical interventions**: Reserved for critical cases, surgical thrombectomy was performed in patients with hemodynamic instability or intracardiac thrombi. This modality was typically used when thrombolysis was contraindicated or unsuccessful.

- **Supportive measures**: Oxygen therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and inotropic support were utilized in critically ill patients with massive PE and cardiopulmonary compromise. In Akam-Venkata et al, five patients received ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis.

Prognosis and outcomes

Patient outcomes were stratified by PE severity, revealing significant variability:

Massive PE was associated with the highest mortality rates, reaching up to 22%, largely due to delayed diagnoses and treatment failures. Survivors often required prolonged hospitalization.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1129iTsj]. Chest (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary embolism, more specifically concerning indications for IVC filter placement, the ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend considering a conventional course of anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute PE. An IVC filter may be inserted as an alternative to anticoagulation in patients for whom the risk of bleeding has resolved.

### Acute pulmonary embolectomy: A contemporary approach [^116GEYyC]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism confers a high mortality rate despite advances in diagnosis and therapy. Thrombolysis is often effective but has a high frequency of major bleeding complications, especially intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, we liberalized our criteria for acute pulmonary embolectomy and considered operating on patients with anatomically extensive pulmonary embolism and concomitant moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction despite preserved systemic arterial pressure.

- **Methods and results**: We report 29 (17 men and 12 women) consecutive patients who underwent embolectomy from October 1999 through October 2001. Twenty-six patients (89%) survived surgery and were alive more than 1 month postoperatively. The median follow-up is 10 months.

- **Conclusion**: The high survival rate of 89% can be attributed to improved surgical technique, rapid diagnosis and triage, and careful patient selection. We hope that other tertiary centers will evaluate pulmonary embolism patients with an algorithm that includes surgical embolectomy as one of several therapeutic options. Our contemporary approach to pulmonary embolectomy no longer confines this operation to a treatment of last resort reserved for clinically desperate circumstances.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: A critical appraisal [^112czDLD]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for over 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, at the time of writing, there have been only 11 randomized controlled trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, and the number of patients included in these trials has been small. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice.

It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. However, the appropriate therapy for submassive PE (PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial BP) remains an area of contention, and definitive data proving mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy.

This article reviews historical aspects of and evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE with specific attention to bleeding risk, and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

### Current controversies in caring for the critically ill pulmonary embolism patient [^117Kpbs7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians must be prepared to rapidly diagnose and resuscitate patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain aspects of PE resuscitation run counter to typical approaches. A specific understanding of the pathophysiology of PE is required to avoid cardiovascular collapse potentially associated with excessive intravenous fluids and positive pressure ventilation. Once PE is diagnosed, rapid risk stratification should be performed and treatment guided by patient risk class. Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of PE treatment, emergency physicians also must understand the indications and contraindications for thrombolysis and should be aware of new therapies and models of care that may improve outcomes.

### Massive pulmonary embolus with hemodynamic compromise: therapeutic options [^116nmcYj]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics and interventional techniques have resulted in a resurgence of interest regarding the optimal management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolic disease. However, these various techniques have many associated disadvantages. It is of paramount importance that the responsible physician has a detailed understanding of each technique to ensure the appropriate intervention is requested and performed.

By way of background discussion and relevant cases, we consider each of these management options in turn, with particular reference to the advantages, disadvantages, and application of each.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: The state of practice [^1173QTXu]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major public health problem and the third most common cause of death in hospitalized patients. In the United States, up to 600,000 cases are diagnosed per year, with 100,000–180,000 acute PE-related deaths. Common risk factors include underlying genetic conditions, acquired conditions, and acquired hypercoagulable states. Acute PE increases the pulmonary vascular resistance and the load on the right ventricle (RV), leading to compensatory RV dilation, impaired contractility, tachycardia, and sympathetic activation. RV dilation and increased intramural pressure decrease diastolic coronary blood flow, which leads to RV ischemia and myocardial necrosis. Ultimately, insufficient cardiac output from the RV causes left ventricular under-filling, resulting in systemic hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.

Prognostic stratification strategy separates acute PE into massive, submassive, and low-risk categories based on the presence or absence of sustained hypotension, RV dysfunction, and myocardial necrosis. The mortality rates for massive, submassive, and low-risk acute PE are 25%-65%, 3%, and < 1%, respectively. PE management includes the use of anticoagulation alone, systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and surgical embolectomy.

This article describes the state of practice for catheter-directed thrombolysis and its role in the management of acute PE.

### Catheter-directed therapies for the treatment of high risk (massive) and intermediate risk (submassive) acute pulmonary embolism [^111CWynp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a major cause of acute morbidity and mortality, resulting in long-term morbidity in up to 50% of survivors, known as post-pulmonary embolism (post-PE) syndrome. APE can be classified according to the short-term (30-day) risk of mortality, based on various clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. Most mortality and morbidity are concentrated in high-risk (massive) and intermediate-risk (submassive) APE.

The first-line treatment for APE is systemic anticoagulation. High-risk (massive) APE accounts for less than 10% of APE cases and is a life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate reperfusion treatment to prevent death. Systemic thrombolysis is the recommended treatment for high-risk (massive) APE; however, only a minority receive systemic thrombolysis due to comorbidities or the 10% risk of major hemorrhagic side effects. Of those who receive systemic thrombolysis, 8% do not respond in a timely manner. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy is an alternative reperfusion treatment but is not widely available.

Intermediate-risk (submassive) APE represents 45% to 65% of APE cases, with a short-term mortality rate of around 3%. Systemic thrombolysis is not recommended for this group, as major hemorrhagic complications outweigh the benefit. However, individuals at higher risk within this group have a short-term mortality of around 12%, suggesting that anticoagulation alone is not adequate treatment. Identification and more aggressive treatment of individuals at intermediate to high risk are essential.

### Epidemiology and management of massive, sub-massive, and non-massive pediatric pulmonary embolism: a systematic reviews [^1144RqNA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review highlights the importance of classifying pediatric pulmonary embolism (PE) by severity to guide diagnosis and treatment. Adolescents, particularly females with risk factors like hormonal influences and thrombophilia, are at higher risk and require tailored management. Massive PE demands aggressive interventions such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and ECMO, while submassive PE benefits from CDT and anticoagulation. Non-massive PE typically has favorable outcomes with timely anticoagulation.

Pediatric PE, though rare, carries significant morbidity and mortality, especially in severe cases. Delays in diagnosis, limited access to therapies, and inconsistent management protocols remain key challenges. Addressing these through large-scale, multicenter trials and novel therapeutic approaches is essential to improving outcomes.

Future research should focus on standardized severity classifications, comparative therapeutic assessments, and the development of diagnostic tools to enhance early detection and treatment, ultimately improving outcomes for affected children and adolescents.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

- **Methods**: Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

- **Results**: Management dilemmas discussed include sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge, and novel oral anticoagulants.

- **Conclusion**: The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Contemporary approach to the diagnosis of non-massive pulmonary embolism [^11456zLe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism are in constant evolution, integrating new diagnostic tools along with better use of clinical information.

Recent findings in the past year have provided more data on the value of clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, along with improved clinical prediction rules for pulmonary embolism. Among the diagnostic tools, the use of multislice computed tomography of the chest received further validation, whereas the yield of bedside tests, such as the D-dimer test or alveolar dead-space measurement, has been further investigated. Furthermore, data linking good outcomes with appropriate diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism have been reported for the first time this year.

These new data allow for a more evidence-based and cost-effective approach to patients with suspected non-massive pulmonary embolism. Multislice computed tomography is replacing other imaging tests. More research should be conducted on the role of lower limb venous compression ultrasonography and on how to select patients in whom pulmonary embolism should be suspected and investigated.

### Catheter-directed embolectomy, fragmentation, and thrombolysis for the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism after failure of systemic thrombolysis [^116HWhnF]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

The standard medical management for patients in extremis from massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is systemic thrombolysis. However, the utility of this treatment relative to catheter-directed intervention (CDI) is unknown. This study evaluated the effectiveness of CDI as part of a treatment algorithm for life-threatening PE.

Methods involved a retrospective review of 70 consecutive patients with suspected acute PE over a 10-year period (from 1997 to 2006) who had been referred for pulmonary angiography and/or intervention. The criteria for study inclusion were patients who received CDI due to angiographically confirmed massive PE and hemodynamic shock (shock index, ≥ 0.9). CDI involved suction embolectomy and fragmentation, with or without catheter thrombolysis.

In the results, twelve patients were treated with CDI. There were seven men and five women with a mean age of 56 years (age range, 21 to 80 years). Seven patients (58%) were referred for CDI after failing systemic infusion with 100 mg of tissue plasminogen activator, and five patients (42%) had contraindications to systemic thrombolysis. Catheter-directed fragmentation and embolectomy were performed in all patients (100%), and catheter-guided thrombolysis was performed in eight patients (67%). Technical success was achieved in all 12 cases (100%), with no major procedural complications (0%). Significant hemodynamic improvement (shock index, < 0.9) was noted in 10 of 12 cases (83%). Unfortunately, two patients (17%) died secondary to cardiac arrest within 24 hours. Ten of the 12 patients (83%) survived.

### The PERT concept: A step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^114BcDd9]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in the adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging. However, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians.

Thirteen international guidelines, authored by medical societies or expert author groups, provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This review summarizes key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Systemic thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: who and how [^111mvXLD]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation has been shown to improve mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Initiation of anticoagulation should be considered when PE is strongly suspected and the bleeding risk is perceived to be low, even if acute PE has not yet been proven. Low-risk patients with acute PE are simply continued on anticoagulation. Severely ill patients with high-risk (massive) PE require aggressive therapy, and if the bleeding risk is acceptable, systemic thrombolysis should be considered. However, despite clear evidence that parenteral thrombolytic therapy leads to more rapid clot resolution than anticoagulation alone, the risk of major bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, is significantly higher when systemic thrombolytic therapy is administered.

It has been demonstrated that right ventricular dysfunction, as well as abnormal biomarkers (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide), are associated with increased mortality in acute PE. In spite of this, intermediate-risk (submassive) PE comprises a fairly broad clinical spectrum. For several decades, clinicians and clinical trialists have worked toward a more aggressive, yet safe solution for patients with intermediate-risk PE. Standard-dose thrombolysis, low-dose systemic thrombolysis, and catheter-based therapy, which includes a number of devices and techniques, with or without low-dose thrombolytic therapy, have offered potential solutions, and this area has continued to evolve.

On the basis of heterogeneity within the category of intermediate-risk as well as within the high-risk group of patients, we will focus on the use of sy…

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^1112DJvR]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

I feel it is too unsafe to perform thrombolysis: what are the surgical and non-surgical alternatives? If thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated and a patient has significant accessible PE and persisting hemodynamic compromise, then embolectomy, performed by an open surgical or catheter-based approach, should be considered. Older case series observed mortality rates for surgical embolectomy of over 20%; however, an intraoperative mortality of 6% was reported in 47 consecutive patients. Catheter-directed therapies include mechanical disruption of thrombi by catheter, ultrasound, or pressurized saline injection. Suction may be used to perform thrombectomy or aspirate fragments of macerated emboli following other techniques. A recent meta-analysis observed 87% clinical success. Local intra-clot thrombolytic was used in 67% of cases and was associated with superior clinical success, postulated due to increased thrombus surface area exposed to thrombolysis after fragmentation. Major complications of catheter-directed therapy, including pulmonary artery rupture and massive hemoptysis, were seen in 2.4% of cases, while hemodynamic deterioration due to fragmented emboli was unpredictable. Although the incidence of major bleeding in the meta-analysis was low (18 non-cerebral hemorrhages requiring transfusion and 1 intra-cerebral hemorrhage reported in 594 patients), the absolute risk of bleeding related to intra-clot thrombolysis in an individual patient with a contraindication to systemic thrombolysis is not clear. There are few data comparing thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-b…

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^114wjHRa]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Several guidelines on acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have been published. Guidance for various scenarios that challenge physicians in the management of acute PE is often not easily accessible in these guidelines. Our institution operates an integrated PE service between respiratory and hematology physicians and a large tertiary pulmonary hypertension service. We are frequently referred complex acute PE cases from other centers. In this review, we discuss the most clinically challenging scenarios.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: With an emphasis on an interventional approach [^115BB6ph]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Compared with recent advances in the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, the treatment and outcome of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades. This has prompted several experts to call for the formation of multidisciplinary PE response teams with a more proactive approach to the treatment of PE. In the document, we discuss the formation of such teams and describe the available treatment options beyond anticoagulation, with a focus on the interventional approach. Acknowledging the paucity of data to support the widespread adoption of such techniques, we call for the collection of outcomes data in multicenter registries and support for randomized trials to evaluate interventional treatments in patients with high-risk PE.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism undergoing ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis [^111o8V27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Among unstable patients with massive (high-risk) acute pulmonary embolism (PE), immediate reperfusion is commonly achieved with thrombolytic therapy by intravenous injection of a plasminogen activator (e.g. recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [rt-PA]). Systemic thrombolysis, however, is associated with a significant risk of bleeding in up to 20% of treated individuals, including rates of intracranial hemorrhage between 2% and 5%. Appropriate therapy is often withheld due to the anticipated risk of bleeding. Submassive (intermediate risk) PE is characterized by right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or cardiac ischemia. Although early mortality rates are as high as 10.9% in this patient population, clinical practice guidelines recommend anticoagulation rather than thrombolytic reperfusion therapy in stable patients due to the associated hazard of life-threatening bleeding.

Catheter-directed therapies for PE were mainly studied in hemodynamically stable patients and may avert the risk of RV overload in intermediate-risk patients and minimize the risk of major bleeding. Among interventional techniques, catheter-directed thrombolysis using ultrasound-enhanced technology, the EkoSonic Endovascular System (EKOS), provides most of the evidence supporting an early treatment strategy for PE. Although numerous single-arm studies have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this device, overall patient numbers are still low.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the benefits and risks of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis (USAT) in a large patient cohort.

### Treatment of massive or submassive acute pulmonary embolism with catheter-directed thrombolysis [^113SbTrA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The presentation of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) can be highly variable, resulting in diagnostic challenges and management difficulties. Guidelines suggest that therapy must be adjusted based on the severity of PE presentation. Systemic thrombolysis is the standard therapy for acute massive PE; however, it carries an estimated 20% risk of major hemorrhage, including a 3% to 5% risk of hemorrhagic stroke. There are data supporting the use of catheter-directed therapy (CDT) in massive and submassive PE, but past studies have limited its use to patients in whom systemic thrombolysis has either failed or was contraindicated. There is a paucity of data comparing the efficacy of CDT to systemic thrombolysis across different risk groups. This review will summarize the available data on the techniques, indications, and outcomes of CDT for acute PE.

### Contemporary practice patterns and outcomes of systemic thrombolysis in acute pulmonary embolism [^1173PYdc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Although systemic thrombolysis (ST) is the standard of care in the treatment of high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), large variations in real-world usage exist, including its use to treat intermediate-risk PE. A paucity of data is available to define the outcomes and practice patterns of the ST dose, duration, and treatment of presumed and imaging-confirmed PE.

We performed a multicenter retrospective study to evaluate the real-world practice patterns of ST use in the setting of acute PE (presumed vs. imaging-confirmed intermediate- and high-risk PE). Patients who had received tissue plasminogen activator for PE between 2017 and 2019 were included. We compared the baseline clinical characteristics, tissue plasminogen activator practice patterns, and outcomes for patients with confirmed vs. presumed PE.

A total of 104 patients had received ST for PE: 52 with confirmed PE and 52 with presumed PE. Significantly more patients who had been treated for presumed PE had experienced cardiac arrest (n = 47; 90%) compared with those with confirmed PE (n = 23; 44%; P < .01). Survival to hospital discharge was 65% for the patients with confirmed PE vs. 6% for those with presumed PE (P < .01). The use of ST was contraindicated for 56% of the patients with confirmed PE, with major bleeding in 26% but no intracranial hemorrhage.

The in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed acute PE has remained high (35%) in contemporary practice for those treated with ST. A large proportion of these patients had contraindications to ST.

When to wean-

There is little guidance on the best weaning strategy for patients with massive PE treated with VA‐ECMO. Standardized weaning protocols are recommended to optimize the weaning process. Despite the presence of various institutional protocols, none have been demonstrated to be superior. However, all these protocols require sufficient recovery of end‐organ function (pulmonary and cardiac), and the patient should be considered hemodynamically stable. Clinical signs such as the patient's clinical state, including vasopressor support requirement, as well as serum lactate levels and other biochemical markers, should all be considered when making a comprehensive decision to wean.

Echocardiographic and invasive hemodynamic monitoring provide objective information when evaluating biventricular recovery and the likelihood of VA‐ECMO weaning success. In massive PE, some institutions rely on the evaluation of RV function to determine the probability of weaning from VA‐ECMO. Three‐dimensional echocardiography has high accuracy and reproducibility in the assessment of RV function under VA‐ECMO support. However, there remains some disagreement on the accuracy of 2‐dimensional echocardiography given that VA‐ECMO may reduce RV preload. Some proponents suggest lowering the ECMO flow to 25%–50% during RV assessment using 2‐dimensional transthoracic echocardiography, which may be supported by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography during ECMO decannulation. The role of serum biomarkers such as NT‐proBNP and troponin remains unclear.

### Interventional treatment of pulmonary embolism [^116wA52s]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and prevalent cause of vascular disease. Nevertheless, optimal treatment for many phenotypes of PE remains uncertain. Treating PE requires appropriate risk stratification as a first step. For the highest-risk PE, presenting as shock or arrest, emergent systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is reasonable, while for low-risk PE, anticoagulation alone is often chosen. Normotensive patients with PE but with indicia of right heart dysfunction (by biomarkers or imaging) constitute an intermediate-risk group for whom there is controversy on therapeutic strategy.

Some intermediate-risk patients with PE may require urgent stabilization, and approximately 10% will decompensate hemodynamically and suffer high mortality, though identifying these specific patients remains challenging. Systemic thrombolysis is a consideration, but its risks of major and intracranial hemorrhages rival overall harms from intermediate PE. Multiple hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches have been devised to capture the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but there is limited aggregate clinical experience with such novel interventional strategies.

One method to counteract uncertainty and generate a consensus multidisciplinary prognostic and therapeutic plan is through a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team, which combines expertise from interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac imaging, and critical care. Such a team can help determine which intervention — catheter-directed fibrinolysis, ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy — may be most appropriate for a given patient.

### Interventional therapies for pulmonary embolism [^117Bvcff]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the leading cause of in-hospital death and the third most frequent cause of cardiovascular death. The clinical presentation of PE is variable, and choosing the appropriate treatment for individual patients can be challenging. Traditionally, treatment of PE has involved a choice of anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or surgery; however, a range of percutaneous interventional technologies has been developed and is under investigation in patients with intermediate-high-risk or high-risk PE. These interventional technologies include catheter-directed thrombolysis (with or without ultrasound assistance), aspiration thrombectomy, and combinations of the aforementioned principles. These interventional treatment options might lead to a more rapid improvement in right ventricular function and pulmonary and/or systemic hemodynamics in particular patients. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials on the safety and efficacy of these interventions compared with conservative therapies is lacking.

In this review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology of PE, provide assistance with decision-making on patient selection, and critically appraise the available clinical evidence on interventional, catheter-based approaches for PE treatment. Finally, we discuss future perspectives and unmet needs.

### Catheter embolectomy for acute pulmonary embolism [^111JDxM9]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition with a high early mortality rate due to acute right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, an IV bolus of unfractionated heparin should be administered. In addition to anticoagulation, rapid initiation of systemic thrombolysis is potentially life-saving and, therefore, is standard therapy.

Many patients with massive PE cannot receive thrombolysis because of an increased bleeding risk, such as prior surgery, trauma, or cancer. In these patients, catheter or surgical embolectomy are helpful for rapidly reversing right ventricular failure. Catheter thrombectomy appears to be particularly useful if surgical embolectomy is not available, or the patient has contraindications to surgery. Although no controlled clinical trials are available, data from cohort studies indicate that the clinical outcomes after surgical and catheter embolectomy may be comparable.
