## Question

A 68-year-old man with severe COPD is assessed in clinic for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) after a recent hospitalization for an exacerbation. During his assessment, his arterial blood gas reveals a PaO₂ of 52 mmHg on room air and a PaCO₂ of 54 mmHg, which is 10 mmHg higher than his baseline PaCO₂ from previous records. He is started on LTOT at 2 L/min. You are responsible for arranging his follow-up care.

According to current guidelines, when should this patient have his first follow-up clinical assessment after starting long-term oxygen therapy, and what is the rationale for this timing?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the first follow-up clinical assessment should occur after starting long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in a 68-year-old man with severe COPD who was recently hospitalized for an exacerbation, and what the rationale is for that timing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient meets criteria for LTOT and whether the timing of initiation is appropriate. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (GOLD, BTS, VA/DoD) say about reassessment intervals after starting LTOT, especially in the context of a recent exacerbation. Next, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies between guidelines and align them with the clinical scenario. Finally, I will outline the key elements of that first follow-up visit and the rationale for timing, including safety checks for hypercapnia and adherence.

> Let me first confirm the indication for LTOT. The patient has severe resting hypoxemia with PaO2 52 mmHg on room air, which meets GOLD and VA/DoD criteria for LTOT in stable COPD, and the elevated PaCO2 with a 10 mmHg rise from baseline raises concern for ventilatory instability and CO2 retention risk with oxygen therapy [^8bc41cc3] [^3d39b1ca] [^103dc45c].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of initiation relative to the exacerbation. BTS advises waiting at least 8 weeks after an exacerbation before assessing for LTOT to avoid prescribing oxygen during clinical instability; however, many patients are started on oxygen at discharge and then reassessed, so I should not assume the current prescription is definitive without planned reassessment [^c4dc5bbc] [^4905a63e].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed reassessment intervals. GOLD 2025 recommends reassessing LTOT 60–90 days after initiation to confirm ongoing need and therapeutic effectiveness, which applies to patients started in stable state or after an exacerbation, and it aligns with VA/DoD guidance to reassess 30–90 days post-discharge when oxygen is started around a hospitalization [^cf46137b] [^f9fe7065] [^eabe928d].

> Hold on, I should verify whether a shorter interval is warranted in this case. BTS suggests a 3-month follow-up for all new LTOT starts, but also advises earlier follow-up within 4 weeks when there is a rise in PaCO2 of more than 7.5 mmHg during assessment, which fits this patient's 10 mmHg increase from baseline and heightened risk of oxygen-induced hypercapnia; thus, a 4-week check is prudent here [^b41a3ec2] [^5a8acef0].

> I need to reconcile these positions. The most conservative, safety-focused approach is to schedule the first clinical reassessment at about 4 weeks to check for rising PaCO2 and respiratory acidosis, verify adherence and equipment issues, and titrate oxygen as needed, while recognizing that GOLD's 60–90 day reassessment window remains the standard for confirming long-term eligibility and effectiveness; practically, many programs combine an early safety check at 4 weeks with a formal reassessment at 3 months, which satisfies both safety and guideline requirements [^5a8acef0] [^cf46137b] [^b41a3ec2].

> Let me consider the rationale for the 4-week timing. After a recent exacerbation, gas exchange and ventilatory drive can be labile, and oxygen-induced hypercapnia may emerge or worsen; early ABG reassessment ensures the prescribed flow is therapeutic yet safe, allows correction of any harmful CO2 rise, and addresses adherence and equipment problems that commonly arise after discharge, thereby reducing readmission risk and improving outcomes [^5a8acef0] [^89e8c6da] [^a3ab95fe].

> I should confirm what to include at that first follow-up. The visit should include room-air ABG to reassess PaO2, PaCO2, and pH; review of oxygen use hours and equipment functioning; smoking status; symptoms of hypercapnia or worsening dyspnea; and consideration of ambulatory oxygen needs if exertional desaturation is present, with flow titration to achieve adequate oxygenation while avoiding CO2 narcosis [^89e8c6da] [^a3ab95fe] [^6f3ab53f].

> But wait, what if the patient stabilizes and no longer meets criteria at 4 weeks? In that scenario, I should still plan a formal reassessment at 60–90 days per GOLD to confirm whether LTOT remains indicated, because early post-exacerbation hypoxemia can resolve and many patients started on oxygen around hospitalization ultimately do not qualify for continued LTOT, reinforcing the need for structured reassessment rather than indefinite continuation [^cf46137b] [^f9fe7065] [^eabe928d].

> Final recommendation: Schedule the first follow-up clinical assessment at 4 weeks to ensure safety and early optimization, with a planned reassessment at 60–90 days to confirm ongoing eligibility and effectiveness; this approach balances BTS safety guidance for rising PaCO2 with GOLD's standard reassessment window and VA/DoD post-discharge recommendations [^5a8acef0] [^cf46137b] [^f9fe7065].

---

The first follow-up assessment after starting LTOT should be scheduled within **4 weeks** [^5a8acef0] to detect early hypercapnia or acidosis and ensure the oxygen prescription is safe and effective. This timing is especially critical in patients with rising PaCO2 or unstable disease, as oxygen can worsen ventilatory control and precipitate respiratory failure [^51aa9abf]. If the patient is clinically stable and no significant PaCO2 rise is observed, routine reassessment at **3 months** [^b41a3ec2] is recommended to confirm ongoing need and adjust therapy [^cf46137b].

---

## Rationale for early follow-up

Early follow-up is essential to:

- **Detect hypercapnia**: Oxygen therapy can suppress hypoxic drive, leading to CO2 retention and respiratory acidosis, especially in patients with baseline hypercapnia or unstable disease [^51aa9abf].

- **Adjust oxygen therapy**: Early reassessment allows titration of oxygen flow to maintain adequate oxygenation while minimizing hypercapnia risk [^89e8c6da].

- **Identify clinical instability**: Patients recovering from exacerbations may have fluctuating gas exchange, necessitating close monitoring and timely intervention [^aa3fa5cc].

---

## Recommended timing of first follow-up assessment

According to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, patients initiating LTOT should have their first follow-up assessment within **4 weeks** [^5a8acef0] of initiation, particularly if there is a rise in PaCO2 or clinical instability. This early assessment should include:

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis**: To evaluate PaO2, PaCO2, and pH, ensuring oxygen therapy is effective and not causing hypercapnia or acidosis [^89e8c6da].

- **Clinical assessment**: Review symptoms, signs of hypercapnia, and overall clinical stability [^a3ab95fe].

- **Oxygen delivery and adherence**: Check oxygen equipment, delivery method, and patient adherence to prescribed oxygen therapy [^a3ab95fe].

---

## Subsequent follow-up assessments

After the initial 4-week assessment, if the patient is stable and no significant hypercapnia or acidosis is observed, routine follow-up should be scheduled at **3 months** [^b41a3ec2] from the initiation of LTOT. This 3-month assessment aims to:

- **Confirm ongoing need**: Reassess oxygen requirements and confirm continued eligibility for LTOT [^cf46137b].

- **Adjust therapy**: Titrate oxygen flow based on current clinical status and ABG results [^89e8c6da].

- **Monitor for complications**: Evaluate for any adverse effects or complications related to long-term oxygen therapy [^228b737a].

---

## Summary of follow-up timeline

| **Assessment** | **Timing** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial follow-up | Within 4 weeks | Detect hypercapnia, adjust oxygen therapy, assess stability [^5a8acef0] |
| Routine follow-up | 3 months | Confirm ongoing need, adjust therapy, monitor complications [^b41a3ec2] |
| Ongoing follow-up | Every 6–12 months | Continued monitoring, therapy adjustment, adherence support [^4b31c828] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed follow-up

Delayed follow-up can lead to **undetected hypercapnia**, worsening respiratory acidosis, and increased risk of respiratory failure [^51aa9abf]. It may also result in inappropriate oxygen therapy — over- or under-titration — and missed opportunities to address adherence issues or equipment problems, ultimately increasing the risk of readmission and negatively affecting outcomes [^a1d00fd7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's severe COPD, recent exacerbation, and elevated PaCO2, the first follow-up assessment should be scheduled within **4 weeks** [^5a8acef0] of initiating LTOT. This early reassessment will ensure safe, effective oxygen therapy and allow timely adjustments to prevent complications. If stable, continue with routine follow-up at 3 months [^b41a3ec2] and then every 6–12 months [^4b31c828].

Objectives

The aim of the study was to assess the extent and quality of follow-up of patients on LTOT.

Setting

The Danish Oxygen Register.

Subjects

A total of 890 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who were on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during the period from 1 November 1994 to 31 August 1995.

Main Outcome Measures

The extent and quality of follow-up.

Results

Only 38.5% of the patients were followed up in the study period, and only 17.5% had a 'sufficient follow-up' defined as at least one follow-up visit within 10 months which included measurement of arterial blood gases or pulsoximetry with oxygen supply, verification that the patient used oxygen ≥ 15 h day-1 and was nonsmoker. Female gender, LTOT initiated 3–12 months ago, LTOT started by a chest physician at pulmonary department and LTOT prescribed ≥ 15 h day-1 were found to be significant predictors of 'sufficient follow-up' (odds ratio (OR): 1.7, 2.0, 3.7 and 1.9, respectively).

Conclusions

The extent and the quality of follow-up of patients on LTOT were poor, especially if a nonpulmonary physician initiated LTOT. We recommend that more attention should be paid on proper monitoring of LTOT, and that only chest physicians should be able to prescribe and re-evaluate LTOT.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for home oxygen, more specifically with respect to follow-up home visits, BTS 2015 guidelines recommend to schedule a home visit within 4 weeks, conducted by a specialist nurse or healthcare professional with experience of domiciliary oxygen therapy, for all patients in whom long-term oxygen therapy is initiated. The visit provides an opportunity to highlight potential risks and should be used to reinforce education and offer support to the patient and carer. Compliance may be checked, along with smoking status, symptoms of hypercapnia and oxygen saturations on oxygen to check that oxygen is therapeutic.

Hospital Discharge, Early Readmissions, and Follow-Up

There are no standards to the timing and nature of hospital discharge, but early readmissions during the first 90 days after discharge are frequent and constitute a significant healthcare problem. A systematic review has shown that comorbidities, previous exacerbations and hospitalizations, and increased length of stay were significant risk factors for 30- and 90-day all-cause readmission after a hospitalized COPD exacerbation. Hence, after an exacerbation, it is good practice to cover education on the correct use of the medications and to provide support at home and a follow-up plan before discharge. Early follow-up (within one month) should also be scheduled, as it has been related to fewer exacerbation-related readmissions. Additional follow-up at three months is recommended to ensure a return to a stable clinical state and permit a review of the patient's symptoms, lung function, and, where possible, the assessment of prognosis using multiple scoring systems, such as the BODE. In addition, arterial oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas assessment will determine the need for long-term oxygen therapy more accurately. The effects of initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation in the first 4 weeks after hospital discharge are unclear.

Prognosis

Long-term prognosis after hospitalization for COPD exacerbation is poor, with a five-year mortality rate of about 50%. Factors independently associated with poor outcome include older age, lower body mass BMI, comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease or lung cancer), previous hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations, clinical severity of the index exacerbation, and need for long-term oxygen therapy at discharge.

### Post-hospitalization short-term oxygen therapy: use of a clinical management pathway and long-term follow-up [^9d61d95c]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Home oxygen therapy is commonly prescribed for patients who remain hypoxemic at hospital discharge, although evidence supporting this practice is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate oxygen prescription and follow-up for patients who were prescribed post-discharge short-term oxygen therapy (STOT) and to assess their long-term outcome.

Methods

A retrospective audit was undertaken of subjects prescribed STOT following hospitalization at a single site in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2011 and December 2015. During the study period, a designated clinical pathway for STOT prescription and follow-up after hospital discharge was in place. Chart review was performed to collect subject demographics and comorbidities, results of oxygen assessment (arterial blood gas and 6-min walk tests) and prescription, and results at follow-up re-assessment and mortality.

Results

Over five 5 years, 205 subjects were prescribed STOT upon hospital discharge. Common indications for oxygen treatment were chronic lung disease (54%) and dyspnea palliation (26%). Of the 152 subjects who were discharged with non-palliative oxygen therapy, 28% did not fulfil the recommended prescribing criteria or did not have recommended assessments. Among the 118 subjects who returned for re-assessment 4 weeks after initial oxygen provision, 47 (40%) did not fulfill criteria for long-term oxygen therapy. The 1-y cumulative survival rate for the study population was 56%.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of subjects who were prescribed post-discharge STOT did not fulfill the recommended prescribing criteria. The long-term prognosis for subjects who were prescribed post-discharge STOT was poor.

Regarding medical management for home oxygen, more specifically with respect to assessment of stability, BTS 2015 guidelines recommend to consider assessing patients for long-term oxygen therapy after < 8 weeks of stability if they exacerbate frequently and are unable to achieve a period of stability lasting 8 weeks. If long-term oxygen therapy is ordered for such patients, they should be counseled that oxygen therapy may no longer be required once they achieve a more stable state.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^b5a260eb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Proper reassessment of home oxygen needs is so important that it has been identified as one of the top five areas for further improvement in adult respiratory medicine by the Choosing Wisely Campaign. According to the TSANZ guideline, patients who commence LTOT after a COPD exacerbation should be reassessed 4–8 weeks after hospital discharge to ensure continued eligibility. In patients prescribed home oxygen for severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia, the 2020 GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the need for oxygen after 60–90 days; when home oxygen is started to treat severe hypoxemia after a COPD exacerbation, the GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the home oxygen requirement at 1–4 weeks and again at 12–16 weeks to update the oxygen prescription as clinically indicated. At the time of reassessments, SpO₂ (or arterial blood gases) at rest and with exertion should be considered. Ideally, reevaluation should occur at home to capture context and barriers to use. Expert opinion suggests that patients should be monitored, at minimum, every 6 months to confirm continued oxygen use, a current oxygen prescription, and adequacy of the equipment used.

Values and preferences

This recommendation places a high value on reducing mortality and a lower value on cost and resource use.

Research needs

The practice of initiating short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge in patients with severe hypoxemia is based on indirect evidence from the NOTT and MRC clinical trial populations with chronic hypoxemia. The harms and benefits of prescribing short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge deserves further study. The panel recommends studies to develop and test the acceptability and effectiveness of easy-to-use ambulatory oxygen equipment that can facilitate LTOT use by patients, to identify strategies that improve adherence to LTOT, and to develop and test strategies to discontinue home oxygen in patients who recover sufficiently after an exacerbation or no longer have a clinical indication for its use. Studies to examine whether some subgroups of patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia (e.g. higher hematocrit, higher mean PAP, early hemodynamic impairment) are more or less likely to benefit from LTOT are also needed.

Question 2: Should long-term oxygen be prescribed for adults with COPD who have moderate chronic resting room air hypoxemia?

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^4905a63e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

When and how should i screen patients for LTOT?

Given the evidence for LTOT, it is important that potential candidates be screened and referred in a timely manner. It is therefore recommended that all patients be screened within their annual COPD assessment. Patients whose resting saturations are ≤ 92% on air during a period of stability should be referred to their local home oxygen service for a formal assessment with arterial blood gas sampling. LTOT should only be prescribed by specialists after a comprehensive review, and it is not something that should be initiated in primary care.

The need to identify patients early must be balanced against the potential for overprescribing LTOT to 'unstable' patients who have not yet fully recovered from an exacerbation. Patients should therefore not be screened for LTOT until they are ⩾8 weeks clear of an exacerbation — thus, our patient would need to be rescreened in 5 weeks' time.

### What happens to patients with COPD with long-term oxygen treatment who receive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation? A 1-year retrospective follow-up study [^b784f2c0]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) on long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) who received invasive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation. Of the 4791 patients, 23% died in the hospital, and 45% died in the subsequent 12 months. 67% of patients were readmitted at least once in the subsequent 12 months, and 26.8% were discharged to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility within 30 days. We conclude that these patients have high mortality rates, both in-hospital and in the 12 months postdischarge. If patients survive, many will be readmitted to the hospital and discharged to nursing home. These potential outcomes may support informed critical care decision making and more preference congruent care.

Discussion

We describe outcomes over 12 months for patients with COPD on LTOT who are treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for acute COPD exacerbation. Beyond mortality, we provide insights into the clinical care trajectories for patients after mechanical ventilation in terms of readmission and nursing home admission.

Patients with advanced COPD are at increased risk for severe COPD exacerbations that require critical care. Our work may be useful to inform patients' decision making about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation in the event of respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, by describing and quantifying survival and outcomes that may affect quality of life such as rehospitalisation and admission to nursing home.

In prior work, we designed a Markov decision model to simulate outcomes for patients with severe COPD who chose alternative advance directives for mechanical ventilation. We estimated 54% 12-month mortality for severe patients with COPD who chose to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (Full Code advance directives) versus 57% for patients who chose not to receive invasive mechanical ventilation. However, Full Code patients had increased rehospitalisations and discharge to nursing home. Other investigators have indicated high mortality for patients with COPD who require mechanical ventilation for COPD-related respiratory failure. Breen et al describe 48.6% 12-month mortality in a retrospective cohort of 74 patients admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure due to COPD.

COPD is a leading cause of hospital readmissions. Most studies report 30-day readmission because this may be more likely a marker of quality of care. The goal of our analysis was to describe outcomes that may be helpful for patients in decision making, and we therefore describe longer-term readmission rates. These readmissions likely reflect the severity of underlying chronic disease and the 'end-of-life' stage of COPD, although the proportion of potentially preventable admissions cannot be measured by this analysis.

In contrast to mortality and readmission rates, few studies have described discharge to nursing home after mechanical ventilation for COPD respiratory failure. Although our current analysis does not include data to assess functional capacity, more than 60% of nursing home residents who have COPD require extensive assistance, or are totally dependent for activities of daily living in other studies. In addition, many patients are unable to be liberated from mechanical ventilationand many of the 26.8% of patients we identified as being discharged to nursing home within 30 days may have remained on mechanical ventilation. Understanding the likelihood of nursing home admission after mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation, described in our study, may be valuable for patients' decision making.

### Resilience and health-related quality of life in patients with pulmonary diseases receiving ambulatory oxygen therapy [^6f3ab53f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There is no consensus regarding when patients should be prescribed ambulatory oxygen therapy. The British Thoracic Society and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2017) recommend that patients with COPD having a resting stable peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of ≤ 88–92% should be referred for a blood gas assessment to assess eligibility for long-term oxygen therapy. Furthermore, assessment should also be made with SpO 2 of ≤ 94% if patients with COPD have peripheral edema, polycythemia (hematocrit ≥ 55%) or pulmonary hypertension. Many patients with pulmonary diseases, including COPD and interstitial fibrosis, started their long-term oxygen therapy with ambulatory oxygen. British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend that ambulatory oxygen therapy should be offered to patients already on long-term oxygen therapy who are mobile outdoors. The 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test can discern whether patients with COPD with a partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) between 60 and 70 mmHg desaturate (SpO 2 ≤ 90%) early or late during their daily living activities. In the García-Talavera et al. study, patients who desaturated after 3.5 min of the 6MWD test did not desaturate in the 24-h pulse oximetry, but those who desaturated during the first minute had a 74% probability of desaturating in their daily activities. Even though the criteria are relatively clear for starting long-term oxygen therapy, ambulatory oxygen has been prescribed without proper patient assessment, counselling, support and follow-up. Thus, patients may use it differently than aimed therapy, resulting in disappointments about the effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen therapy.

### What happens to patients with COPD with long-term oxygen treatment who receive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation? A 1-year retrospective follow-up study [^a4c1e7cf]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Most notably, we used LTOT as a marker of COPD severity. We chose this method as a surrogate marker of advanced/severe COPD because CMS data files do not contain lung function tests. We believe oxygen supplementation is a valid surrogate marker of COPD severity because patients with COPD typically require oxygen supplementation once their lung disease is very advanced. Second, there are limits on the generalisability of our outcomes because the cohort was predominantly white and did not include patients admitted to rural hospitals where practice patterns are likely different. Third, because this was a course-of-disease study, we did not compare outcomes from another group, such as an exacerbated COPD cohort who did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation. A meaningful comparison would require the groups to have similar characteristics (eg, health status and acuity of illness) at the time of ICU admission, which we could not ascertain with the available data.

The outcomes we report have important implications for doctor–patient discussions about prognoses in the event of acute COPD exacerbation and could be useful to patients making informed decisions about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation. Future work will describe the quality of life for patients discharged to a nursing home in an attempt to further inform advance care planning in patients with advanced COPD.

Discussion

This is the first study to compare effectiveness of LTOT duration of 24 and 15 h/day on clinical outcomes in people with chronic respiratory failure, with a potential direct impact on research and clinical management. LTOT is used commonly as it is one of few interventions that can affect prognosis in COPD, but there has been no trial of LTOT in severe hypoxemia since the 1970s. Research in LTOT has been held back by problems and high cost of recruitment and follow-up of patients with advanced disease, and challenges with ethical justification to withhold oxygen 24 h/day in patients with severe hypoxemia for the purpose of conducting a clinical trial even though there is no clear evidence of difference in outcomes between shorter and longer duration LTOT. This study will be by far the largest study in LTOT to date, and the first R-RCT in respiratory medicine. The R-RCT design is a paradigm shift and enables a large-scale, randomized trial in a representative sample of people with very advanced disease, with complete follow-up of main endpoints. This will be the first trial investigating whether LTOT 24 h/day improves important patient outcomes − survival time, risk of hospitalization, levels of symptoms, oxygen side effects, and HrQoL compared with LTOT 15 h/day, or whether LTOT 24 h/day might unnecessarily constraint and burden patients. This study will also for the first time evaluate effects of LTOT by the degree of hypoxaemia and in people with disease other than COPD. Further, evaluating the effect on the risk of hospitalization is crucial as hospitalization is a major driver of health care costs. If COPD hospitalizations can be reduced by LTOT 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day, increased use of long term oxygen treatment could be cost-effective, which will be evaluated in a comprehensive health economic analysis. The trial will also examine the effect of LTOT prescribed 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day on survival and other outcomes, several of which were not assessed in the LOTT trial of patients with moderate hypoxemia. The study will investigate effectiveness of the prescription of LTOT in clinical care. No objective measurement of oxygen use will be used, as there is no accepted, user-friendly objective means of collecting usage data. However self-reported actual oxygen duration will be collected.

### What happens to patients with COPD with long-term oxygen treatment who receive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation? A 1-year retrospective follow-up study [^b9eabc2a]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the USA. The disease follows a progressive course, and patients with advanced disease most often die from respiratory failure or cardiovascular disease. Patients hospitalised for respiratory failure due to COPD (COPD exacerbation) have a 2-year median survival, and 50% of patients who survive hospitalisation are readmitted within 6 months of discharge. In addition, patients with COPD are more likely to die after receiving life-supporting technologies and less likely to receive palliative care compared with lung cancer patients. Unless patients explicitly choose to forego invasive treatments, often the default is to 'do everything' to prolong survival. However, survivors of invasive treatments often have decreased functional capacity, are discharged to a nursing home and have recurrent hospitalisations that may adversely impact quality of life.

Knowledge of these potential outcomes may influence patients' informed decision making about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, few studies have measured outcomes beyond hospital survival for patients with COPD.

In this study, we describe outcomes for patients with COPD on LTOT who are admitted to an ICU for respiratory failure and receive invasive mechanical ventilation. The focus of our analysis is on outcomes that may inform patient-level decision making about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation, including in-hospital and 12-month mortality, readmissions and discharge to nursing home. Further, we describe the association between patient-level factors such as comorbidities and nursing home residence, and these outcomes.

### British thoracic society guidelines for home oxygen use in adults [^a0fd5b34]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Home Oxygen Guideline provides detailed evidence-based guidance for the use of home oxygen for patients out of hospital. Although the majority of evidence comes from the use of oxygen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the scope of the guidance includes patients with a variety of long-term respiratory illnesses and other groups in whom oxygen is currently ordered, such as those with cardiac failure, cancer and end-stage cardiorespiratory disease, terminal illness or cluster headache. It explores the evidence base for the use of different modalities of oxygen therapy and patient-related outcomes such as mortality, symptoms and quality of life. The guideline also makes recommendations for assessment and follow-up protocols, and risk assessments, particularly in the clinically challenging area of home oxygen users who smoke. The guideline development group is aware of the potential for confusion sometimes caused by the current nomenclature for different types of home oxygen, and rather than renaming them, has adopted the approach of clarifying those definitions, and in particular emphasising what is meant by long-term oxygen therapy and palliative oxygen therapy. The home oxygen guideline provides expert consensus opinion in areas where clinical evidence is lacking, and seeks to deliver improved prescribing practice, leading to improved compliance and improved patient outcomes, with consequent increased value to the health service.

Design and participants

The REDOX is a multicenter, single-blinded (analyst), effectiveness, phase IV R-RCT. Current Swedish guidelines recommend LTOT to be used for at least 15–16 h/day but preferably 24 h/day. In the present study, patients starting LTOT will be randomized to either oxygen prescribed 24 h/day or 15 h/day using the Swedish Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox). Clinical follow-up and concurrent treatments are according to routine clinical practice. The main endpoints of mortality, hospitalizations, and incident disease are assessed using Swedish registry data, with expected complete follow-up due to compulsory registrations nationally. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using postal questionnaire at three and 12 months. The study is managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research Center (UCR), a clinical trial unit with great experience from national randomized controlled trials. All 48 centers prescribing LTOT in the Swedish Quality Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox) are invited to participate in the trial. The study design is outlined in Fig. 1. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial are listed in Table 2. As all patients eligible for starting LTOT are included regardless of the underlying disease, the overall study population is expected to be heterogeneous. The main analysis will be in the defined group of patients with spirometrically verified COPD and severe hypoxemia. Secondary analyses will also be performed in sub populations listed in Table 3.

### Long-term continuous oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: proper use, benefits and unresolved issues [^754c4c44]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Long-term oxygen treatment is one of the few interventions that improve survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and it is widely used even though published evidence supporting the use of this treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is scanty. In addition, some studies do not demonstrate a mortality benefit for long-term oxygen treatment in this disease. It is important that long-term oxygen treatment be administered only to those patients who will benefit and in a manner that maximizes its efficacy. New studies are urgently needed to address these questions.

Recent Findings

The published evidence for and against the use of long-term oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is summarized and problems with current guidelines and important areas for future research are discussed.

Summary

Future research will address the optimal timing and duration of oxygen therapy during rest, exercise and sleep, ways of identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who are most likely to benefit and ways of improving patient compliance, all of which may have a profound effect on clinical practice.

### Time to desaturation less than one minute predicts the need for long-term home oxygen therapy [^349e110e]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise desaturation in patients with COPD is a pathophysiological phenomenon that is not wholly understood and whose clinical consequences are still unclear.

Methods

Eighty-three patients with moderate to severe COPD and P(aO(2)) > 60 mm Hg who desaturated during the 6-min walk test were followed for 5 years. Forty-eight patients had early desaturation (S(pO(2)) fell below 90% less than one minute after starting the walk test). Spirometry, blood-gas measurements, and 6-min walk tests were performed every 6 months. We recorded 6-min walk distance, baseline S(pO(2)), lowest S(pO(2)), and the time to S(pO(2)) < 90%. In each control, stable patients with severe hypoxia at rest who required long-term oxygen therapy were identified.

Results

Upon completion of the study, 65% of the early desaturators had developed severe hypoxemia and required long-term home oxygen, versus 11% in the non-early desaturators (P < .001).

Conclusions

In patients with moderate to severe COPD, desaturation within the first minute of the 6-min walk test predicts the need for long-term home oxygen at 5-year follow-up.

### Long-term oxygen therapy for 24 or 15 hours per day in severe hypoxemia [^977bea98]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen supplementation for at least 15 hours per day prolongs survival among patients with severe hypoxemia. On the basis of a nonrandomized comparison, long-term oxygen therapy has been recommended to be used for 24 hours per day, a more burdensome regimen.

Methods

To test the hypothesis that long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day does not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death at 1 year than therapy for 15 hours per day, we conducted a multicenter, registry-based, randomized, controlled trial involving patients who were starting oxygen therapy for chronic, severe hypoxemia at rest. The patients were randomly assigned to receive long-term oxygen therapy for 24 or 15 hours per day. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of hospitalization or death from any cause within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome assessed at 3 and 12 months.

Results

Between May 18, 2018, and April 4, 2022, a total of 241 patients were randomly assigned to receive long-term oxygen therapy for 24 hours per day (117 patients) or 15 hours per day (124 patients). No patient was lost to follow-up. At 12 months, the median patient-reported daily duration of oxygen therapy was 24.0 hours (interquartile range, 21.0 to 24.0) in the 24-hour group and 15.0 hours (interquartile range, 15.0 to 16.0) in the 15-hour group. The risk of hospitalization or death within 1 year in the 24-hour group was not lower than that in the 15-hour group (mean rate, 124.7 and 124.5 events per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 1.36; 90% CI, 0.76 to 1.29; P = 0.007 for nonsuperiority). The groups did not differ substantially in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause, death from any cause, or adverse events.

Conclusions

Among patients with severe hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day did not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death within 1 year than therapy for 15 hours per day. (Funded by the Crafoord Foundation and others; REDOX ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03441204.).

### Long-term outcomes following first short-term clinically important deterioration in COPD [^824881b6]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this retrospective analysis of two 3-year COPD studies demonstrate that short-term deterioration assessed using a composite CID endpoint had prognostic value in identifying patients with increased future risk of a sustained loss of lung function and health status, and importantly increased incidence of exacerbations requiring hospitalization and all-cause mortality. This concept of evaluating short-term changes across multiple endpoints may be a useful tool for physicians in identifying patients at greater risk of worsening of COPD and in designing trials to test treatments that may mitigate that risk.

### Predictors of first-year survival in patients with advanced COPD treated using long-term oxygen therapy [^137d4d04]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Little evidence-based guidance is available to aid clinicians in determining short-term prognoses in very severe COPD patients. Therefore, the present study was designed to provide a prospective assessment (1) of the mortality rates and (2) whether the baseline measurements may be determinants of 1-year mortality in hypoxemic COPD patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Seventy-eight clinically stable patients with advanced COPD treated using LTOT were enrolled in a prospective cohort study.

Outcome Variable

first-year mortality. Baseline measurements: categorical variables: age (< 60 or ≥ 60 years); gender; body mass index (< 20 or ≥ 20 kg/m(2)); fat-free mass (FFM) index (< 16 [men] and < 15 kg/m(2) [women]; baseline dyspnea index (BDI) (≤ 3 or > 3); and corticosteroid use. Continuous variables: smoking history; lung function; FFM; fat mass; hemoglobin; hematocrit; arterial blood gases; forearm muscle strength; St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); and comorbidity score. By the end of 1-year of follow-up, 12 patients (15.4%) had died. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that BDI ≤ 3 was the only variable associated with higher mortality. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that lower PaO(2) and SpO(2), higher PaCO(2) and SGRQ scores were associated with reduced survival. In the multivariate analysis, BDI remained predictive of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31–0.81), as did PaO(2) (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26–0.95). These data suggest that readily available parameters as dyspnea intensity and hypoxemia severity may be useful in predicting first-year survival rates in advanced COPD patients receiving LTOT.

### Patient-assessed quality of virtual consultations as follow-up on long-term oxygen therapy for patients with COPD [^62e53959]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) can increase survival time and relieve symptom burden in patients with COPD and chronic hypoxemia. The Department of Respiratory Medicine at Odense University Hospital invites patients with LTOT and COPD to the out-patient clinic for treatment evaluation every 6 months to regulate or terminate treatment and support patients' treatment adherence. The out-patient clinic, however, experiences many absences or cancellations from patients. For that reason, patients were offered virtual consultation as an alternative to physical attendance. This study was initiated to uncover reasons for absences and the patients' experiences of virtual consultation to promote a more patient-centered clinical practice for patients with COPD and LTOT.

Methods

A qualitative study encompassing semi-structured interviews with 20 subjects was conducted in the winter of 2021. The subjects had tried or been given the opportunity of virtual consultation. Data were analyzed inspired by Kvale and Brinkmann focusing on the subject's perspectives on virtual consultation.

Results

The analysis resulted in 3 main themes: limitations and vulnerabilities, independence and quality of life, and personal strategies. Subjects expressed that everyday life with LTOT and COPD was characterized by limited resources in terms of energy, oxygen, and time. LTOT was perceived as a necessary means to maintain a sense of independence and quality of life. However, LTOT also meant additional limitations due to cumbersome equipment and feelings of isolation. Most subjects considered the virtual consultation to be oxygen-, energy-, and time-preserving, as it meant avoiding stressful transportation and handling of oxygen cylinders, COVID-19 exposure, waiting time, and not having to involve others for help.

Conclusions

The subjects' perspective showed that follow-up on LTOT as a virtual consultation was considered a valuable offer. The chosen method was found to be relevant in uncovering subjects' attitudes toward clinical practice procedures.

Regarding respiratory support for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to long-term oxygen therapy, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to do not offer long-term oxygen therapy routinely in patients with stable COPD and moderate resting or exercise-induced arterial desaturation, as it does not lengthen the time to death or first hospitalization nor provides sustained benefit in health status, lung function, or 6-minute walk distance.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^5a14befc]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a mainstay treatment for patients with severe resting hypoxemia secondary to chronic respiratory conditions including COPD. The evidence for LTOT is based on two trials that are now several decades old but have been insufficiently revisited. Therefore, many questions remain about precisely which patients experience the most benefit from LTOT, as well as how to define that benefit. Most studies have examined LTOT's effect on longevity rather than its impact on quality of life. In addition, many challenges exist in training both clinicians and patients on best practices for LTOT and associated equipment. Reimbursement policies have reduced the kinds of equipment available to the LTOT patient community, presenting additional challenges. This paper will review the current evidence for LTOT in COPD, the challenges involved with providing optimal therapy, and potential avenues of modernizing this essential intervention.

### A prospective study of 12-week respiratory outcomes in COVID-19-related hospitalisations [^64d6419e]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

The long-term respiratory morbidity of COVID-19 remains unclear. We describe the clinical, radiological and pulmonary function abnormalities that persist in previously hospitalised patients assessed 12 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset, and identify clinical predictors of respiratory outcomes. At least one pulmonary function variable was abnormal in 58% of patients and 88% had abnormal imaging on chest CT. There was strong association between days on oxygen supplementation during the acute phase of COVID-19 and both DLCO-% (diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide) predicted and total CT score. These findings highlight the need to develop treatment strategies and the importance of long-term respiratory follow-up after hospitalisation for COVID-19.

### A model of quality assessment in patients on long-term oxygen therapy [^e81e8278]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The difficulty of implementing guidelines for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) has been recognized. We performed this analysis to evaluate the impact of a national quality assurance register on the quality of LTOT and to suggest indicators with levels for excellent quality LTOT.

Methods

Based on national register data on Swedish LTOT patients in 1987–2005, we measured nine quality indicators and the achievement levels of the participating counties in fulfilling these treatment criteria.

Results

There were improvements in the following eight quality indicators: access to LTOT, PaO(2) ≤ 7.3 kPa without oxygen, no current smoking, low number of thoracic deformity patients without concomitant home mechanical ventilation, > 16 h of oxygen/day, mobile oxygen equipment, reassessment of hypoxemia when LTOT was not started in a stable state of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and avoidance of continuous oral glucocorticosteroids in COPD. There was decline in the quality indicator PaO(2) > 8 kPa on oxygen. After improvements, three criteria were fulfilled by ≥ 80% of the counties in 2004–2005.

Conclusions

We found improvements in eight of nine quality indicators. We suggest these indicators with levels for excellent quality for use in quality assurance of LTOT based on our results.

Follow-up of Patients with COPD Who Developed COVID-19

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology that were consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients, thus the follow up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

Patients who developed mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD. Patients who developed moderate COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during/after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at a high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the underlying conditions before they became severely ill.

There are informative candidate models for the comprehensive management of complex care delivery that are already published and undergoing study in a primary care setting, and these may be adapted for application after COVID-19.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^98cb17c0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Unanswered questions and research priorities

There are no studies examining which hospitalized patients will have resolution of hypercapnia versus those who will not, nor has the time course of resolution after an acute exacerbation of COPD been thoroughly examined. Thus, the ideal time to evaluate (or reassess) appropriateness of NIV is not known. Long-term studies with extended follow-up are needed to see whether differential outcomes are maintained after prolonged outpatient therapy, including outcomes such as exacerbations, rehospitalizations, and QOL. Finally, there are no data regarding cost-effectiveness in the United States, although on the basis of costs in the United Kingdom, the use of long-term NIV is likely to be commensurate with other therapies considered to be cost-effective.

Question 4: Should long-term NIV settings be determined by an in-laboratory overnight PSG in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD?

Recommendation

We suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight PSG to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

Background

There is little guidance about how to initiate NIV in patients with COPD. Trials outside the United States sometimes adjust settings over time (e.g. 1–2 wk) while patients are hospitalized. Initiation in a sleep laboratory might allow for acclimatization to equipment and might provide additional education from sleep technicians. Conversely, PSG and real-time Pa CO 2 measurement tools constitute a limited resource in most settings.

### Long-term mortality and health-related quality of life with lower versus higher oxygenation targets in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia [^7918ab12]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this one-year follow-up of the HOT-COVID trial, we assessed the long-term effects of a lower versus a higher oxygenation target on mortality and HRQoL in ICU patients with COVID-19 and hypoxaemic respiratory failure. We found that targeting a PaO 2 of 8 kPa (60 mmHg) versus 12 kPa (90 mmHg) did not lead to statistically significant improvements in mortality or HRQoL. Similar results were observed in secondary and post-hoc analyses including the 110 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the HOT-ICU trial.

Albeit we did not find any statistically significant between-group difference in one-year mortality, the survival curves appear to separate early; a separation that was still present after one year, with 33.6% of patients having died in the lower-oxygenation group and 39.1% in the higher-oxygenation group. Importantly, our findings are consistent with the primary results of the HOT-COVID trial, which demonstrated a benefit from the lower oxygenation target with significantly more days alive without life support in 90 days mainly due to more days alive without mechanical ventilation. In recent years, several trials have investigated different oxygenation targets in the ICU setting. A recent Cochrane review on this topic analysed 16 RCTs with follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 12 months and found no mortality difference between lower and higher oxygenation strategies. However, these trials varied significantly in terms of the included populations, applied interventions, and timing of follow-up. Notably, at the time of the review, only the HOT-ICU trial included patients with COVID-19. The HOT-COVID trial was approved as an amendment to the HOT-ICU trial protocol and tested similar interventions as the parent trial. However, the HOT-COVID trial stands out among other trials investigating targeted oxygenation due to the etiological homogeneity of the population of interest and the fact that less than 25% of patients were invasively mechanically ventilated at baseline. This is likely a consequence of increased use of high-flow nasal oxygen in COVID-19 patients after the first wave of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the overall mortality rates of the HOT-COVID trial are comparable to those reported elsewhere.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^228b737a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up and monitoring — Patients should be reviewed after a suitable interval (shorter in more severe patients and longer in less severe patients) with assessment of symptoms using either the CAT or mMRC scores and exacerbation frequency; the effect of treatment and possible adverse effects should be evaluated and comorbidities reassessed. Inhaler technique, adherence, smoking status and continued exposure to risk factors should be regularly checked; physical activity should be encouraged; referral for pulmonary rehabilitation considered in severe patients; and the need for oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilatory support, lung volume reduction and palliative approaches considered individually with the action plan updated. Spirometry should be repeated at least annually, and if the patient is already receiving bronchodilator treatment, the latter should not be interrupted for performing spirometry. The report states that we no longer refer to asthma and COPD overlap (ACO) and emphasizes that asthma and COPD are different disorders; asthma and COPD may coexist, and if a concurrent diagnosis of asthma is suspected, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines.

### Evaluation of oxygen prescription in relation to hospital admission rate in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^801c7b40]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We also chose to look at mortality in the patients given oxygen, as it was apparent from the high Charlson indices, poor lung function and ABG results that this population was very unwell, and reducing mortality is a key aim of LTOT use. We confirmed that respiratory deaths were common, highly likely to occur within a few years of starting oxygen, and more likely when oxygen is indicated. It is important to note that we found no evidence of harm resulting from oxygen prescription, particularly there were no admissions or deaths related to oxygen use in patients given it against current guidance.

In our study LTOT was stopped in 40.3% of patients after specialist review, a figure consistent with previous work, suggesting our results are likely to be generalisable. It is possible that some of these patients may require oxygen other than LTOT, and therefore assessment for ambulatory oxygen alone – this was not a feature we could examine in our data, although it has been suggested that such assessments may be a drain on oxygen assessment services. There are significant numbers of COPD patients who exhibit desaturation on exercise, although they are normoxaemic at rest. This predicts mortality and subsequent need of LTOT. Trials of ambulatory oxygen have varied in their design and outcome measures, such that a recent review concluded further evidence was needed. Cochrane continue to advocate individual assessment, rather than a guideline based approach, for this reason. It remains unclear whether home ambulatory oxygen use is beneficial; self-reported improvements in activity levels and exercise tolerance did not match well to objective measures of exercise capacity in previous work. Short burst oxygen therapy (SBOT) has been the subject of a systematic review and meta-analysis, and shown to provide no symptomatic benefits. Consequently use of home oxygen outside of the setting of LTOT remains controversial; when the Long term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT;) reports results, some of these questions may be answered. Given this uncertainty, whilst we acknowledge that lack of data on ambulatory oxygen needs is a potential weakness we do not think it clinically significant.

### Characteristics at the time of oxygen initiation associated with its adherence: findings from the COPD long-term oxygen treatment trial [^ed38976a]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Characteristics associated with adherence to long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in COPD remain unclear.

Objectives

To identify patient characteristics at the time of oxygen initiation associated with its adherence.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 359 COPD participants assigned to oxygen in the Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. Participants were prescribed continuous (n = 214) or intermittent (n = 145) oxygen based on desaturation patterns at study entry. At the time of initial prescription, participants rated their perceived readiness, confidence, and importance to use oxygen on a 0–10 scale (0 = not at all, 10 = very much). During follow-up, they self-reported average hours per day of use (adherence). Adherence was averaged over short-term (0–30 days), medium-term (months 9–12), and long-term (month 13 to last follow-up) intervals. Multivariable logistic regression models explored characteristics associated with high adherence (≥ 16 h/day [continuous] or ≥ 8 h/day [intermittent]) during each time interval.

Results

Participant readiness, confidence, and importance at the time of oxygen initiation were associated with high short- and medium-term adherence. For each unit increase in baseline readiness, the odds of high short-term adherence increased by 21% (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.40) and 94% (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.45–2.59) in the continuous and intermittent groups, respectively. In both groups, high adherence in the medium-term was associated with high adherence in the long-term (continuous, OR 12.49, 95% CI 4.90–31.79; intermittent, OR 38.08, 95% CI 6.96–208.20).

Conclusions

Readiness, confidence, and importance to use LTOT at initiation, and early high adherence, are significantly associated with long-term oxygen adherence.

If LTOT 24 h/day is found to be non-superior to 15 h/day, this will confirm that patients safely can be free of supplemental oxygen for up to nine hours per day. If not, LTOT 24 h/day may be superior which implies the importance of oxygen therapy in chronic respiratory failure and the relevance of implementing services to facilitate and optimize the daily duration of LTOT. The trial design will provide robust, detailed data using validated instruments that enable correlational analyses of factors influencing the adherence to and net clinical effectiveness of LTOT in patients with respiratory failure in current clinical practice. The study also aims to take forward an infrastructure for randomized trials that can be used to facilitate research and improved evidence-based treatment in patients with chronic respiratory failure.

### Oxygen therapy for patients with COPD: current evidence and the long-term oxygen treatment trial [^5ff5d76f]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term use of supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. However, the role of oxygen in symptomatic patients with COPD and more moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with activity is unclear. The few long-term reports of supplemental oxygen in this group have been of small size and insufficient to demonstrate a survival benefit. Short-term trials have suggested beneficial effects other than survival in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest. In addition, supplemental oxygen appeared to improve exercise performance in small short-term investigations of patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with exercise, but long-term trials evaluating patient-reported outcomes are lacking. This article reviews the evidence for long-term use of supplemental oxygen therapy and provides a rationale for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. The trial plans to enroll subjects with COPD with moderate hypoxemia at rest or desaturation with exercise and compare tailored oxygen therapy to no oxygen therapy.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^f51d3e81]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) positive airway pressure (PAP) good practice statements — Treatment of OSA with PAP therapy should be based on a diagnosis of OSA established using objective testing. Adequate follow-up, including close monitoring of objective device and usage data to ensure adequate treatment and adherence, should occur following PAP therapy initiation and during treatment of OSA. This good practice statement applies specifically to a new diagnosis of OSA, which should be established by either a home sleep apnea test or in-laboratory sleep testing prior to initiation of treatment for OSA, and patients with a previously established diagnosis of OSA who are currently on PAP therapy and have good symptom control should continue PAP therapy, even when prior testing results are not readily available. OSA is a chronic disease that rarely resolves except with substantial weight loss or successful corrective surgery, and periodic follow-up by a qualified clinician is necessary to confirm adequate treatment, assess symptom resolution, and promote continued adherence. Initial treatment of OSA requires close monitoring and early identification of difficulties with PAP use, as adherence over the first few days to weeks has been shown to predict long-term adherence, and objective monitoring of PAP therapy should be performed to complement patient reporting. The timing of follow-up varies by patient, but patients should be followed in the initial weeks to months after PAP initiation to promote adherence and assess response to treatment, with subsequently yearly evaluation reasonable, and more frequent follow-up for persistent or recurrent symptoms or difficulties with PAP use.

### Effects of long-term oxygen therapy on acute exacerbation and hospital burden: the national DISCOVERY study [^7222aa8f]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in patients with chronic severe resting hypoxaemia, but effects on hospitalisation are unknown. This study evaluated the potential impact of starting LTOT on acute exacerbation and hospital burden in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Methods

Longitudinal analysis of consecutive patients in the population-based Swedish DISCOVERY cohort who started LTOT between 2000 and 2018 with a follow-up duration ≥ 3 months. Total and hospitalised acute exacerbations of the underlying disease, all-cause hospitalisations, and all-cause outpatient visits were annualised and compared between the year before and after LTOT initiation for each disease cohort, and by hypercapnic status in patients with COPD.

Results

Patients with COPD (n = 10134) had significant reduction in annualised rates of total and hospitalised acute exacerbations, as well as all-cause hospitalisations, following LTOT initiation, with increment in those with ILD (n = 2507) and PH (n = 850). All-cause outpatient visits increased across all cohorts following LTOT initiation. Similar findings were observed in patients with hypercapnic and non-hypercapnic COPD. Sensitivity analyses of patients with 12 months of follow-up showed reduced acute exacerbations and all-cause hospitalisations in the ILD and PH cohorts.

Conclusion

LTOT is associated with reduced rates of both total and hospitalised acute exacerbations and all-cause hospitalisations in patients with COPD, as well as patients with ILD and PH with 12 months of follow-up. There is increased all-cause outpatient visits in all disease groups following LTOT initiation.

Oral appliance (OA) therapy monitoring and follow-up — unattended PM may be indicated to monitor the response to non-CPAP treatments for OSA, including OAs (Consensus). Once optimal fit is obtained and efficacy shown, follow-up with dental specialist is recommended every 6 months for the first year, and at least annually thereafter. The purpose of follow-up is to monitor patient adherence, evaluate device deterioration or maladjustment, evaluate the health of the oral structures and integrity of the occlusion, and assess the patient for signs and symptoms of worsening OSA. During all phases of assessment, therapy, and follow-up, patients should have access to a care team with appropriate dental personnel, educators, support groups, and sleep specialists (Consensus).

### A randomized trial of long-term oxygen for COPD with moderate desaturation [^3842dbe4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen has unknown efficacy in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation.

Methods

We originally designed the trial to test whether long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen would result in a longer time to death than no use of supplemental oxygen among patients who had stable COPD with moderate resting desaturation (oxyhemoglobin saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo 2], 89 to 93%). After 7 months and the randomization of 34 patients, the trial was redesigned to also include patients who had stable COPD with moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, Spo 2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds) and to incorporate the time to the first hospitalization for any cause into the new composite primary outcome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term supplemental oxygen (supplemental-oxygen group) or no long-term supplemental oxygen (no-supplemental-oxygen group). In the supplemental-oxygen group, patients with resting desaturation were prescribed 24-hour oxygen, and those with desaturation only during exercise were prescribed oxygen during exercise and sleep. The trial-group assignment was not masked.

Results

A total of 738 patients at 42 centers were followed for 1 to 6 years. In a time-to-event analysis, we found no significant difference between the supplemental-oxygen group and the no-supplemental-oxygen group in the time to death or first hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.12; P = 0.52), nor in the rates of all hospitalizations (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.13), COPD exacerbations (rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.19), and COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.17). We found no consistent between-group differences in measures of quality of life, lung function, and the distance walked in 6 minutes.

Conclusions

In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, the prescription of long-term supplemental oxygen did not result in a longer time to death or first hospitalization than no long-term supplemental oxygen, nor did it provide sustained benefit with regard to any of the other measured outcomes.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is described as having cost with few adverse clinical effects, with the major hazard being fires or explosions, and prescribing LOTT for current smokers is controversial. We recommend: Studies that measure the effects of LTOT on outcomes in various COPD subtypes. Examples of subtypes that warrant evaluation include patients with mild and moderate hypoxemia, desaturation with exertion, desaturation during sleep, comorbid heart disease, frequent exacerbations, decreased exercise capacity, or pulmonary hypertension. Studies that evaluate the effect of LTOT on physical activity and the relationship of this effect on other outcomes, such as quality of life, frequency of exacerbations, and mortality. Studies that compare the effects of various modalities of LTOT (e.g., continuous, exercise, sleep, combined, with or without flow titration) on outcomes in different patient subtypes.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^1ab974f7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

Evaluate for other contributing diagnoses and co-occurring conditions and "Obtain diagnostic spirometry if available (see Recommendation 1)". Next, determine "Is there a confident clinical diagnosis of COPD?" with the no branch to "Treat or refer as clinically indicated". For confirmed COPD, "Offer prevention and risk reduction methods including smoking cessation, vaccination, and patient education" and "Suggest spirometry if not already completed", then assess "Is patient chronically symptomatic and/or has patient had a moderate to severe exacerbation in the past year? (see Sidebar 1)". If symptoms persist, "consider need to initiate/adjust medication and assess inhaler technique", "ensure patient is on a SABA (PRN)", and escalate with "First line LAMA", "Add LABA for severe symptoms (preferably combination inhaler)", "Add ICS only for continued moderate to severe exacerbations (see Sidebar 1)", and "Pulmonology referral". For hypoxemia, "Consider need for oxygen if patient has resting hypoxemia (refer to home oxygen clinic if appropriate)". Ongoing care includes "Continue follow-up and monitoring", "Reassess severity periodically", "Consider pulmonary rehabilitation", "Consider medication adjustment if patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid (see Module C)", "Consider offering referral to a pulmonologist or a palliative care specialist as appropriate for patients with persistent refractory dyspnea", and "Carefully consider alternatives to beta blockers for non-cardiac indications (e.g. HTN)".

U. Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy
U1. Lower the oxygen concentration if the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation is above the target range or if it has been in the upper zone of the target range for some time (usually 4–8 hours) (grade D).
U2. If the target saturation is maintained, the new delivery system and flow should be continued. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required. If the patient is stable, the process can be repeated and the patient can eventually be weaned off oxygen (see section 12) (grade D).
U3. Most stable convalescent patients will eventually be stepped down to 2 L/min via nasal cannulae prior to cessation of oxygen therapy. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure may be stepped down to 1 L/min (or occasionally 0.5 L/min) via nasal cannulae or a 24% Venturi mask at 2 L/min as the lowest oxygen concentration prior to cessation of oxygen therapy (grade D).
U4. Oxygen therapy should be stopped once a patient is clinically stable on low-concentration oxygen, and the oxygen saturation is within the desired range on two consecutive observations (but the prescription for a target saturation range should remain active in case of future deterioration). It may be appropriate to alter the target range following senior review in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease who either have saturations < 94% when stable or in whom it is deemed sensible to discharge from hospital with saturations < 94% pending an outpatient oxygen assessment. Oxygen should also be stopped if the patient has come to the end of a written protocol of timed oxygen (eg, postoperatively) (grade D).
U5. Oxygen saturation on air should be monitored for 5 min after stopping oxygen therapy. If it remains in the desired range, it should be rechecked at 1 hour (grade D).
U6. If the oxygen saturation and physiological 'track and trigger' score (eg, NEWS) is satisfactory at 1 hour, the patient has safely discontinued oxygen therapy. However, saturation and physiology should continue to be monitored on a regular basis according to the patient's underlying clinical condition (grade D).
U7. If the saturation falls below the patient's target range on stopping oxygen therapy, restart the lowest concentration that maintained the patient in the target range and monitor for 5 min. If this restores the saturation into the target range, continue oxygen therapy at this level and attempt discontinuation of oxygen therapy again at a later date provided the patient remains clinically stable (grade D).
U8. If a patient requires oxygen therapy to be restarted at a higher concentration than before to maintain the same target saturation range, the patient should have a clinical review to establish the cause for this deterioration (grade D).
U9. Some patients may have episodic hypoxaemia (eg, after minor exertion or due to mucus plugging) after they have safely discontinued oxygen therapy. An on-going prescription for a target saturation range will allow these patients to receive oxygen as the need arises but transient asymptomatic desaturation does not require correction (grade D).

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management… [^992a152c]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis.

Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations. 3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms.

27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. **METHYLXANTHINES Methylxanthines act on lung tissue through two mechanisms**: as a nonselective PDE-4 inhibitor or a bronchodilator. Because of a low therapeutic ratio, low toxicity thresholds, and significant interactions with other commonly used medications, methylxanthines are not generally recommended. 3, 29.

We conducted secondary analyses of Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) data. The trial enrolled patients with COPD with moderate resting or exertional hypoxemia between 2009 and 2015. Our exposure was the patient-reported inhaled regimen at enrollment, categorized as either aligning with, undertreating, or potentially overtreating per the 2017 GOLD strategy. Our primary composite outcome was time to death or first hospitalization for COPD. Additional outcomes included individual components of the composite outcome and time to first exacerbation. We generated multivariable Cox proportional hazard models across strata of GOLD-predicted exacerbation risk (high vs low) to estimate between-group hazard ratios for time to event outcomes. We adjusted models a priori for potential confounders, clustered by site.

Results

The trial enrolled 738 patients (73.4% men; mean age, 68.8 years). Of the patients, 571 (77.4%) were low risk for future exacerbations. Of the patients, 233 (31.6%) reported regimens aligning with GOLD recommendations; most regimens (54.1%) potentially overtreated. During a 2.3-year median follow-up, 332 patients (44.9%) experienced the composite outcome. We found no difference in time to composite outcome or death among patients reporting regimens aligning with recommendations compared with undertreated patients. Among patients at low risk, potential overtreatment was associated with higher exacerbation risk (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09–1.87), whereas inhaled corticosteroid treatment was associated with 64% higher risk of pneumonia (incidence rate ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01–2.66).

Interpretation

Among patients with COPD with moderate hypoxemia, we found no difference in clinical outcomes between inhaled regimens aligning with the 2017 GOLD strategy compared with those that were undertreated. These findings suggest the need to reevaluate the effectiveness of risk stratification model-based inhaled treatment strategies.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^6b830da2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in COPD — LTOT reverses hypoxemia, and in severe hypoxemia defined as PaO2 ≤ 55 mm Hg, LTOT improved survival; a separate trial showed oxygen administered 19 h/d improved survival versus 12 h/d. In moderate hypoxemia defined as PaO2 < 69 mm Hg, LTOT showed no effect on survival regardless of daily duration, and nocturnal oxygen therapy versus no nocturnal oxygen therapy also found no effect on survival. Trials were limited by small sample sizes and events with only 370 patients and 164 deaths collectively. These data suggest that LTOT has a mortality benefit that may be related to the severity of hypoxemia.

### Randomized trial of nocturnal oxygen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^58b143ad]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic severe daytime hypoxemia. However, the efficacy of oxygen therapy for the management of isolated nocturnal hypoxemia is uncertain.

Methods

We designed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine, in patients with COPD who have nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation without qualifying for long-term oxygen therapy, whether nocturnal oxygen provided for a period of 3 to 4 years would decrease mortality or the worsening of disease such that patients meet current specifications for long-term oxygen therapy. Patients with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of the recording time on nocturnal oximetry were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either nocturnal oxygen or ambient air from a sham concentrator (placebo). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause or a requirement for long-term oxygen therapy as defined by the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) criteria in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Recruitment was stopped prematurely because of recruitment and retention difficulties after 243 patients, of a projected 600, had undergone randomization at 28 centers. At 3 years of follow-up, 39.0% of the patients assigned to nocturnal oxygen (48 of 123) and 42.0% of those assigned to placebo (50 of 119) met the NOTT-defined criteria for long-term oxygen therapy or had died (difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -15.1 to 9.1).

Conclusions

Our underpowered trial provides no indication that nocturnal oxygen has a positive or negative effect on survival or progression to long-term oxygen therapy in patients with COPD. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; INOX ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01044628.).

### A randomized trial of long-term oxygen for COPD with moderate desaturation [^204af746]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study LTOT was published by Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial Research Group and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Dyspnea in palliative care. In the LTOT study, the trial question was: what is the role of long-term supplemental oxygen in patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation? In the LTOT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LTOT study, the population was: 738 patients (196 female, 542 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with stable COPD who had moderate resting desaturation (SpO2 89–93%) and moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, SpO2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds). The key exclusion criteria were COPD exacerbations requiring antibiotics, thoracic surgery or other procedures in the 6 months before randomization, non-COPD lung disease affecting oxygenation or survival, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 15, desaturation < 80% for at least 1 minute during the 6-minute walk, or disease or condition expected to cause death or inability to perform procedures within 6 months of randomization. In the LTOT study, the interventions were: n = 368 supplemental oxygen (long-term supplemental oxygen with 24-hour oxygen for patients with resting desaturation and oxygen during exercise and sleep for patients with desaturation only during exercise) n = 370 no supplemental oxygen (no long-term supplemental oxygen). In the LTOT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of death or first hospitalization (36.4/100 py vs. 34.2/100 py; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26). In the LTOT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of death (5.7/100 py vs. 5.2/100 py; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.56) No significant difference in the incidence of hospitalization (34.5/100 py vs. 31.6/100 py; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.29). In the LTOT study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in adverse events (51 vs. 0). In the LTOT study, the conclusion was: in patients with stable COPD who had moderate resting desaturation (SpO2 89–93%) and moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, SpO2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds), supplemental oxygen was not superior to no supplemental oxygen with respect to the incidence of death or first hospitalization.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Ongoing evaluation of patients — once the nature and cause of the structural abnormalities leading to the development of HF have been defined, healthcare providers should focus on the clinical assessment of patients, both during the initial presentation and during subsequent visits. This clinical assessment should identify symptoms and their functional consequences and should evaluate the short- and long-term risks of disease progression and death whenever appropriate. This ongoing review of the patient's clinical status is critical to the appropriate selection and monitoring of treatments.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2e35199f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

We suggest not using in-hospital initiation of long-term NIV after an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Background

COPD exacerbations are a key cause of morbidity and mortality and place a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Unfortunately, patients often do not recover to the baseline amount of lung function or degree of symptoms, and COPD exacerbations are therefore an important contributor to worse outcomes, including lung-function decline, poorer QOL, and increased risk of death. After discharge, 60–80% of the patients are readmitted within 1 year, and 30–49% die within this first year after their hospital admission for an acute COPD exacerbation. These disappointing outcomes raised the question of whether long-term NIV should be provided to patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of COPD.

Summary of the evidence

We identified four RCTs evaluating the use of long-term NIV after an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Pooled data suggest that there are no major differences in mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.25; low certainty), exacerbations (MD, 0.3 fewer; 95% CI, 1.17 fewer to 0.57 more; low certainty), the need for hospitalization (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.24; very low certainty), changes in dyspnea (MD, 0.8 points lower; 95% CI, 2.17 points lower to 0.58 points higher; low certainty), QOL (MD, 2.89 points higher; 95% CI, 1.03 points lower to 6.8 points higher; low certainty), or exercise tolerance measured with 6MWD (MD, 8.64 m lower; 95% CI, 209 m lower to 192 m higher; very low certainty) when using NIV. There was a significant reduction in PaCO₂ (MD, 3.41 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.09 to 2.73 mm Hg lower; moderate certainty), but there was no improvement in PaO₂ (MD, 1.53 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.24 mm Hg lower to 1.17 mm Hg higher; very low certainty) or FEV₁ (SMD, 0.36 SD; 95% CI, −0.74 to 0.03; low certainty).

### The clinical management in extremely severe COPD [^9f82c733]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 6% of the general population and is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States with severe and very severe disease accounting for 15% and 3% of physician diagnoses of COPD. Guidelines make few recommendations regarding providing the provision of care for the most severe stages of disease, namely Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages III and IV with chronic respiratory failure. The effectiveness of inhaled drug therapy in very severe patients has not been assessed yet. Health care systems in many countries include public funding of long-term oxygen therapy for eligible candidates. Currently, there is little evidence for the use of mechanical ventilatory support in the routine management of hypercapnic patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered as a significant component of therapy, even in the most severe patients. Although Lung Volume Reduction Surgery has been shown to improve mortality, exercise capacity, and quality of life in selected patients, this modality is associated with significant morbidity and an early mortality rate in the most severe patients. Despite significant progress over the past 25 years, both short- and long-term outcomes remain significantly inferior for lung transplantation relative to other "solid" organ recipients. Nutritional assessment and management is an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Morphine may significantly reduce dyspnoea and does not significantly accelerate death. No consistent improvement in dyspnoea over placebo has been shown with anxiolytics. Supplemental oxygen during exercise reduces exertional breathlessness and improves exercise tolerance of the hypoxaemic patient. Non-invasive ventilation has been used as a palliative treatment to reduce dyspnoea. Hypoxaemic COPD patients, on long-term oxygen therapy, may show reduced health-related quality of life, cognitive function, and depression. Only a small proportion of patients with severe COPD discuss end-of-life issues with their physicians.

### The clinical impact of new long-term oxygen therapy technology [^96570868]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival for patients afflicted with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also reduce the incidence of repeat hospitalization due to exacerbations. When properly dosed and titrated, LTOT has also been shown to improve exercise tolerance, thereby enhancing the overall health-related quality of life for this growing patient population. Equipment used to provide LTOT is undergoing a radical transformation, with newer delivery devices offering a sharp contrast to older, more traditional home oxygen equipment. This newer approach to providing LTOT-commonly referred to as "non-delivery technology"-affords LTOT users unprecedented freedom, since they are no longer dependent on home-care providers for repeat deliveries to replenish or replace depleted oxygen contents. Instead, non-delivery LTOT equipment is self-sufficient and able to provide all of the oxygen needed to meet both stationary and ambulatory requirements. However, several models of the newer LTOT equipment have certain operational and performance limitations. Accordingly, in order to preclude unintended desaturation with newer LTOT devices, each patient must undergo an individualized pulse-oximetry titration study by a knowledgeable and experienced respiratory therapist to ensure optimum dosing under all conditions of use.

### Ambulatory home oxygen: what is the evidence for benefit, and who does it help? [^0709c267]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of ambulatory home oxygen have been demonstrated since the 1950s, when Cotes and Gibson gave oxygen to ambulatory COPD patients from small portable high pressures cylinders in the United Kingdom. Over the ensuing 7 decades, oxygen has been prescribed to millions of COPD patients in the home setting. Additionally, it is common clinical practice to prescribe supplemental oxygen when chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to COPD (eg, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, kyphoscoliosis, and cystic fibrosis) is present or in patients with hypoxemia at hospital discharge following flares of their underlying chronic respiratory disorder, without any substantial evidence. Despite the importance of long-term oxygen therapy in clinical home management, there are many gaps in our current knowledge regarding its mechanisms of action, indications for prescription, and its effects on important patient outcomes. Research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s still provides the basis for clinical decision making and insurance coverage policies regarding long-term oxygen administration. Remarkably, little current research is being conducted to extend our knowledge regarding the indications, mechanisms, and benefits of long-term oxygen therapy. This review will focus on our current knowledge of the end points for supplemental oxygen at home, such as mortality, effects on functional performance, sensation of dyspnea, cognitive function, and quality of life, and highlight areas where future research is needed.

### Home oxygen therapy for patients with COPD: time for a reboot [^584a3017]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Just over 100 years ago, John Scott Haldane published a seminal report about the therapeutic potential of supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia. In the 1980s, a pair of clinical trials confirmed the benefit of long-term oxygen therapy in improving survival in patients with COPD associated with severe resting hypoxemia. This review provides a summary of evidence supporting long-term and short-term oxygen therapy, as well as the various types of oxygen equipment commonly used in homes to deliver supplemental oxygen. Because the majority of orders for home oxygen occur at hospital discharge following acute illness, a typical conversation between a patient and their pulmonologist following a COPD exacerbation is presented. The SHERLOCK Consortium, a multi-stakeholder group established following the publication of the COPD National Action Plan in 2017 is also detailed. Interim results of the SHERLOCK Consortium, which suggest a chain of care involving 9 steps to ensure that patients are successfully initiated on home oxygen therapy during transitions from hospital to home, are presented. Recommendations to support evidence-based policies in this high-risk population are provided.

Proportion of patients receiving antifibrotic therapies at presentation. This chart shows a direct comparison of the proportions of patients receiving nintedanib and receiving pirfenidone at presentation since 2016, when nintedanib use was approved by NICE. Some patients were receiving both nintedanib and pirfenidone in the 3 months up to the first clinic visit (including drugs newly prescribed at the first clinic visit). NICE, National Institute of Clinical Excellence.

At presentation, 90% (1744/1937) had oxygen needs assessed, with 60% (1047/1744) not currently requiring oxygen therapy. 16% (647/4113) were receiving/prescribed at least one form of oxygen therapy at presentation, with 15% on ambulatory, 6% long-term and 1% short burst oxygen. Clinical trial recruitment at presentation remained consistently low at 7.5% (272/3603). The proportion deemed ineligible for lung transplantation 'at any time' at presentation (ie, the clinician has not only determined that they are ineligible for transplantation but that their eligibility status will not change) increased from 61% to 74% in 2013–2022. The overall mortality rate is 31%.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) Quality Standard for IPFincludes five quality statements. Figure 5 summarises data against each statement. 93% were discussed at MDT at presentation and a further 2% were due for discussion at an upcoming MDT. At presentation, 89% (1967/2211) were offered interaction with an ILD specialist nurse. 85% (1347/1580) of follow-ups assessed oxygen needs, of which 63% did not currently require oxygen therapy (847). At presentation, 89% (2494/2792) had pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) needs assessed, with 57% subsequently referred for PR. Reasons for not referring included the patient declining or having completed a course of PR < 12 months ago (7% and 4% respectively), while 28% (687) were not suitable for referral, due to poor mobility or already having a good fitness level. At presentation, 82% (2444/2993) had palliative care needs assessed.

Oxygen therapy for CSA in heart failure (HF) has limited symptomatic benefit but is conditionally supported: several small RCTs and observational studies evaluated low flow oxygen, most with at least eight weeks of follow up and no reported benefits in sleepiness, insomnia, or exercise performance; individual response should be re-evaluated before prescribing oxygen over the long term; coverage may be limited; and the task force provided a low certainty recommendation in favor of using low flow oxygen for CSA in HF.

### Similar risk of hospitalization and mortality for patients continuing and discontinuing LTOT [^34128ba7]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is an established treatment method for prolonging life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxemia. Use of LTOT is common, and contributes both to significant societal costs and to a considerable burden, including adverse effects, for the individual.

The evidence base for LTOT rests on two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the late 1970 s. The studies included COPD patients of predominantly male sex with a mean age of 65 years, both demonstrating a mortality reduction by up to 50% at three and two years after treatment initiation, respectively.

While no RCT has since reexamined the effect of LTOT on mortality among patients with severe hypoxemia, rapid development has been seen in the medical management of chronic respiratory disease, and in the characteristics of the treated population. Recent trials have also questioned the effects of LTOT on clinical outcomes in contemporary patients, by showing both a lack of benefit among patients with moderate hypoxemia, and non-superiority of LTOT prescribed for 24 rather than 15 h per day in patients with severe hypoxemia.

In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of LTOT for severe hypoxemia in a modern patient population, by studying the risks of hospitalization and death among patients discontinuing treatment.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) oxygen therapy — duration and outcomes are as follows: The long-term administration of oxygen (> 15 hours per day) to patients with chronic respiratory failure has been shown to increase survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia. Among patients with severe hypoxemia agreeing to participate in a study, long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day did not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death within one year compared to therapy for 15 hours per day, but the generalizability of this finding is unclear.

### Long-term multidimensional patient-centred outcomes after hospitalisation for COVID-19: do not only focus on disease severity [^889487f8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypoxaemia and respiratory failure are the primary reasons for hospitalisation in patients with COVID-19. Depending on the severity of hypoxaemia, oxygen therapy can range from low-flow nasal oxygen or oxygen masks to non-invasive respiratory support modalities (high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)) or even invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

After hospitalisation, patients frequently report long-term health problems, known as post-COVID-19 condition or 'long covid'. These problems include a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), persistence of symptoms and incomplete self-perceived recovery. Half of the patients with mild disease and up to 90% of people with moderate and severe disease continue to experience at least one ongoing symptom 1 year after disease onset. Mild disease often refers to non-hospitalised cases, whereas hospitalised patients are typically classified as having moderate to severe disease. Hospitalised patients requiring oxygen more frequently suffer from a reduced HRQoL and from symptoms compared with those with milder disease severity and those without hospitalisation. However, the association between COVID-19 disease severity and long-term outcomes in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen is uncertain. A more granular understanding of this association may help to guide, prioritise and optimise treatment and aftercare strategies.

We hypothesised that long-term patient-centred outcomes are related to disease severity. Therefore, we assessed the association between the maximal level of respiratory support received during hospitalisation, as a proxy for COVID-19 disease severity, and long-term multidimensional patient-centred outcomes (HRQoL, symptoms and recovery) up to 12 months in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy. We further aimed to identify other risk factors for these long-term outcomes.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) care processes — patient education, interface selection, adherence supports, monitoring, safety, and follow-up — are specified as follows. Patients 'should be educated about the function, care, and maintenance of their equipment, the benefits of PAP therapy, and potential problems', and 'should work together to select the most appropriate PAP interface'. The document states, 'The nasal airway is the preferred delivery route, however, alternatives may be tried to accommodate for comfort or difficulties (Consensus)'. To improve adherence, 'The addition of heated humidification and a systematic educational program is indicated to improve CPAP utilization (Standard)' and 'CPAP usage should be objectively monitored with time meters to help assure utilization (Standard)'. Regarding safety, 'CPAP and BPAP therapy are safe; side effects and adverse events are mainly minor and reversible (Standard)'. For ongoing care, 'Close follow-up for PAP usage and problems by appropriately trained health care providers is indicated to establish effective utilization patterns and remediate problems, if needed', and 'This is especially important during the first few weeks of PAP use (Standard)'; moreover, 'General OSA outcomes should be assessed in all patients (Consensus) (Table 6)'. If adherence remains insufficient, 'If PAP use is considered inadequate based on objective monitoring and symptom evaluation, prompt and intensive efforts should be implemented to improve PAP use or consider alternative therapies'.

### The prevalence of non-invasive ventilation and long-term oxygen treatment in helsinki university hospital area, Finland [^a99ea5b2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The second largest patient group in our study was OHS. Our patients were slightly more hypercapnic (PaCO2 8.0 vs. 5.7–7.9 kPa), but otherwise the patients' characteristics were similar compared to other studies. As expected, the mortality of our OHS patients was the lowest of the diagnostic groups (21.2%) and comparable to earlier studies, in which the five-year mortality ranged from 11% to 22.7%.

Since 2018 the guidelines for OHS have changed. Now continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the first-line treatment for ambulatory patients with OHS and concomitant severe sleep apnea. This will diminish the amount of NIV treatments in OHS patients in coming years. In our study, over 80% of the OHS patients had concomitant sleep apnea. But as patients treated with CPAP were excluded, we were not able to compare these two treatment modes.

Treatment initiation and follow-up protocols varied greatly in our area's clinics. Half of the initiations were performed electively (49.3%). Earlier studies have shown NIV home initiations to be non-inferior to in-hospital initiations. The main reason for these variances between clinics is the different resources at the wards and outpatient clinics. We did not specifically evaluate the effect of initiation unit on the treatment results or on mortality, but no large differences were seen. Lately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in remote monitoring systems, both the initiations and follow-ups have shifted more to the outpatient clinics in our hospitals. In our opinion, the most significant factors affecting the success of the NIV treatments are the clinical skills of the medical staff and efficient treatment initiation and follow-up protocol, not the type of initiation unit itself.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — definition and evidence limits for LTOT in milder hypoxemia — Chronic stable hypoxemia is defined as two measurements at least six weeks apart and at least six weeks from any acute illness resulting in hypoxemia, and there is insufficient evidence that long-term oxygen therapy reduces mortality in COPD with mild to moderate hypoxemia (66 mmHg < PaO2 ≤ 74 mm Hg) without signs of tissue hypoxia; there is also insufficient evidence that it improves dyspnea, QoL, hospitalization rates, or readmission rates, so the Work Group decided to not make specific recommendations for these populations.

### The impact of the Danish oxygen register on adherence to guidelines for long-term oxygen therapy in COPD patients [^e292ef0e]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of The Danish Oxygen Register on COPD patients' treatment modalities, survival, and adherence to guidelines for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).

Design

The Danish Oxygen Register.

Subjects

8487 COPD patients who received LTOT in the study period from November 1, 1994, to December 31, 2000.

Main Outcome Measures

Follow-up, smoking status, correct prescription of LTOT (15-24h/day), and survival.

Results

During the study period an increasing number of patients were prescribed LTOT in connection with discharge after hospitalisation for an exacerbation (1995 vs. 2000: 74.4% vs. 82.2%, P < 0.001), were prescribed oxygen 15-24h/day (66.2% vs. 85.5%, P < 0.001), had delivered oxygen concentrator or liquid oxygen (77.8% vs. 96.9%, P < 0.001), and had mobile oxygen (29.9% vs. 42.8%, P < 0.001). Only 65.8% of the patients were followed-up in an outpatient clinic with the possibility of re-evaluation of the criteria for LTOT and adjustment for oxygen flow, with no change during the study period (P = 0.43). In a representative subsample, 77.1% had smoking habits or measurement of CO-level registered in 1995 compared to 79.6% in year 2000 (P = 0.65), and 25.1% vs. 21.2% (P = 0.34) were considered current smokers. The median survival increased from 1.07 to 1.40 years (P = 0.032).

Conclusions

Adherence to guidelines for LTOT has improved concerning administration of oxygen, but has remained poor concerning follow-up of the patients and smoking cessation. Survival of COPD patients on LTOT has improved during the observation period.
