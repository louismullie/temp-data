## Question

how to treat perihilar peribronchial cuffing.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat perihilar peribronchial cuffing, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what peribronchial cuffing represents pathophysiologically and radiographically. Then, I should verify the clinical context and likely etiologies, especially viral versus bacterial patterns in children. Next, I will review how this finding should influence treatment decisions, including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and steroids. After that, I need to check special scenarios where steroids are indicated, such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia. Finally, I will consider supportive care, follow-up imaging, and when to escalate to CT or biopsy, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data along the way [^112EcQRz] [^1115dAxn].

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Peribronchial cuffing reflects thickening of the bronchial wall and surrounding peribronchial interstitium, classically appearing as a "donut sign" on cross-section and "tram-tracking" longitudinally; this pattern signals inflammatory edema and cellular infiltration of the airway wall rather than alveolar consolidation, which is crucial for management implications [^116Kndab]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical correlate: in young children with lower respiratory tract infections, this pattern clusters with an "obstructive" radiographic phenotype and is strongly associated with viral infection and wheeze, supporting an inflammatory airway obstruction model rather than bacterial alveolar disease [^115UpdFL] [^113AkE17].

> Next, I should review the clinical context. In children aged 3–59 months with severe LRTIs, peribronchial cuffing or hyperinflation predominate over consolidation, and these obstructive patterns correlate with more wheezing, younger age, lower CRP, and less antibiotic use compared with consolidation groups; viruses, especially RSV, are more frequently detected in the obstructive cohort, reinforcing viral predominance when cuffing is isolated [^115UpdFL] [^114SS3F8]. Wait, let me verify the antibiotic signal: children with viral features alone on CXR are treated with antibiotics at rates similar to those with normal CXRs, and the addition of viral features to radiographic pneumonia is associated with lower antibiotic use than pneumonia alone, which argues against reflex antibiotics when cuffing is isolated [^113ykPSB].

> I will now examine how this should guide treatment decisions. For isolated peribronchial cuffing without consolidation, I should avoid routine antibiotics because the pattern is most consistent with viral airway inflammation; instead, prioritize airway-directed therapy and supportive care, reserving antibiotics for high pretest probability of bacterial disease or evolving consolidation on clinical follow-up [^113ykPSB] [^115UpdFL]. Let me consider bronchodilators: children with obstructive patterns and wheeze benefit from inhaled albuterol, and clinicians frequently pair this with systemic steroids in more severe wheezing presentations, although the steroid signal is observational rather than trial-based in this radiographic context [^115UpdFL] [^113AkE17]. Supportive care with hydration, antipyretics, and oxygen as needed remains foundational, and I should double-check that we are not over-ordering chest radiographs, given concerns that routine imaging can increase unnecessary pneumonia diagnoses and antibiotics in pediatric LRTI [^111LK76y].

> But wait, what if the cuffing is not purely viral in origin or the patient is older? I need to ensure I consider special scenarios. In adults with eosinophilic pneumonia, peribronchial cuffing with bilateral reticular markings and ground-glass opacities may respond dramatically to systemic corticosteroids; eosinophilia and BAL eosinophils support the diagnosis and justify empiric steroids when clinical suspicion is high and infection is reasonably excluded [^114e4Xyf]. In organizing pneumonia, peribronchovascular consolidation responds well to corticosteroids; if steroid-refractory, case-based evidence supports rituximab as rescue therapy, though this is extrapolated and should be individualized [^117MttVn] [^117WoUpB]. Hold on, I should verify that these steroid-responsive entities are not being conflated with routine viral bronchiolitis; they require distinct clinical-radiologic correlation and often tissue or BAL confirmation before committing to prolonged immunosuppression [^1115dAxn].

> Next, I should review supportive care and monitoring. For most children with viral LRTI and peribronchial cuffing, supportive care suffices, with close follow-up of respiratory status, oxygen needs, and feeding tolerance; escalation to antibiotics is reasonable if there is clinical deterioration, rising inflammatory markers, or new consolidation on repeat imaging, but I should confirm that imaging is used judiciously to avoid overtreatment [^113ykPSB] [^111LK76y]. Let me reconsider the role of steroids in routine viral bronchiolitis: outside of specific entities like organizing pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia, routine systemic steroids are not indicated for typical viral bronchiolitis, so I need to avoid overextending the obstructive-pattern steroid signal to all-comers [^notfound].

> I should confirm when advanced imaging or procedures are warranted. If the clinical course is atypical, severe, refractory, or if alternative diagnoses are suspected, high-resolution CT can better characterize peribronchovascular disease patterns and guide biopsy decisions; in steroid-refractory pneumonitis or suspected organizing pneumonia, tissue diagnosis may alter therapy and prognosis, so multidisciplinary discussion is prudent [^112EcQRz] [^1115dAxn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said CT is mandatory for all with cuffing; that would be overreach — CT is reserved for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, severe disease, or suspected noninfectious etiologies, not routine viral bronchiolitis with expected recovery [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a child with cough, wheeze, and isolated peribronchial cuffing without consolidation, I would withhold antibiotics, initiate inhaled albuterol for wheeze, provide supportive care, and arrange close follow-up; if wheeze is moderate–severe, a short course of systemic steroids may be considered based on clinical severity and local practice patterns, acknowledging the observational nature of the radiographic association rather than definitive trial data [^115UpdFL] [^113AkE17]. For an adult with peribronchial cuffing, reticular changes, and eosinophilia, I would evaluate for eosinophilic pneumonia and consider empiric systemic steroids once infection is reasonably excluded, given the potential for rapid radiographic and clinical response [^114e4Xyf]. For persistent or atypical cases with peribronchovascular consolidation, I would consider organizing pneumonia and escalate to CT and, if needed, biopsy to guide steroid or steroid-sparing therapy [^1115dAxn] [^117MttVn].

> Finally, I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship and diagnostic humility are explicit. The presence of viral features alone on CXR should not trigger antibiotics, and even in children with radiographic pneumonia, concurrent viral features are associated with lower antibiotic use, reinforcing the need to integrate pretest probability, clinical trajectory, and repeat imaging rather than treating the film in isolation [^113ykPSB]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the child worsens clinically or new consolidation appears, I should reassess and treat presumed bacterial pneumonia accordingly, but the default for isolated peribronchial cuffing in a wheezing child should be supportive, airway-focused care with vigilant follow-up [^115UpdFL] [^111LK76y].

Perihilar peribronchial cuffing reflects **bronchial wall thickening** from inflammation or edema, most often due to viral bronchiolitis or bronchitis [^116Kndab] [^113AkE17]. Management is **supportive and symptom-directed**: provide oxygen for hypoxemia, inhaled bronchodilators for wheeze, and ensure hydration and antipyretics; **avoid routine antibiotics** unless bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed [^113ykPSB] [^115UpdFL]. Most cases resolve spontaneously, but persistent or severe findings may need steroids for reactive airway disease or further workup for underlying causes [^115UpdFL] [^112EcQRz].

---

## Clinical significance and differential diagnosis

Perihilar peribronchial cuffing is a **nonspecific radiographic finding** that reflects bronchial wall thickening from inflammation, edema, or fibrosis [^116Kndab]. Common causes include:

- **Viral bronchiolitis**: Most common in children; RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory viruses are frequent pathogens [^113AkE17] [^1146PvXH].

- **Viral bronchitis**: Often associated with upper respiratory infections [^116Kndab].

- **Reactive airway disease**: Asthma or wheezing syndromes [^115UpdFL].

- **Bacterial infections**: Less common but possible, especially in immunocompromised patients [^115UpdFL].

- **Chronic lung diseases**: Bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, or interstitial lung disease [^116Kndab].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnosis of perihilar peribronchial cuffing is primarily based on **chest radiography**, which demonstrates thickened bronchial walls around the hilar regions [^1112De4G]. Further diagnostic evaluation may include:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to assess for respiratory symptoms, wheezing, fever, and underlying conditions [^114xJEoo].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and viral PCR testing if indicated [^114SS3F8].

- **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)**: Useful in chronic or recurrent cases to differentiate between various interstitial lung diseases and to assess the extent of bronchial wall thickening [^112EcQRz].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment of perihilar peribronchial cuffing is **primarily supportive and symptom-directed**, given its frequent association with viral infections and reactive airway disease:

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **oxygen therapy** for hypoxemia (SpO2 < 92%), **hydration** to maintain adequate fluid status, and **antipyretics** such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever control.

---

### Pharmacological management

- **Bronchodilators**: Inhaled beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol) for wheezing or bronchospasm [^115UpdFL].

- **Corticosteroids**: Systemic or inhaled corticosteroids may be considered in cases of severe reactive airway disease or asthma exacerbations [^notfound].

- **Antibiotics**: Not routinely indicated unless bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical monitoring of respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and overall clinical improvement is essential. Follow-up chest radiography is generally **not required** unless symptoms persist or worsen.

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of perihilar peribronchial cuffing is **generally favorable**, particularly when associated with viral infections or reactive airway disease. Most cases resolve spontaneously with supportive care within 1–2 weeks. Persistent or recurrent findings may indicate underlying chronic lung disease or other pathological conditions, requiring further evaluation and targeted management [^112EcQRz].

---

## Potential complications

Although generally benign, persistent perihilar peribronchial cuffing may lead to **chronic respiratory symptoms** — chronic cough, wheezing, or recurrent respiratory infections — and, in severe or untreated cases, may contribute to **respiratory failure** or chronic lung disease [^115Ui6RL].

---

Perihilar peribronchial cuffing is a nonspecific radiographic finding indicating bronchial wall thickening, most commonly due to viral infections or reactive airway disease. Management is **supportive**, including oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids when indicated. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless bacterial infection is suspected. The prognosis is generally favorable, but persistent findings may require further evaluation for underlying chronic lung disease.

Background/Objectives

Chest radiograph (CXR) is routinely performed among children with suspected pneumonia, though it is not clear how specific radiographic findings impact antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. We evaluated the impact of viral radiographic features on antibiotic treatment among children undergoing pneumonia evaluation in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Children presenting to a pediatric ED who underwent a CXR for pneumonia evaluation were prospectively enrolled. Prior to CXR performance, physicians indicated their level of suspicion for pneumonia. The CXR report was reviewed to assess for the presence of viral features (peribronchial cuffing, perihilar markings, and interstitial infiltrate) as well as radiographic features suggestive of pneumonia (consolidation, infiltrate, and opacity). The relationship between viral radiographic features and antibiotic treatment was assessed based on the level of clinical suspicion for pneumonia prior to CXR.

Results

Patients with normal CXRs (n = 400) and viral features alone (n = 370) were managed similarly, with 8.0% and 8.6% of patients receiving antibiotic treatment, respectively (P = 0.75). Compared with children with radiographic pneumonia (n = 174), patients with concurrent viral features and radiographic pneumonia (n = 177) were treated with antibiotics less frequently (86.2% vs 54.3%, P < .001). Among children with isolated viral features on CXR, antibiotic treatment rates were correlated with pre-CXR level of suspicion for pneumonia.

Conclusions

Among children with suspected pneumonia, the presence of viral features alone on CXR is not associated with increased rates of antibiotic use. Among children with radiographic pneumonia, the addition of viral features on CXR is associated with lower rates of antibiotic use, as compared to children with radiographic pneumonia alone.

### Clinical implications of the obstructive pattern on chest radiography in children aged 3–59 months with severe lower respiratory tract infections [^113AkE17]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Peribronchial cuffing suggests a viral predominance in cases of LRTI showing an obstructive pattern. However, the radiographic finding is considered inconclusive in distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections. We found that viruses were more frequently present in children with the obstructive pattern, compared to their counterparts, with a 24.7% difference. Similarly, a Finnish study conducted on 215 children hospitalized with pneumonia showed a higher proportion of exclusive viral infections in children with peribronchial cuffing than in those with lobar consolidation (51.9% vs. 20.0%). Although we attempted to assess the meaning of hyperinflation, it tended to be more common without significant differences in children who were younger (≤ 2 years, 27.7% vs. > 2 years, 23.3%; Table 3) or had RSV infections (positive, 31.1% vs. negative, 24.2%; Supporting Information S1: Table 3). This lack of significance highlights the need for more objective definitions of "increased pulmonary lucency" or "diaphragmatic flattening" (Supporting Information S1: Table 1). Despite these limitations, we believe that the following implications can be drawn from the associations of an obstructive pattern with viral infection, wheezing, and the use of IAO‐relieving therapy. First, some children with an obstructive pattern may benefit from the treatment. Second, pediatricians or emergency physicians may perceive the radiographic pattern as a sign of IAO, thereby affecting their therapeutic decision‐making.

### Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia [^114e4Xyf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 44-year-old asthmatic male patient presented to the health centre with a 3-week history of coryzal symptoms, persistent productive sputum and shortness of breath. The chest X-ray (CXR) revealed symmetrical, perihilar airspace shadowed with peribronchial cuffing and bilateral reticular markings. The patient did not improve despite treatment, and hence a high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax was recommended. The HRCT showed smooth interlobular septal thickening, central perihilar soft tissue thickening and patches of ground glass changes. Both the CXR and HRCT findings, along with the symptoms and eosinophilia counts, were suggestive of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was successfully treated with steroids. This case highlights the symptoms, diagnosis, management and treatment of IAEP. A rapid diagnosis of this rare disease is essential since it can be completely cured with correct management but can be fatal if left untreated. Once properly treated, this disease does not recur.

4 Discussion

This study confirms the association of the obstructive pattern on radiography (78.9%) with viral infection (obstructive, 76.7% vs. parenchymal, 52.0%), younger age, and symptoms or treatment related to airway obstruction in young children with severe LRTIs. This contrasts with the association of the parenchymal pattern (21.1%) with bacterial infection (47.1% vs. 71.9%), a higher value of CRP, and antibiotic therapy.

LRTIs encompass a range of diagnoses, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma, or transient non‐atopic wheezing. Among these diagnoses, "pneumonia" may lead to the unnecessary use of antibiotics, even though viruses are more common than bacteria as pathogens. The findings of this current study could aid in tailoring emergency measures, such as albuterol, for wheezy children with LRTIs who exhibit peribronchial cuffing or hyperinflation without consolidation. This approach would keep pediatricians or emergency physicians away from relying solely on antibiotics, regardless of whether the children have been diagnosed with pneumonia. While some experienced pediatricians may find these findings intuitive, it could still be beneficial for them to reference the viral landscape of LRTI based on our study population, where 98.7% underwent viral PCR. This contrasts with previous studies that used PCR in combination with other viral testing methods.

ABSTRACT

Objectives

To investigate the clinical implications of the obstructive pattern on plain chest radiography, defined as peribronchial cuffing or hyperinflation, in young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).

Methods

We reviewed all children aged 3‒59 months with LRTIs who underwent radiography and polymerase chain reaction in a Korean emergency department from 2016 through 2020. The radiographs were read as consolidation, peribronchial cuffing, or hyperinflation, with each interrater reliability computed. As per the obstructive pattern, we compared their clinical features, therapeutic interventions, outcomes, and microbiology.

Results

Among 599 children with LRTIs, 465 were enrolled, of whom 98 (21.1%) had consolidation (κ = 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.50‒0.70), and 367 (78.9%) had peribronchial cuffing (0.55; 0.46‒0.65) or hyperinflation (0.59; 0.52‒0.67). The obstructive pattern was significantly associated with more frequent wheezing (obstructive, 28.6% vs. consolidation, 10.2%) and the use of inhaled albuterol or systemic steroids (39.0% vs. 23.5%), and lower median values or frequencies of age (22.0 vs. 35.0 months), crackle or diminished breath sound (42.0% vs. 61.2%), C‐reactive protein (1.4 vs. 2.9 mg/dL), antibiotic therapy (72.2% vs. 93.9%), length of hospital stay (4.0 vs 5.0 days), fever lasting 3 days or longer (7.9% vs. 29.6%), and complications (0.5% vs. 9.2%). Microbiologically, viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, were more frequently detected in children with the obstructive pattern or at a younger age.

Conclusions

This study confirms an association of the obstructive pattern on radiography with viral infection and inflammatory airway obstruction‐relieving therapy in young children with severe LRTIs.

### Clinical presentations and outcomes of children with cancer and COVID-19: a systematic review [^115PCSfX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Information regarding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric oncology is limited. We conducted a systematic review of the available published literature on children with cancer affected by COVID-19. The last date of the study search was October 20, 2020, and 33 studies comprising 226 children were included for the final analysis. Data were extracted in a predefined data collection form, and the variables were extracted and analyzed. Patients with hematological malignancies were more in number. Males and children on intensive treatment were more frequently affected. Fever was the commonest symptom. The disease was asymptomatic/mild in 48% and severe in 9.6%. Consolidation, peribronchial cuffing, and consolidation with ground glass opacities were the common imaging findings. Hydroxychloroquine was the most frequently used drug for COVID-19. About 10% of children required intensive care, and about 32% had oxygen requirements. The percentage of children who died due to COVID-19 was 4.9%. The severity, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 in pediatric oncology were more compared to the general pediatric population. This information can help in risk stratification for the management of COVID-19.

Features related to the consolidation are consistent with those of relevant studies. The median time elapsed from symptom onset to radiograph acquisitions (5 days) is within the reported range of 3‒8 days. The consolidation rate of 21.1% and its κ value of 0.60 are similar to the values reported in children with LRTI, which range from 21.0% to 24.9% and 0.58 to 0.73, respectively. The association of consolidation with a duration of fever or hospitalization was reproduced in our study. Similar to ours, an Italian study on 68 children with pneumonia (median age, 3.6 years) also found that a CRP value higher than 10.1 mg/dL was reported more commonly in the consolidation group than in the peribronchial cuffing group (65.5% vs. 27.3%). To aid in predicting LRTIs that were caused by bacteria or showed consolidation, it has been suggested to consider a CRP higher than 8 mg/dL or a combination of any two of the following: tachypnea, desaturation, and fever. These supplementary tools showed a 7%–52% sensitivity and 72%–96% specificity. The high specificity suggests the potential for reducing false‐positive cases and promoting antibiotic stewardship. However, this diagnostic process does not provide information for therapeutic decision‐making for children with exclusive peribronchial cuffing or hyperinflation.

Currently, radiography is arbitrarily performed and interpreted in children with LRTIs. Radiography remains the imaging modality most commonly used for the diagnosis of LRTI, despite recommendations against its routine use based on the poor distinguishability between viral and bacterial infections. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus in its interpretation. Different terms have been used to describe peribronchial cuffing in the literature, such as "peribronchial thickening", "peribronchial infiltrate", "other infiltrate", "interstitial infiltrate", or "interstitial lung disease", to name a few.

In children with LRTIs, performing radiography alone may raise the frequency of pneumonia diagnoses or prescription of antibiotics, regardless of the findings. Thus, to obtain clinically useful information from the radiography, it is important to objectify criteria for interpretation and communicate the implications of the obstructive pattern. This radiographic pattern typically suggests viral rather than bacterial causes. Despite the high likelihood of encountering an obstructive pattern on radiographs of young children with LRTIs, the implications remain elusive regarding the indirect signs of IAO.

### Beyond bronchitis: a review of the congenital and acquired abnormalities of the bronchus [^116Kndab]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Acquired conditions

Bronchial wall thickening

Bronchitis

Bronchitis is the generic term referring to inflammation of the bronchial wall, representing the common final response of the airways to irritants. Acute bronchitis is a short-term process (< 3 months in length but typically lasting 2–10 days) with symptoms occasionally lingering for 2–3 weeks post-infection, most commonly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection leading to an inflammatory hyperresponsiveness. Patients typically present with cough, wheezing, dyspnoea, chest discomfort, fever, and occasionally sputum production. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough most days for ≥ 3 months in 2 consecutive years in patients for whom other causes of chronic cough have been excluded.

In both acute and chronic bronchitis, the chest x-ray is often unremarkable. CT demonstrates bronchial wall thickening, a mosaic attenuation pattern of the pulmonary parenchyma, and mucous plugging (Fig. 6 a and b). The descriptive terms "tram tracking" and "peribronchial cuffing" are often used to describe bronchial wall thickening, with the former describing thickened longitudinally oriented bronchi mimicking the parallel rail tracks of a tram and the latter referring to thickened bronchi seen in cross section, also called the "donut sign" (Fig. 6 a and b).

### Chest X-ray interpretation in the EPICO pediatric COVID-19 study: addressing misconceptions [^116gkVbQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Specific Questions Raised

In response to the questions posed in the Commentary:

Do discrepancies in X‐ray interpretation influence treatment?

Treatment decisions were made in real time by clinical teams based on radiographic readings available at the bedside, which were different from the retrospective interpretations analyzed in our study. Therefore, discrepancies in interpretation did not appear to impact patient management.

Should radiologists receive targeted training for difficult‐to‐interpret findings?

We agree that improving consistency in the interpretation of certain findings — such as peribronchial thickening — requires clearer definitions and consensus criteria, rather than reflecting a lack of expertise. Efforts to harmonize interpretation frameworks in pediatric imaging are crucial to reduce variability across studies and clinical practice.

Could studying long‐term radiographic outcomes help clarify treatment‐recovery links?

While our study did not include long‐term imaging follow‐up, we concur that future research in this area could provide valuable insights into the relationship between treatment and radiographic evolution.

### Radiologic features of all-trans-retinoic acid syndrome [^111VNuyA]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) sometimes results in a syndrome characterized by fever, respiratory distress, weight gain, pleural and pericardial effusion, and pulmonary infiltrates. We report the radiologic features of ATRA syndrome.

Materials and Methods

During the past 5 years, 69 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with ATRA. Of this group, 15 patients developed ATRA syndrome. Serial chest radiographs of the 15 patients with ATRA syndrome were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacity, septal lines, increased pulmonary blood volume, peribronchial cuffing, and air bronchogram. Also, we measured the cardiothoracic ratio and the vascular pedicle width.

Results

Chest radiographs showed increased cardiothoracic ratio in 13 of the 15 patients, increased vascular pedicle width in 13, increased pulmonary blood volume in 13, septal lines in nine, peribronchial cuffing in nine, ground-glass opacity in nine, consolidation in seven, and nodules in seven. Pleural effusion was noted in 11 of the 15 patients, and air bronchogram was noted in five of the 15 patients. Pulmonary hemorrhage developed in three patients who were being treated with ATRA; they showed bilateral, diffuse, poorly defined nodules and ground-glass opacity on radiography.

Conclusion

Most patients with ATRA syndrome have abnormal findings on chest radiographs, and the abnormalities are similar to those of pulmonary edema.

### Therapeutic management of broncholithiasis [^114kNg2F]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Broncholithiasis is characterized by calcified perihilar and mediastinal lymph nodes eroding into the tracheobronchial tree. We report herein 4 cases of symptomatic broncholithiasis managed by surgical resection in 2 cases and bronchoscopic removal in 2 cases. From our experience and from the literature review, bronchoscopic removal should be considered in cases of uncomplicated and loose broncholithiasis, whereas surgical management should be chosen first in complicated cases such as obstructive pneumonitis, bronchiectasis, massive hemoptysis, and bronchoesophageal fistulas.

Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — peribronchiolar changes include that fibroblast foci can be subpleural, paraseptal, or peribronchiolar, and when peribronchiolar metaplasia is widespread (affecting > 50% of bronchioles), fibrotic HP should be considered.

### Coronal thick CT reconstruction: an alternative for initial chest radiography in trauma patients [^1112De4G]. Emergency Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that the imaging workup of trauma patients be accelerated by omitting the initial chest radiography (CR) and directly performing a computed tomography (CT); however, the baseline CR is then lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess if coronal thick reconstructions generated from chest CT could present an adequate alternative for CR. Sixty trauma patients underwent bedside CR and multidetector row chest CT in the emergency room. The image quality of thoracic anatomical structures, the diagnostic accuracy for chest pathology, and the depiction of indwelling devices were assessed on both modalities. Main pulmonary arteries and perihilar bronchi were equally visualized with both modalities. Central bronchi, retrocardial lung parenchyma, diaphragm, descending aorta, and vertebral pedicles were better visualized on thick CT reconstructions, whereas peripheral lung vessels were better depicted on CR (p < 0.05). The accuracy to delineate various pathological findings did not differ between both modalities, except for a higher sensitivity to diagnose bronchial cuffing on CR (p < 0.05). The location of indwelling devices was similarly and correctly depicted with both modalities. Coronal thick CT reconstructions provide a similar image quality and diagnostic accuracy compared with CR. These reconstructions may serve as an equivalent baseline image in trauma patients in whom emergency radiological evaluation has to be accelerated.

However, 6 weeks later, on NSAID, prednisone 0.33 mg/kg/day, low dose cyclosporine 0.36 mg/kg/day, and anakinra 1.4 mg/kg/day his arthralgias, morning stiffness, and fatigue returned. He described having morning emesis (up to 3 per week), upper respiratory congestion, sore throat, and self-resolving headaches. Two weeks later his morning stiffness worsened, so his anakinra dose was divided into morning and evening doses (0.7 mg/kg/dose). One week later he represented to an urgent care clinic complaining of cough, evening chest pain, wheeze, upper respiratory congestion, poor appetite, and mild nausea. He had low-grade fever (38.2°C), mild tachycardia (124 beats/min), an otherwise normal physical examination, and his chest radiograph revealed left lower lobe interstitial markings and peribronchial cuffing. He was assessed to have a viral illness. Two days following he returned, now with emesis and diarrhea. His temperature was 37.7°C, and he had mild tachycardia (114), tachypnea (24 breaths/min), and hypertension (132/83). He had scattered wheezes, without other abnormalities on physical exam. Report of his chest x-ray documented his heart size within "the upper limits of normal". At home two days later, he was found apneic and pulseless. Unsuccessful attempts at resuscitation were made, during which an urgent bedside echocardiogram did not identify pericardial effusion. An autopsy was performed.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in assessing pulmonary edema on bedside chest radiographs using a standardized scoring approach [^117Mb6Zn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Scoring system

Customized scoring software, implemented as a web-based application, facilitates a standardized assessment of the presence of pulmonary edema. It is based on the systematic evaluation of characteristic radiological indications of pulmonary edema on bedside CXRs which was previously validated.

Each characteristic indication (a-g) has to be classified in a three point scale (b and c) as missing, moderate and severe or a four point scale (a, d-g) as missing, mild, moderate and severe: (a) hilar vessels enlarged (0/1/2/3 points), hilar vessels increased in density (0/2/4/6 points), hilar vessels blurred (0/3/6/9 points)), (b) Kerley B lines (0/4/-/8 points), (c) micronoduli (0/4/-/8 points), (d) widening of interlobular fissure (0/4/8/12 points), (e) peribronchial and perivascular cuffs (0/4/8/12 points), (f) extensive perihilar haze (0/5/10/15 points) and (g) diffuse increase in density (0/5/10/15 points). The software calculates the total score, and results > 15 are rated as pulmonary edema, whereas a score ≤ 15 is rated as no pulmonary edema. Detailed information of the radiological scoring of pulmonary edema is given in Figure 1 and Table 1.

Bedside chest radiographs showing different indications of pulmonary edema. Enlarged/blurred hilar vessels (a), Kerley lines (lower arrow) and peribronchial/perivascular cuffs (upper arrow) (b), micronoduli (c) widening of interlobular fissure (d), extensive perihilar haze (e) and diffuse increase in density (f).

Table 1
Radiologic scoring of pulmonary edema on bedside chest radiographs

The score assigned to each variable depends on the severity of involvement (missing = 0 points, mild, moderate and severe). During the score-based approach a total score > 15 was rated as pulmonary edema, whereas a score ≤ 15 was rated as no pulmonary edema. The variables and scores were previously validated.

Lung cancer TNM — regional lymph nodes (N) and distant metastasis (M) definitions are as follows: N0 is no regional node metastasis; N1 is metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or perihilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension; N2 is metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes; and N3 is metastasis in contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes. M0 is no distant metastasis; M1a includes separate tumor nodules in a contralateral lobe or tumor with pleural nodules or malignant pleural dissemination; and M1b is distant metastasis. Pleural effusions are excluded when cytologically negative, nonbloody, transudative, and clinically judged not to be due to cancer.

### Pediatric chest X-ray in COVID-19 infection [^1118jNMh]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The outbreak of COVID-19 has become pandemic. Pediatric population has been less studied than adult population and prompt diagnosis is challenging due to asymptomatic or mild episodes. Radiology is an important complement to clinical and epidemiological features.

Objective

To establish the most common CXR patterns in children with COVID-19, evaluate interobserver correlation and to discuss the role of imaging techniques in the management of children.

Materials and Methods

Forty-four patients between 0 and 16 years of age with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection and CXR were selected. Two paediatric radiologists independently evaluated the images and assessed the type of abnormality, distribution and evolution when available.

Results

Median age was 79.8 months (ranging from 2 weeks to 16 years of age). Fever was the most common symptom (43.5%). 90% of CXR showed abnormalities. Peribronchial cuffing was the most common finding (86.3%) followed by GGOs (50%). In both cases central distribution was more common than peripheral. Consolidations accounted for 18.1%. Normal CXR, pleural effusion, and altered cardiomediastinal contour were the least common.

Conclusion

The vast majority of CXR showed abnormalities in children with COVID-19. However, findings are nonspecific. Interobserver correlation was good in describing consolidations, normal x-rays and GGOs. Imaging techniques have a role in the management of children with known or suspected COVID-19, especially in those with moderate or severe symptoms or with underlying risk factors.

### Clinical implications of the obstructive pattern on chest radiography in children aged 3–59 months with severe lower respiratory tract infections [^111713LV]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

When young children develop lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), their plain chest radiographs (henceforth, "radiographs") show peribronchial cuffing or hyperinflation more frequently than consolidation. In this article, the former radiographic finding was defined as an "obstructive" pattern given its implications for inflammatory airway obstructions (IAOs), while the latter was defined as a "parenchymal" pattern given those for alveolar filling. Theoretically, these findings are indicative of pathology occurring in the growing respiratory system. Neonates have 21‒25 bronchial generations in the peripheral lungs, similar to adults, and their bronchi grow in length and diameter, not in number. In contrast, the number and surface area of the alveoli increase from ~20 × 10 6 and 3 m 2 at birth to 300 × 10 6 and 70‒80 m 2 in adults, respectively. Notably, infant alveoli have fewer pores of Kohn, which communicate with adjacent alveoli, compared to adults. The thin bronchi are easily obstructed by mucus or edema, while the poorly developed and connected alveoli are less affected. This inherent vulnerability to IAO may be worsened by prevalent viral infections in infants or toddlers. The IAO may lead to the radiographic predominance of the obstructive pattern over the parenchymal pattern in young children with LRTIs.

The authors hypothesized that an obstructive pattern on radiography indicates the presence of wheezing, the use of bronchodilators or systemic steroids, or viral infection. Conversely, a parenchymal pattern indicates fever, the use of antibiotics, or bacterial infection. By testing this hypothesis, such clinical aspects could be anticipated to some degree based on the radiographs of children with LRTIs, thereby streamlining the required emergency measures. From this perspective, we aimed to analyze the characteristics of young children with severe LRTIs, according to the presence of the obstructive pattern on radiography.

3.3 Microbiology

Overall, 459 (98.7%), 120 (25.8%), and 368 children (79.1%) underwent viral PCR, bacterial PCR, and M. pneumoniae serology, respectively. The viruses were detected more commonly in children with the obstructive pattern (Table 2). Children who tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) exhibited a higher proportion of peribronchial cuffing, a lower proportion of definite consolidation, and a younger median age, compared to those who tested negative (Figure 2; Supporting Information S1: Table 3). This contrasts with the findings for the comparisons per the positivity of M. pneumoniae.

Table 2
Microbiology.

Figure 2
Radiographic findings based on the presence of respiratory syncytial virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Among the children who tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (n = 103), there was a lower proportion of definite consolidation (represented by open bars), a higher proportion of peribronchial cuffing (black‐shaded bars), and a younger median age (stippled bars), compared to those who tested negative (n = 356). This is opposite to the findings related to the presence of M. pneumoniae. For detailed numerical data, refer to Supporting Information S1: Table 3. There were no significant differences in the proportions of hyperinflation between the two comparisons (gray‐shaded bars).

### Chest X-ray lung imaging features in pediatric COVID-19 and comparison with viral lower respiratory infections in young children [^1111CE2Z]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Chest radiography (CXR) is a noninvasive imaging approach commonly used to evaluate lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children. However, the specific imaging patterns of pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on CXR, their relationship to clinical outcomes, and the possible differences from LRTIs caused by other viruses in children remain to be defined.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional study of patients seen at a pediatric hospital with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 95). Patients were subdivided in infants (0–2 years, n = 27), children (3–10 years, n = 27), and adolescents (11–19 years, n = 41). A sample of young children (0–2 years, n = 68) with other viral lower respiratory infections (LRTI) was included to compare their CXR features with the subset of infants (0–2 years) with COVID-19.

Results

Forty-five percent of pediatric patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized and 20% required admission to intensive care unit (ICU). The most common abnormalities identified were ground-glass opacifications (GGO)/consolidations (35%) and increased peribronchial markings/cuffing (33%). GGO/consolidations were more common in older individuals and perihilar markings were more common in younger subjects. Subjects requiring hospitalization or ICU admission had significantly more GGO/consolidations in CXR (p < .05). Typical CXR features of pediatric viral LRTI (e.g., hyperinflation) were more common in non-COVID-19 viral LRTI cases than in COVID-19 cases (p < .05).

Conclusions

CXR may be a complemental exam in the evaluation of moderate or severe pediatric COVID-19 cases. The severity of GGO/consolidations seen in CXR is predictive of clinically relevant outcomes. Hyperinflation could potentially aid clinical assessment in distinguishing COVID-19 from other types of viral LRTI in young children.

Table 1
Epidemiological and clinical parameters of hantavirus respiratory syndrome cases

During the prodromal phase, the main observed symptoms were fever (77.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and digestive disorders (55.6%) that lasted a mean of 5 days (range, 2–6 days). The illness phase started with dry cough (78%) and dyspnea (66.7%), progressing quickly to respiratory, renal, and hemodynamic failure (Table 1). No patient presented with neurological or hepatic manifestations.

Biologic analyses performed at admission showed renal injury in seven patients, hypoproteinemia in seven, elevated hematocrit in eight, hyperlactatemia in six, elevated C-reactive protein in seven, and normal hepatic and muscular enzymes in all patients (Table 2). Chest X-Ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates in all patients and pleural effusion in seven patients. Chest computed tomography was performed in only four patients (44.4%) and showed vessel enlargement, peribronchial cuffing, bilateral Kerley lines, alveolar edema, and pleural effusion. Pleural effusion required drainage in three patients (33.3%). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in five patients (55.6%) and showed normal left ventricular function. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic investigations were consistent with hypovolemia with hyperpermeability syndrome without cardiac involvement. Eight patients needed mechanical ventilation (MV). All had pink, frothy bronchial aspirates. The remaining patient received high-flow oxygen for 3 days. Patients treated with MV received deep sedation, muscle blockers, norepinephrine, adrenalin (one patient), and dobutamine (one patient). Nitric oxide was administered to four patients without evidence of effectiveness. Two patients were put in a prone position. No patient received fluid infusion or albumin administration. One patient died ∼14 hours after admission to the emergency department and four others died in the ICU, giving a case fatality rate of 55.6%. The length of stay in the ICU was 14 days in survivors treated with MV, and 6 days for the patient who did not receive MV. In the survivors, MV was needed for 4, 20, and 24 days, and renal replacement therapy was used for 5 and 7 days.

### Common and uncommon CT findings in CVID-related GL-ILD: correlations with clinical parameters, therapeutic decisions and potential implications in the differential diagnosis [^113XY3my]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another interesting finding regards the distribution of nodules. Radiologically, nodules centered in the secondary lobule without contact with pleural, peri-bronchovascular surfaces or interlobular septa may be described as centrilobular, usually sustained by a bronchiolar spread of inflammation. Conversely, nodules that are predominantly located along pleural, peri-bronchovascular surfaces or interlobular septa may be described as peri-lymphatic. Lastly, if they are distributed without any predominance, a random pattern is defined, usually due to hematogenous metastatic or infective spread. In our study, nodules were usually non-perylymphatic. This result was partially unexpected, since a perilymphatic distribution is the hallmark of lung diseases involving the lymphatic structures and data in literature, derived from small cohorts, are conflicting. However, in our opinion, in CVID patients, small inhaled antigens could determine a peribronchiolar reaction with an increase in centrilobular nodules, justifying the relative lower frequency of perilymphtic nodules.

### Accuracy of chest radiographs in the emergency diagnosis of heart failure [^115CCrC1]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiographic findings of heart failure (HF) in current patients presenting with dyspnea in the emergency department. In a secondary analysis of the BASEL study, initial chest radiographs of 277 patients with acute dyspnea were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the adjudicated diagnosis (56% had the final diagnosis of HF). Predefined radiographic criteria of HF were used. Statistical analysis included receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calculation of a logistic regression model including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The reader's overall impression showed the highest area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of HF in both supine and erect patient positions (0.855 and 0.857). Among individual radiographic findings, peribronchial cuffing in the supine position (0.829) showed the highest accuracies. The lowest accuracy was found for the vascular pedicle width in the supine position (0.461). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant differences between the reader's overall impression, the radiographic model, and BNP testing. In our study, the combination of radiographic features provided valuable information and was of comparable accuracy as BNP-testing for the diagnosis of HF.

### Diseases involving the lung peribronchovascular region: a CT imaging pathologic classification [^112EcQRz]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Chest CT imaging holds a major role in the diagnosis of lung diseases, many of which affect the peribronchovascular region. Identification and categorization of peribronchovascular abnormalities on CT imaging can assist in formulating a differential diagnosis and directing further diagnostic evaluation.

Review Findings

The peribronchovascular region of the lung encompasses the pulmonary arteries, airways, and lung interstitium. Understanding disease processes associated with structures of the peribronchovascular region and their appearances on CT imaging aids in prompt diagnosis. This article reviews current knowledge in anatomic and pathologic features of the lung interstitium composed of intercommunicating prelymphatic spaces, lymphatics, collagen bundles, lymph nodes, and bronchial arteries; diffuse lung diseases that present in a peribronchovascular distribution; and an approach to classifying diseases according to patterns of imaging presentations. Lung peribronchovascular diseases can appear on CT imaging as diffuse thickening, fibrosis, masses or masslike consolidation, ground-glass or air space consolidation, and cysts, acknowledging that some diseases may have multiple presentations.

Summary

A category approach to peribronchovascular diseases on CT imaging can be integrated with clinical features as part of a multidisciplinary approach for disease diagnosis.

### Fibrosing organising pneumonia [^117MttVn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Organising pneumonia (otherwise referred to as bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia) is characterised histologically by plugs of granulation tissue, which are present predominantly within small airways, alveolar ducts and peri-bronchiolar alveoli. This pattern is not specific for any disorder or cause, but is one type of inflammatory response to pulmonary injury, which may be seen in a wide variety of clinical conditions. Typically, organising pneumonia responds very well to corticosteroid treatment; however, a small percentage of patients appear to develop progressive fibrosis.

### Human metapneumovirus infection in the United States: clinical manifestations associated with a newly emerging respiratory infection in children [^1146PvXH]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently, a newly identified human respiratory virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), was reported by investigators in the Netherlands. We sought to determine whether hMPV was circulating in our community and to determine the clinical features associated with hMPV infection.

Methods

Respiratory specimens from children who were younger than 5 years and had a negative result for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, and adenovirus by direct fluorescent antibody test were screened for hMPV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Samples were collected from October 30, 2001, to February 28, 2002.

Results

Of the 296 patients screened, 19 (6.4%) had evidence of hMPV infection. hMPV was identified in patients with either upper or lower respiratory tract infection or both. Clinical manifestations included wheezing, hypoxia, and abnormal findings on chest radiographs (eg, focal infiltrates, peribronchial cuffing). Nosocomial infection occurred in at least 1 patient.

Conclusions

hMPV is circulating in the United States and is associated with respiratory tract disease in patients with respiratory illnesses not caused by respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, and adenovirus. Additional studies are required to define the epidemiology and the extent of disease in the general population caused by hMPV.

### Mimics in chest disease: interstitial opacities [^114dicDa]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Nodular pattern

A nodular pattern is characterised on HRCT by the presence of numerous rounded opacities that range from 2 mm to 1 cm in diameter, with micronodules defined as smaller than 3 mm in diameter. The differential diagnosis — apart from the clinical setting and the ancillary findings — is largely based on the three different patterns of anatomic distribution: perilymphatic, random, and centrilobular. The perilymphatic distribution is characterised by presence of nodules along the peribronchovascular interstitium, interlobular septa and subpleural areas. Random distribution demonstrates nodules without any particular site predominance. Centrilobular nodules are located several millimetres away from the pleural surfaces, interlobar fissures or interlobular septa. Centrilobular distribution further divides into nodules with and without tree-in-bud distribution. Moreover centrilobular nodules without any "tree-in-bud" pattern may be either of homogeneous density or of ground-glass texture.

Nodular–perilymphatic

Classic entity

Sarcoidosis is typically characterised by a nodular pattern with perilymphatic distribution. A highly distinctive finding is the middle and upper lung zone predominance centrally at the perihilar region. Other findings that support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis are the beading of the fissures, the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that occasionally is calcified like "icing-sugar" and the presence of air-trapping on expiration (Fig. 23).

### Coronavirus HKU1 infection in the United States [^116n4JfJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Results

From December 16, 2001, to December 15, 2002, 1,048 respiratory specimens from 851 children were tested by RT-PCR for HCoV-HKU1. Specimens from 9 of these children (1%) tested positive for HCoV-HKU1. Specimens from these children tested negative for RSV, parainfluenza viruses (types 1–3), influenza A and B viruses, and adenovirus by direct immunofluorescence assay as well as human metapneumovirus and HCoV-NH by RT-PCR. Two children had 2 specimens that tested positive for HCoV-HKU1. For each of these 2 children, the positive specimens were collected < 10 days apart. Children whose specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1 infection had clinical evidence of either upper or lower respiratory tract infection or both (Table). The most common clinical findings were rhinorrhea (100%), cough (67%), fever (67%), and abnormal breath sounds on auscultation (44%). Hypoxia (oxygen saturation of < 90%) was observed in only 1 patient. Chest radiographs were obtained for 4 patients, all of whom had abnormal findings that included peribronchial cuffing, atelectasis, hyperinflation, or infiltrates. One patient (patient 3) had respiratory decompensation requiring ventilatory support and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. This patient had no history of underlying illness, had not been premature, and was 1 month of age at the time of specimen collection.

CXR examination

In supine position, infants were acquired a posterior–anterior CXR. Lateral radiographs were not obtained to decrease radiation exposure, according to the British Thoracic Society Guidelines recommendations. The radiologist was blind to the infants' clinical and laboratory data. Bacterial pneumonia on CXR was defined as "consolidation", "infiltrate", or "pneumonia" identified by the pediatric radiology. Viral infections on CXR was diagnosed on the attending pediatric radiologist reading for "likely viral infiltrates", "peri-bronchial infiltrates", "peri-bronchial cuffing", "peri-bronchial thickening", or "increased interstitial markings".

### Mycoplasmosis in ferrets [^114oVF5Y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The number of pet ferrets in the United States has grown rapidly, from an estimated 800,000 in 1996 to an estimated 7–10 million in 2007. Also in the United States, ferrets have become the third most common household pet; their popularity as a pet in Europe is similar. The common respiratory diseases in pet ferrets are caused by viruses; canine distemper is probably the most virulent. Ferrets also are highly susceptible to human influenza virus, but disease is rarely severe. Bacteria rarely cause disease outbreaks in ferret populations, but they do cause disease in individual ferrets.

In 2007, in the state of Washington, USA, an outbreak of respiratory disease characterized by a dry, nonproductive cough was observed in 6- to 8-week-old ferrets at a US distribution center of a commercial pet vendor (Video). Over a 4-year period, ≈8,000 ferrets, equal numbers of both sexes, were affected. Every 2–3 weeks, kits had been shipped in groups of 150–200 from a commercial breeding facility in Canada to the distribution center. At 5 weeks of age, before shipment to the distribution center, each kit received a single vaccination for distemper (DISTEM R-TC; Schering Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA).

Some ferrets exhibited hemoptysis, labored breathing, sneezing, and conjunctivitis. Almost 95% of the ferrets were affected, but almost none died. Symptomatic ferrets were selected from each shipment for testing; results of heartworm screening, PCR and serologic testing for distemper, and serologic testing for influenza virus were negative. Cytologic examination of bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples yielded few inflammatory cells. Thoracic ultrasonography found no abnormalities. Thoracic radiographs showed a mild bronchointerstitial pattern with peribronchial cuffing (Figure 1). Complete blood counts and chemistry results were within reference ranges.

### The role of airway smooth muscle in the pathogenesis of airway wall remodeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116Dzuxb]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Airway wall remodeling processes are present in the small airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consisting of tissue repair and epithelial metaplasia that contribute to airway wall thickening and airflow obstruction. With increasing disease severity, there is also increased mucous metaplasia and submucosal gland hypertrophy, peribronchial fibrosis, and an increase in airway smooth muscle mass. Apart from its contractile properties, airway smooth muscle produces inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and growth factors, which may contribute to the remodeling process and induce phenotypic changes of the muscle. Airflow limitation responds minimally to beta-agonists and corticosteroid therapy, unlike asthma, perhaps because of alterations in beta-receptor or glucocorticoid receptor numbers, alterations in receptor signaling, or the constrictive limitation imposed by peribronchial fibrosis. Better response is observed with the combination of inhaled long-acting beta-agonists and corticosteroids. This could result from effects at the level of airway smooth muscle. Airway wall remodeling may involve the release of growth factors from inflammatory or resident cells. The influence of smoking cessation or of current therapies on airway wall remodeling is unknown. Specific therapies for airway wall remodeling may be necessary, together with noninvasive methods of imaging small airway wall remodeling to assess responses.

Radiology

Serial radiologic imaging including chest CT for steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis was captured and tumor radiologic response was assessed by RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) V.1.1 (v. 4.03) guidelines. Infiltrate types of steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis were categorized as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), organizing pneumonia (OP), or non-specific by a board-certified thoracic radiologist (CTL), blinded to the clinical course of each patient. Radiologic DAD pattern of ICI-pneumonitis was defined as findings of ground glass opacities (GGOs) with or without intralobular lines ("crazy-paving"), traction bronchiectasis, and perilobular sparing; while the OP pattern was defined as lung parenchymal consolidation (occasionally with "reverse halo sign") with traction bronchiectasis, and perilobular sparing. Non-specific findings included those that did not clearly demonstrate DAD or OP; including extensive nodularity with associated GGOs (pneumonitis not otherwise specified)and bronchial wall thickening with centrilobular tree-in-bud nodularity and consolidation (pneumonitis not-otherwise-specified).

Level-of-care

The level-of-care received by each patient from the day of diagnosis of steroid-refractory ICI-pneumonitis was recorded and categorized as oncology floor/intermediate care, intensive care unit (ICU) without mechanical ventilation, or ICU with mechanical ventilation.

Case report

The proband was a male born at term with respiratory failure. Soon thereafter, he developed bilateral pneumothoraces and was noted to have suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left flow across a large patent ductus arteriosus. He was initially treated with inhaled nitric oxide and later transitioned to oral sildenafil. By age 3 months, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation when an echocardiogram showed right ventricular pressure less than half of systemic pressure. He was discharged home, self-ventilating on room air with no requirement for pulmonary hypertension medications.

At age 15 months the proband returned for follow-up and was noted to be intermittently tachypneic. Echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary hypertension, and sildenafil was reinitiated. A chest CT showed a paucity of lung markings and perihilar peribronchial wall thickening (Fig. 1A). Over the subsequent 2 years, his lung disease progressed, with a 4 L oxygen requirement and moderate pulmonary hypertension treated with tadalafil and bosentan. Spirometry was consistent with restrictive lung disease, with reduced FVC at 0.8 L (0.8 L; 66% predicted), FEV1 of 0.78 L (0.78 L; 71% predicted), and high FEV1/FVC ratio (0.97). Neither lung volumes nor diffusion capacity could be assessed due to his young age. Throughout this time his physical examination was notable for retractions with exercise, lung fields clear to auscultation, and widely spaced first and second toes that is typically observed in TBX4 -related ischiocoxopodopatellar syndrome with or without pulmonary arterial hypertension (Fig. 1B).

### Organizing pneumonia: the many morphological faces [^1156wC4g]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Organizing pneumonia is a non-specific response to various forms of lung injury and is the pathological hallmark of the distinct clinical entity termed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The typical imaging features of this syndrome have been widely documented and consist of patchy air-space consolidation, often subpleural, with or without ground-glass opacities. The purpose of this article is to highlight the less familiar imaging patterns of organizing pneumonia which include focal organizing pneumonia, a variety of nodular patterns, a bronchocentric distribution, band-like opacities, a perilobular pattern and a progressive fibrotic form of organizing pneumonia.

### Syrian hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) as an upper respiratory tract model for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^114B6BuC]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Lung lesions were evaluated as lesions of conductive airways and alveolar lesions. Lung changes were more pronounced in the ferrets than in the hamsters. Conductive airway lesions were characterized by vacuolation and loss of polarity of epithelial cells with varying degrees of a mainly mononuclear (lymphocytes, macrophages) and partly granulocytic infiltration. Single cell necrosis of epithelial cells was characterized by rounded hypereosinophilic epithelial cells with hyperchromatic and shrunken nuclei (Fig. 5A, B). Occasionally, there were eosinophils within the lamina propria and submucosa of affected airways. The peribronchial/perivascular infiltrate was mainly composed of mononuclear cells with low numbers of admixed granulocytes. Vascular endothelium was hypertrophic and pavementing of leukocytes was occasionally noted in both species. In the ferrets, mild (score 1) to moderate bronchitis and bronchiolitis (score 2) with moderate to marked (score 2 and 3) peribronchial/perivascular cuffing was detected in all animals. In one animal (animal #7), there was marked bronchiolitis (score 3) in one of the examined sections. In hamsters, conductive airway lesions were mainly defined by peribronchial/perivascular cuffing. Seven hamsters showed mild cuffing (score 1), whereas one animal each had a moderate (score 2) or marked cuffing (score 3). Bronchitis/bronchiolitis was detected in 5 animals (score 1: 3 animals; score 2: 2 animals). Alveolar lesions were characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of macrophages and occasional granulocytes (Fig. S3). Occasionally, alveolar septae were variably hypercellular due to infiltration of mainly histiocytes and less frequent granulocytes. Pneumocyte type II hyperplasia was characterized by a cobblestone-like lining of hypertrophic type II pneumocytes along the alveolar septae. Additionally, varying numbers of intra-alveolar multinucleated syncytial cells were detected in the ferret, but not in the hamster lung. In eight ferrets, less than 25% of alveolar tissue was affected while in the ninth ferret (animal #7), more than 50% of alveolar parenchyma showed lesions. Inflammatory severity scores ranged from 1 to 3 with animal #7 also having the highest severity score. In the hamsters, mild alveolar lesions were detected in eight hamsters, the ninth hamster did not show alveolar lesions. In all affected hamsters, lesions extended into less than 25% of lung tissue. Seven of the hamsters had a severity score of 1, while in one histopathological examination yielded in a severity score of 2. In all ferrets and two hamsters, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes was present. RSV antigen was detected within the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium of seven ferrets and two hamsters. The conductive airways of the remaining animals yielded negative results (Fig. 5C, D). Alveolar immunolabeling for RSV antigen was only detectable in ferret #7 which also showed the most severe total lung score (13/15, 86.67% of maximal total score). No hamster showed alveolar immunoreactivity for RSV antigen.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115CSMpq]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Histologic differential diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) across fibrotic HP vs usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF), connective tissue disease–interstitial lung disease (CTD‑ILD), hot tub lung, and airway‑centered interstitial lung diseases emphasizes that extensive peribronchiolar metaplasia with granulomas/giant cells — specifically an increased fraction of bronchioles > 50% and increased foci of peribronchiolar metaplasia per cm2 — favors fibrotic HP, whereas increased numbers of fibroblastic foci and increased thickness of subpleural fibrosis favor UIP/IPF; in CTD‑ILD, germinal centers, large lymphoid aggregates, or a high plasma cell to lymphocyte ratio favored CTD while extensive peribronchiolar metaplasia increased likelihood of HP; in hot tub lung, granulomas are more conspicuous than inflammatory infiltrates, mostly within airspaces and bronchiolar lumens, more well‑formed, and have only a moderate rim of chronic inflammatory cells, yet hot tub lung is regarded as HP due to similar clinical and CT features; airway‑centered entities (airway‑centered interstitial fibrosis, idiopathic bronchiolocentric interstitial pneumonia, peribronchiolar metaplasia) represent a spectrum in which multidisciplinary discussion may classify some as Compatible with Fibrotic HP and others as Indeterminate for Fibrotic HP.

### Interleukin-32: its role in asthma and potential as a therapeutic agent [^113Z74xw]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

IL-32 in animal asthma models

The anti-inflammatory property of IL-32 has been demonstrated in a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic asthma (Fig. 2). In this asthma model, in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the numbers of total inflammatory cells, recruited eosinophils, and lymphocytes were decreased; however, the numbers of macrophages/IL-10–producing CD11b + mononuclear cells were increased in IL-32γ transgenic (TG) mice compared to those in wild-type (WT) mice. There was no difference in BALF neutrophil counts between the two groups. The anti-inflammatory function of IL-32 was confirmed by the histological evaluation of lung tissues after hematoxylin and eosin staining, which showed that inflammatory cell infiltration around the vascular and bronchial areas was decreased in IL-32γ TG mice compared to that in WT mice. Moreover, the histopathologic score of the lung sections indicated a lower degree of peribronchial and perivascular inflammation in IL-32γ TG mice than in WT mice. Also, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including Th2 and Th1 cytokines, were reduced in IL-32γ TG asthma mice.

Similarly, rIL-32γ–treated asthmatic mice had decreased numbers of inflammatory cells (i.e. eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) in BALF. Histopathologic examination showed a remarkable suppression of peribronchial and perivascular inflammation in rIL-32γ–treated mice as well.

### Sirolimus alters lung pathology and viral load following influenza A virus infection [^111uCfyo]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Sirolimus altered the lung inflammation in IAV-infected mice

In order to determine the impact of sirolimus administration on the severity of pulmonary disease, we monitored lung histology following IAV infection. As expected, mice that received DMSO did not exhibit any peribronchial inflammation and pulmonary parenchymal architecture was preserved. In contrast, lung histology in mice received sirolimus alone showed focal interstitial thickening and inflammation on day 4, and mild peribronchial inflammation on day 10 (Fig. 3, arrows). On days 4, 10, and 25 post-infection, lung findings in mice infected with IAV showed various degrees of patchy peribronchial and perivascular inflammation with dense, diffuse parenchymal inflammation and formation of lymphoid nodules. IAV-infected mice treated with sirolimus also showed somewhat similar patchy peribronchiolar inflammation with increased peribronchial inflammation (patchy and interrupted, most prominent on day 10 post-infection), Fig. 3. Lung inflammation reached a disease score of 9.0 ± 4.5 in IAV-infected mice that were administered sirolimus, as compared to 11.5 ± 4.5 in mice that received IAV alone (p = 0.335), Table 1.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115FoLUQ]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute airway and bronchoscopic management of massive hemoptysis — Treatment of significant or massive hemoptysis requires securing and maintaining an adequate airway and optimal oxygenation. This usually necessitates endotracheal intubation, and a single-lumen cuffed endotracheal tube is generally more beneficial than a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Selective right or left mainstem intubation can be performed to protect the nonbleeding lung. Since blood clot formation obstructing the airways is the most common cause of respiratory insufficiency from massive hemoptysis, it is essential to place an endotracheal tube with a larger diameter so that bronchoscopic suctioning and removal of large obstructing clots can be accomplished quickly. Bronchoscopy is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in patients with massive hemoptysis. Bronchoscopic management begins with tamponade of the segment by tightly inserting the tip of the bronchoscope into the bronchus followed by bronchoscopic instillation of iced saline solution to constrict the blood vessels; this alone may stop the bleeding in many patients. If the bleeding is brisk, instillation of vasoactive agents like epinephrine is unlikely to help. Bronchial blockade balloons can be used to tamponade the bronchus, and it may be necessary to leave the balloons in place for 24 to 48 h to allow tamponade of hemoptysis. A study reported that bronchoscopy-guided topical hemostatic tamponade therapy using oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh immediately arrested hemoptysis in 56 of 57 patients (98%), and all patients thus treated remained free of hemoptysis for the first 48 h. If these measures are unsuccessful, consideration should be given to bronchial artery embolization to temporize the bleeding.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have become the mainstay of asthma control. They are also recommended as an add-on therapy to long-acting beta agonists and anticholinergics in moderate to severe COPD with recurrent exacerbations. Ultimately this clinical practice has led to the widespread use of ICSs, which are supported by a more favorable side effect profile than that of systemic steroids.

(E and F) Fibrotic ILA. Axial (E) and coronal (F) images show bilateral subpleural reticulations with traction bronchiolectasis.

The Fleischner Society definition of ILA required findings to be incidental and excluded high-risk populations. These features have been removed from the updated definition for multiple reasons. First, a definition of ILA that is independent of pretest probability is more practical for clinical use, particularly because radiologists frequently lack the necessary patient details to confirm whether these nonimaging criteria are met. Second, ILAs can still be present in high-risk populations, and incorporating these groups within the definition of ILAs allows the committee to provide guidance for evaluation and management of these patients. Finally, in the absence of compelling data to suggest otherwise, it is simpler to create a relatively broad definition of ILA with consistent evaluation and management algorithms that can be applied to most clinical scenarios.

### Clinical and radiological features of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs): a pictorial review [^1145Mkoj]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Radiological features

HRCT images usually demonstrate diffuse or predominantly lower bilateral abnormalities. They also show the presence of lymphatic nodes, normally seen in patients with LIP. LIP is most severe in the inflamed perilymphatic interstitium, so thickening of the bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa is usual. Uniform or patchy areas of bilateral ground-glass opacity are typical findings in LIP and they reflect the histological evidence of diffuse interstitial inflammation.

Other findings (about 80% of cases) are a few, perivascular, thin-walled cysts (Fig. 17). These cysts measure 1–30 mm and are seen within the lung parenchyma, predominantly in the mid-lung zones, adjacent to blood vessels (in UIP, cysts are usually subpleural and in lower lung areas). A partial "check-valve" bronchiolar obstruction has been considered as the main explanation for cyst formation because the bronchiolar obstruction due to the lymphatic infiltration leads to a consequent partial air trapping.

Fig. 17
Pattern of LIP. Small thin-walled cysts (white arrows) represent a typical imaging feature of LIP, usually not exceeding 30 mm and located in the mid-lung zones, adjacent to blood vessels. A partial "check-valve" bronchiolar obstruction has been considered the main explanation for cyst formation. The bronchiolar obstruction — due to lymphoid nodules and aggregates — leads to "air trapping"

The association of perivascular cysts and ground-glass opacities is highly suggestive of LIP.

Centrilobular and subpleural nodules (Fig. 18) with thickening of the interlobular septa are also typical and reflect the inflammatory infiltration of the peribronchiolar interstitium. Perivascular honeycombing in areas of previous airspace abnormality and reticular pattern (in about 50% of patients) can also be seen.

Fig. 18
Pattern of LIP (after corticosteroid treatment). Small reticular opacities and nodules (black arrows) are well depicted in the caudal area of the right upper lobe. Surgical biopsy revealed reactive lymphoid follicles along peribronchial regions and indicated a LIP diagnosis

Regarding the differential diagnosis, the HRCT pattern of LIP should be differentiated from hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis and lymphangitic spread of tumour. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia may be considered because of cystic abnormalities. A very important differential diagnosis is from Hodgkin's lymphoma.

### Catheter-based endobronchial electroporation is feasible for the focal treatment of peribronchial tumors [^112pkgia]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the feasibility of catheter-based endobronchial electroporation for the treatment of peribronchial tumors and assess the incidence of treatment-related adverse events.

Methods

Cytotoxicity of electroporation with or without cisplatin or gefitinib was assessed in vitro with lung cancer and normal cell lines. A novel catheter was designed for endobronchial electroporation, and computer simulations were used to predict in vivo treatment effects. Electroporation with the test catheter was performed (2000 V, 70 pulses) in the main bronchus of 8 pigs at 11 locations. Computed tomography imaging was performed before they were killed at 4 hours (6 animals) or 4 weeks (2 animals) posttreatment. Treated airway and surrounding parenchyma were compared with sham treatment via gross and histopathology.

Results

Significant cell death due to electroporation and increased cytotoxicity in combination with cisplatin or gefitinib were observed in cancer cells only (P < .05). Simulations predicted penetrative electroporation of peribronchial parenchyma without tissue heating. Electric pulse delivery in vivo induced transient venous and bronchial spasms that resolved without intervention. Cross-sectional measurement of electroporation effects on computed tomography (14.4 ± 1.4 by 10.5 ± 1.3 mm) and gross pathology (17.2 ± 3.0 by 8.8 ± 0.6 mm) were representative of values predicted by simulation (P < .001). Cell death due to irreversible electroporation was observed in bronchial and parenchymal tissue in acute tissue samples. Treated lung rapidly recovered from the effects of electroporation without change in bronchial patency at 4 weeks posttreatment.

Conclusions

Catheter-based endobronchial electroporation is a reproducible technique that can be used to treat peribronchial tumors in combination with cisplatin, without affecting patency of the treated bronchus.

### A protective role for periostin and TGF-β in IgE-mediated allergy and airway hyperresponsiveness [^112bFGYb]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Measures of epithelial mucin stores and peribronchial fibrosis increase similarly in periostin deficient mice and wild-type controls following airway challenge with A spergillus antigen

To determine if periostin affects epithelial mucin stores or peribronchial fibrosis, we quantified PAS staining in the epithelium and Sirius red staining of the peribronchial region. PAS staining showed that epithelial mucin stores increased significantly following Aspergillus antigen challenge in periostin deficient mice, but there was no difference in periostin deficient mice and wild-type controls (Figs 6 a and b). Sirius red staining showed that peribronchial fibrosis also increased significantly following Aspergillus antigen challenge in periostin deficient mice with no significant difference compared to wild-type controls (Figs 6 c and d).

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114xJEoo]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — pointers to presence of specific cough in children lists abnormalities with example etiologies and notes the list is not exhaustive. Daily wet/productive cough is linked to protracted bacterial bronchitis, suppurative lung disease, recurrent aspiration, atypical infections, TB, and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Wheeze — monophonic indicates large airway obstruction (for example, from foreign body aspiration, malacia and/or stenosis, vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal tumors) and TB should be considered in selected settings (for example, high prevalence or HIV). Wheeze — polyphonic is associated with asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiolitis. Hoarse voice/stridor suggests laryngeal cleft/problems and airway abnormalities. Recurrent pneumonia is associated with immunodeficiency, atypical infections, suppurative lung disease, congenital lung abnormalities, and trachea-esophageal H-type fistulas. Hypoxia/cyanosis is linked to any airway or parenchyma disease and cardiac disease. Neurodevelopmental abnormality is associated with aspiration lung disease. Chest radiograph (other than peribronchial changes) or spirometry abnormality can reflect any cardiopulmonary disease. Growth failure indicates any serious systemic including pulmonary illness such as cystic fibrosis.

### Is low dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy as effective for inflammation and remodeling in asthma? A randomized, parallel group study [^114PJ5fJ]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are the most effective medication for the prevention and treatment of asthmatic inflammation. Many dose-ranging studies have been conducted to examine the dose-response relationship of ICSs in the treatment of asthma in adults and children. The adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have been clearly shown to be dose-related in both adults and children in numerous studies. Although it has been suggested that most of the clinical benefits of ICSs occur at low doses, the results of dose-ranging studies are inconsistent. Some data show no dose-response for FEV1 or asthma symptoms, for airway hyperresponsiveness or exhaled nitric oxide, while other data show a significant dose-response for clinical outcomes.

### Human metapneumovirus in children with acute lower respiratory infections: effects on clinical and disease severity [^114y2rUo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary provincial children's hospital in Hebei, northern China. Admission records were reviewed for all pediatric patients hospitalized between April 2023 and March 2024 with a diagnosis of ALRI. Induced sputum or alveolar lavage fluid samples were collected as part of standard diagnostic care to test for respiratory pathogens, including HMPV.

Hebei Province has a population of approximately 74 million and is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate, with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The study hospital, located in the provincial capital, provides specialized inpatient and outpatient services exclusively for children under 18 years of age and serves as a major regional referral center for pediatric care across the province.

Data collection

Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical record system. These included age, sex, clinical symptoms (fever, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, pharyngitis, wheezing, respiratory distress), laboratory findings, chest radiographs, hospital length of stay, use of mechanical ventilation, presence of underlying conditions, and clinical outcomes. All data were de-identified and analyzed to explore the epidemiological and clinical features of HMPV-ALRIs.

Clinical investigations and diagnostic criteria

The initial diagnosis of ALRI was made by the attending physicians at admission, based on clinical presentation, including cough, fever, increased respiratory effort (e.g. tachypnea, wheezing, retractions), and abnormal chest auscultation findings. For the purposes of this study, all ALRI cases were subsequently reclassified based on clinical manifestations and chest radiographic findings: Specifically, pneumonia or bronchopneumonia was defined as the presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms with at least one focal patchy opacity or consolidated infiltration on chest radiograph, typically involving the perihilar or peribronchial areas. Bronchiolitis was defined as clinical symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in children ≤ 24 months of age, with either normal chest imaging or mildly increased peribronchial markings without focal consolidation.

A case is reported of broncholithiasis in a 29-year-old female factory worker presenting with cough and lithoptysis. Broncholithiasis is a rare disorder characterized by calcified perihilar and mediastinal lymph nodes eroding into the tracheobronchial tree. Although cough, hemoptysis, lithoptysis, pneumonia and bronchoesophageal fistula formation have been reported, broncholithiasis may also result in potentially life-threatening conditions such as airway obstruction from endobronchial polypoid granulation masses, and massive hemorrhage from an aorto-tracheal fistula or erosion of a pulmonary artery branch.

Drainage: perihilar stricture, benign and malignant — For asymptomatic patients with obstructive jaundice due to a malignant perihilar stricture who have declined or are not candidates for additional treatment, palliative drainage is not mandatory and should be decided on an individual case basis. There are no RCTs directly evaluating outcomes of asymptomatic patients undergoing biliary decompression in this setting, and drainage with either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) increases the risk of cholangitis and biliary sepsis, with patients likely to require repeat procedures for stent or drain exchange. We advise that the potential benefits and disadvantages be thoroughly discussed with patients and their caretakers, and based on available evidence, ERCP or PTBD is not mandatory in this context.

Diagnosis of PCP in children with HIV — physiology, imaging, and diagnostic criteria: Most children with PCP have substantial hypoxia with low arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2 typically < 70 mm Hg) and an A-a gradient > 30 mmHg; CD4 percentage is often < 15% and CD4 counts are usually < 200 cells/ mm3 in children aged 6 years and older; chest radiographs most commonly reveal bilateral diffuse parenchymal infiltrates with ground-glass or reticulogranular appearance, though they can be normal or show mild infiltrates, with earliest infiltrates perihilar progressing peripherally and, rarely, lobar, cavitary, nodular, or miliary lesions, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum observed; a definitive diagnosis of PCP requires demonstration of the organism in pulmonary tissues or fluids in the presence of pneumonitis, and diagnostic procedures are the same as for adults suspected of having PCP, although some procedures may be more difficult to perform in children.

2 Case Reports

The index patient (P1) came to medical attention at the age of 4 months with cough and fever.

He had received a BCG vaccination postnatally without local or systemic complications, but the positive tuberculin skin test result prompted a chest X‐ray examination, which revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates. The patient was treated for suspected infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Pneumocystis jirovecii, but none of these pathogens could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). Surfactant proteins were found present, but no information on BAL cytology is available. The treating physicians also noted to have ruled out primary or secondary immunodeficiency at the time.

A lung biopsy performed at the age of 10 months showed an accumulation of alveolar macrophages within the alveoli consistent with desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) (Figure 1A), cholesterol clefts and discrete pleural fibrosis. Notably, no granulocytic reaction was seen. The local pathologists evaluated another BAL at the age of 4 years and there was no evidence at that time of extracellular debris and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Repeated chest HRCT scans over 17 years revealed multiple clustered cystic lesions with variable size, predominant in lung apices, perihilar, subpleural, and peribronchial (Figure 1C–E). While peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and 12‐min walking tests were found normal during his first years of life, a restrictive airflow limitation was noted at the age of 10, which worsened during adolescence and early adulthood (Figure 1B). Pulmonary hypertension was excluded by echocardiography.

### Broad-spectrum chemokine inhibition ameliorates experimental obliterative bronchiolitis [^1123qZNp]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) affects over half of all long-term survivors after lung transplantation. Respiratory epithelial cell injury, peribronchial inflammation, and proliferation of fibrovascular connective tissue causing airway occlusion characterize this lesion. Several chemokines participate in experimental OB, and singular blockade is only partially effective. We hypothesized that a broad-spectrum chemokine inhibitor would be an effective intervention in preventing the progression of OB in an established heterotopic tracheal transplantation model.

Methods

Tracheas from Brown-Norway or Lewis rats were transplanted subcutaneously into Lewis recipients. Treated, allogeneic recipients received either a broad-spectrum chemokine inhibitor in its active (NR58.3.14.3) or inactive (NR58.3.14.4) form at a dose of 30 mg/kg daily. Luminal obstruction, epithelial loss, leukocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were assessed in explanted tracheal samples 14 days after transplantation.

Results

After 14 days, allografts receiving the inactive chemokine inhibitor demonstrated marked peribronchial inflammation, near complete loss of respiratory epithelium, and extensive intraluminal proliferation of fibrovascular connective tissue, with a mean 84% ± 5% reduction in airway lumen cross-sectional area. Isografts showed limited inflammation, with minimal loss of epithelium and luminal occlusion. Allogeneic recipients treated with the active chemokine inhibitor showed a significant preservation of respiratory epithelium, minimal peribronchial inflammation, and a marked decrease in the loss of airway cross-sectional area (23% ± 1%) (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

These findings further characterize the participation of chemokines in OB, and suggest that broad-spectrum chemokine inhibition may potentially be a useful therapeutic tool in slowing the progression of this disease.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114f9w1n]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) histopathology is characterized by a bronchiolocentric pattern of fibrosis with extensive subpleural fibrosis reminiscent of a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, with fibroblastic foci at the edge of dense fibrotic scars. Bronchioles may be surrounded by fibrosis with mild chronic inflammation, and scattered poorly formed granulomas can be present; low power bronchiolocentricity and subtle granulomas are key features in suspecting fibrotic HP. Biopsies can show patchy dense interstitial fibrosis with a bronchiolocentric distribution, including bands of fibrosis bridging between bronchioles and the pleura. Bronchiolar fibrosis may consist of widespread peribronchiolar metaplasia with bronchiolar remodeling due to fibrosis extending beyond bronchiolar lumens into the surrounding interstitium of alveolar walls, where thickened alveolar walls are lined by bronchiolar epithelium, and a poorly formed noncaseating granuloma may be present.

Mid and upper zone distribution

In fibrotic sarcoidosis and fHP, fibrosis is most commonly peribronchovascular and located in the mid and upper zones. In both conditions, other CT findings supporting the underlying aetiology are present; the 'three-density pattern' (coexistence of ground-glass opacities, decreased lung attenuation and normal lung) is highly specific for fHP and facilitates differential diagnosis with IPF, while perilymphatic nodules, conglomerate peribronchovascular masses and enlarged or calcified nodes support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis (Fig. 4).

Axial and sagittal CT images (a – c) showing peribronchovascular conglomerate masses in the upper lobes associated with parenchymal and airways distortion in the right upper lobe in a fibrotic sarcoidosis. Note the right upper lobe volume reduction and areas of mosaic attenuation in the mid-lower zones due to air trapping.

Note the association with centrilobular ground-glass nodules, partially confluent, and a mild 'three-density pattern' in the upper-mid zones

Reading modalities

CT image reading should be performed by qualified radiologists with an appropriate level of training and expertise.

Since FLD distribution (craniocaudal gradient, involvement of the dorsobasal region, peripheral or peribronchovascular) is of large diagnostic importance, reconstruction and analysis of sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructions is strongly recommended. Maximum intensity projections (MIP) are advantageous for classifying the distribution of nodular opacities (random, perilymphatic and centrolobular). In the field of FLDs, minimum intensity projections are particularly helpful in differentiating traction bronchiectasis from honeycombing and in diagnosing the extent and distribution of lobular air trapping (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistency in CT technique and image quality between serial CT scans is of paramount importance, and any variation should be accounted for.

### The diagnostic accuracy of chest radiographic features for pediatric intrathoracic tuberculosis [^114eS5CU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The chest radiograph (CR) remains a key tool in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB). In children with presumptive intrathoracic TB, we aimed to identify CR features that had high specificity for, and were strongly associated with, bacteriologically confirmed TB.

Methods

We analyzed CR data from children with presumptive intrathoracic TB prospectively enrolled in a cohort study in a high-TB burden setting and who were classified using standard clinical case definitions as "confirmed", "unconfirmed", or "unlikely" TB. We report the CR features and inter-reader agreement between expert readers who interpreted the CRs. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the CR features with at least moderate inter-reader agreement and analyzed the relationship between these CR
features and the classification of TB in a multivariable regression model.

Results

Of features with at least moderate inter-reader agreement, enlargement of perihilar and/or paratracheal lymph nodes, bronchial deviation/compression, cavities, expansile pneumonia, and pleural effusion had a specificity of > 90% for confirmed TB, compared with unlikely TB. Enlargement of perihilar (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.80–11.72) and/or paratracheal lymph nodes (aOR: 5.14; 95% CI, 2.25–12.58), bronchial deviation/compression (aOR: 6.22; 95% CI, 2.70–15.69), pleural effusion (aOR: 2.27; 95% CI, 1.04–4.78), and cavities (aOR: 7.45; 95% CI, 3.38–17.45) were associated with confirmed TB in the multivariate regression model, whereas alveolar opacification (aOR: 1.16; 95% CI, .76–1.77) and expansile pneumonia (aOR: 4.16; 95% CI, .93–22.34) were not.

Conclusions

In children investigated for intrathoracic TB enlargement of perihilar or paratracheal lymph nodes, bronchial compression/deviation, pleural effusion, or cavities on CR strongly support the diagnosis.

### Mimickers of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest CT: spectrum of CT and clinical features [^11483LFU]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Ground-glass (GGO) pattern with or without consolidation is the most common feature of COVID-19 infections. They are usually bilateral, multifocal and peripheral with posterior or lower lung zone distribution. Ground-glass opacification is defined as hazy increased lung opacity with preserved bronchovascular margins contrary to consolidation that is defined as a homogeneously increased parenchymal attenuation with obscuration of margins of airway and vessel walls. A different unifocal pattern of GGO was reported by Zhou, et al. in early phase of disease, commonly at the inferior lobe of right lung. Furthermore, Bernheim, et al. reported a significant number of cases having opacities of non-specific distribution and non-predominant perihilar pattern. GGO has also been frequently reported to have a "crazy paving" pattern that is defined as thickening of interlobular septa and intralobular lines with superimposed GGO. Vascular dilatation and traction bronchiectasis are typical findings found in the GGO detected in COVID-19 patients. Architectural distortion with the formation of subpleural bands was reported in some cases during a peak stage of the disease. Pulmonary embolism was found among patients with COVID-19 and was linked to elevated D-dimer. Other findings typically were seen in infection as thickening of bronchial wall, mucoid impactions and centrilobular nodules (tree-in-bud), and lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion are rarely observed. Figures 1, 2 and 3, and Additional file 1 demonstrate typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Evaluation of chest radiographs of children with newly diagnosed acute Lymphoblastic leukemia [^115apFyE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic yield of baseline chest radiographs (CXRs) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Study Design

We reviewed the CXR findings at diagnosis for 990 patients aged 1–18 years with ALL treated during the Total XV and XVI studies at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and evaluated the associations of these findings with clinical characteristics and initial management.

Results

Common findings were peribronchial/perihilar thickening (n = 187 [19.0%]), pulmonary opacity/infiltrate (n = 159 [16.1%]), pleural effusion/thickening (n = 109 [11.1%]), mediastinal mass (n = 107 [10.9%]), and cardiomegaly (n = 68 [6.9%]). Portable CXRs provided results comparable with those obtained with 2-view films. Forty of 107 patients with a mediastinal mass (37.4%) had tracheal deviation/compression. Mediastinal mass, pleural effusion/thickening, and tracheal deviation/compression were more often associated with T-cell ALL than with B-cell ALL (P < .001 for all). Pulmonary opacity/infiltrate was associated with younger age (P = 0.003) and was more common in T-cell ALL than in B-cell ALL (P = 0.001). Peribronchial/perihilar thickening was associated with younger age (P < .001) and with positive central nervous system disease (P = 0.012). Patients with cardiomegaly were younger (P = 0.031), more often black than white (P = 0.007), and more often categorized as low risk than standard/high risk (P = 0.017). Patients with a mediastinal mass, pleural effusion/thickening, tracheal deviation/compression, or pulmonary opacity/infiltrate were more likely to receive less invasive sedation and more intensive care unit admissions and respiratory support (P ≤ .001 for all). Cardiomegaly was associated with intensive care unit admission (P = 0.008). No patients died of cardiorespiratory events during the initial 7 days of management.

Conclusions

The CXR can detect various intrathoracic lesions and is helpful in planning initial management.

### Radiography, tomosynthesis, CT and MRI in the evaluation of pulmonary cystic fibrosis: an untangling review of the multitude of scoring systems [^1142AQoE]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The evolution of radiological scoring systems for pulmonary cystic fibrosis reflects a desire to translate the pathological findings in the images into numbers, in a reproducible and objective way. Clinicians are of course interested in the general disease progression, but also in the progression of a separate component, such as mucus plugging, atelectasis or consolidation since treatment then can be focused on a specific pathology with a specific therapy. Chest radiography is the most widely used imaging modality to track the progression of cystic fibrosis lung disease, since it is easy to perform and the radiation dose and cost are low. Scoring systems for tomosynthesis, CT and MRI are still mainly used for research purposes. The different modalities obviously have different abilities to detect cystic fibrosis changes, but when deciding which modality to choose in the follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis other aspects are of course also important, such as radiation dose, cost and the possibility to perform the examination on young children without anaesthesia (Fig. 1, Table 1).

Figures from studies using different radiological scoring systems are difficult to compare, due to the different scoring components and scoring areas used by the scoring systems, and also from divergences in weighting and terminology. For example, "bronchial wall thickening" may also be called "bronchial line shadows", "linear markings" or "peribronchial thickening". Chest CT and tomosynthesis obviously have a greater ability to detect early abnormalities that may have similar appearances on radiography, there reflected in radiographic scoring terms such as "nodular cystic lesions", whereas CT and tomosynthesis scoring systems may differentiate these lesions into "mucus plugging" and "bronchiectasis". MRI, on the other hand, is more sensitive to mucus plugging compared with CT, but cannot evaluate air trapping or differentiate between bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis (Table 1).

### Doubts and concerns about COVID-19 uncertainties on imaging data, clinical score, and outcomes [^114dH7ax]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In order to answer such questions, this study included the first chest CT examination carried out by each patient during the hospitalization independently of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms or positive NAAT result and chest CT examination to allow the correlation of CT scores with different stages and disease progression. This way, patients with severe clinical conditions were also included allowing to investigate CT abnormalities linked with disease severity. CT images were assessed for scan quality considering motion artifacts and inspiratory level. The 7 parameters we adopted to investigate and assess each CT examination, are below reported:

A) - CO-RADS scores based on COVID-19 lung involvement ranged from 1 to 5, with higher values reflecting an increase in likelihood of patients having confirmed COVID-19 with lung involvement, whereas lower values were attributed to CT examinations either normal or showing abnormalities less likely linked to COVID-19 infection in which an alternative diagnosis was more probable. CO-RADS is a useful tool used to diagnose COVID-19, especially when NAATs are not readily available. The 5-score CO-RADS scale (Table 1) is summarized as follows: 1: very low level of suspicion; 2: low level of suspicion; 3: equivocal findings; 4: high level of suspicion; 5: very high level of suspicion.
B) - Chest CT score for single lobe involvement. 0: 0%; 1: < 5%; 2: 5–25%; 3: 26–50%; 4: 51–75%; 5: > 75%.
C) - Dominant pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacity, multifocal, crazy-paving, or reverse halo), defined by the Fleischner Society (Additional file 1, section b).
D) - Dominant distribution (lower lobes, peripheral, bronchocentric, dorsal, apical, or diffuse).
E) - Additional COVID-19 related findings (vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, air bubble sign, halo sign, subpleural sign, perilobular pattern, and subpleural sparing).
F) - Additional findings not typical for COVID-19 (pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, discrete small nodules, tree-in-bud, cavitation, isolated lobar/segmental consolidation, smooth interlobular septal thickening, atelectasis, and lymphadenopathy).
G) - Comorbidities at CT (cardiomegaly, aortic/coronaric calcifications, pre-existing pulmonary disease, steatosis, and tracheomalacia).

Radiographic manifestations in lymphotracheobronchial tuberculosis are nonspecific, and a normal chest radiograph does not rule out airway involvement. Involvement of the central airways can be easily missed on radiographs. Persistent segmental or lobar collapse, lobar hyperinflation and obstructive pneumonia are seen as complications of the airway compression.

Enhancement and enlargement (usually > 2 cm) of adjacent mediastinal lymph nodes are common findings at CT in the active stage of stenosis. The enlarged lymph nodes are commonly identified in the subcarinal, paratracheal and perihilar (infrahilar) regions closely abutting or compressing the airways.

The most commonly involved airway is the bronchus intermedius, followed by the left main bronchus and trachea. Bronchial narrowing can be smooth or irregular, with mural thickening. Smooth bronchial narrowing is caused by compression by an adjacent node, and the irregular narrowing correlates with significant mucosal irregularity, caseation, granuloma formation or even perforation.

The obstructive infiltrates can be resorbed or calcify, fibrose with traction bronchiectasis (Fig. 13) or cause lung destruction. There is often excessive inflammation, which can result in dense alveolar consolidation and eventual parenchymal breakdown. Cicatricial bronchostenosis can manifest as concentric narrowing, uniform wall thickening, and involvement of a long bronchial segment after healing.

### Effects of short-term treatment with atorvastatin in smokers with asthma – a randomized controlled trial [^117X1EKp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Smokers with asthma have poor symptom control, accelerated decline in lung function and an attenuated response to inhaled corticosteroids compared to non-smokers with asthma. Optimum medical therapy for smokers with asthma has not been established. There is an unmet need for alternative or additional drugs for smokers with asthma who are unable to stop smoking.

In addition to reducing cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluteryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, statins have pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, including experimental models of allergic lung inflammation, have shown that statins reduce components of airway inflammation potentially relevant to the pathogenesis of asthma. Despite preliminary data showing an absence of clinical benefit with short-term statin therapy on asthma symptoms or lung function in non-smokers with asthma, there is indirect evidence to suggest that statins may show efficacy in patients with asthma who smoke. First, simvastatin inhibits lung parenchymal destruction, peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate and leads to a reduction in levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in a rat model of smoking related lung disease and reduces airway inflammation and reverses elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in mice. Second, statins enhance corticosteroid sensitivity in asthma, possibly by restoring histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, which is reduced by cigarette smoking. Thirdly, retrospective or case cohort studies have shown statin use is associated with a reduced decline in lung function in cigarette smokers and reduced exacerbation rates, hospital admission and mortality in patients with COPD. Taken together, this evidence suggests that statin treatment may improve asthma control in smokers with asthma. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that short term treatment with atorvastatin, either alone or in addition to low dose inhaled corticosteroid improves lung function or other indices of asthma control and/or airway inflammation in smokers with asthma. Atorvastatin was chosen because of its favourable in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties and evidence of clinical benefit at the dose of 40 mg daily in rheumatoid arthritis.

Organizing pneumonia

The hallmark histopathologic finding of OP is polypoid fibroinflammatory tissue filling distal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and peribronchiolar alveoli with intact alveolar septa involved by mild interstitial inflammation (Fig. 5).

OP usually appears on CT as peribronchovascular and/or peripheral areas of consolidation with or without ground-glass opacity. The consolidation seen at imaging corresponds to dense plugging of small airways and alveolar spaces with fibroinflammatory tissue combined with alveolar septal thickening. The ground-glass opacity corresponds to alveolar septal thickening, intraluminal cellular debris, and lesser amounts of intraluminal fibroinflammatory tissue. Additional CT findings include perilobular opacities seen as subpleural predominant ill-defined curvilinear or polygonal opacities surrounded by aerated lung, and the "reversed halo"/"atoll" sign in which crescentic or ring-shaped consolidation surrounds areas of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 6). Single or multiple ill-defined nodular opacities can also be seen in the setting of OP, often in a peribronchial/peribronchiolar distribution with internal air bronchograms, but other findings of OP are usually also present. Over time, CT findings of OP can completely resolve, although findings of fibrosis including reticulation, ground-glass opacity (reflecting fine fibrosis), parenchymal bands, architectural distortion, and/or traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis, sometimes in an NSIP pattern, may remain at follow-up.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study showed that LAS obtained in TBLC have a high frequency of unideal specimens that do not include the bronchiole or perilobular area. Since the histological diagnostic yield tends to be higher in cases that do not contain LAS, it may be important to determine the biopsy site that reduces the frequency of LAS collection by referring to the HRCT findings in TBLC.

### ASO author reflections: palliative therapy might be an alternative when the risks of surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma are high [^112VyYAB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Future

A randomized trial comparing palliative treatment with resection in patients with high-risk perihilar cholangiocarcinoma has not been performed and would be challenging. The present study shows that the benefit of surgery should be carefully weighted against the substantial risks of surgery in these patients. Major liver resection is often required and survival can be limited and even similar to palliative treatment without surgery. Surgery however can still offer long-term survival in a small proportion of patients. Surgery remains the standard for resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. When the anticipated risk of positive margins is high and the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality is considerable, palliative systemic therapy should be considered.

Despite the therapeutic advances and improvements in ventilation complications of therapy arise, particularly in the very premature infants.

A patent ductus arteriosus is common in premature infants and is thought to contribute to the lung disease.

Positive pressure ventilation in these premature infants is the most common cause of complications such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pnuemopericardium, and pulmonary interstitial emphysema. These air leaks are less common since the more routine use of artificial surfactant and high frequency ventilation.

Focal atelectasis, due to tube malposition of the endotracheal tube, poor clearance of secretions or mucous plugging is also a common complication of surfactant deficiency.

Pulmonary haemorrhage may also develop in infants with hyaline membrane disease secondary to severe hypoxia and capillary damage.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or chronic lung disease, described by Northway in 1967, is a long-term consequence of neonatal lung disease. It occurs most commonly after treatment for hyaline membrane disease with mechanical ventilation but may occur following any lung condition which leads to prolonged oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. The incidence of BPD has not changed significantly despite the many advances in ventilatory support and the introduction of artificial surfactant. This is largely due to the survival nowadays of very low birth weight premature infants. However, its severity has decreased, particularly in infants greater than 28 weeks gestation.

During fetal life the lungs are expanded with fluid, an ultrafiltrate of fetal serum which contributes to amniotic fluid volume. During and after birth the fluid is removed by the pulmonary lymphatics and capillaries. When there is slow or incomplete removal of the lung fluid the infant may suffer from transient tachypnoea of the newborn and the condition most commonly occurs in term infants. The incidence is increased in infants delivered by caesarian section. It is postulated that the absence of squeezing of the thorax during passage through the vaginal canal results in retention of lung fluid. The condition is also reported in infants with hypoproteinaemia, hyponatraemia, maternal fluid overload, small hypotonic or sedated infants and infants who have experienced a precipitous delivery. The most common radiographic appearance is mild overaeration of the lungs, perihilar interstitial shadowing, prominent blood vessels and the presence of fluid in the horizontal fissure. Occasionally there is a small pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly.

### Usual interstitial pneumonia-pattern fibrosis in surgical lung biopsies. clinical, radiological and histopathological clues to aetiology [^115AcGsE]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Distinguishing histopathological features

Occasional cases of CHrHP will show advanced fibrosis that is indistinguishable from that seen in UIP of IPF. However, there are several histopathological clues to help suggest CHrHP as the aetiology. Because chronic HP is a result of repeated inhalational exposure, the primary site of injury is the airways. It makes aetiologic sense that most cases of CHrHP will show a centrilobular dominant pattern of fibrosis(figure 7 A), as opposed to the subpleural and periseptal fibrosis of UIP of IPF (where centrilobular sparing is the norm). Centrilobular fibrosis is characterised by peribronchiolar fibrosis with bronchiolar distortion and occlusion by scarring and smooth muscle hyperplasia. Respiratory bronchioles are frequently involved. Bridging fibrosis is frequently identified in HP. It is represented as linear fibrotic connection between centrilobular and perilobular areas (subpleural or/and paraseptal) or between centrilobular and adjacent centrilobular area. Similarly, the fibroblast foci of CHrHP are typically present at the edge of the fibrosis in peribronchiolar areas. Again, like most inhalational disease, ChrHP affects the upper lobes early in the course of disease. Surgical biopsy from more than one lobe is essential to distinguish UIP of IPF from UIP- pattern in CHrHP.PBM is a very common finding in CHrHP (figure 7 B), and if it is seen diffusely throughout the biopsy, a careful search for other histopatholological support for CHrHP is warranted. The 'smoking gun' of CHrHP is the poorly formed interstitial granuloma, or rare aggregate of interstitial giant cells (figure 7 C, D). Unfortunately, the frequency of this finding seems to decrease with increasing fibrosis. Other findings in CHrHP that help to differentiate it from UIP of IPF are the presence of inflammatory bronchiolitis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration.

Characteristics of advanced fibrosis in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis include centrilobular fibrosis with relative sparing of the septum and pleura (A, 20×, H&E), centrilobular interstitial inflammation with extensive peribronchiolar metaplasia (arrow heads) (B and D, 40×, H&E), and rare interstitial giant cells/histiocyte aggregates of poorly formed granulomas (arrows) (C and D, 200×, H&E).

3.1 Continuation of clinical history

Subsequently the patient underwent an 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography‐computed tomography (18F‐FDG PET‐CT) of the whole body, which showed a hypermetabolic perihilar mass lesion in the left lung infiltrating the mediastinum, encasing and severely narrowing the left pulmonary artery, suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma. Enlarged hypermetabolic left supraclavicular, mediastinal, and left hilar lymph node metastasis were also noted, indicative of a metastatic disease process.

### Pediatric pulmonology 2024 year in review: rare and diffuse lung disease [^115Xd6L2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

NEHI is a form of chILD, characterized by tachypnea, hypoxemia, crackles, and failure to thrive. Distinct chest CT findings associated with NEHI include air trapping and ground glass opacities (GGOs), predominantly in the right middle lobe, lingula, and/or perihilar regions. Miraftabi et al. provided a critical examination of the histopathologic characteristics of NEHI, noting that the original histopathologic criteria may not apply uniformly to all patients with this condition. This study detailed the GGO ratios in children with NEHI, consisting of 11 patients with biopsy‐confirmed NEHI and another 11 with a clinical history suggestive of NEHI but with biopsy results inconsistent with the diagnosis. Interestingly, the maximum GGO ratio calculated in this cohort did not correlate with the percentage of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) observed in the biopsies, despite being from anatomically similar regions. This finding is consistent with prior studies that areas of GGO do not necessarily correspond with increased PNECs. Furthermore, one patient presented with clinical characteristics typical of NEHI, alongside consistent biopsy findings, yet lacked imaging results indicative of the condition. This raised concerns about the possibility of an alternative disease process involving increased PNECs rather than NEHI. It is worth considering that the identified areas of GGOs may represent normal lung tissue on expiratory scans, while the areas exhibiting air trapping may be the true pathological findings, and therefore biopsies of the GGOs would not be expected to have increased PNECs. This manuscript underscores the significant gaps in our understanding of NEHI in children. In a separate commentary, Griese et al. reviewed the developmental conditions manifesting in infancy, which encompass persistent tachypnea of infancy (PTI), pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), and NEHI. The authors emphasized the importance of recognizing the developmental nature of these disorders and argue for the use of PTI as the preferred label over NEHI, citing the rarity of lung biopsies and the lack of a definitive causal relationship between PNECs and PTI. The commentary encouraged pediatricians to avoid superficial diagnoses and instead to search for associated and underlying conditions with the help of clinical expertize and genetic testing. To expand upon our current diagnostic capabilities, Marczak et al. investigated the utility of various serum biomarkers in diagnosing NEHI in children compared with healthy controls. They observed that children with NEHI had elevated serum levels of KL‐6 compared to healthy controls, although these levels were relatively low. Elevated levels of KL‐6 have been associated with various forms of chILD. While biomarkers like KL‐6 hold diagnostic potential, their precision remains uncertain.
